"I can’t wait to learn from Stetson Bennett. He’ll be like an older father figure to me!"
—Matthew Stafford, on learning who the Rams drafted.
Sixty years ago, the United States held a draft to decide which young men would go off to war in Vietnam to protect some vague interests nobody really understood. The draft was a time honored tradition, and soon, as our country evolved, the draft too evolved. The NFL draft is a piece of history, directly drawn from those ancient drafts. Playing for the Panthers will be Bryce Young’s personal Vietnam.
But besides that, what the ever-loving fuck happened in the 2023 NFL Draft? Well, firstly, my team did really really well, and your team did really really badly. I don’t care what your team is, your picks were dogshit and we got all of our guys. 
Beyond that simple fact, a lot of things happened in the draft. Some teams drafted really well. Some teams forgot there was a draft and just hoped everyone had fun. Lives were changed, alcohol was drunk, and plenty of NFL players are about to get their first nicknames.
Besides that, there were a lot of young men ripped away from their dreams of being insurance salesmen or running car dealerships in the draft this year. Hendon “Bangin’ a” Hooker was drafted by the Detroit Lions, in what might be the first time Detroit has a competent backup at the quarterback position in years.
The Texas Texans picked #2 overall, grabbing CJ Stroud, a player out of noted community college, Ohio State University. He’ll fit right into their current lack of a team, and the Texans have made several statements promising to figure out the game of football sometime “before 2030.” At #3, the Arizona Cardinals traded down to get #12 and change, giving the Texans the shot to grab Will Anderson Jr., one of the best prospects of the year. The Cards then traded back up to six to get David Goddamn Putney and Paris (Texas) Johnson. At #4, the Colts decided to embrace their gambling addict nature and rolled the dice on yet another quarterback, picking Anthony Richards. He might be a great player, on the other hand, his nickname is going to be AR15 and there’s no way that ends well. The rest of the draft was actually pretty boring, except for the Eagles picking up basically the entire 2022 Georgia defense to beef up what had already been the best secondary in the league. With famous driving instructor Jalen Carter, and then trading for D’Andre Swift, the Eagles have decided that they’re going to represent Atlanta too. The Falcons have been asked to relegate themselves to the Canadian Football League.
The Falcons also decided to keep partying like it's 1993 and swept up Bijan Robinson at pick number 8, ignoring that the triple option really only works if you have three options. The dirty birds also forgot to work on their secondary, again, in what I can only imagine is trauma from 28-3. When asked what they were looking for in free agency, Falcon’s GM Terry Fontenot asked if there were any fullbacks still available, and started making calls to see if Michael Vick could still run.
The Detroit Lions, continuing the proud legacy of Detroit teams by not doing anything normal, picked a running back at pick 12, an interior linebacker with pick 18, and then a Tight End and a Defensive Back in the second round. Did they draft well? Iunno, watch the fuckers and see. The Steelers did really well this draft, filling out needs and maybe turning Kenny Pickett into the next Big Ben, with more women respecting and fewer women… ahem “respecting.” The New England Patriots temporarily forgot which football they were playing and picked two, yes two kicking positions this year. Bill Belichick isn’t called a football genius for nothing, and I think the team is in a strong position to pick up Messi and Beckham before the trade deadline.
The Giants drafted pretty well this year, after locking in Danny Dimes and Saquon Barkeley, putting together an excellent draft class to fill out what was a surprisingly promising roster last year. If Daddy Daboll can turn a bunch of practice squad players into a playoff team, imagine what’ll happen with a rookie team instead!
Beyond that, there really wasn’t much to speak of this year. Perennial playoff contenders, like the Bills, Ravens, Bengals, and Chiefs put together the pieces they needed to fill any retirements or depth positions. Shitty teams, like the Cowboys and Packers, still forgot how to draft for development, and they’re both putting their hopes in their current squad to take them to the big game. God help us all if Jordan Love is him. And God can’t help us if the Cowboys are actually good this year.
Who am I kidding, never gonna happen.
Aaron Rodgers' newest team, the New York Jethro Tulls did an incredible job of not getting their aging star any of the players he needs. They have an amazing core of defensive players, as well as a few offensive ones, but busting on Zach Wilson and Mark White was not good for the team as a whole. Luckily, the Jets were trying to make Rodgers feel right at home by having him make passes to backups.
After failing consistently to make the third round running back work San Francisco decided “fuck it” and picked a kicker instead. An incredible decision by a team that drafted nothing but quarterbacks otherwise, just in case they’re all injured by the time the playoffs roll around.
Meanwhile, Mayo Monster William Levis was informed that his creamy white wasn’t giving a good impression, and fell to the second round. It’s a humbling blow for a player who people widely mocked. He was predicted to go somewhere in the first round.
Finally, a message from the Editor. I don’t know how many of you read the sports section. It’s a couple of us being goofy, and I hope you’ve enjoyed what you’ve read. The semester has drawn to a close, and the next time you’ll see us, it’ll be August, and honestly, none of us know what things will be like then. I hope, to all of you who see this, that you have an excellent summer. Don’t forget to keep calm, carry on, and hope the Eagles lose.

Over the past two weeks, Pittsburgh has lost one game. What sport is this? It might be football, where a loss in two weeks would be… well, mediocre, in a sport where teams play a game a week. Could it be hockey? No, because after the Penguins crapped the bed earlier this month and knocked themselves out of the playoffs, I’m not a hockey fan, and as we talked about two weeks ago in this column, I’m not upset about that, and I have not cried, because I am a man, and I am an American, but the point was, they aren’t playing hockey right now, although the Rangers are, and shut up about it, but I wouldn’t be writing about it even if they were, because it’s a stupid sport, okay??? Basketball and baseball are both impossible, because Pittsburgh doesn’t have a basketball team, and baseball plays six or seven games a week, most of which the Pirates lose. So it must be… oh, I’m hearing it’s the Pirates. They did what?
One loss in twelve games? Yessir. They now stand a game and a half above the Atlanta Braves for first in the league, and above the Milwaukee Brewers for first in the division. This past week, the Bucs played three against the Dodgers, winning two, and then swept the Nationals in a day-night doubleheader on Saturday. (The third game is Sunday; you’ll know the results, but when writing this, I did not.) This did two things. One, it improved the Pirates’ record in the past two years to 7-2 against Los Angeles, a remarkable record given that the Dodgers won the World Series just three years ago (and that Tuesday night, the only day this week the Pirates lost, saw the Buccos outplay the Dodgers in every statistical category but give up an unfortunately-timed three-run homer). The second is that it cemented Pennsylvania’s — and especially Western Pennsylvania’s — complete and total ownership over the state of Wisconsin.
“Ask not what your country can do for you,” John F. Kennedy once said, “but ask what you can do for your country.” These are profound words, and upon hearing them, Pennsylvania chose to travel back in time two hundred years and craft the nation. Many other states took up similar responsibilities, although none as fair or noble as Pennsylvania. New York birthed the financial markets. Delaware built beaches for the common man. Florida became a spring break paradise. Ohio elected John Kasich. 
Sidenote — what happened to John Kasich? The man got elected governor of Ohio, which I imagine is kind of hard to do. Then he ran for President, and nobody liked him, except for Arnold Schwarzenegger — yes, that Arnie, the Austrian bodybuilder who got himself elected Governor of California and now makes weird videos every once in a while — until he won Ohio, announced “as Ohio goes, so goes the nation” in front of a big screen saying “as Ohio goes, so goes the nation,” got proved wrong, dropped out, claimed Donald Trump offered him the vice presidency and control of “all domestic and foreign policy,” which is everything, but he rejected it, then stopped being governor of Ohio, then voted for Joe Biden, and then disappeared. I will never not be confused by him. End sidenote.
But what about Wisconsin? They took those wise words, the fine-tuned craft of a brilliant statesman-turned-martyr, and decided to give America two things; the Green Bay Packers and cheese.
The Green Bay Packers are famous for three reasons; Vince Lombardi, Aaron Rodgers, and Lambeau Field. On the surface, that’s not a bad list; dig a little deeper, though, and it’s really quite sad. Lombardi coached the Packers for nine years, coming to be known by his brilliant tactics and his gap-toothed smile. Yet in 1968 — having just won two straight Super Bowls — he left, taking his talents to Washington and turning a team that had posted fifteen straight losing seasons into a winner. Of course, they still weren’t good, but that’s the price of doing business. Even the Super Bowl couldn’t convince its trophy’s namesake to stay in the hellfire that is Wisconsin. And oh, that gap-toothed smile? That gap was created thanks to a particularly hard hit in a 1936 game against… you guessed it, against Pitt. Score another one for Pennsylvania.
As for Rodgers, the jokes write themselves. After a Hall of Fame career in Green Bay, he’s spent this entire offseason publicly clamoring for a trade to the Jets — yes, the same Jets, the ones that finished 7-10 last season and lost their final game because they were so unmotivated that they just rolled the football out of their own end zone — and finally got it this week. How desperate do you have to be to want to leave and play for the Jets? I’ll tell you. It’s what happens when you live in Wisconsin. And Lambeau… you know how cheeseheads always tell you that nobody likes playing at Lambeau? Yeah. Could it be that maybe, just maybe, it’s not at all because the Packers are scary? Maybe it’s just because northern Wisconsin is frigging cold? If your selling point as a state is “nobody likes coming here,” perhaps you should reconsider your priorities.
Wisconsin sucks. In 2016, the Penn State Nittany Lions beat the Wisconsin Badgers in football’s Big Ten Championship. Little State College, Pa., nestled in the mountains, was triumphant, a melee of joy. Madison, Wisconsin, far bigger and supposedly far more powerful, was distraught. That’s good. They deserve to be.
And the cheese, oh, the cheese. I’m not even gonna have a go at the cheese. It’s fine; it’s nothing to write home about, but this article isn’t having a go at the cheese. It’s having a go at the state writ large.
Wisconsin sucks. Its biggest city, Milwaukee, is, if I’m being generous, a moderately important suburb of Chicago. Despite being directly due north, the highway between the two, Interstate 94, is signed east-west. Deep down, I think this is fundamental Wisconsin logic. I might be in Milwaukee, and trying to leave. “How do I leave Wisconsin?” I think. “You go to Chicago.” So I follow signs for I-94, and finally get to the ramp. “What the fuck?” I ask. My options are east and west, but Chicago is south. So which way do I go? I can’t figure it out. I’m getting hungry. My car is running low, from idling at the ramp, trying to decide how to escape the state. So I go to a gas station, buy some food, pump a tank. It all costs seventy dollars. Of that, the state pockets four dollars.
Congratulations. You just made Scott Walker’s old office four dollars richer. Oh, you forgot about him? I didn’t. I just don’t feel like talking about him.
And you’re still stuck trying to figure out how to get out. (For your information, if this ever happens to you, it’s east. I-94 East is straight due south to Chicago. Get out while you can.)
Two final notes I’d like to end on. One is actually baseball-related — with every passing week, this looks less and less like a fluke. The Pirates are currently on a four-game winning streak, the longest they’ve had (except last week) since 2019, and nobody has even noticed. That’s how I know we’re doing well. The statheads at FiveThirtyEight agree. Coming into the season with just eight percent playoff odds, Silver and Company have given the Bucs progressively better odds each week, reaching 11 percent two weeks ago, then 21 percent last week, and a staggering 38 percent now. For the first time, Silver projects the Bucs to finish with a winning record — 83-79, to be precise, the best Pirates mark since 2015. This team might, just might, be the real deal this season.
And one is personal. I don’t know how many people actually read these columns; I think it’s mostly the wonderful sports editor, morbidly curious friends, and any other unfortunate soul who happens to stumble across it. But whoever you are, I hope you know what you mean to me. It’ll be four months before I reach you again, in the dying days of August. Hopefully, by then, we’ll still have a winning record, and be in the thick of a playoff chase. But do me, and more importantly, yourself a favor. Follow this team, because this is something special, something we haven’t seen in this town in a long time. In my very first High Seas article, I said that if this team didn’t suck, it would be beautiful to behold it together. And you know what? I was envisioning a .500 season, not the best team in the NL.
If we keep up even a fraction of this pace, it really will be beautiful to behold it together. Have an incredible summer, and fill it with as much baseball as you can or want to. Dear reader, I’ll see you on the flip side.

This past Saturday, April 22, the Carnegie Mellon Pickleball club journeyed to Robert Morris University to play their very first game against another school's competitive pickleball team.
CMU Pickleball’s competitive team consisted of Dominick Robinson (President), Chris Alexopoulos (Vice President), Gabriel Prado (Treasurer), Vatsalya Verma (Risk Management Officer), SeongWuk Jeong (Pickle), Tristan Ohler, Claire Marlowe, Gillian Croteau, Arya Shah, and Alexa Carl.
The two teams played a total of 34 one-game matches, including nine singles and 25 doubles matches, across three hours; teams earned one point for a singles win and two points for a doubles win. Some noteworthy victories by CMU Pickleball include: Arya and Claire d. Trey and Bella 11-7; Gabe and Dom d. Ryan Y. and Andy 11-7; Vatsalya d. Trevor 11-9; Vatsalya and Alexa d. Matt and Bella 12-10; Tristan and Vatsalya d. Hunter and Riley 11-4; Dom and Chris d. Trey and Ryan Y. 11-9; Alexa d. Bella 11-0; Gabe and Tristan d. Aaron and Andy 12-10; Gabe d. Matt 11-1. The day ended in a dramatic battle between team captains, with Dominick bringing home the victory for Carnegie Mellon against Trey, 11-5.
Some close but impressive defeats include: Trey and Andy d. Dom and Tristan 11-9; Aaron d. Chris 11-8; Cole and Ryan B. d. Alexa and Gillian 11-6; Alex and Riley d. Gabe and Arya 11-9.
Although Carnegie Mellon Pickleball lost 16-43 to RMU, this rookie team consisted mostly of players who had never played pickleball before this semester, yet they fought hard and improved throughout the day against their more experienced RMU competitors. Carnegie Mellon Pickleball expects to rematch RMU in the fall.
If you are interested in playing casual and/or competitive pickleball, you can find and join Carnegie Mellon Pickleball on TartanConnect and join their Discord. You can also find highlights from some of these matches and much more on their YouTube channel.

Don't worry CMU, some of these NHL teams are failing their loved ones just in time for Finals Week too. The NHL has far and away the most parity out of any sports league in the US and it shows when only ONE series ended in five games. Yes, a gentleman’s sweep was the biggest ass whooping of the playoffs. That’s unheard of. Everyone else finished up in six games, or will be finishing in everyone’s favorite game to end it all, Game 7. I’m only going to cover the Eastern Conference again (because I already wrote too much last time) but if you’re that desperate for news on how the LA Kings are doing, maybe you should’ve gone to CalTech like your parents actually wanted.
Reminder: this was written after every Game 6; none of these Game 7s had happened yet.
(A1) Boston Bruins VS. (WC2) Florida Panthers
GAME SEVEN
How do you write a twist so unpredictable it becomes the most predictable shit I’ve ever seen? Anyone who’s shocked by this outcome clearly forgot what happened to the Lightning before their dynasty. “Lightning in 3” turned into “Columbus in 1.” 62 wins in the regular season, 0 in the playoffs. Boston’s got 65 wins in the regular season, and hey, at least they might get 3 in the playoffs to show for it. Game 1 showed a Bruins team that, while struggling to score at their usual level, still had the insane chemistry that won them so many games. There were so many blind passes you’d think Matt Murdock joined the lineup, and yet they all worked. No matter how many ghosts they passed to, a Bruin would end up with the puck on their stick… and maybe that was their downfall. They’ve been playing a collected, but cocky, type of game and that confidence isn’t translating because these bears are nowhere near as hungry as the cats on the other bench. Maybe it’s that underdog mentality, but these Panthers are electric. Just look at the difference in how these two teams celebrate. The Panthers bring the house down even when they’re not in their own house, and truth be told, scoring goals is a whole lot easier when Linus Ullmark loses his magic. In game 5, Ullmark got Jarry Syndrome and decided to pass the puck to the wrong team in overtime like every competent goalie seems to do nowadays. Then in game 6, 'twas a legendary and extremely fun to watch battle where both goaltenders forgot how to tend goals. 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, all within the last 12 minutes of the game. The greatest team in regular season history has a chance to blow a 3-1 series lead by the time anyone reads this, and you already know I’ll be the first to show up to an inferior black and gold team’s funeral.
(A2) Toronto Maple Leafs VS. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning
TORONTO WINS 4-2
Oh my God, the rapture is here. After losing an insane 11 straight series-clinching games, the Canadian kings of choking finally won a playoff series. For the first time since 2004, a year I couldn’t even say the Maple Leafs sucked ass because I couldn’t speak yet, they are moving on to the second round. "Hey, guys, we can’t lose another game 7 if we never play a game 7." I don’t think anyone actually believed the Lightning would win; everyone just believed the Maple Leafs would lose. There’s a difference. I mean, I was convinced the Leafs already hit peak playoff form after getting blown out 7-3 in game 1, but as soon as someone called the ambulance, they declared “but not for me” and dominated the Lightning 7-2 two days after. Credit to Toronto’s coaching staff because they pulled some Imitation Game bullshit and cracked Andrei Vasilevskiy before anyone else could. They even told the world their strategy live on air in an interview. Paraphrased, “yeah just pop shots from the point lmao”. How else do you think Morgan Reilly had a round to remember alongside Shawn Mendes impersonator Mitch Marner? That’s called adjustment, folks. Biden declared that the COVID pandemic was over and accidentally ended the Lightning in the process. Maybe those Corona championship asterisks were right. You didn’t hear that from me though. Congratulations Toronto, in the spirit of shedding labels, I hope Auston Matthews sheds that terrible mustache too.
(M1) Carolina Hurricanes VS. (WC1) New York Islanders
CAROLINA WINS 4-2
The only bet safer than Carolina winning was that this would be one boring ass series. This series had no energy other than the Sebastian Aho people actually care about. All the moments that should’ve had players screaming “LFG” looked like “LFG to bed.” Before game 6, I had never seen a more nonchalant celebration/cry of defeat combo in my life. The goal to end it all was a total shitter that was more of a pass to the corner boards than a shot and yet, what do you know? Ilya Sorokin played as advertised, making nutty save after nutty save only to let in the saddest goals imaginable. In game 2, the Hurricanes somehow put one of the jankiest goals of all time because Islanders defender, wish.com Sebastian Aho, decided to use his stick as a flail and somehow threw a total bouncer of a puck into his own net. If you don’t want to watch hockey for the right reasons, at least watch this play for laughs because I cannot make this shit up. Back to game 6, Sorokin let in the softest of softies off his right foot to end the series and the only thing more baffling than the goal was the aftermath. The Hurricanes lackadaisically skate over to goal scorer, or more accurately “last guy who happened to touch the puck”, Paul Stastny with the energy of “oh jolly good show old chaps” and the Islanders sulk in agony with the pain of “aw jeepers guys, that sure was an oopsies.” I think the Hurricanes are a talented team who just need an opponent with more personality than a graham cracker to really showcase their energy and skill but for the time being, this was an empty husk of a series. If the Penguins held just one of their multi-goal third period leads against the Islanders, the world wouldn’t have been subjected to this torture on ice.
(M2) New Jersey Devils VS. (M3) New York Rangers
GAME SEVEN
Akira Schmid? More like Sch-based (kill me). On a serious note, I could not tell you what the hell this series is. In games 1 and 2, the Rangers humiliated the Devils beyond comprehension. The Devils’ entire offense was so cold I thought I could see them turning blue. Their only offensive production in game 1 was a god damn penalty shot. We already knew their goaltending wasn’t the reason they were winning, but at least in the regular season, they were burying enough pucks to give Vitek Vanecek a workload CMU students would sacrifice themselves for… and then a miracle happened. Some random ass nobody named after the most overrated anime movie of all time (this is a joke, Akira slaps) got thrown into game 3 and singlehandedly flipped the series on its head. A perpetual minor leaguer completely and utterly collapsed the Rangers’ offense for 3 games straight. The same offense that roasted the Devils on an open fire with 10 goals in the first two games scored just 2 in the next 3. Unfortunately, the Devils' offense didn’t get much better and only survived by 1 goal margins in games where the Rangers could only score 1 goal. At least game 5 was the destroyer of confidence the Devils hoped for as they went for a 20-2 shot differential in the third period and a 4-0 win on the night but that didn’t last long at all. The Rangers came roaring back to win 5-2 in game 6 and showed the world that they remembered how to skate. So to sum it up, according to my in-depth analysis, I’ve come to the thoughtful conclusion of “I don’t even fucking know." Both teams have shown they know how to shit the bed with peak efficiency and so all I can expect is that everyone’s uniform will look a little more brown than usual.

Note: To understand what our hormones do and how birth control uses hormones to prevent pregnancy, please pair this article with “Anna’s In-Progress Guide to Hormonal Birth Control.”
That’s right, it’s time to finally tackle this beast: How in the world does the period cycle work? The truth is, even though very few menstruators actually know what’s going on in their brain and body on any given day of the month, it’s really not so complicated. And understanding the hormonal mechanism behind the scenes really helps explain some of the less pleasant symptoms that can happen along the way.
For much of my discussion, I’ll be speaking in averages: Everyone’s cycle and symptoms are unique, but understanding the basic structure can help you apply the significant concepts to your personal cycle, no matter how beautifully (or annoyingly) irregular it may be. 
The average cycle lasts 28 days, or one month. The first five to 10 days are the actual “period,” or the bleeding, and ovulation happens around day 14. I’m going to start our menstrual story on that day.
Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovaries into the uterus. It is the day that egg-havers are most likely to get pregnant, because the egg is so new and readily available. It is also the time in which many menstrual hormones are at their highest levels, including estrogen, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. 
What does that mean for your body? We’re thriving. First and foremost, the body loves estrogen. It clears your skin, strengthens your bones, and likely puts you in a great mood when combined with the other hormones. The increase in testosterone, which might be confusing because most people associate testosterone with people who don’t have menstrual cycles, works as a balance against the increased estrogen. We always have a low level of testosterone in our bodies, but it would be an awkward outlier if it remained low during ovulation.
Luteinizing hormone (pronounced loo-ten-eye-zing) is a regulator. More specifically, it promotes the production of progesterone, which is a key player in pregnancy. Increasing progesterone makes your body more ready to carry another human being, and as you can imagine, that’s a very healthy state. 
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) plays a slightly more technical role. FSH incites the ovaries to do the actual releasing of the egg, which lives in a follicle. When the follicle is stimulated (hence the hormone name), it prepares the egg to exit the ovary through the fallopian tube and into the uterus. 
So now we have an egg in our uterus and we’re all ready to fertilize it and make it into a baby. Great! Except, chances are you’re not getting pregnant every month, so what happens to that egg? It stays there for a while, and as your body starts to notice that you’re not using it for anything, it gets ready to get rid of it before it gets too old to use. The lining of the uterus — or the endometrium — builds up a new layer of blood vessel cells and other types of cells. Spoiler alert: That layer isn’t going to stick around for very long.
Hormonally, though, the body hasn’t given up on the concept of pregnancy completely. Ovulation is a hormonal spike, so all the hormones I talked about earlier decrease rapidly after the egg is released. This is why some people experience spotting, or light bleeding, in the middle of their cycle — the decrease in estrogen is to blame. All of the hormones I talked about in the context of ovulation are now at low levels except for estrogen, which begins to increase again in the last few weeks of the cycle (or the luteal phase). And I already told you that progesterone has been triggered by LH, so there’s an increase in that, too. Things are going pretty well for the body for a little while, until the month is over and everything drops all at the same time.
Welcome to PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, the name given to a horrifying symptom soup that happens before the period and is caused by the complete hormone drop. Low estrogen causes (amongst a long list of other things) sudden mood changes, acne, and increased salt retention that leads to bloating. Low progesterone signals that time is up for our egg, which is by now sitting in a thick layer of endometrium. Getting rid of that layer requires muscle contractions that are to blame for period cramps. The layer itself is shed as blood during the menstrual period. Hormones remain at a low level, with estrogen gradually increasing until ovulation.
This might seem like a mess of changes, and it is certainly a complex system. But it’s also highly evolved, meaning that, like it or not, everything you go through pushes us all towards the goal of successful procreation. 
That said, I’ll end with some food for thought: If we’re including estrogen (which does not prevent pregnancy) in our birth control treatments, why are we giving women steady doses all month long? Could we not take a hint from nature and grade the dosages to replicate the cycle without ovulation, and would that not result in healthier birth control outcomes?

Working deep in the lower levels of the Gates Center, a team of students is sending a rover to the moon — and it is set to become the first-ever university project to do so. That team has been working for over five years to make their mission a reality, involving nearly 400 students from across disciplines at Carnegie Mellon. The rover, known as Iris, is planned to launch this summer aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket. With hard work and a little luck on their side, the Iris team is going to make history.
The Iris team recently outfitted an old conference room on the second level of Gates into the Mission Control Center, from which the rover will be teleoperated. Large TV monitors show a live stream of what the rover is seeing on the Moon. Sleek soundproofing panels allow the team to focus on mission tasks. When the rover touches down on the lunar surface, it will be all systems go, sending commands and checking for obstacles. Every second counts — not a moment is to be lost in the hours-long mission that took years to manifest.
Now seniors, Mission Control Lead Nikolai Stefanov and Systems Management Lead Divya Rao joined the project as first-years. As Stefanov told The Tartan, the Iris mission is the culmination of “a human century of effort,” and a pioneer for the university and the country. The project builds on decades of space robotics at Carnegie Mellon. Robots built here have been sent into volcanoes, traveled to the Antarctic, and serviced numerous NASA contracts. Iris, however, is set to be the full stack rover mission to go from Earth to the Moon.
The rover has passed all qualification tests for launch, riding as a payload on board Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology’s Peregrine lander. They were required to present rigorous documentation and testing to prove their "nanorover" was fully equipped for the mission. Rao served as the main point of communication between Iris members, bridging the mechanical, avionics, and software teams. She also worked with those teams to create deliverables for submission to Astrobotic, proving their rover’s capability.
The trip to the moon, onboard ULA’s Vulcan Centaur spacecraft, will last approximately a month. It will be taking a highly fuel-efficient path, using Earth’s orbit and gravity to help propel it toward the Moon. During transit, operations are minimal, with only the occasional status report sent home. After touchdown, however, it's a full-on sprint.
The rover is completely battery-operated, and with 72 watt-hours of charge, the mission is anticipated to last roughly 50 hours. To maximize all the effort behind a two-day push, multiple tasks on the rover will be running in parallel. Navigation controls will communicate with the home base and execute specific movements on their command. System elements will analyze rover health, using a thermistor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to monitor the temperature across the rover and ascertain its rotation and orientation. 
A critical capability for navigation is known as localization, determining where the rover is with respect to its surroundings. Iris has front- and rear-facing cameras but has no depth perception without a means of localization. To achieve a better perspective, the team uses MonoSLAM, an algorithm system that determines a 3D bearing from a monocular camera. That helps figure out, for example, “what’s a rock and what’s a crater,” Stefanov said — not a triviality in-mission. Ground localization software enables the perception of objects using AI edge detection, and also allows for determining distances, all computed here on Carnegie Mellon servers, and not on the rover itself.
A key aspect of navigation lies right outside the control room’s windows, down below in the high bay Planetary Robotics lab where Iris was built. Nestled amid an organized jumble of NASA-contracted innovations and robotics projects is the so-called “moonyard,” a large walled-in sandpit where a flight-equivalent rover will mimic the live actions of its lunar counterpart. Computer models will predict where the rover should be on the moon, which can be checked against where the rover actually is in the moonyard and analyzed post-mission. A focus of the Iris mission is to explore how rover behavior differs on the Moon versus on Earth, enabled by the moonyard’s recreation of the lunar surface.
On top of being the first developed by students, the nanorover is also the smallest to ever go to the Moon. Most rovers are “the size of SUVs,” Stefanov said, but theirs is “the size of a shoebox.” A key aspect of the mission is to test how a rover as small as Iris functions, as studying its terramechanics and interactions with the lunar surface may prove vitally useful to future rover missions. Building a space-ready rover has been quite the learning experience. Every lesson will be a contribution to further lunar ventures.
The original launch date of this May was pushed back to later this summer, due to complications with the Vulcan Centaur test rig. Better safe than sorry — all necessary precautions must be taken to ensure a smooth journey.
What else makes Iris so groundbreaking? A main component is its extreme affordability. Past NASA rover missions have cost in the magnitude of billions of dollars. All told, total programmatic expenses for Iris will come in at under one million. Due to its small size, production costs are not enormous. Showing how a university can achieve getting a project into space for such low cost may inspire others to pursue similar missions.
By showing how such a small rover performs on the Moon and learning what problems must be dealt with in production, the Iris team aims to equip future missions with the data and knowledge gained from their experience, and “open up space for everybody,” as Stefanov likes to say.
“We don't really know how the rover is going to interact on the lunar surface,” he said. “We’ll see when we get there and play it by ear.”
The process of developing Iris has been one of constant learning and adaptation. Often, work on the rover has involved gaining new knowledge more than making use of old, “learning more than application in a lot of ways,” Stefanov said. His coding skills and physics knowledge have come in handy more than once, but learning new things makes up the bulk of his work, which Stefanov is especially excited about.
“A lot of what I deal with right now is logistics,” he said. During the mission itself, he will be stepping into the Director of Operations, ensuring communications are running properly and all operators are in position.
For Rao’s part, she’s been serving in mission operations development now that production of the rover has wrapped up. This semester, Rao has worked to “define and structure our operator roles, making sure we have a set structure, developing training and documentation, and getting ready for launch,” she said.
For the Moon-curious, Iris will be traveling to the Gruithuisen Domes, an area composed of silica-based volcanic eruptions. The lander will touch down in a region named Sinus Viscositatis, or the Bay of Stickiness. A unique feature of the Moon, given its lack of an atmosphere, is a thin layer on its surface called lunar regolith. The makeup of this dusty material varies by lunar location but is essentially a bunch of charged particles, thus highly prone to sticking to surfaces — a major reason why solar panels were ruled too complicated, thus the need for battery operations.
During the Apollo mission, “astronauts would have to wipe their masks constantly because the dust would stick to their mask,” Stefanov explained. How the rover’s wheels perform in this thick layer of regolith, floating on top or sinking deeper, will be another focus of post-mission analysis.
The Iris program, in its pioneering nature as the first university rover to aim for the Moon, aspires to “motivate other universities and students to get interested and see that this is an option, to put things on the moon and even go further,” Rao said. Hopefully, “it will encourage others to get interested and involved in the space community.” With numerous interdisciplinary aspects involving students from every college on campus, Iris “shows that you don’t have to be a STEM major” to contribute to space exploration, she said.
“It's kind of surreal. You don't really grasp the reality of it. We're putting something on the Moon, something that we built as students,” Rao said. She never expected that her time at Carnegie Mellon would involve work on a lunar space mission. For her, doing it now is “just mind blowing."

With the rise of cellular communication, it’s easier than ever to talk to others. However, it’s also easier than ever to ignore them. When communication ends with someone without explanation, it’s called “ghosting.” Though it’s more likely to happen in romantic relationships, it also happens in friendships as well. 
A team of researchers at the University of Vienna studied the consequences of ghosting others in emerging adults’ romantic relationships and friendships. The study focused on individuals between the ages of 16 and 21 years old, as 84 percent of people in this age group use at least one social media site and about a third use online dating platforms. This demographic also heavily engages in ghosting behavior — 29.3 percent had at some point ghosted someone, 25.3 percent had been ghosted, and 44.2 percent had been in both positions. 
The study examined ghosting of relationship partners and friends as two separate phenomena. The researchers found that when it comes to ghosting romantic partners, communication overload positively predicts ghosting behavior. In this scenario, communication overload is the feeling of receiving more messages than one can handle. The researchers noted that ghosting others within romantic relationships did not yield any effects on well-being.
While this was the case for romantic relationships, the researchers found that ghosting friends could instead be predicted by one’s self-esteem; when someone had greater self-esteem, they were more likely to ghost their friends. Also unlike romantic relationships, researchers found that when someone ghosts a friend, they are more likely to develop increased depressive tendencies over time, which they said demonstrated that ghosting is harmful to both the person who was ghosted and the person who ghosted. 
The last area that researchers looked at was if depressive tendencies were an indicator of ghosting behavior. In both romantic relationships and friendships, the authors found no predictive influence from depressive tendencies. 
The authors of the paper closed with what they considered to be the practical implications of their work: “Our findings may also have practical implications as they may prompt individuals to reflect on their own ghosting behavior as well as app designers to minimize unforeseen harms that may come not only with being ghosted but also with ghosting others, particularly friends.”

It’s been a week since part one of this investigation was released, and I appear to have become a bit of a celebrity on campus. My wonderful fans (median age of 48, standard deviation of 8.4 years) shower me with praise, and I’ve finally received the notoriety and admiration that I ought to have already received, considering my writing genius. A friend that went to Colorado Mesa has been sending me death threats for the past four days. A pair of twins at the dueling Chinese Medical Universities have been hexing me and now I have shingles and a lower back injury. I have fourteen finals. But enough about me, me, me. You are here for the content (what a disgusting weasel-word); I’m more than happy to provide.
Central Methodist University (centralmethodist.edu): Back on American soil at last (Fayette, Missouri). Founded by a Mr. D. Rice McAnally in 1853, this CMU is quite the trivia extravaganza, a veritable “did you know” affair. Despite what some might expect, Missouri basically remained in the Union during the American Civil War. Technically neutral at the start of the conflict, by the time Missouri secessionist government officials attempted to secede, they controlled basically none of Missouri, so most people just shrugged and moved on with their lives. “It’s just a little war, right? Who really cares what side we’re on?” 
On September 24, 1864, Jesse James (before his assassination at the hands of the coward Robert Ford) and over 179 other confederate bushwackers ambushed a group of around 50 union soldiers in Fayette, Missouri, fighting up to the campus grounds of Central College (now notorious under the name Central Methodist University). Despite their strength in numbers, the confederates got their asses handed to them. Thirteen dead confederates, and they managed to only kill Thad Jackson in return. Pathetic display. 
Did you know that the only Prime Minister of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia went to CMU? (Abel Muzorewa, by all accounts a great guy.) Did you know that Steinbrenner (Seinfeld Yankees guy)’s son went to CMU? Central Methodist is a D1 school, so Mongolian football (soccer) player Murun Altankhuyag went to CMU! The only Americans that have heard of Ноён Altankhuyag are degenerate sports betters with 13-leg parlays and 12-step Alcoholic Anonymous programs. Did you know that Tyler “tyler1” “not Ninja Blevins” Steinkamp played football (football) for CMU? (He’s a gamer who gets angry. Your son that never leaves his room will know who I’m talking about.) This CMU’s endowment is approximately one percent of our CMU's, but they managed to have a special CMUEagles app with a fancy green color scheme and a map “so you don’t miss the action.” 
There are three components to the name. Fayette is in the Center of Missouri. According to Central Methodist, “Fayette has long been an area of education”, hence the University. ¯\ (ツ) /¯
And when CMU changed its name to Central Methodist University in 2004, Missouri had the most Meth lab busts in the country.
China Medical University (cmu.edu.cn): I don’t speak Mandarin, I prefer to do my research unaided by demonic machine translations, and I am blocked from visiting this CMU’s website. Nevertheless, I persisted. This was the first medical school founded by the Chinese Communist Party, and it encompasses an impressive 1.8 million square meters (or a significantly less impressive 0.7 square miles) in the heart of 沈阳. It was originally called Military Medical School of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, but comrade Mao Zedong had the brilliant idea to make the name less terrible, so they acquiesced. It is the second best Chinese University for clinical medicine. I’d love to evangelize CMU more, but they are trying to thwart me at every turn. I try to reach their website raw, no dice. Use a VPN, no dice. I even called their phone number (at 3:10 p.m. China time, so don’t you dare tell me they were asleep) and dialed 9 to get to their school section, but they left me on hold for longer than my 15 cent per minute Verizon international calling plan could handle. I’m calling it quits here, and would love for an intrepid adventurer to succeed me.
China Medical University(cmu.edu.tw): Like Mario and Wario, this CMU appears as a reflection of the previous, similar yet twisted. Similar website, just with a Taiwanese domain instead of Chinese. To a layman, this may seem more like a Mario and Mario situation, since the names are identical. However, the Chinese CMU is named 中国医科大学, and the Taiwanese 中國醫藥大學. Some of the characters are different. This looks to be yet another great school in a region full of great schools.
Colorado Mesa University(coloradomesa.edu): These are a bunch of posers. How are you going to stake a claim on the illustrious CMU acronym in 2011? That’s far too late to join the fight. I shouldn’t even mention the college formerly known as Grand Junction Junior College or Mesa College or even Mesa State College in this article, but I know that my Americo-centric audience would whine and moan about its lack of inclusion. I bust my balls cataloguing everything there is to know about some lesser-known institutions of more or less learning. I must applaud this CMU for their student newspaper “The Criterion.” I love its fancy-schmancy website with matching editor headshots! and dropdown menus! (gasp) Their journalism appears competent, and their April Fools issue has some heaters. I specifically liked “CMU hires renowned chemist Walter White." Their readership numbers seem rather low. Luckily, we don’t post our viewership numbers on our articles. This CMU isn’t without faults though. They are a D2 sports college, legitimately pathetic. Either be D1 with good sports, or D3 with a good school. D2 is just a mediocre sports school with a 32 percent graduation rate. It’s telling that the “Why Choose CMU?” page on their website is three tweets long. But in another life, I could see myself joining the Maverick Network as a CMU alum. The ambiance seems cozy. Hopefully someone on their newsroom name searches this article, and we’ll develop a Criterion x Tartan rivalry.
Capital Medical University (ccmu.edu.cn): This is a Chinese medical university, not to be confused with China Medical University or the other China Medical University. You’ve got to realize that there are many Chinese people (more than 80 million), and therefore many Chinese people necessitating medical care. Once you realize that there are many Chinese people, so much begins to make sense. To us, it can appear that they are running out of names, but this is purely a demonstration of the weakness of the English language, a reverse of the slaying of the Chinese Jaberwocky astoundingly performed by Doctor Yuen Ren Chao, and chronicled in a wonderful issue of “The Believer”. I however am no linguist, and again admit defeat on the Chinese issue.
Central Mindanao University (cmu.edu.ph): Known as the “Academic Paradise of the South,” this Filipino university does not disappoint. First of all, I must thank the anglophone hegemony, centuries of colonialism, and the legendary bag-fumbling of the Spanish empire, for Filipinos speaking English, and therefore letting me read their website without a dictionary by my side. I did my due diligence here, and I can confirm that this is a real, legitimate university. It was founded it 1910, and received its CMU denomination in 1965, two years before we did! They are a research university just like us, and they aren’t another goddamn medical school. CMU PE uniforms are emblazoned with “Mens sana in corpore sano.” Now I don’t speak Tagalog, but that text is actually in Latin, so I can translate it as “Sound mind in a sound body.” This CMU, unlike some others, actually cares about the mental health of its patients. CMU Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Dr. Leo Labrador expounded on this: “Bakit? Ang youth natin ngayon very oriented with the social media, parang, kahit na magkasama sila.” I’d like to see Dr. Jahanian say that.
Central Michigan University (cmich.edu): This is the big one, the big Kahuna, the real CMU. When I search CMU finals schedule, they come up. When I search CMU dining, they come up. “Oh, it says CMU dining, it must be the right link!” NO, YOU IDIOT. That’s CMICH dining, maliciously reported as being CMU dining by the frauds in Google. And I’m not jealous of their award winning student newspaper that has won the National Pacemaker Awards for best college newspaper six times since The Tartan last won. I’m not jealous of their happy students. I’m not even jealous of their location in a town literally called “Pleasant.” Because jealousy is the victim of success, and my CMU is so superior, that listing all its qualities would require 200 pages. But here’s just one bit of C(arnegie)M(ellon)U(niversity) superiority. We may not be the oldest, but our domain sure is! Always on the forefront of technological innovation, we were the first non-DARPA organization to get a .edu page! (And second to get any domain, after Symbolics.) But I’d like to rub it in. Here’s a list of all the CMU website founding dates I could gather (legally). I had to fill out so many CAPTCHAs (name coined at the real CMU btw) to get these, so just be grateful:
Carnegie Mellon (cmu.edu): 24-Apr-1985
Central Michigan University (cmich.edu): 02-May-1991
Canadian Mennonite University (cmu.ca): 15-Nov-2000
Central Methodist University (centralmethodist.edu): 20-Jul-2004
Caribbean Medical University (cmumed.org):31-Jan-2007
California Miramar University (calmu.edu): 05-Feb-2007
Colorado Mesa University (coloradomesa.edu): 08-Jul-2011
So what did we learn? Perhaps that our CMU lives, as pitiful as they may seem to us, are but specks in an ocean of horror that other CMU students reside in. Maybe we can be content with going to a top three CMU. Maybe most of the other CMUs don’t even have enough going on to fill an article. Why can’t you just be happy?

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: “We don’t want you staying up all night, so we’ve set your assignment due at 9 p.m.” Well, the joke’s on you Amanda, because now I’m gonna pull an all-nighter the day before your problem set is due. These professors have had it too easy for too long. While we toil away with our lowercase-c backs at the never-ending homework-projects-quiz-discussion-board hell, the fatcats lay back, with their fancy autograders and poorly socialized TAs humbling us without any hope of appeal. Being a college professor used to be hard work, real salt-of-the-earth, backbreaking labor. They needed to speak words good and grade handwritten papers over candlelight and take special defense training in case a GI-bill supersenior with the nickname “Beefster” ever came swinging. The only upside was the fresh supply of undergrads to have affairs with. (Now they only get to make love to their grad students. What has the world come to?) Modern “professors” are so pampered, you might as well call them diapers. The most exotic submission times are at their fingertips, so of course they must use them! 11:43 a.m. deadline for a 4:30 p.m. class? Of course! And feel free to get me started on the 11:59 p.m./12:00 p.m. deadlines, 12 hours (and one minute) apart, and consistently confounding. I have searched “when is 12 p.m.” nine times. They overuse a convenience they cannot properly even “regular-use.” 
But we can’t blame our beloved teachers for this tech rapaciousness. As much as they’d deny it, the 39-year-old adjunct is drawn to the learning management system like a moth to a flame, or a baby to an iPad, or a baby to the bathwater, or a baby to the microwave. And we can’t blame them for their tech incompetence. After all, they’ve only been adults for 20 years, we can’t expect them to know how to post a link. The real blame lies on the wretched Canvas that lays bare all human sins. Here is where I lay my thesis on Canvas Hell. As with 99.9998% of post-2002 creations (I’m the exception), Canvas (founded by Bringham Young University super-soakers) has failed to deliver on its promise to streamline the tedious edges of the educational process. Just like the Common App caused your rejection from MIT and SIO screwed you out of Acting for Non-Majors, Canvas has made everything worse. College is a war between the professor and the student. We cannot win without bringing the enemy down, and they must do the same for us. We used to maintain a delicate balance through the use of the aforementioned “Beefster” types and our sexual wiles, but Canvas (the atomic bomb) has pushed the balance too far, and we now must prostrate in deference to the enemy. “Sure, I’d love to respond to three discussion posts in my own words outside of class!” - words spoken by a broken people, with psyches so shattered that we cannot fathom a before times.
My grievances are as follows:
- Canvas is woefully inadequate for the esoteric grading schemes favored by the more twisted professors.
- “Component Weight Participation: 3%, Average homework percentage score (lowest 2 dropped): 30%, Highest test percentage score: 20%, Second-highest test percentage score: 15%, Greater of: lowest test score, final exam score: 5%, Final exam percentage score: 27%”
- The intelligentsia wasn’t allowed to do this back when a grade calculation involved a slide rule, two abacuses, and an underpaid Black woman computer whose contributions would be neglected for half a century.
- The so-called Syllabus tab rarely contains a syllabus, most often favoring a list of Zoom links to office hours, or maybe a list of all the homework assignments you didn’t submit. I’d like to shout out Dr. Kritschgau, Dr. Meija, and Dr. Yurko, whose Syllabi tabs this semester are the best I’ve seen. Great professors, too. On an unrelated note, I take payment in unearned extra credit points. Pretend this article is a statistical analysis or something.
- I know some people like the confetti, but I’m not a baby. The heroin I carefully inject intravenously following homework submissions is reward enough.
- And am I the only one who gets low-key P-Oed when somebody is writing corrections on my submission, and I get a new notification for every comment they make? Every time I think it means that she texted back, and then I realize what it really is, which makes the cyanide pill I’ve kept hidden in my molar look that much more appealing. Sometimes they’ll be grading a really poor project, and it’ll happen to me like 15 times before I get Pavloved into figuring it out.
- Also, sometimes I turn in homework, but Canvas doesn’t actually turn it in. I’ll pinky promise that I did the work, but something weird must have happened. What a strange glitch, I’ll send you the homework as soon as I can find it. But my computer’s storage is plentiful (512gb ssd plus 2tb hdd btw), so it may take me about 2 hours to find. And if they don’t give full credit, I call them a fascist on their course evals.
But Canvas does have some upsides. As I’m not propagandizing for the enemy, I won’t tell you them, but I’m sure the Canvas superfan at (913) 468-9741 would love to enlighten you on them. As for me, I’m still a sophomore, and I’m excited for two more years of Canvas Hell.

“Henry! You okay there bud?” Mr. Greenberg asked as he ran past the house where a young boy was lying on the ground. 
“Yes sir, Mr. Greenberg. I’m just looking at the girl in the window.” 
“What girl?”
“That one. Right there. Sitting on the bed in the attic,” Henry responded.
“There’s no one up there, kid. Only dust and broken glass. It’s just your imagination.” Mr. Greenberg gave Henry one last apprehensive look and jogged off towards his house around the corner. Typical of an adult, Henry thought. Discrediting a kid because he could see something that they couldn’t. He wanted to prove them wrong. Mr. Greenberg and all the rest of the people that thought he was crazy for watching the broken-down mustard-colored house. He pulled the aviator’s cap that he always wore lower on his head and tried to muster up the courage to walk to the front door. He knocked. No one answered. He knocked again. Nothing. Henry pushed the door and miraculously, it opened. 
“Hello?” he called. “Hellooo?” No one responded, but a clatter came from the attic. Henry hastily, but nervously walked up the steps. When he poked his head through the trapdoor into the attic, he was welcomed by a girl with bushy, mousy brown hair pointing a sharp looking stick at him. She was wearing an old Red Hot Chili Peppers t-shirt, ripped jeans and bright red rain boots. The most striking thing about her though were her eyes. One was so blue a sapphire would turn green with envy. The other was so dark brown that it appeared as though the night sky had taken refuge. Her face was pale, with freckles sprinkled across her nose. Her transparent skin….wait, that’s not right. Transparent? “Ah! You’re see through!” Henry yelped. 
“That’s because I’m dead, you pinhead!” the girl responded in a harsh British accent. 
“WHAT?!” Henry went very pale. He looked like he had seen a ghost, which I guess he had. “You’re... you’re, uh….” Henry stuttered.
“Dead. D...E...A...D. Dead,” she responded bluntly. 
“But, h-h-how can I see you?” 
“I don’t know, mate. You’d be the first. Now, if you don’t mind. I’d prefer to be alone in my eternal torment.”
“But, I didn’t even get your name?”
“Emily, although it’s none of your business.” 
“How did you die?” Henry fumbled with the zipper on his jacket.
“Didn’t I tell you to scat, you little maggot?” 
“Please? Then I’ll leave.”
“Ugh. Fine. I do enjoy talking about myself. It was a dark and stormy night. The wind screamed in the darkness. It was my job to fetch water from the well and give it to the animals on my family’s farm. The only thing I remember was staring into the well and then suddenly I felt a tap and I was dead.” Henry remained silent. “What?” Emily asked.
“I think someone pushed you.”

To prepare you for finals week, I've compiled a ranking of all the coffee on campus according to a rigorous rubric that was checked and approved by the culinary critics of pillbox, so you can be properly caffeinated for your many upcoming all-nighters. Godspeed and god bless, I hope you all pass your exams. 
Note: to keep the rankings fair, I consumed a coffee from each of these locations with one cream and one sugar. I don't drink black coffee because it's nasty.
Entropy (5/10)
Tastes mildly of wood chips. The powdered coffee creamer doesn't seem to dissolve in liquid. I was going to give this a lower ranking before it was pointed out to me that this is the cheapest coffee on campus. It's for times of desperation, and it fulfills its beverage niche well.
Exchange (6/10)
Nothing to rave about, but no complaints either. It's coffee, and by God, it'll wake you up. Solid, dependable, and functional. Beats water.
Wean Prima (10/10)
I don't know what they put in this, but it is glorious. My positive experiences with this may purely be due to the fact that my brain associates this coffee with Sorrels library (my safe space), but it's incredible. The coffee is rich and flavorful, and the little teeny cups are adorable. The baristas are GOATed. Proof that unions work. 
Gates Prima (9/10)
Not nearly as good as the coffee from its sister location in Wean somehow. I attribute this to the fact that Gates is a newer building so the water pipes don't impart the earthy, lead taste that makes the Wean water so much richer. 
Zebra Cafe (4/10)
Mildly disappointing, it tastes more watery than one would want. However, the coffee urns have a push lever that makes it feel like you're extracting coffee from a subterranean well, which is pretty fun.
Millie's (2/10)
Thin, unpleasant, and under-caffeinated. It tastes like somebody microwaved a cup of bathwater while thinking about a coffee bean. I put in a splash of cream and it immediately turned pale white. 
ABP (8/10)
By far the strongest on campus and the most economically efficient way to get a caffeine high. The coffee equivalent of Barton's vodka. Their hazelnut coffee has egregious amounts of artificial flavoring, and I love it. 
Schatz (9/10)
This is the white whale of campus coffee. The dispenser is not working half the time, but when it does, the "extra strong" button goes ridiculous. Bonus points because it's right next to the milk dispenser.
De Fer (4/10)
For a place with such incredible beverages, their drip coffee was surprisingly mid. You can only be great at so many things, I guess. There was no sugar, so I had to use Splenda, the most foul concoction devised ever by chemists, which significantly detracted from my experience. It is also the most expensive coffee on this list. Just get their smoothies instead. 
Fifth Commons Coffee Machine (3/10):
(Note, the coffee machine in Fifth Commons is the exact same model as the one on Wean 2, so this review applies to both.)
I was inspecting the liquid as it came out of the machine, and it was completely clear for the first few seconds. The coffee, however, was surprisingly passable for something made by a robot. It tasted vaguely like a popsicle stick, and their definition of "1" cream is perhaps less than I might desire, but my expectations were not terribly high. At no point did a price display on the machine so I have no idea how much I was charged for this.

To all the readers of this fine magazine, I’m here to tell you about the greatest movie of our generation. It’s not "Super Mario Bros." or "Citizen Kane," but the iconic "The VelociPastor."
Released in the year of our Lord two thousand and eighteen, the movie was a cinematic masterpiece, ushering in a new era of editing styles, shots, and composition that changed the industry forever. It’s not hard to see where Scorsese got his knowledge of directing for "Killers of the Flower Moon"— one look at "VelociPastor"'s transcendental change in special effects will show you where he learned his chops from. The film takes a new look at how to talk about media, special effects, and really deconstructs what a film is. Does a film need plot? Coherence? Action? "VelociPastor" rejects the orthodoxy and gives us a movie filled with uncomfortable close-ups and confusing action — the sort to make audiences sit up, take notice, and pay attention.
The first scene of "VelociPastor" really sells its avant-garde approach to understanding cinema. By opting to give the main character, Reverent V. Lossi Pasteur, a pair of dead parents, the movie turns traditional stereotypes about movie orphans on its head. "VelociPastor" shows you that you don’t need to be the child of wealthy families to see your parents killed in front of you — anyone, anywhere, can become an orphan at any time. If that’s not an uplifting message, I don’t know what is.
"VelociPastor" also used new filming trends like “text on screen” to help convey messages to their audience. No more exploding cars, or strange fires. Now, we can just say, “VFX: Car on fire.”
After having one of the best representations of Asian characters in recent memory (a single, non-specific martial artist who quickly dies), "VelociPastor" transforms into a vast, breathtaking cinematic masterpiece, with some of the most amazing shots of dinosaur-on-criminal violence we’ve seen since Ken Burns’ documentary "Jurassic Park." They also, for audiences that may not want to view violence, only flashed their incredible work, giving it an exquisite air of mystery.
Our hero is then saved by Carol, a woman of the night, who nurses him back to health. She asks him to fight crime as a dinosaur, raising the philosophical question of vigilantism and utilitarianism, something anyone who’s taken 80-100 will recognize. We’re thrown twists and turns, though, as the hero returns to his church to confess and then face an exorcism, only to fail and become a crime fighting dino-man. His first hurdle? Killing Carol’s pimp. His second? Fighting an army of ninjas hell bent on spreading cocaine to the public, in an effort to eventually cut off all the users and drive them to organized religion. In a fight scene rivaling that of "Avengers: Endgame," the ordained pastor kills the ninja clan, rips the head off its leader, and goes back to his life of crime-fighting.
"The VelociPastor" is an excellent movie, but I do have problems with it. Personally, I find its new use of text on screen to be underutilized, and I’d have preferred it if more scenes got replaced with floating text. It would have made the viewing experience much more concise, and much more enjoyable. The movie could also have put less effort into its plot and concision — the fact that I understood anything was a serious mark against this film, and I wish the scriptwriter had worked harder to obfuscate the situation. Finally, I’m not a big fan of this movie coming out in 2018. Considering its subject material, I wish the producers had put in the effort to get this released in the summer of 1987, where it deserves the spotlight.
All in all, "VelociPastor" is a crime-fighting family friendly flick for all ages, and one I’d definitely recommend you check out the next time you’re inebriated.

“The blood is the life.”
This is the mantra of Dracula’s loyal assistant, Renfield, a man gone mad under the control of the powerful vampire. Portrayed by Dwight Frye in the 1931 classic "Dracula," the version of Renfield we see in the movie of the titular character (portrayed by Nicholas Hoult) tries to be a “direct sequel” of the 1931 film, or at least that’s what they say. It’s more of a comedy-horror alternate universe, but I digress.
Without giving too much away, the plot can be summed up as this: a pathetic Tumblr man from the Victorian era who does Dracula’s dirty work (and laundry) attends group therapy sessions to give him hope that one day he’ll be free from Dracula’s abuse, only to find himself tangled between his job, his far-fetched dream of independence, and a girl he likes for some reason. There’s also a mob family on his tail, thanks to the recent uptick in violent deaths wherever he goes getting him in trouble with police. 
A lot of times, when people think of the character Renfield, they think of a mentally unstable man who eats bugs to gain their life force, or an Igor-type character who practically worships the ground Dracula walks upon. This new movie actually strays from this portrayal. In it, R.M. (Robert Montague) Renfield willingly gives himself up to become Dracula’s familiar, which was definitely an interesting choice. Without going too deep into the nuances of the character and his origin story from Bram Stoker’s novel, Renfield’s depiction is a very divided subject in any adaptation. This one attempts to humanize him more than other film adaptations, and it does a decent job. 
However, if you’re just coming into this movie for a wild ride, it’ll be right up your alley. This movie was just… unbridled bloodshed-y fun. In this film, the bugs Renfield eats give him powers, such as enhanced strength, so you’ll see a lot of ways a person with vampire-enhanced superpowers could mess someone up. The gore is not as bad as other films I’ve heard of, like "Saw" or films of the like, but you will see some limbs flying here and there (it’s definitely gory, but heavier on the blood rather than guts). It’s also played comically, so the amount of gore used paired with the action-packed/comedic tone of the movie didn’t make me feel as squeamish as I thought I would be going in. Overall, if you can’t really stomach gore, you might want to reconsider giving this movie a go. 
Speaking of a wild ride, this IS a Nicolas Cage movie we’re talking about: and it’s a role he’s apparently been wanting to play for a while now. His Dracula is hilarious, but also incredibly well-acted overall. He does a great job of injecting comedy into the character of Dracula, but still making him absolutely terrifying.
The cinematography was fun, especially the parts in the beginning (which everyone was buzzing about) where snippets from scenes of the 1931 "Dracula" film were reenacted by Cage and Hoult (Cage actually makes for a pretty good Bela Lugosi look-alike in those scenes). There were more action-y bits than I thought would be in the movie, and while I found it a bit redundant and goofy at times, it was admittedly a lot of fun to watch. Both Nicholases do an incredible job, and I mean come on—who wouldn’t want to see Nic Cage as Dracula?
Quick side note: I saw this movie at the Harris theater as part of their month-long Dracula movie event — because I went to see that movie and another Dracula-adjacent film (in my case, I decided to watch the 1979 version of "Dracula"), I got this cool wooden coffin thing that has all the movies they were showing etched into it!
That’s all I'm gonna say about this movie: you’ll have to find out the rest yourself! I think if you like vampires, horror, comedies, or movies with Nicholas Cage, then you’ll find something to love about this film. I certainly did.

Sudan’s military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, holding power since the ousting of President al-Bashir in 2019, is fighting against Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of a Sudanese paramilitary group, in a struggle to determine who will hold centralized power in Sudan in the coming years.
Dagalo was initially appointed by Bashir, to lead the Rapid Support Forces, only to turn on him in the coup. Al-Burhan was the military inspector general, and used his power to take command in the vacuum that followed Bashir’s removal from power. The two men were initially good allies, having come to power in similar ways during Sudan’s violent past, but the decision on who will subordinate to who in the new government has turned the alliance violent. First, both Burhan and Dagalo seemed to support a democracy, but within two years, they overthrew the government they themselves had formed by removing Bashir from power. This new government was populated by Burhan’s allies from Bashir’s regime, a move which put Dagalo on edge, and started fragmenting the relationship that has led to the situation as it stands today.
Recently, Dagalo’s RSF started an offensive in Sudan against Burhan’s government, a move that he has characterized as a "coup."
The move has resulted in hundreds of deaths as the fighting continued. While there had been some hope of a truce on Eid, which the RSF and the government initially supported, neither side has ceased shelling, and civilians remain in the crossfire. An estimated 200,000 Sudanese civilians have fled the country, fleeing to nearby Chad to get away from the fighting. Hospitals and other necessities have been caught up in the front lines, as the RSF and the military chip away at each other.
In terms of strength, the RSF is considerably smaller than the military, having only about 70,000 regulars to the military’s 200,000, but reports say that Dagalo has better trained, supplied and utilized his men, making them a severe threat to Burhan’s government.
With the suddenness of this conflict, major airports and transport hubs in Sudan have been shut down, and those that have not face the costs of being caught in an active war zone. Gunshots can be heard at the country’s major airports, as governments across the world try to find ways to evacuate their embassy staff. This came to a head on April 23, as the United States evacuated its entire embassy staff from Sudan despite fears that this would not be possible due to the crisis unfolding in the country.
Meanwhile, supplies continue to dwindle, as the country faces a long, drawn out war. Even with international arbiters attempting to negotiate a long term solution, the ceasefires that were negotiated so far have all collapsed due to breakouts of violence. 
Unfortunately, regional powers have a significant stake in the conflict. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are both allied with the RSF, as Dagalo helped the Saudi-backed conflict in Yemen during his earlier years. On the opposite side, Egypt, another major player in the middle east, has backed al-Burhan as the legitimate ruler of Sudan. With funding for both sides of this conflict coming in from ostensibly wealthy OPEC countries, this conflict faces the grim reality of taking a long time to come to a conclusion.
The nature of this conflict has also brought in other countries. Russia, through private military company Wagner and their sanctioned fighting group Haftar, seems to be funding the RFS in the conflict. Wagner supply vehicles seem to have been traveling between two key Libyan bases currently controlled by Haftar, and it appears that Russia is meddling in the region again. Russia and Sudan have a close relationship, as both Dagalo and al-Burhan were receiving aid from Moscow in order to continue their rule. With the two now at odds, Russia may be picking a side — or may find it more in their interests to choose both. When initially accused of working with the Russians, Dagalo accused al-Burhan of doing the same, while Wagner denied everything. 
As the conflict ramps up, the humanitarian crisis in Sudan will only continue to worsen. The UN has asked for peace, it now remains to be seen if either party is willing to uphold a ceasefire for long enough that peace can be negotiated.

In light of the recent special elections for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Democrats are officially in control of the House for the first time since 2010. However, this majority is slim, a mere 102-101, meaning any resignations, deaths, or other changes could quickly flip this. This election update makes Pennsylvania one of two states with the two chambers of the state legislature controlled by different parties (the other state being Virginia).  
With that flip, a whole host of new legislature is being proposed, representing both Democratic priorities and bipartisan initiatives. Before we leave for the semester, let’s take a look at some of the legislation coming down the Pennsylvania pipeline:
Insurance coverage of breast cancer screening
The Pennsylvania General Assembly has passed a bipartisan bill mandating insurance coverage for vital screenings and genetic testing for patients at high risk for developing breast cancer. The bill is anticipated to be the first that Governor Josh Shapiro signs into law.
Specifically, the bill requires insurance to cover “all costs associated with breast cancer MRIs, ultrasounds, and BRCA-related genetic testing.” This is an expansion of previous 2020 legislation that required insurance to “cover the costs of breast cancer MRIs and supplemental breast imaging for high-risk patients” — the new bill covers all costs including copays, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs. This is the first bill with such requirements in the U.S.
14,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and these preventative measures can not only help diagnose the issue, but prevent the disease from having long term impacts.

Informed consent for medical exams
In another of a total of eight bipartisan bills passed by the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, a bill requiring informed consent for pelvic, rectal, or prostate exams was passed unanimously.
This bill was proposed by State Representatives Elizabeth Fiedler and Liz Hanbidge after a constituent raised the issue to Fiedler after having a pelvic exam performed on her for “training purposes” without consent while she was unconscious. Current Pennsylvania laws allow this to be a “learning opportunity” for students at medical schools and teaching hospitals, but advocate groups note that this practice is harmful due to the lack of consent given by patients. 
Specifically, this bill requires “explicit verbal and written consent” from a patient to receive these exams while under anesthesia or unconscious, but gives exceptions for “emergencies and exams deemed ‘within the scope of care.’” Violating healthcare providers would be fined for such actions. 
Fiedler describes this policy as a balance between medical training and patient care while also maintaining trust between patient and doctors. Indeed, advocacy groups note that informed consent “protects patient rights, empowers students, and mitigates racist and sexist medical practices.”
Such procedures are currently banned in 21 states, and as this legislation moves through the Pennsylvania Senate and to Shapiro’s office, Pennsylvania has the chance to make that 22.  
Diwali as a state holiday
The Pennsylvania legislature just passed a bill making Diwali a state holiday in Pennsylvania, with the bill clearing the Senate unanimously and the House in a vote 200 to one. The bill recognizes the holiday but “does not require any governments, businesses, or schools to close for the day.” 
The holiday is an important tradition for those who practice Hinduism, and celebrates the triumph of good over evil, calling back to the Ramayana, an Indian epic where the god Vishnu is reincarnated as the prince Rama and defeats an evil demon. Celebrations include fireworks and leaving on lights in their homes, reminiscent of the pathway of lanterns that Rama follows home to his kingdom in the Ramayana. 
The House version of the bill was sponsored by Representative Arvind Venkat, while the Senate version was sponsored by Senator Greg Rothman. Both sponsors emphasized the need for representation, with “the goal to recognize and celebrate the growing Indian community in the Commonwealth.”
Next steps include the House and Senate bills being passed in their opposite houses (a simple process because the bills are identical), and for the bill to be signed by the Pennsylvania governor.  
LGBTQ non-discrimination
In the next step in 22 years of repeated proposals, a bill banning discrimination against LGBTQ individuals has received a committee vote. 
Specifically, this bill looks to ban “sexual orientation discrimination in housing, employment, and all other public accommodations.” This builds on 2022 administrative changes allowing LGBTQ individuals to file a complaint with the Human Relations Commission if they feel they have been fired or denied a service on the basis of their sexual orientation, as well as a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling defining “sex” in federal law as sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Republicans unanimously voted against the bill in committee, claiming the rule is unnecessary given the federal protections from the 2020 Supreme Court ruling and that it would suffer misuse when it came to gender-affirming care. Democrats argue that state-wide protections are necessary in case the federal ruling is ever reversed. 
This legislation still faces a House vote, where Democrats have a slim majority, and a Senate vote, where Republicans have control. However, Governor Shapiro campaigned strongly on this issue, making it one to look out for as the Pennsylvania legislature moves forward on this process. 
Gun control legislation
Previous Republican control of the House meant that any potential gun control legislation was blocked in committee. However, the new Democrat-led House has just advanced four gun-control bills through committee that should hit the House floor as early as next week. 
The first bill requires that long-barrel firearms are sold with trigger locks in an attempt to promote safe-storage rules. The second “requires gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm to the police within three days,” with legal punishments for repeat offenders. The third expands mandatory background checks for firearms purchasing in Pennsylvania, helping close the “gun show” loophole that provides an exception for private sales of shotguns, sporting rifles, and semi-automatic rifles. The fourth enables a judge to “order authorities to temporarily seize firearms from someone if asked by family members or police,” implementing a “red flag” policy that is already followed by 19 other states. 
Despite such progress, the bills are likely to face backlash in later steps of the process. While in committee, the bills were passed along party lines, and Republicans are already speaking out with concerns about the enforceability of such legislation and whether judges can be trusted to make such judgments required in the “red flag” law. They claim that this legislation is symbolic and doesn’t address the root cause of the issue.
In contrast, Democrats claim these bills are “relatively moderate gun-control measures aimed at reducing gun violence, trafficking, suicides, and accidents,” necessary legislation in the face of record pace mass killings in 2023, and an issue in cities like Philadelphia.

On Oct. 27, 2018, Robert Bowers walked into the Tree of Life Synagogue, also home to New Light and Dor Hadash congregations, opened fire, and killed 11 people. According to the ADL, this makes it the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. His case is now going to trial — he has been charged with 63 county and federal charges, 22 of which can merit the death penalty.
The facts of the case are effectively known. There is no real doubt in the minds of the prosecution, defense, or public that Bowers was motivated by antisemitic sentiment to kill worshippers. The trial is less about guilt than it is a referendum on whether the perpetrator deserves the death penalty for his crime.
The defense team will argue that the defendant suffers from major mental illness, including schizophrenia, and that he should receive life in prison. The team includes Judy Clarke, a public attorney who has defended perpetrators of national tragedies (including the Unabomber and the Boston Marathon Bombers) and earning them life in prison as opposed to the death penalty. The defense has unsuccessfully asked for a plea deal in which Bowers would receive life in prison; however federal prosecutors have maintained that the unique facts of this case demand capital punishment. In particular, they point to his extremely clear antisemitic beliefs, reflected in his social media activity; they also point to his lack of remorse for his actions. 
Bowers was active in online far-right communities. His motivation for the attack seems to be his genuine belief in white genocide and the great replacement theory, the most fringe version of which claims that Jewish people are intentionally encouraging the settlement of non-white immigrants to reduce, and eventually replace the American white population. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) is a Jewish non-profit that provides aid to refugees through legal support and resettlement resources. In a social media post mere hours before the attack, Bowers tiraded, “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.” According to the criminal complaint, when Bowers was apprehended by law enforcement he "told a SWAT officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that they [Jews] were committing genocide to his people."
The trial itself will likely last for months. The jury selection process began this past Monday, with each team of lawyers carefully selecting jurors without strong pre-existing feelings on the death penalty. There is a significant push to not sentence Bowers to death, even among those affected by his crimes. Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, who oversees the congregation of New Light (which shared a building with Tree of Life), gave an impassioned speech at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall the day after the shooting, begging federal prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He argued that a lengthy death penalty trial would only prolong the trauma and grief of his congregation. The president of the Dor Hadash congregation made much the same argument in a letter to then Attorney General William Barr, which was signed by members of the congregation that included family members of victims. However, in an open letter to the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle, the families of nine other victims wrote: "His crimes deserve the death penalty." 
The jury selection is expected to last for several more weeks, and the trial itself may not conclude until well into the summer.

The Duquesne police union went on strike on April 17, following months of failed negotiations between the union and the school administration. This came as a response to the last-ditch negotiations between the union and the University, with the union seeking to maintain pension and healthcare benefits, and the university seeming unwilling to budge on the issue.
With no deal on the horizon since October of 2022, Teamsters Local 249 felt that they had no other option but to go on strike. According to Vice President Keith Frank, “It’s wages. It’s retirement. There are issues with seniority and health care. What is pushing us to this point right now is they are acting in bad faith.”
According to the union, Duquesne has refused to increase the police’s pay without removing funding from their benefits, a deal which the union does not feel is fair considering the work the 28 members of the Duquesne police put into the school. 
At the time, Duquesne responded by stating that they’d operated in good faith with the police union, and the most recent agreement represented the highest wage increase since 2006. The university believed its package was sufficient and the Duquesne Chief of Police stated that the university would still be ready and capable of handling problems on campus, even with the strike in progress.
The strike ended Tuesday night, following quick negotiations between the Teamsters and Duquesne. The union reported that the two parties had agreed to a three-year contract with the university, with terms amenable to both parties. Little else has come out of the negotiations.

On Sunday, April 23, the home goods retail giant Bed Bath & Beyond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company has been on the decline for months, staving off bankruptcy by raising funds through a series of ambitious stock offerings and by slowing their "cash bleed" by closing stores.
Bed Bath & Beyond is a type of big-box retailer called a "category killer" — these are stores that specialize in a particular type of consumer product, and can operate at a volume and offer many products smaller businesses simply can't compete with — Staples and Best Buy are two other examples. 
However, with the rise of online shopping, the category killers are starting to see their day fade. Radio Shack went from a thriving company based on brick-and-mortar stores to a much smaller, primarily online endeavor after filing for bankruptcy in 2015. Toys"R"Us, though still hanging around as a brand, lost its relevance after closing its final two independent U.S. locations in 2021. With this bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond seems doomed to go the way of these category killers. However, the company has one, very unlikely ally that makes their situation unique.
r/WallStreetBets is a notorious forum on Reddit where users share their investment experiences, often filtered through in-jokes and memes. They were responsible for the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, in which the members of the subreddit utilized their collective power to artificially drive up the price of GameStop, with the intent of forcing short-sellers (investors who bet against the price of a stock) to lose a lot of money. After receiving national attention for this, the fabric of the community changed permanently. With an influx of new members drawn to them via the GameStop squeeze, a number of splinter communities have formed that focus on trying to replicate such high-risk stunts. 
r/BBBY is the gathering place of choice for those who believe that Bed Bath & Beyond will be the subject of the next short squeeze. Much like GameStop, it is a category killer undergoing a long, slow decline at the hands of Amazon and other online retailers. Also like GameStop, it has drawn the attention of a number of short-sellers who seek to profit off its decline. By its nature, short-selling is a highly risky investment, and if a stock's price starts to turn up it can cause a feedback loop that keeps driving it higher and higher.
For months, the users of r/BBBY have been holding onto the hope that the company would soon turn around and that the predatory short-sellers would no longer be in a position to profit from its decline. Upon the news of bankruptcy breaking, one user said "We are either all going down broke or all going to have more money than what to do with, there is no in between."
Users compared the situation to that of the car rental company Hertz, which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 due to pandemic-related financial woes. They were acquired by Knighthead Capital Management, and when the economy began to open, their stock price turned around and shareholders were rewarded with a handsome payout. 
Since 2021, the "memestock" community has become an unignorable group in the financial world. Whether or not they actually possess the capital or coordination to replicate another GameStop squeeze, they are still a large population of investors whose decisions have the potential to affect markets and the sentiments of other investors. In their bankruptcy petition, Bed Bath & Beyond does not cite short-selling as a reason for their closure; however, many on the subreddits believe that predatory short-selling is in fact the primary reason for their decline. It's a place where conspiracy theories often flourish, as people search for explanations as to why the predicted short squeeze hasn't happened yet. 
Bed Bath & Beyond seems to be on death's door. Their website has a banner reading, "We have made the difficult decision to begin winding down our operation," and many stores are advertising their "everything-must-go" sales. But before it goes the way of Radio Shack and Toys"R"Us, there's a large number of unusually devoted investors who may lose a lot of money in the process.

After announcing a settlement with Dominion to the tune of $787 million dollars, Fox News broke the news that they would be parting ways with news anchor and opinionated host, Tucker Carlson. Carlson was one of the most-viewed Fox hosts, drawing in over three million views on average. In his place, Fox has tried to place Brian Kilmeade, though ratings have tumbled as Kilmeade has struggled to break two million views after his first show.
This is a shocking change for one of the largest media companies in the United States, and the end of an era of Fox broadcasts. Out of the big three Fox hosts, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Bill O’Reilly that had defined the company for the last decade and more, only Hannity still has a show. Carlson’s departure has also pushed traffic to other “alternative” news sites, such as Newsmax. Many of Carlson’s viewers don’t seem to want to watch Kilmeade or a Carlson-less Fox News, indicating that perhaps Fox has lost its stranglehold on the right-leaning media landscape. 
However, more news has come out about Carlson’s firing, and it appears in connection to allegations of rampant sexism and harassment allegedly levied by Abby Grossberg, in a lawsuit. Should that be the case, it would appear FOX is currently not in the mood to deal with another round of lawsuits, allegations, or the like, another departure from the decade the company kept Bill O’Reilly after the first allegations surfaced. If Carlson is being forced out because of claims of harassment, FOX might have found him too expensive to try to keep.
The difficulty in reporting on this situation is the lack of updates coming from within the organization itself. The Grossberg accusation is just one, and neither Fox nor Carlson haven’t disclosed anything about the so-called “mutually discussed departure.” It’s hard for outsiders to tell if Carlson was forced out, left to prevent liabilities from the Dominion lawsuit, or simply became too much for Fox executives to deal with in the current climate.
What is known is that Dominion revealed damning information about Carlson and his colleagues and had he gone to testify, much more would have been brought to light. In text messages between Carlson and other Fox hosts, he revealed a hatred for Donald Trump, serious qualms with the path Fox was following for his show and reporting, as well as a slew of disparaging, sexist, and hateful comments.
Carlson did break his silence with a cryptic message in the days after his firing. He mentioned the importance of free speech, and claimed that none of the arguments he’d made, or anyone made on television would matter much in the grand scheme of things. For a man with direct influence on events including the deadly January 6th riots, it seems a little counterfactual.
On the other end of the political spectrum, CNN’s Don Lemon, a moderate news host with his own history of harassing women, was also fired following further disparaging comments made towards colleagues at CNN. Lemon has faced several controversies in the past and recently, his comments about prominent Republican Nicky Haley were enough to remove him from CNN. Reportedly, guests were unwilling to appear with him on air, and as his show was already lagging behind MSNBS’s Morning Joe and Fox network’s Fox and Friends, the network was willing to move on from him. Morning shows rely far more on a "vibe" of happiness and friendliness and most viewers are women. According to CNN, Lemon was making viewers, fellow hosts, and guests so uncomfortable that advertisers were pulling their funds. With all that in mind, CNN did not contact him directly, and removed him from their payroll.

On Thursday, April 27, the 2022-2023 Undergraduate Student Senate met for the last time to give committee reports and vote on their executive committee for the next year. They also heard a Special Allocations request.
The meeting opened with a Special Allocations request from Carnegie Mellon Racing, who requested $7,200 to pay for uprights for the racecar that the organization builds. One of the organization’s sponsors pulled their funding part way through the year, which made the cost unexpected. The funding was passed by the Senate 18-0-3.
The Advocacy Committee, chaired by Jeanie Xu, were the first to give their report. Some of their initiatives this year included working with the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) to increase voter engagement on campus, continuing and closing their mental health overview initiative on campus, and looking into raising awareness of Pennsylvania SNAP benefits for students who are food insecure. 
As part of their future efforts, the Advocacy Committee in collaboration with University Health Services plans to pilot two emergency contraceptives vending machines on campus to make sexual health resources more accessible. They also plan on reaching out to organizations that are underrepresented in Student Government to try and increase representation in the student government process. 
The next committee to present their work was the Business Affairs committee, chaired by Claire Jin. The Business Affairs committee worked to add New York Time Games to students’ current access; however, due to low readership, they will also be canceling the USA Today subscription next year. They also continued their initiative to provide more access to outlets around campus, including outlet stands and more outlets in the rotunda area above Kirr Commons in the Cohon University Center. Some of the ongoing initiatives and discussions within the Business Affairs committee revolves around transportation on campus and working with Carnegie Mellon Dining. 
The third report was from the Campus Life Committee, which was chaired by Victoria Liu. This past year, the committee was responsible for Team Tartan Tailgating during the football season, the Senate Strip Crawl, and running the First Lectures series. They plan to continue these initiatives in the future while also potentially hosting an ice skate night at PPG Place and establishing a partnership with the Carnegie Mellon Police Department.
The next presentation came from the Finance Committee, which was chaired by Kyle Hynes. As of April 27, the combination of all Senate accounts has $422,777.08. The Senate Agency account had $101,887.91, though it is expected to have a deficit of roughly $33,000 by the end of the year due to many expenses not being processed yet. This deficit will come out of the Senate Reserve, which currently has $126,298.73. The third account is the Media Fee account, which currently has $194,371.42. The account collects roughly $69,000 each year in media fees, but only about $37,000 is spent. Hynes said that addressing how to spend the Media Fee account funds should be a priority for next year’s session of the Senate. The last point was in regards to Special Allocations; the budget for Special Allocations was increased to $72,000 in January. The Finance Committee received requests totaling $164,284 for Special Allocations, and a total of $65,678 was approved (40 percent of requests).
The next committee to present was the Governmental Affairs Committee, which was co-chaired by Hynes and Senate President Prithu Pareek. The committee was started in November 2022 to give the Senate a voice in legislative affairs. The committee hosted a series of town halls at Carnegie Mellon, including Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Pittsburgh Councilwoman Erika Strassburger. Five of the committee members also traveled to Washington, DC to advocate for current bills relating to topics such as education policy. The Governmental Affairs Committee was merged into the Advocacy Committee earlier this month, where the work will be carried on.
The Operations Committee, chaired by Saloni Gandhi, presented next. The Operations Committee was responsible for creating Senate merchandise, increasing Senate Week to four days, and increasing Senate Instagram engagement. Moving forward, the committee aims to host Senate Socials, posting Senate Spotlights to the Senate’s social media, and further improving Senate Week. 
The final committee to present was the Academic Affairs Committee, chaired by Mason Xiao. The committee gave out $18,355.16 as part of the OLR/Arts fund, which covers the costs of course materials for students. The committee is also discussing a series of initiatives. The first is regarding course fees — an idea the committee has is to charge students a materials fee for classes that need it, and the unused portion of this is refunded at the end of the semester. The Academic Affairs Committee has also been working with the Calendar Innovation Committee to analyze the effectiveness of the “7-1-7” calendar model that Carnegie Mellon has moved to. They are also looking into what they call “J term,” which would make it so students have January off to work on personal projects and student initiatives.
The final presentation of the 2022-2023 Senate was from Pareek, who gave the State of the Senate presentation. He highlighted many of the overall Senate initiatives from the year. The first was increased communication with constituents, such as emailing the entire undergraduate body, doubling the Senate Instagram following, and commenting on issues relevant to the student body.
The Senate also worked with GSA to help register votes on campus, provided voting resources to students, and put forth a resolution for a Day of Service Holiday on Election Day; next year, students will have most of the election day off in celebration of Democracy Day. Senate also worked with administration on raising the campus minimum wage and restructuring student government, including dissolving the offices of Student Body President and Student Body Vice President. 
Pareek also highlighted many future initiatives for the Senate. These included reforming the Media Fee and how it is spent, better engaging with the undergraduate student body, and focusing more on diversity initiatives within the Senate. 
Following Pareek’s presentation, the 2022-2023 Senate adjourned for the last time and the 2023-2024 Senate convened for the first time. The main focus of this meeting was to elect a new Senate President and executive committee. 
The first election was for Senate President, where two candidates were running: Hynes and Senator Ethan Johnson. After both candidates gave speeches, the Senate voted for Hynes to serve as Senate President.
Following this, the Senate heard speeches from candidates for other executive committee positions and voted for the following candidates: Mahitha Chaturvedula for Operations Chair, Silas Wang for Academic Affairs, Johnson for Advocacy, Jin for Business Affairs, Gloria Lee for Campus Life, and Medha Palavalli for Finance. 
After elections, the Senate adjourned; they will meet again at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year.

In a whole semester of news reporting, it was inevitable that some stories receive updates after their initial publication in The Tartan. To end the year, here's a roundup of updates to some of the hot button stories in previous issues:
Senator John Fetterman back in office
Two weeks ago, Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) has returned to Congress. His return comes two months after he checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to receive treatment for clinical depression.
This return comes at the end of a two-week recess, and Fetterman's return coincided with Senator Mitch McConnell's return after a month of recovery following hospitalization after a fall at a fundraising dinner. 
In statements to reporters, Fetterman commented on how great it was to be back, and stating: "I want everyone to know that depression is treatable, and treatment works. ... This isn’t about politics — right now there are people who are suffering with depression in red counties and blue counties. If you need help, please get help." He expresses extreme gratitude to the "'incredible team'" at Walter Reed, stating that "'the care they provided changed my life.'"
Fetterman's decision to receive treatment was supported throughout Congress, opening up the conversation about mental health on Capitol Hill and in public discourse. 
Fox News vs. Dominion
Dominion Voting System sued Fox Corp for defamation in March of 2021, seeking $1.6 billion. Dominion alleged that Fox News hosts and guests had been falsely claiming that Dominion voting machines had been rigged in the 2020 presidential election in favor of President Biden. Fox’s argument was that they had simply been reporting others’ opinions, and were protected by our nation’s robust libel laws. This is reminiscent of when Tucker Carlson was sued for slander and got off scot-free, with the judge remarking that Carlson “is not 'stating actual facts' about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in 'exaggeration' and 'non-literal commentary'” and that “given Mr. Carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer 'arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism' about the statement he makes." On March 31, 2023 Delaware Superior Court judge Eric M. Davis ordered for a trial. Fox News settled for $787.5 million. In a statement released April 18, they said: “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards (sic). We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” We may have not gotten the soap opera trial that some wanted, but the trial did cause the release of many Fox News figures’ private messages. These revealed that cynical figures like Tucker Carlson do not believe what they peddle. (Carlson on Trump: “I hate him passionately … What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong,” on Sidney Powell’s fraud claims: “Sidney Powell is lying by the way,” and much more), and true believers like Maria Bartiromo (“I want to see massive fraud exposed.”) 
Fox News still has a $2.7 billion lawsuit from Smartmatic USA, another voting system company, who claim that they were irreparably harmed by Fox News’ lies about election fraud. Fox News claimed that Smartmatic was founded by Hugo Chávez (it wasn’t), that they worked with Dominion (they don’t), and that they messed with votes in battleground states (they didn’t).
DeSantis vs. Disney
Ron DeSantis’ war on woke has continued as his campaign prospects falter, now at just 24.9 percent in FiveThirtyEight’s Republican primary polling average. This implies that he would lose unless Trump goes to jail. DeSantis has not yet announced a run for the presidency. Members of even the Florida GOP have endorsed Trump in droves, and at this point, the DeSantis 2024 campaign may be dead in the water. In the meantime, DeSantis has decided to fight the wokest company of all, Disney. Disney World’s position in Florida law is very peculiar, with the park benefiting from many deals from the 60s. DeSantis, who got married at Disney World, now sees them as the woke elite and is determined to make his tussle with them part of his legacy. The Reedy Creek Improvement District was a district that encompassed the Walt Disney World Resort. It gave Disney its own governmental authority for the area, on the level of a county government, without being subject to the constraints of a governmental body. This deal situation lasted for almost 60 years before recently being repealed. Critics of the repeal categorize it as retaliation for Disney’s opposition of the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” Bill. They also believe that this will be detrimental to Florida’s tourism industry, impose billions of dollars in tax burdens on the local government, and may load them with over a billion dollars of debt. Proponents claim that this will be good for Florida, and give more power back to the Florida government. The situation is still in flux and Disney lawyers seem to have at minimum cemented Disney’s exclusive rights to their property, prohibiting the Florida state government from using any pieces of intellectual property owned by the company until 21 years after the death of the last currently living descendent of King Charles II.
The most recent blows traded takes this battle to the federal level. Last week, Disney sued DeSantis in federal court, claiming political motivations and violations of the First Amendment. Such new developments lead to even his fellow conservative politicians doubting whether attacking Disney was the right approach.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
As the semester comes to a close, I wanted to share a little about my favorite books I’ve read since January (some of which I’ve mentioned in previous Novel-teas). I hope that this inspires your summer reading and makes the light at the end of the tunnel that is finals week a bit brighter.
“Breasts and Eggs” by Mieko Kawakami
This is the best book I’ve read this semester and probably my current favorite. “Breasts and Eggs” is a Japanese lit-fic translated by Sam Bett and David Boyd into English. Kawakami’s prose is unmatched, painting a breathtaking portrait of womanhood centered in Japan. It tells the story of Natsu, her older sister, Makiko, and Makiko’s daughter Midoriko as each faces challenges with their identity and establishing their lives. The novel is split into two parts: “Breasts” and “Eggs.” In “Breasts,” Midoriko has stopped speaking to her mother, a silence which causes each of the women to reflect on their fears in their womanhood and identity. “Eggs” takes place a decade later when Natsu struggles with her career and being unmarried and childless. The novel completely reshaped how I think about my own womanhood and the writing was captivating. I seriously encourage everyone to read this.
“Loop” by Brenda Lozano
“Loop” is a Mexican translation published by Charco Press in 2019. It is a fascinating story about a woman waiting in Mexico City for her boyfriend, Jonás, to return from Spain. The novel serves as a diary of sorts for the narrator where she explores everything from dwarfs to swallows to friendship to the art of writing itself. She treats writing as a coping mechanism and likens herself to Penelope from “The Odyssey.” She explores what it means to wait, love, and to think. Lozano writes in a stream of consciousness style, but her words are more intentional than you can ever imagine. 
"The Twilight Zone” by Nona Fernández
Another Spanish translation, Fernández’s “The Twilight Zone” provides enrapturing insight into Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship. Taking a fictionalized account of the true story of Andrés Valenzuela, Fernández’s terrifying and innovative novel explores the nooks and crannies of trauma and how a society tries to recover. The narrator is a child when she sees a magazine with the headline “I Tortured People.” A member of Pinochet’s secret police had walked into a dissident journal’s office and testified to the horrors he had committed. The narrator explores these terrifying horrors through a comparison to the television show “The Twilight Zone.” She explores how that period in history was so confusing, so painful, that it could be compared to the portals of the “The Twilight Zone.” It is an incredible novel about traumatic legacy and what it means to remember. 
“Interior Chinatown” by Charles Yu
“Interior Chinatown” is not what you expect. An exploration into race and the roles we are forced to play, Charles Yu writes in the style of a script where every character plays a role. The novel stars Willis Wu who “doesn’t perceive himself as the protagonist in his own life”. Willis is simply “Generic Asian Man” until he gets the chance to attain the most prestigious role in Chinatown, “Kung Fu Guy.” Playing with reality and fiction, “Interior Chinatown” is a biting, devastating, engrossing novel about stereotypes and what it means to push back.

Sudan’s been on fire recently — a situation which has never been too stable has now become even less stable. Following the “please-don’t-call-it-a-coup” coup against President al-Bashir, led mostly by young protesters (who were not the greatest fans of his track record of war, oppression, genocide, and murdering his own civilians), Sudan had a sort of “government” held between the military (responsible for said warn, genocide, and oppression) and a totally stable civilian government led by President al-Burhan.
Whoops, all dictators! So now, the egos of President al-Burhan and Mohamed Dagalo, leader of the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF), are in conflict, and the only thing they know how to do is more war. I'll spare most of the details, since I already covered this in-depth last week if you want to learn more.
Side note: There’s something very interesting about African militaries and their reliance on bush infantry (light infantry and motorized brigades), paramilitaries (light infantry and motorized brigades) and paratroopers (light infantry, questionably motorized brigades). Until the late 90s, Zimbabwe was a military powerhouse, having one of the largest reserves of mechanized forces in the region. With tanks, planes, and other vehicles that would make a small Eastern European country blush, a lot of people predicted that Zimbabwe would be a major player in Africa for years to come — something that was shattered almost immediately by war with Rwanda. The problem is that very few African countries have the industrial base to build a consistent stream of tanks, something the U.S. and (allegedly) Russia do have. 
This means most African countries usually rely on light infantry to do the damage. Mechanized forces won’t have the punch necessary to stick around for too long, and once the tanks dry up, the bush soldiers can come back in. It also makes African militaries rely heavily on paratroopers and paramilitaries, because they’re easy to create, easy to fund, and easy to arm. They’re also fiercely loyal (to each other, at least), since the sort of training/experiences going into being a special forces or paramilitary soldier can engender a lot of community. It can be significantly problematic though, as former president al-Bashir found out when the close knit RSF he built (partially to keep the official military off his back) betrayed him.
It’s a tragedy of the Sudanese people, one which you should care about because any war in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region could kick off a region-wide disaster. It doesn’t help that this conflict has all the makings of an intervention. Firstly, Egypt and Ethiopia are at odds over rights to water, and Ethiopia is busy making a dam to gain more power. They’re both regional heavyweights, and Egypt relies on Sudan for food and water. They also, really, really like al-Burhan and the military, and if Sudan is in crisis, Egypt may not be able to feed its population of millions.
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates are on their own happy little diplomatic mission, looking to support their allies in the RSF. This puts two powerhouses — one in North Africa, facing its own internal conflicts, and one in the Middle East, looking to make power plays in the region — at odds, something that is the worst possible idea to ever have been devised by Middle Eastern politicians since the last time they tried to invade Israel.
And again, the people who are suffering from this egotistical conflict are the Sudanese people, people who have been subjected to years upon years of harsh violence and poverty. Thousands are fleeing into neighboring countries — another sign of possible danger down the road — and those who can’t flee are stuck in an incredibly dangerous area.
Oh, but it gets worse. So, so much worse. Prison breaks have happened — the prisons holding those responsible for al-Bashir’s reign of terror. Warring parties now hold various biological laboratories. There are risks of incredibly dangerous diseases being released in a part of the world where there is no easy way to start containment. 70 percent of the hospitals don’t work, so diseases that escape certainly won’t get caught for a while, but even more importantly, people don’t have access to food and medicine. It’s a nightmare scenario, and one that needs to be solved.
Egypt and South Sudan keep offering to mediate, but the RSF doesn’t like Egypt and South Sudan has its own problems that prevent it from being really all that effective. Russia, as usual, is trying to flex back into North Africa by getting Wagner to liaison with the RSF, and the US is trying to figure out how to fix this (spoiler: they don’t know either).
The situation isn’t good. It doesn't seem to be getting better, and with neither party willing to agree to terms of a ceasefire, the conflict in Sudan may get a lot worse before it gets any better.

Twitter woke up to an absolute shock when on Monday, April 24, Fox News announced out of nowhere that they were dropping Tucker Carlson from their platform — the bootlicker gets the boot, the irony brings a tear to my eye. We don’t mean to come off as angry leftists who just fill in blanks with random words (call that mad libs), but it’s not my fault the bipartisan divide can’t hide the fact Tucker is a total dick. Honestly though, that’s why the decision surprises me. He was undoubtedly Fox News’ most popular figurehead and I mean, he sure was perfect for the job. He’s a middle aged white guy with a haircut fresh off ChatGPT who can read right-wing talking points angrily enough to activate Fox's audience. Despite this though, out of all the absurdly famous right-wing voices that you know about whether or not you actually want to, Tucker’s the one that makes the least sense. 
Andrew Tate fancies himself as the voice of “strong” young men who simply miss the good ol’ days where women couldn’t buy the same color Bugatti as him. Tucker Carlson’s built like the Pillsbury Dough Boy’s midlife crisis, he can’t perpetuate toxic masculinity if he tried, so it begs the question, who in the misogynistic crowd is aspiring to be Tucker Carlson? Was the meltdown over an insufficiently sexy M&M supposed to lecture us on what “real men” look like? Ben Shapiro can at least say enough words per minute to convince the average half-asleep debater he’s a genius, but Tucker straight up snatches the Diar DeRozan playbook and screams until his opponent loses their faith in humanity. God forbid they call him out because if they do, Tucker can rely on ol’ faithful and smugly say, “So much for the tolerant left amirite?” I almost have to respect it. He realizes his incompetence, so his style of “debate” is just to make any left winger look a dumbass for even talking to him (and I mean, he’s right. If you choose to interact with Tucker Carlson, you are indeed a dumbass).
There is still no official reason why Fox News decided now was the time they needed to do away with Tucker. It's believed that Fox let go of Carlson on the personal order of Rupert Murdoch, possibly due to misogynistic comments he made about a female executive. FOX News thrives off of shocking statements, so for all I know, him saying “President Joe Biden” instead of Sleepy Joe may have been their last straw. Of course, it absolutely has to do with the 750 million dollar defamation lawsuit FOX News just lost and refuses to elaborate on, but is cutting Tucker supposed to be their method of saving face? The network has never truly cared about providing accurate information, and Tucker Carlson was their most popular “entertainer." If you’re going to gut your platform without having any change of heart, you might as well keep scumbags your audience actually liked. All they’re left with now is a Legion-of-Doom boardroom full of out-of-touch wannabe politicians who get to regurgitate the same tired right-wing talking points with nowhere near the same level of pissy conviction that made Tucker a notable name in every party.
That’s the thing about this whole goddamn situation, huh? Carlson made so much money for the entirety of Fox News it's hard to imagine the smarmy git gone. He’s the biggest TV personality in these states he's tried so hard to disunite, and the only thing that could deplatform him was a 750 MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT. That’s just pathetic for Fox, but what else can we say of an organization that spent years covering up Bill O’Reilly’s actions?
What’s this mean for Fox? Well, those folks lost 50 percent of their viewership in the Carlson slot. 50 percent. Their ratings have pretty much cratered. They had one cash cow, and they milked it or every drop of rotten-ass milk, and now all they’ve got is Sean Hannity.
This ain’t the end for the Network, not a chance in hell, but it’s sure a new era. The core that built the empire, from O’Reilly to Carlson is gutted, and the actual news anchors — they call it Fox News after all — have left. Krauthammer died, and Wallace walked to CNN.
Speaking of CNN, they notified their own notorious woman-respecter Don Lemon that he would have to find a new place to respect women, after realizing that it might not behoove the media giant to have yet another misogynist on the squad. Lemon was already known for sending threats to a coworker who’d gotten an assignment in Iraq (making him and George Bush the only people eager to go there). After realizing that Don “The Damsel Destroyer” Lemon didn’t seem to work well with women, they didn’t let him work with one on staff until his most recent assignment.
Lemon then followed that up by complaining that there wasn’t enough of a wage gap between the US Men’s and Women’s Soccer teams. This made a lot of sense at the time, as the Men’s team was working hard on losing, while the Women hadn’t won a title since... the last tournament. After that, Lemon made some very biologically inaccurate statements about how women work— according to the Lemon, they’re only “in their prime” from the ages of 20 to 40. Apparently, they have expiration dates now— someone better tell science.
Either way, there’ve been some high profile firings in the media world now.

Last week, President Biden announced that a Biden-Harris re-election bid will be on the 2024 presidential ballot, when he will be at the age of 82 years young. Currently the oldest man to ever be president, Joe Biden will be 86 by the end of his second term if he wins re-election. However, many nay-sayers today criticize him on a number of issues and find him unfit to be president for another four years after 2024. Everyday the American people seem to grow more circumspect of Biden, in particular regarding his age, cognitive ability, and decisions in office. All things considered, if Biden is the best candidate that the Democratic Party has for 2024, they might be in serious trouble.
One particularly loud criticism we hear against Biden is the speculation that he might be suffering cognitive decline. NBC News recently released a poll on what voters think about Biden's reelection; it found that 70 percent of voters — including 51 percent of Democrats — believe that Biden should not run for a second term. 48 percent of them say his age is a “major” reason for that, while 21 percent say it’s “minor.” It doesn’t seem to be politically-charged hearsay that Biden is too old for the position. Anecdotally, from my conversations with people across the political spectrum, my impression is that many people believe we can do better than an old man with a habit for muttering at speeches.
Biden’s speculated decline in mental awareness has garnered comparisons to other presidents who’ve suffered from mental decline. Ronald Reagan was the subject of similar discussions and speculations during his later years as president. Such speculations were validated when in 1994, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Another example is Woodrow Wilson, who late into his presidency suffered a major ischemic stroke in 1919, causing him to effectively be a husk that his wife Edith Wilson moved to run the country. One can find a number of other examples of politicians who have suffered decline in office. Americans found it to be such an issue that in 1967, the 25th amendment was passed in case a president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” 
There is a question of whether such an amendment will ever be used against our current president. In the same way that those presidents had their speculations, President Biden has his. As a matter of fact, speculations against Biden have gotten so common that upon typing “senile” into Google Images, he is one of the first images to show up. It is these speculations which have brought people to demand that Biden not run. Of course, many of these demands against Biden come from a place of political bias. For example, candidate Nikki Haley (R-SC) called for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75, clearly targeting Biden and former president Trump, the latter of whom will be 78 in 2024. But such a sentiment is not uncommon among many voters. To them, it is clear that neither Biden nor Trump should be the decision makers for the American people; rather, new blood in the White House is not only preferred but necessary.
Other issues that people see with Biden are concerning his decisions he’s made as president so far. Approval ratings for the president have not been above 50 percent since August of 2021, the month in which U.S. troops fully withdrew from Afghanistan. Inflation has been a hot button issue for many people since he’s taken office leading to disapproval from all sides. The war in Ukraine, tensions with China, border security, and crime rates are all issues that many voters are condemning Biden for not handling well.
The issue with the Democratic Party come 2024 will be rounding up independents to vote for Biden. Though not as vocal as the parties, independents make up the majority of the votes in the country. If they are not appeased, as they are not now, Democrats will have a rough campaign going into 2024. If electing Biden was a referendum on Trump, we will likely see the pendulum swing the other way — and if the Democrats aren’t ready, Biden may end up being another one-term president.

Before the Sept. 2022 shooting at Kennywood Amusement Park in West Mifflin, park attendees were required to pass through metal detectors and open their bags for inspection by park security. I watched this system of security develop over childhood summers spent going to Kennywood — it used to be that you could just walk in with a short nod at a cop who was pacing between ticket booths.
Now, as the park opens for the 2023 summer season, there is a heavier focus on security measures to prevent more violence. Most of the changes are reflected simply in an increased presence of security personnel at the park, but a few other things are being done, like taking down trees that block sight from the park to the road and decreasing the number and size of bags that are allowed in. Response protocols have been improved to avoid the chaotic and harmful mass exodus that occurred during the shooting.
An altercation between two young teenagers escalated to shooting in which two 15-year olds and a 39-year old were wounded. The obvious changes that could be made include checking that weapons aren’t being brought into the park and requiring that minors be accompanied by adults. The thing is that Kennywood was already doing both of those things when the shooting happened. The gun was purportedly slipped through a gate at the periphery of the park, which arguably should have been secured. But to what extent can we hold Kennywood security accountable for what happened?
What comes to mind for me when I think about this is the time that two people were shot by a 17-year old in the Monroeville Mall Macy’s in 2015. Or when a 20-year old was killed at the same mall in 2020, after a policy was implemented that required minors to be accompanied later in the day.
Police have attributed the altercation that led to the shooting to a “feud” happening among teenagers in the Mon Valley, which is south of West Mifflin. The “feud” is actually a string of 55 shootings (yes, 55) occurring in Duquesne, Homewood, and the Mon Valley over three or four months after an initial shooting at a graduation party on June 1, 2022. In one of these instances, a 14-year old was killed. If the gun violence issue among young people in these communities is so large that the Pittsburgh police or community justice organizations failed to solve it after 55 instances in three months, how was Kennywood security going to solve it?
When I was first talking about writing this article, I nearly decided not to write it, because I thought I would just end up saying what I’ve said in Forum a million times before. Yes, of course the shooting at Kennywood was terrible and tragic and had real impacts on real people, but please don’t be surprised or cut funding for trips there because you are under the impression that the entire rest of Pittsburgh is the same crime-free utopia that we live in at CMU. There are very very few neighborhoods in Pittsburgh that are even remotely similar to North Oakland/Squirrel Hill North, and very very many neighborhoods struggle every single day with gun violence. Instead of isolating yourself from these incidents because they do not conform with your unrepresentative idea of what Pittsburgh is, get involved and learn about what is actually happening. Go visit Kennywood, and its home in West Mifflin. Did you know that there’s a high school right behind Kennywood? And a Giant Eagle where people get their groceries every day? Learn about how gun violence is impacting residents and how you can get involved in local activism instead of avoidance.

I can’t count on one hand how many people told me that freshman year would be the “best year of my life,” but boy were they wrong. I came to Pittsburgh from southern California, about 2,500 miles away. Having never been away from my family (besides the casual sleep away camp), college was something new and terrifying. I knew that I would be homesick, but I wasn’t prepared for the level of homesickness that I would feel. 
Adding to that, I was under the impression that freshman orientation would get me used to how Carnegie Mellon works. I thought that I would learn where the dining areas were, how to use my meal plan, maybe even where some of my classes were located. I can safely say that I knew none of that upon the end of orientation. The first time I used my dining plan, I ended up paying $2 of my own money because I didn’t know how DineX worked. I also got so lost on my first day of classes that I had to ask a stranger for directions, and I went to a class that I wasn’t actually taking until the second mini of the semester. So sure, maybe I got a really nice lecture on mental health and learned some cool chants to brag about Stever’s AC (even though they turn it off in September), but I had no idea how to actually get around Pittsburgh or our own campus. 
My first day of classes was really rough. I came to this school as a Guitar major, but after that first day I knew that the music program wasn't the right choice for me (in fact, on the second day of class I was already speaking with my advisor about changing my major to Film & Visual Media). It was so lonely and isolating that I found myself having to call my mom after I had to sing in front of my entire Solfege class. Combine being new, homesick, confused and sleep deprived, and you have the recipe for disaster. I didn’t yet have any friends or a support system of any kind. I didn't make strong connections with the people on my floor, everyone I had ever known was 2,500 miles away. It was really hard. When fall break came around I was relieved to be able to escape from a place where I felt like such an outsider. 
I held on to the belief that after a while, I would find a support network and some sort of community. While this did eventually happen, it took much longer than I ever expected. I joined clubs and played in the pit orchestra for Scotch'n'Soda, but it still never felt like I belonged to a community.
Upperclassmen and adults had also told me that I would make most of my friends during orientation. When I made zero friends during orientation, I got really scared that I would never find a group of friends. While I eventually did, the stress of feeling like I had to make lifelong friends during one week of meetings and games gave me so much anxiety. 
Speaking of anxiety, I had to go on anxiety medication for the first time in my entire life. In fact, I didn’t even realize I had anxiety until I began having daily panic attacks. I honestly feel like the one thing that kept me from leaving school altogether was the Introduction to Film Studies class. I needed to take it to change my major, and although I enrolled two weeks after the semester began, it quickly became my favorite class and the only thing that got me through the day. 
I’ve spoken to other freshmen, and a lot of them feel the same way. They feel like orientation didn't prepare them to find their classes, use their meal plan and utilize campus transportation. 
Although freshman year has been incredibly difficult, I was eventually able to find a group of friends that I feel like I can rely on. I was also able to change my major to something that I enjoy infinitely more; I’m having fun playing guitar again and I felt my confidence and independence grow significantly. 
So even though my freshman year was probably the most difficult year of my life, I was able to figure things out eventually — it really did just take time. I thought it would only take a few months, but it took eight, and that’s okay. I found my footing eventually and I hope that future freshman classes don’t put too much pressure on themselves to immediately make friends and find community. I wish people had given me a more reasonable expectation for college rather than the excessively optimistic view that it would be “the best year of my life.”  It’s perfectly normal if it takes longer than a week to meet your people and feel like you belong, and it's okay if it doesn't always feel like the best time of your life.

I’ve been at The Tartan for five years, during which I've been a Staffwriter, Online Editor, and Publisher. I'm the last remaining staff member who remembers the organization before the pandemic. I thought long and hard about what I wanted my last piece, my swan song, to be about. Should I write all the things I wish I'd known when I first came into Carnegie Mellon? Or should I write about my journey at The Tartan? It’s difficult to condense five years of memories, thoughts and emotions for this piece. 
I went to an all-staff meeting with my friend on day one of freshman year, despite having no prior intention to do so. I wasn’t sure that my thoughts were all that special, much less something anybody would want to read. What I saw that day was a group of young people, many non-STEM majors, sincerely dedicated to their craft and enthusiastic about highlighting issues on campus that probably wouldn’t have otherwise entered public conversation. I enjoyed the camaraderie, but more the sense of working for a large purpose. My friend didn't join, but I did.
The first pieces I wrote were not my best. I was green, my writing amateurish, unformed and hopeless without editorial intervention — or so it seems in retrospect. If there is one thing that anyone needs to know about the Tartan staff, it’s that even in a school full of chronic over-workers, the editors here are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet. I still remember the Forum editor Madeline Kim going over my hastily submitted draft and trying to get it to follow The Tartan’s style and working on the layout, the copy editor Wilson Ekern poring over printouts, the Editor-in-Chief Valene Mezmin handing out awards to staff writers for each week’s issues. Production Sundays were 12-15 hour long marathons, and it was a rare Sunday when an Editor-in-Chief left the office before midnight. That is still somewhat the case to this day. 
I loved being in The Tartan — I knew the happenings on campus, the administrative hoopla, the weird (for the lack of a better word)  political matters in student government, among other assorted gossip. Even more, I enjoyed writing about it. Practice may not have made my writing perfect, but it did make it eminently readable (to my standards at least.) The messages of encouragement I received every Monday when a new issue carrying my piece came out were the most incredible salve to my sense of self-worth that was being bruised in my CS/ECE classes. Not everybody agreed, however. One of my first news pieces was about students’ reactions to a formerly-prominent administrator's departure from a Trump-era governmental department and subsequent return to their position in CMU. It received much blowback from the subject of the piece who angrily called up my then-Editor and in so many words characterized my work as garbage. Perhaps it’s a sign of how young and naïve I was that it came as a rude shock and I didn't  — couldn’t — write anything meaningful for the rest of the semester. I still stand by my reporting, and am very grateful to my Editor Adam Tunnard who did his best in shielding me from the brunt of the subject’s disapproval. Sometimes I want to go back and give my sophomore year-self a hug. I don’t know if that would have helped and prevented the subsequent burnout that followed. 
By the time the pandemic hit, I was the Online Editor, handling all the social media handles by myself, writing captions, creating graphics, scheduling posts. We went remote in March 2020, opened a new Substack newsletter, and moved all of our publishing online — that meant it all depended on me to publish our work to social media. Our follower count increased rapidly and engagement was at an all-time high. We also decided to publish through the summer. Working for The Tartan during the pandemic was a strange and isolating experience — everything was on Zoom and I felt detached from the campus community. In the few weeks of the spring 2020 semester before we went online, I had cajoled a bunch of staff members into making a TikTok video. Going back to see the video now, I feel a tinge of regret for all the lost time we could have spent together. In the meanwhile, the burnout had turned into a flameout — I only wrote one piece in all of 2020. 
When we returned to print publishing in Fall 2021, I was the new Publisher. I still hadn’t written a piece in a year, and I certainly did not know how to solicit advertisers. It was completely new territory — learning to make a budget for the organization, sticking to that budget, earning revenue. Almost all of the editorial team had graduated by then leaving me, then Editor-in-Chief Frank Hu, and the former Publisher Sujay Utkarsh as the only ones who knew what The Tartan in print was like. The loss of institutional knowledge was a looming prospect, as Frank and I were both Seniors and Sujay was a Master’s student by then. Thankfully, the influx of new students, including the now Editor-in-Chief Cole Skuse, who were enthusiastic about student journalism, saved the organization. The scrappy determination with which The Tartan newsroom is run is truly a thing to behold. 
Every year, the Tartan recruits young, bright-eyed students, at least half of whom end up leaving due to burnout. Until last year, the editors at The Tartan worked upwards of 12 hours a week for no pay. Any staff writer submitting a piece works for about 3-6 hours at a minimum — for no pay. Our budget, as allocated by the JFC, ended up with a reduced honorarium amount than the one we asked for. So since last year, we began padding the insultingly small amount awarded to us with the leftover revenue we earn from advertisements to give a small monetary award to our editors. Journalism is a thankless job even on a student level — I suppose if it was not, its true purpose would be defeated. But the realization that editors and creatives are underpaid on all levels of a public duty as crucial as journalism is disillusioning. My sincere hope is that future Publishers will find better ways to monetarily compensate the staff for their work. 
Throughout this time, I struggled with burnout, writing far fewer pieces than I would have liked to. I wrote some pieces that I am proud of now, and was able to deal with pushback much more effectively than I could as a hapless sophomore. But I was still attending fewer productions and struggling in classes. The isolation during the pandemic and multiple subsequent illnesses made the burnout worse. My grades on SIO now show all kinds of letters. I wish I had known how to pace myself and seek help when I needed it. I wish I had known how and where to seek help from. I wish CaPS had been able to help me all the times I had called them in 2020 (they apparently couldn’t because I was out-of-state). Starting therapy, support from friends and family, and learning to create a semblance of work-life balance helped with healing from the burnout. Despite the regrets, I am not ashamed of this period of my life; I learned the important lesson of advocating for myself. If there is one piece of advice I will give — as much as I assiduously avoided doing so throughout this piece — it's that you have to learn to advocate for yourself. You cannot rely on a figure of authority to bat for you or come to your aid. You have to learn to ask and push for your needs from the institution. 
Far too many times I have seen young, bright and ambitious students struggle with their mental health or other challenges, who do not know how to access resources that can and should help them. Far too many times, overburdened academic advisors do not provide the support that students need. Ultimately, there is no student at Carnegie Mellon who is not intelligent, who does not have the capacity for innovation or causing social change, who does not have the potential to change the world we live in for the better.
While I hold a cherished place in my heart for my time at The Tartan, I am also aware of how the pace and structure of its operations contribute to the systemic issue that is Carnegie Mellon's over-work culture. It’s a tragedy that so many who walk into our office with enthusiasm end up having to leave the organization at some point in the semester due to exhaustion. Across the campus community, there is much work to be done to address the issue of paying better wages to workers. I leave the Tartan, and Carnegie Mellon, with a mix of bittersweet emotions — a complex interplay of regret, nostalgia, longing, and hope. The dominant emotion being hope — for myself and the future that lies ahead for me, and for all the brilliant, wonderful people I am leaving behind here. I will have left the institution, but the steps to progress will not stop.
