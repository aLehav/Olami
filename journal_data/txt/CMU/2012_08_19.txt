Senior running back Patrick Blanks, one of the four captains of Carnegie Mellon’s football team, looks forward to his last season. 
Blanks studies business administration in the Tepper School of Business, with a concentration in finance.
“I would enjoy an opportunity to work in the financial services industry immediately following graduation, but I have higher aspirations to start my own business someday,” he said.
Blanks started playing football at seven years old and played throughout high school, until some complications arose.
“I was seriously injured during my senior year of high school. This injury required intensive rehabilitation that sat me out for two years,” Blanks explained.
“I was extremely proud when I finally earned my first collegiate carry against Washington University half of the way into my freshman season. I was able to recover from a serious setback and focus on higher goals.”
With such a large team, there is no shortage of laughs in the locker room. Blanks’ funniest moment occurred during his sophomore year.
“We were watching film of a game against Wittenberg,” Blanks recalled. “The play was on the goal line going in to score. I got the ball on a sweep to the left, but I chose to reverse the field to the right. Just as I was about to score over the right pylon, a Wittenberg defender came out of nowhere and launched me into the air out of bounds. Everyone laughed as the offensive coordinator replayed the segment several times.”
In college, he has found his perseverance through the years rewarding.
“I have the rare opportunity to play a sport that I love on a highly competitive stage, while earning one of the best degrees in the nation,” he said. “The professors and coaches at CMU expect the best on both fronts, and you cannot have athletic success without classroom success; at CMU they go hand in hand.”
Since completing preseason training, Blanks has some goals in mind for the upcoming season.
“The other three captains and myself understand that this team has the talent to be successful and it is our goal to turn all of the talent into wins on the field,” he said.
Having three years of college under his belt, Blanks has some advice to offer to the incoming class.
“College is the bridge between childhood and adulthood — you should be learning all you can and stretching yourself to your limits,” he said. “Try new things so you can understand the type of person you want to be.”

To the surprise of very few, the U.S. had the most fruitful Olympic scores of participating nations, finishing with a whopping 104 medals and bringing home a total of 46 gold medals.
The 2012 Olympic games saw the U.S. bounce back from its 2008 gold medal count of 36, second to China’s 51. 
Although the U.S. won the total medal count in Beijing, winning both the gold count and total count was a nice improvement from four years ago.
Although the U.S. was successful in this year’s Olympics, there were a few disappointing performances for the red, white, and blue.
In men’s beach volleyball, Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhauser — the reigning gold medalists from the Beijing Olympics — looked poised to bring back another gold for America. But in an early round, they were beaten in straight sets (21—17 and 21—19) by Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo of Italy. 
Rogers said before the match that he was playing on a sore hamstring, and it showed. He only registered 11 of his 29 swings as kills and recorded just 13 digs in the two matches. 
Dalhauser’s performance was subpar as well, with just 10 kills and one block — low numbers for arguably the best player in men’s beach volleyball.
The other American team, Jacob Gibb and Sam Rosenthal, made it to the quarterfinals before losing 2-1 to the bronze-winning Latvian team of Martins Plavins and Janis Smedins.
The U.S. also couldn’t live up to its expectations in men’s gymnastics. Previously considered one of the best, the American team failed to grab a medal while the Chinese team dominated the events. “There’s definitely a disappointment,” U.S. captain Jonathan Horton said, as reported by the Associated Press. “We’re one of the best teams in the world.”
After finishing seventh on pommel horse, the men’s team was bumped down to last place. However, their excellent performance on the rings put them back into medal contention. Unfortunately, John Orozco’s fall on the vault did the Americans in.
“I fell on my butt,” Orozco told the Associated Press.
Despite the handful of disappointing performances by U.S. athletes, Americans were overwhelmingly successful in a majority of the other Olympic events.
The U.S. team dominated Olympic basketball, going 8–0 and winning by an average of 32 points per game. The team met Spain in the gold medal match, just as it did in the 2008 Olympics.
This was an aggressive game, but the U.S. managed to pull away and win 107–100. This marks the last Olympic game for superstar Kobe Bryant and head coach Mike Krzyzewski. “Can’t believe the games are over, seems like yesterday we were walking into the stadium with nerves of excitement and dreams of Gold,” Bryant told the Associated Press.
In women’s beach volleyball, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings took their third consecutive gold, after winning in 2004 and 2008, setting an Olympic record. In the gold medal match, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings beat the other American team, April Ross and Jennifer Kessy, in straight sets, winning 21–16 in both.
It did not come as a surprise when the U.S. team dominated the pools, winning 16 golds in swimming and 31 total swimming medals. Competing in a total of 24 events, Michael Phelps won four gold and two silver medals in this year’s Olympic games, setting Olympic records and bringing his career medal count to 22 and gold medal count to 18.
At the young age of 17, American swimmer Missy Franklin led the women in medals with five total — four gold and one bronze. “I can’t believe you just did that!” Phelps told Franklin after she scored gold just 15 minutes after qualifying for the 200-meter freestyle final.
The 2016 Summer Olympics will held be in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and with the abundance of young athletes like Franklin and men’s swimmer Ryan Lochte, as well as a cluster of young basketball talent, the U.S. is poised to dominate the field once again.

Carnegie Mellon senior systems scientist Shawn Kelly is developing a retinal prosthesis capable of restoring vision to those with degenerative eye diseases. He was recently awarded a four-year, $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to continue his research.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 21 million Americans suffer from functional vision problems or eye diseases that may lead to loss of vision. 
The CDC also reported that Americans are more likely to experience vision loss due to age-related eye diseases, such as glaucoma, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the breakdown of the macula tissue near the retina that allows a person to see fine details clearly. Left untreated, AMD can lead to permanent blindness.
Kelly’s device is designed specifically to combat AMD; his team works to help victims of the disease see again.
“My tools are designed to help individuals struggling with blindness, and to ultimately help injured veterans with head and eye wounds recover some peripheral vision,” said Kelly, who worked at Boston Veterans Hospital before coming to Carnegie Mellon last year.
“A device like this will not easily work on someone who has been blind since birth and hasn’t created the visual connections in the brain,” Kelly warned. But he did affirm that “it will work on someone whose degenerative disease has left them completely blind later in life.”
The 15 micrometer-thick prosthesis is surgically inserted through a small incision near the back of the eye, and is held in place by the retina. Its communication coil — which allows the chip to “talk” to external devices — is attached to the sclera, or the white of the eye.
“We don’t expect significant discomfort,” Kelly said of the seemingly intrusive implant. “Other ophthalmic devices sit in this area, including scleral buckles to repair retinal detachments, and some glaucoma pressure valves.”
After surgery, a patient would wear a pair of eyeglasses with a camera fitted into its frame. The camera connects to a portable image processor, which wirelessly transfers a compressed version of the captured image data to the implanted device. The prosthesis then sends stimulating signals to the appropriate retinal nerves, creating a pixelated form of the original image. 
The entire process comes together to form a version of the macula cells responsible for high-resolution vision that are destroyed by AMD.
Kelly recalled his success in the early phases of his research where blind volunteers tested a prototype of the device.
“We delivered stimulating currents to the retina and asked what the volunteer saw,” Kelly said. “They reported seeing spots and lines, which was the proof of concept that we needed to begin developing a chronically implantable device.”
Many technical challenges stood in the way of that development, including the device’s low power draw and the logistics of wireless data and power transfer. But the most difficult part of the project for Kelly and his team has been the chip’s packaging.
“Creating an airtight package that is small enough to fit on the side of the eye but has enough connections to create an image with a few hundred pixels is pushing the edge of existing technology,” he said.
Kelly, who began this project as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has developed four different prototypes of the device in his 16 years of research. He and his colleagues are working on a fifth and final prototype of the prosthesis, with clinical trials expected to begin in about two years.
“We expect the device to be available for sale on the market in about five years,” he said.

Nearly half of all car accidents occur at night despite fewer drivers on the road, according to the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration. Rain and snow only make matters worse, further reducing visibility. However, a team of Carnegie Mellon researchers are developing a way around this problem: smart headlights.
A vehicle’s headlights illuminate everything in front of the car. This means that when it’s raining or snowing, the headlights illuminate raindrops or snowflakes, which distort the light and prevent drivers from seeing objects as easily.
The researchers, led by associate professor Srinivasa Narasimhan of the Robotics Institute, solved this problem by streaming light between raindrops so it’s not reflected back toward the driver. Instead of using a bulb as a headlight, the researchers used a projector, which controls the pixels.
“If the particles are not hit by the projector light, the driver will not see them,” Narasimhan said. 
The smart headlights have a camera that captures images illuminated by the light source, showing where the raindrops are. This information is transmitted to a computer, which figures out where the raindrops will be in the next few milliseconds by looking at their velocity and direction. The findings are then fed back to the headlights, which switch off light rays at those predicted locations.
Narasimhan’s team tested the headlights by writing a computer system that simulated all kinds of rain and snow conditions. After doing a feasibility study, the researchers built a real system in a laboratory. They used valves to generate real rain conditions, ranging from a drizzle to a downpour.
The project started about two years ago, and Narasimhan said that it may take another two or three years to test the system and make sure that it works for cars traveling at high speeds. Companies in the automotive industry have expressed interest in commercializing this product, Narasimhan said.
Currently, the smart headlights work for a car moving at around 20 miles per hour. In order to test the system on a faster moving car, there needs to be a significant improvement in the efficiency of data transfer between all of the headlight system’s components.
“For that, we are trying to build a completely embedded system,” Narasimhan said. 
The bottleneck of the current system comes from the time it takes for an image to be transferred among the camera, computer, and projector — a transfer delay of eight milliseconds. Narasimhan explained that the team wants to put the camera and the processing on the same computing board with the projector directly connected.
“A couple of years ago, when we started this project, we thought it was going to be very hard,” Narasimhan said. Before the development of the current system, the team decided to start with an easier project, building a multi-dimensional display that simulated water drops falling through the air. 
The prototype system had up to four layers, with each layer consisting of a row of fifty drops. The researchers knew exactly where the water drops were because they controlled them, which created a much simpler scenario than reality. Once the computational requirements became clear with the prototype system, the team was ready to use the smart headlight system to tackle the challenges associated with real, non-simulated rain drops.

While child rearing usually leads to sleepless nights, parent-teacher conferences, and countless trips to the hospital, a recent study suggests that being a parent may make you healthier. And while many of the students on campus might not personally know the joy of having children, this research could uncover which positive behaviors arise from parenthood.
The research, conducted by professor Sheldon Cohen and graduate student Rodlescia Sneed in Carnegie Mellon’s psychology department — along with colleagues from the University of Virginia and the University of Pittsburgh — was recently published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.
Sneed and Cohen have long been interested in the connections between social relationships and physical health, so the team decided to cover a relationship that had not received much exposure: parenthood.
“We found that parenthood had not been well studied, despite the fact that it is a common social role for many people,” Sneed said.
The study was designed to use data from previous studies to analyze a relationship between wellness and parenthood. Cohen and Sneed had two different hypotheses.
“On one hand, we thought that parenthood would be good for health because people who had children would have a more positive outlook on life,” Sneed explained. “On the other hand, we thought that parenthood could be bad for health because of the stress associated with child rearing.”
In the prior studies, over 800 healthy participants were inoculated with either a rhinovirus or influenza strain. Throughout an either five- or six-day assessment, the participants were quarantined and monitored for nasal congestion and other symptoms of upper respiratory illness.
The researchers discovered that parents with one or two children were 41 percent less likely to get ill than their childless peers, while parents with three or more children were more than 60 percent less likely to develop cold symptoms. Parents who were younger than 22, however, seemed to receive no health benefit. 
The researchers accounted for factors such as race, age, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, obesity, marital status, and prior viral exposure. It is important to note that previous exposure to viral infections was not responsible for the difference between parents and non-parents, indicating not a biological cause but a psychological one. 
As the researchers explore a new avenue of public health, the studies are creating more questions than answers.
“Do people who see their children infrequently accrue health benefits? How does the quality of the relationship factor into all of this? Are these findings specific to the common cold?” Sneed said, already thinking of how to apply the outcomes to further studies.
Additionally, the data gives no particular reason for parents’ increased cold tolerance. Cohen and Sneed are still looking for an explanation for the cause between parenthood and health, but they believe they are moving toward an answer. 
“This research gives us more insight into how social relationships can actually ‘get under the skin’ to influence health,” Sneed said.

This summer has been hot enough to make the devil sweat. In fact, according to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the first six months of 2012 were the warmest recorded since 1895. Through all this triple digit madness, we were reminded to drink lots of water and stay cool in order to avoid, among other heat-associated ailments, heat stroke.
Heat stroke is a serious matter in which a person’s core body temperature goes from the normal 98.6°F to 104°F. This thermal spike triggers the central nervous system to experience widespread dysfunction, with symptoms including nausea, delirium, seizures, and possible comas.
According to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine, heat stroke is caused by exposure to high ambient temperatures or strenuous physical activity. The authors generally categorize heat stroke as a form of hyperthermia with systemic organ dysfunctions. These malfunctions stem from breakdowns in the brain where the precise control of thermoregulation is compromised.
Normally, during a period of heat stress, a region in the brain called the hypothalamus operates as the body’s thermostat, cuing the transport of warmed blood to the skin to be cooled. 
Meanwhile, the body sweats to lose its excess thermal energy — about 1.7 milliliters of sweat will get rid of 1 kilocalorie of energy. The residual salt left on the skin from sweating has to be replenished within the body, which can done by ingesting salt tablets or consuming electrolyte-rich drinks.
The initial reaction to heat stress is a coordinated, short-lived, but severe inflammatory response. Various cells in the body begin to communicate and a slew of protective molecules emerge. The complicated conversation between cells and tissues is a necessary one, functioning as a visceral alarm.
The trouble starts when the cellular conversation becomes over-stimulated, leading to heat stroke. The exaggerated inflammatory response causes high volumes of blood to be redirected away from core organs. Furthermore, when the response is too strong, doctors often see symptoms associated with poor blood circulation, rampant inflammation, and overall loss of core temperature regulation.
Another biologic response to heat stress is to expel protective proteins, appropriately called heat-shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs operate to prime the body for possible future episodes of hyperthermia. They have a variety of roles in the body, but often provide stability and assist in cellular transport. The HSP family protects the cells from oxygen deprivation, inflammation, and other noxious threats that occur during heat stress and would otherwise damage tissue. 
If the body cannot produce HSPs properly during heat stress — due to genetic mutation, effects of aging, or inability to acclimate to the heat — heat stroke sets in. For example, in a 1988 article published in Science, researchers discovered an increase in the mortality of cells subjected to heat stress when HSP genes were mutated to produce abnormal protein structures.
Heat stroke is a complicated malady and is contingent on multiple biological processes running amok. This illness mostly affects the elderly, infants, athletes, and outdoor laborers; however, it has been seen in every age group and is associated with numerous activities. 
The best preventive action is to take time to acclimate to the heat: Drink plenty of water, eat salty foods to replenish salt lost from sweating, and conduct outdoor activities during cooler parts of the day.

Physicists discover 'Higgslike' subatomic particle
Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, shook the world July 4 with news confirming the existence of the elusive Higgs Boson particle. Commonly referred to as the “God Particle,” its discovery marks one of the most important milestones of modern physics.
In 1964, English physicist Peter Higgs and his team theorized that the existence of such a particle would prove an invisible force field called the Higgs Field was responsible for giving objects mass. Without the Higgs Field, matter would zoom around at the speed of light; life as we know it would not exist.
Scientists maintained that while their current data resembled the theory of the God Particle, further research would be necessary to fully characterize it.

NASA's 'Curiosity' lands on Martian surface
On Aug. 6, viewers around the world watched a live feed of mission control at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Ca., where scientists cheered as the Mars Science Laboratory landed on Mars. NASA invested eight years and $2.5 billion into developing the small SUV-sized rover, dubbed ‘Curiosity,’ which will be able to explore the surface of Mars.
Over its two year mission, the rover will scale the base of a three-mile-high mountain, sending back high-definition panoramic pictures while simultaneously utilizing its robotic arm and rock-vaporizing laser to collect samples of the ground for chemical analysis. 
NASA scientists hope their data will one day answer the question of whether Mars has ever been suitable for life.

Tech companies compete during tablet revolution
The past decade has seen the evolution of personal computing, from desktops to laptops to tablet computers. Since Bill Gates’ Microsoft-designed Windows operating system (OS) debuted in the 1990s, Apple Inc. and Google have been developing their own OS for consumers to utilize mobile devices.
This summer, Apple and Google rolled out updates to their latest operating systems, OS X Lion and Jellybean, respectively, which highlighted the companies’ focus on touch interfaces for tablet computers. 
Microsoft Windows, which is the still the dominant OS, joined the summer update frenzy by showcasing its own newly rebuilt Windows 8, which is scheduled to be available for consumers in October 2012.

Solar storms kept sun busy this summer
Earth was subject to a few sun storms this summer, producing flares that sent solar particles toward the planet. On July 12, the sun released an X1.4-class solar flare — the most powerful type of flare it can emit — less than a week after releasing a slightly less powerful X1.1-class solar flare. 
This flare was the strongest of the summer season and means the sun is in an active phase, expected to peak in 2013.
Solar flares are capable of traveling at speeds of up to five or six million miles per hour, reaching the earth in roughly one to three days.
Intense X-class solar flares threaten Earth, as they can interfere with satellites that control navigation, communication signals, and power system infrastructures. This causes blackouts similar to the one seen in India at the end of July.

FDA approves drug to reduce HIV infections
In July, the FDA approved the first drug aimed at reducing the risk of sexually acquiring HIV. 
The drug, marketed as Truvada, includes a daily morning and night pill as a prevention strategy for individuals with high risks of getting HIV. In clinical trials, it reduced the frequency of infection in both heterosexual and LGBT subgroups.
Although anti-HIV drugs have been used in previous years, this drug is the first to prevent HIV infection, rather than treat those who have been born to HIV-positive mothers. 
Nearly 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with HIV every year. FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said the drug’s acceptance is an “important milestone in our fight against HIV.... New treatments as well as prevention methods are needed to fight the HIV epidemic in this country.”

Researchers find bacteria-resistant surfaces
Earlier this month, researchers at the University of Nottingham in the U.K. released a study in which they found new types of polymers that are resistant to bacterial attachment. Polymers are large molecules composed of repeating structural units that play an essential role in forming materials like many rubbers and plastics. 
Bacteria that collect on surfaces form communities called biofilms, against which our bodies have difficulty defending. They are also resistant to conventional antibiotics. These newly identified polymers prevent the formation of biofilms and can be used to construct the surfaces of medical devices like catheters, heart valves, and prosthetic joints, protecting patients from infection.

With so many food options on campus and in Pittsburgh, it’s hard to know where to go and what to try. That’s why we, The Tartan staff, have decided to give you our recommendations. Based on a survey taken by 50 Tartan staffers, here are a few of our opinions on the best of Pittsburgh, both on and off campus. Happy eating!
ON CAMPUS
Coffee
It’s tough to name the best coffee on campus; it’s easily disputable and everyone has his or her personal favorite. But we here at The Tartan believe that Tazza d’Oro takes the cake. Located on the third floor of the Gates Center, Tazza d’Oro only uses fair trade coffee beans and makes the best pastries. With a hip staff that plays great music, Tazza d’Oro is an on-campus escape from campus life — that is, until you have to wander into Gates 3000 to print your paper. If you’re on the opposite side of campus, try La Prima, located on the fifth floor of Wean Hall.
Quick breakfast
Depending on the line, The Exchange may not be the quickest option for breakfast. But if you have a few minutes to spare (and trust us, it’s worth getting to class two minutes late for), we highly recommend grabbing a breakfast sandwich on your way to class. If you’re in more of a hurry, stop by Entropy+ and grab a yogurt or bagel to go.
Salads
For fresh salads made before your eyes, try Spinning Salads. Located on the second floor of the University Center, Spinning Salads has the best salads on campus. To be fair, the salads at The Exchange were a close second, but you can’t beat the options available at Spinning Salads. There’s usually a long line around lunchtime, so try to go a little before or after the rush.
Sandwiches
Hands down, the best sandwiches on campus are made at The Exchange (formerly known as Ginger’s). The ridiculously long line should say it all, but in case there was any doubt, it’s well worth the wait. With an exceptionally friendly staff that’s always willing to chat — when the line’s not out the door, of course — The Exchange is the perfect place to meet friends for lunch or to grab a sandwich before class. The Exchange is located on the first floor of Posner Hall (home to the Tepper School of Business), and all of its sandwiches are named after economic concepts. We recommend the Free Market.
Vegetarian and Vegan
Evgefstos consistently offers the best vegetarian and vegan food on campus, which makes sense since that’s all it serves. Located on the second floor of the University Center, Evgefstos features a menu that changes daily, with lots of vegetables, tofu, and seitan as meat substitutes. We recommend the pizza. Evgefstos also has a lot of great gluten-free options.
Late night
Open until 2 a.m., Skibo Café is one of the only places on campus to get your late-night fix. It has a lot of food options — paninis, pasta, salads — and runs the full menu until it closes. With its convenient location (on the second floor of the University Center) and plenty of seating, Skibo is a great place to take a study break or just grab a bite to eat.
Hangover Cure
Hangovers happen to everyone. Luckily, a big breakfast at Schatz is all you need to feel alive again. The buffet style is perfect for a hungover appetite; you can get practically anything you want and as much of it as you want. There’s also ice cream. At breakfast. Need we say more? The only downside is that you’re sure to see a few people from the party you were at last night, so consider taking a shower (or at least changing your clothes) before you stumble over there for breakfast.
OFF CAMPUS
Coffee
Aside from the conveniently located Starbucks on South Craig Street, Pittsburgh has some great coffee. We recommend trying Commonplace Coffeehouse in Squirrel Hill. Commonplace (located at 5827 Forbes Ave.) offers a wide variety of coffee blends and is the perfect spot to spend an afternoon sipping coffee and getting some homework done.
A close second, Coffee Tree Roasters also fits this bill. There are a few locations around the city, but the closest are in Shadyside (5524 Walnut St.) and Squirrel Hill (5840 Forbes Ave.). The Shadyside location is a favorite among students and features a garage door wall that opens when the weather is nice, so it’s perfect on warm days.
Vegetarian and Vegan
For the vegetarians and vegans out there, we recommend Quiet Storm and Eat Unique. Quiet Storm, located in Bloomfield at 5430 Penn Ave., features an all-vegetarian menu, with a lot of vegan and gluten-free options, and a quaint, comfortable decor. Even for non-vegetarians, Quiet Storm is an excellent place to grab lunch or dinner any day, except when it’s closed on Tuesdays.
Eat Unique is a favorite among students, thanks in part to its location on South Craig Street. Eat Unique is like Panera, but better. Offering a wide selection of sandwiches, soups, and salads made from fresh ingredients, Eat Unique has something for everyone (including your non-vegetarian friends).
Pizza
While Vocelli’s may seem like the only pizza option (because it’s the only pizza place that takes DineX), we recommend spending (actual) cash and trying Pizza Sola. Pizza Sola is a New York-style slice shop where you can stop by anytime to eat a slice in store or to pick up a pizza to go — sadly, they don’t deliver. It’s reasonably priced, and all of the pizza is baked on a stone. The nearest location is in Oakland (114 Atwood St.), but there are also stores in East Liberty and South Side.
Sweet Spot
When your sweet tooth kicks in, we recommend Razzy Fresh. With three convenient locations — in Squirrel Hill (1717 Murray Ave.), in Oakland (3533 Forbes Ave.), and at 300 S. Craig St. — all of your frozen yogurt needs are easily fulfilled. Fill your cup and adorn your yogurt with as many toppings as you please; you’ll never be unsatisfied. If you’re in the mood for ice cream, go to Dave & Andy’s in Oakland (207 Atwood St.). This small ice cream shop has been a Pittsburgh favorite since 1983 and offers a large selection of homemade ice cream flavors.
When Your Parents Are in Town
There’s no better time to treat yourself to a nice meal than when your parents are in town (and they’re paying). We recommend taking them to Salt of the Earth. The first restaurant from chef Kevin Sousa, Salt offers a lot of vegetarian options and its menu is constantly changing to take advantage of seasonal availability of local produce. The first floor of the restaurant features communal seating for walk-ins, and the mezzanine level is reservation-only. Salt, which is located at 5523 Penn Ave., was voted best new restaurant in 2011 by Pittsburgh Magazine. A word to the wise: Salt only has a few dessert items on its menu, but be sure to order one — you won’t regret it.
OTHER WINNERS
Best Mexican: Mad Mex (370 Atwood St., 220 S. Highland Ave.)
Best Italian: Piccolo Forno (3801 Butler St.)
Best Chinese: Orient Express (4609 Forbes Ave.)
Best Thai: Bangkok Balcony (5846 Forbes Ave.)
Best Burgers, Best Milkshakes: BRGR (5997 Penn Circle South)

Pittsburgh may seem like a strange, fearsome place where the locals order french fries on their salads and where black and yellow “Stillers” paraphernalia cover every inch of store windows. But despite its regional quirks and sometimes unintelligible dialect, Pittsburgh is actually a manageable city, easily broken down into smaller neighborhoods, each with its own diverse set of attractions. From shoe shopping to museum hopping to ice cream tasting, Pittsburgh has a destination for your every whim — if you know where to look.
Downtown
The hulking metal bridges that stretch over the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh’s Downtown probably most closely reflect what you already know about the Steel City. But hidden among the vestiges of Pittsburgh’s industrial past is the Cultural District, home to a few must-see gems.
Among the Cultural District’s offerings are the Benedum Center, where Broadway musicals often make their Pittsburgh stop; the O’Reilly Theater, where Pittsburgh Public Theater puts on its acclaimed (and student-discounted) plays; and the Byham Theater, where students can see everything from musicals to dance troupes to comedians. At Heinz Hall, home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, music-loving students can dress up for the evening and enjoy the sounds of an excellent orchestra.
While not technically in Downtown, a quick hop across the Allegheny takes you to the North Shore, home of the Andy Warhol Museum, which features an extensive collection of the Pittsburgh-born artist’s work, and the New Hazlett Theater, a great place to take in offbeat plays and performances. But be warned: Most Pittsburgh buses stop running after midnight or 1 a.m., so plan your trip wisely.
Strip District
The Strip District is one of Pittsburgh’s busiest and most eclectic neighborhoods. Running for half a mile along Liberty Avenue, Penn Avenue, and Smallman Street, the Strip is crowded with upscale boutiques, family-owned businesses, sidewalk vendors — and people, on any nice weekend day. Check out Costume World for an awesome get-up this Halloween, stop by Mon Aimee Chocolat for an in-store mug of cocoa or a candy bar to go, or pick up hard-to-find Asian groceries at Lotus Foods. If you’re in a spontaneous mood, stop by one of the sidewalk stalls for a funny hat, or go native and buy a Steelers T-shirt.
The South Side
Lined with shops ranging from Urban Outfitters and American Eagle to White House Black Market, the South Side is an ideal destination for the casual weekend shopper or the desperate last-minute gift seeker. While it’s a haven for shoppers, the South Side is also popular among movie-theater goers or students seeking a rare off-campus meal at restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory. For the over-21 crowd, South Side is one of the most popular nightlife areas in town, with tons of bars and clubs.
Oakland
Only steps from campus, Oakland is an easy walk down Forbes Avenue into the epicenter of Pittsburgh’s college life. This bustling strip of Forbes is just as vibrant after dark as it is at high noon: Joe Mama’s, Fuel and Fuddle, and Mad Mex are among the local restaurants that offer tasty half-price food after 11 p.m. on week nights.
Cheap food is not the only attraction that Oakland has to offer. A trip to the Carnegie Museum of Art or the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is the perfect cure for a lazy Saturday; plus, admission is free with your student ID. And, of course, Oakland is home to our neighbor, the University of Pittsburgh, and on-campus destinations like the magnificent 42-floor Cathedral of Learning.
Squirrel Hill
A favorite among students because of the convenient trip — a short ride on any 61 bus — Squirrel Hill is a charming neighborhood with tons of restaurants, shopping, and residential areas. On warm days, in particular, there’s no better place to be than Squirrel Hill. With Rita’s Italian Ice, Cold Stone Creamery, and Baskin-Robbins all within a few blocks of each other, it’s the perfect place to cool off.
If you’re interested in thrifting, check out Avalon, an upscale used-clothing store with lots of little treasures. Want to take in a movie? The Manor Theatre showcases a mix of indie films, big-budget blockbusters, and Oscar contenders. And to satisfy your appetite, there’s Pamela’s Diner, which has one of the best breakfasts in town.
Shadyside
Many students call Shadyside their home, whether they live there or just frequent its coffee shops and bars. Shadyside is a popular neighborhood that’s just a short walk from campus. In the midst of residential streets, its main drag of shops is on Walnut Street. Attractions include upscale stores — American Apparel, Banana Republic, Sephora, and the Apple Store — and excellent restaurants, including Girasole and Eden.
Want to beat the heat, but in the mood for something a little classier than Baskin-Robbins? Try Mercurio’s, Shadyside’s gelato-and-pizza joint. And if you need groceries, Giant Eagle’s Market District is a short bus ride away. Shadyside is a great neighborhood to spend an afternoon, whether you’re shopping or just admiring its beautiful homes.
East Liberty
This up-and-coming neighborhood borders Shadyside and Friendship. Its main landmark is the East Liberty Presbyterian Church, a Gothic-style church built in the early 1930s. Featuring shopping hotspots like Trader Joe’s and Target, East Liberty is becoming a destination neighborhood for many locals.
The area is also home to many fantastic restaurants, including Abay and Tana, the only two Ethiopian restaurants in Western Pennsylvania; BRGR, a burger joint with open air seating upstairs; and Plum, an Asian-fusion restaurant. The neighborhood is also becoming a hub for live music, with popular clubs including Shadow Lounge, AVA Lounge, and the newly-opened 6119.
Bloomfield/Friendship
The “Little Italy” of Pittsburgh, Bloomfield is situated north of Shadyside. In addition to the excellent bakeries and Italian restaurants in Bloomfield, the neighborhood is home to a number of art galleries that participate in the Penn Avenue Art Walk that happens every first Friday of the month in Bloomfield and Friendship, an adjacent neighborhood. Friendship is similar to Bloomfield, with a number of beautiful old homes that have been converted into apartments.

This whole week, you’ll probably be inundated with information about Carnegie Mellon: how to use the Port Authority buses, how to get along with your roommate, and how to be prepared for your classes. While that information is important and useful, it doesn’t really teach you how to deal with Carnegie Mellon’s unique idiosyncrasies. So here are a few tips on how to seem less like a first-year (no offense) and more like a well-adjusted member of the Carnegie Mellon community (you’re welcome).
Don’t bring your Segway indoors. Perhaps you’re one of the few people at Carnegie Mellon who have a Segway; good for you. But do you really need to ride it through the University Center? You don’t see anyone riding their bicycles indoors. Park it outside, please. 
Do paint the fence. You’ve probably already seen the Fence and heard all about it during your various campus tours. It’s not overrated, though. Painting the Fence is an integral part of the Carnegie Mellon experience — and if nothing else, it’s probably the only time you can graffiti a piece of public property without the risk of getting in trouble. Just make sure you follow the rules when you paint it.
Do be passionate. Chances are, in high school, you often had to tone down your love of LARPing or obscure British poets for fear that your peers would judge you. Well, it’s your lucky day — here at Carnegie Mellon, everyone has something specific and nerdy they love, so don’t be afraid to tell your roommate about that great new anime you found online. Be careful, though — it’s good to be passionate, but... 
Don’t make obscure references in conversation. You can usually take it for granted that whomever you’re talking to reads xkcd and will understand Pokémon jokes. However, unless you know you’re talking to a fellow Homestuck fan, please don’t start speaking only in Homestuck references. It will just confuse people.
Do be quiet in the upper floors of the library. Its nickname may be Club Hunt, but it is still first and foremost a library. If you want to take a break from studying and Skype loudly with one of your high school friends, do it somewhere else.
Don’t sit by yourself at a large table on the University Center’s second floor. Do you see how that table has five chairs surrounding it? That means it’s supposed to have five people sitting at it. There are a lot of other people who eat there, and if you take a large table to sit at by yourself, everyone else looking for a table will silently judge you.
Do know how to order food efficiently. This includes, but is not limited to: having your money ready when you’ve reached the checkout counter; knowing your order when you get to the front of the line at La Prima; and having your sandwich order ready when they ask for it at The Exchange. You’re all smart people. Just use common sense and be quick about it.
Do dump cheese onto your pasta at Pasta Villaggio. The pasta, be it with marinara, alfredo, or vodka sauce, can lack a little zing in this University Center eatery. For one, it needs more salt. Plus, it doesn’t help that the cheese shaker at the counter has a problem letting the Parmesan fall out of those tiny holes. So don’t feel bad if you have to open it up and pour some extra on your pasta, even if other people glare at you. Just know your food is going to taste wonderful.
Do leave the computer clusters and act sociable. Yes, we know you’re a computer science, engineering, or College of Fine Arts student. And fine, let’s just agree that business and humanities students have a lot of work, too. But always sitting alone in the computer clusters isn’t healthy. Go study with your friends or take a break and get some Razzy Fresh. Honestly, it is somewhat sad to see people at odd hours — for example, 3 a.m. on a Friday night — working alone in a cluster. Do everyone a favor and go have some fun.
Do stand in line to get a free mug the next time someone donates millions of dollars to Carnegie Mellon. When Carnegie Mellon received a generous donation of $265 million dollars from Bill Dietrich last year, a lot of us missed out on the “Thank you Bill” glasses and other merchandise. It’s a great souvenir. Those who got it know its sentimental value. And those who didn’t, well, better luck next time.
Do go to social events with free food, but be social while you’re there. There are plenty of barbecues and free dinners that will happen at the beginning of the semester. By all means, take advantage of the free food — you are a broke college student now, after all — but don’t show up for the sole purpose of loading up a plate and leaving. Try talking to the members of the organization hosting the event. Even if you’ve never been interested in that activity before, give it a chance. You no longer have to be the person you were in high school; you’re free to be interested in anything and everything. And even if you try an activity and don’t like it, at least you’ll have met new people.

Hello Class of 2016+,
Once again, we want to congratulate you on making it here! If you’re reading this edition of The Tartan, it means you’ve made it all the way to campus and are ready to get your college experience started. This is a monumental achievement in and of itself. Carnegie Mellon is a very special place, but that description dangerously oversimplifies the truth. In actuality, there is no adequate way to describe the culture, community, and wealth of experiences that await you here.
Instead, we hope that you will get a sense of what the phrase “Carnegie Mellon is a very special place” means during Orientation week and that you will come to fully understand the magic of this place throughout your four or five years here.
It’s difficult to wrap your head around all the opportunities you’ll have; each of us HOCs are entering our fourth year and we still continue to be wowed by the experiences we are presented with and the amazing things we see our peers doing in all fields. Here you are only limited by your ambition, and this idea played an integral part in the selection of our theme: “Tartan Tale.”
We wanted to emphasize the agency you will have in shaping your experience. You are writing your own story and the plot is whatever you choose. Labels mean little here; your major doesn’t define your life path. Instead, what is important is how you choose to use your skills and passions.
It’s common here to see computer scientists go into the arts, artists end up coding, and every form of collaboration in between. We encourage you to use your time here to discover your passions and take advantage of Carnegie Mellon’s vast resources to see your dreams to fruition.
Another aspect that led us to choose “Tartan Tale” is that it speaks to a grander story than one on the individual level. We are all Tartans here. All of our actions and achievements contribute to the already-impressive legacy of Carnegie Mellon. How will your individual story weave into the larger plaid of Carnegie Mellon?
You are now a part of a huge family of innovators and award winners in just about every field. More importantly, this is a family of curious, kind, and fascinating individuals. Your experience will be greatly enriched if you seek out those around you and learn from one another by exchanging your stories and dreams.
This coming week is going to be packed with new people, places, and information. Don’t worry if you don’t remember every fact you learn or every face you meet; it’s impossible to do so. However, we still recommend you try to learn all you can about what Carnegie Mellon can offer and to meet as many other students as possible.
All of us have close friends we met during our Orientation week, and you will find yourselves building those bonds shortly. The seven of us and the 130 Orientation Counselors we hired will be there to answer your questions and make sure that this week is one of the most fun and memorable weeks you have at Carnegie Mellon.
Get excited for the journey ahead. You cannot be sure of where you will end up four or five years from now. There will certainly be ups and downs, but they will be well worth it, for no good story is without struggle. Rest assured that you will make some incredible friendships, gain great knowledge, and have a tale or two to tell as a result of your time here!
We are excited to see you off on your college journey, and we eagerly wait to see how your chapter fits into the ever-evolving “Tartan Tale.”
The 2012 HOCs,
Christina Brant, Eric Dietz, Michelle Guarino, Matt Ho, Sangita Sharma, Nadia Sheen, and Will Weiner

At Carnegie Mellon you will receive a world-class education, work with amazing professors, and do a good bit of hard work. And while these things may seem like the most important parts of college, they don’t come close to defining the Tartan experience.
For those whose hearts are in the work, the quirky traditions at Carnegie Mellon are more definitive of Tartan culture than its academic aspects are. While the following list is far from comprehensive, these traditions are arguably the most important factors in shaping students’ identities and experiences. Welcome to the Tartan family.
Playfair
During Orientation week, there are tons of events meant to help first-years bond with fellow classmates. No event does this better than Playfair, a once-in-a-Carnegie-Mellon-lifetime experience where students get the chance to meet and interact with practically everyone in their class. With a number of games and mini-competitions, Playfair is a memory-making activity and a chance to start friendships that could last a lifetime.
The Kiltie Band
Proudly and affectionately known as the band that wears no pants, the Kiltie Band is Carnegie Mellon’s official marching band. Founded in 1908, the band performs in full Scottish regalia — kilts, knee socks, and all — and is known for its colorful, nerdy cheers and anti-cheers. Under the direction of music professor Paul Gerlach, the Kiltie Band entertains the crowd during home football games and during spring and winter concerts. At halftime during Carnegie Mellon’s Homecoming game, the band performs its famous Scatter Show.
Growing from seven members at its inception to over 130 members today, the Kiltie Band is a staple of Carnegie Mellon culture, and it is open to all who wish to join, regardless of musical experience.
Bagpipes
Both Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon were of Scottish descent, and the culture of their homeland is alive and well here. In addition to being one of very few universities in the U.S. to offer degrees — bachelor’s and master’s — in bagpiping, Carnegie Mellon is also home to Carnegie Mellon Pipes and Drums, a competitive bagpipe band.
The band is currently under the direction of Andrew Carlisle, one of the world’s leading pipers and the director of piping in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music. Made up of students, faculty, and alumni, Carnegie Mellon Pipes and Drums can be seen — and heard — on warm Monday nights on the Cut.
Spring Carnival
The light at the end of the dark winter tunnel, Spring Carnival is regarded as Carnegie Mellon’s oldest tradition. Taking place about a week before spring semester finals, Spring Carnival is comprised of four main parts: Midway, Booth, Mobots, and Sweepstakes/Buggy, along with a celebrity comedian performance, a large outdoor concert, and a fireworks show.
On Midway — traditionally located in the parking lot behind Morewood Gardens — you will find the necessities of any good fair, including rides, carnival food, and games. What makes Midway unique, however, are the booths: one- and two-story wooden structures built from the ground up by students in various organizations and clubs. Each year, the Spring Carnival Committee chooses a theme and booths are built to creatively reflect it, with prizes awarded to the very best. Past themes include “History With a Twist,” “When I Was Your Age,” and “As Seen on TV.” Midway is also the site of the comedy show.
The curious white lines in front of Wean Hall aren’t part of some abstract art piece; they are part of the course for yet another Carnegie Mellon tradition: Mobots. Also known as Mobile Robots, Mobots are student-built autonomous robots designed to read the white lines and navigate the course. Initiated in 1994, Mobot racing has become an annual Spring Carnival event.
The pièce de résistance of Spring Carnival, and perhaps the most sacred of all Carnegie Mellon traditions, is Buggy. In a nutshell, a buggy is a cross between a soapbox car and a luge racer. Once large and boxy, these student-built racers are now sleek and aerodynamic cylinders that have raced at every Spring Carnival since 1920 in an event known as Sweepstakes. On the day of competition, buggies are pushed and driven in a relay-style race along the backside of campus on a course over 4,000 feet long. Today’s buggies have clocked in at over 30 miles per hour. Sweepstakes brings out fierce competition among racers and non-racers alike and creates rivalries that last well after graduation.
The Fence
As legend has it, the Fence was built in 1923 to replace a bridge that used to span a ravine running along the Cut. The bridge brought together the gender-divided campus — male Carnegie Tech students and female Margaret Morrison students — and was a popular place for students to mingle. Ever since, the Fence has served as the central spot for advertising on campus and remains a common meeting place.
According to university rules, the Fence must be painted in its entirety between midnight and 6 a.m. and can be painted only with hand brushes. In addition, it must be guarded at all times by a member of the group that most recently painted the Fence in order to keep that group’s message up. It is unwritten etiquette that if another organization needs the Fence, it is turned over to that group or shared between groups.
The steel- and concrete-cored Fence on the Cut today is not the original; it’s a replacement erected after the original collapsed under its own weight in 1993. With over six inches of paint, the original fence holds the Guinness World Record for being the most painted object.
Playground
For one week every semester, the normal School of Drama curriculum grinds to a halt as students take part in "Playground: A Festival of Independent Student Work." For the past nine years, students have had the opportunity to breathe life into their original ideas while testing methods and skills acquired during the year. All of the works created and performed during Playground aren't just abandoned at the end of the week: A number of pieces are developed further, and some even go on to be produced.
The Green Room
Carnegie Mellon's School of Drama has turned out a number of famous alumni such as Ted Danson, Blair Underwood, and Judith Light. Besides each getting their start on the main stages of Purnell, they have also partaken in the School of Drama tradition of signing the walls and ceiling of the Green Room. Located behind the main stage in Kresge Theatre, the Green Room is signed by senior drama students at the end of the school year, signifying the end of one chapter and the start of another.
Primal Scream
It may be Orientation, but it's never too early to think about finals, right? Take comfort in knowing that Primal Scream is there to take the stress away. Hosted by the Student Dormitory Council, the event invites students to come to the Fence and release their frustration by screaming into the night. Taking place each semester the night before the first day of finals, Primal Scream is a night of free food and great conversation — a perfect way to calm yourself before the madness begins.

Although it is often referred to as “The Steel City,” Pittsburgh has a lot more to offer than buildings and bridges; it’s filled with numerous entertainment options for students of all backgrounds and interests. With its expansive Cultural District, Pittsburgh is a hub for music, theater, and culture.
The Cultural District was developed and is operated by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit arts organization founded in 1984 and one of the major supporters of Pittsburgh’s cultural community. Thanks to the Cultural Trust, a once beaten-down district has become a prominent Mecca for arts lovers.
The Benedum Center, a 2,800-seat theater in the heart of the Cultural District, is one of its most impressive attractions. In 1928, the Benedum opened as the Stanley Theater; it was known as “Pittsburgh’s Palace of Amusement” and was intended to bring joy to those suffering during the Great Depression.
In 1984, the $43 million renovation of the Stanley to the Benedum became the Cultural Trust’s first project after its founding. The Byham Theater — formerly the Gayety Theater — underwent a similar transformation in the 1990s, helping to turn the area into the vibrant district it is today.
The now 14-square-block Cultural District is situated in Downtown. It boasts a total of 90 shops, 50 restaurants, and seven theaters, as well as several parks and art galleries, all intended for the promotion of local arts. There are endless entertainment possibilities in the district. Most notably, the Cultural District provides many venues intended for classical music. From stunning symphony concerts to outstanding opera performances, Pittsburgh has a vibrant classical scene that will appeal to any music lover.
The world-renowned Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) has made a home at Heinz Hall, a 2,661-seat concert hall located at 600 Penn Ave. Throughout the year, the PSO presents both pop and classical concerts, ensuring that it offers something for everyone.
Recently, the PSO performed The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses, a musical presentation of one of the world’s most popular video game soundtracks. Among other performances, the upcoming season features “Year of the Dragon” celebrations, a concert featuring flautist Lorna McGhee, a recital by Russian pianist Olga Kern, and a performance with Glee star Matthew Morrison at the end of September.
If you’re interested in something more dramatic, the Pittsburgh Opera offers a different type of musical experience in the Benedum Center. This season, the Pittsburgh Opera will be presenting several classic operas, including Rigoletto, Don Giovanni, and Madama Butterfly.
In addition to the Pittsburgh Opera, the Benedum Center houses the PNC Broadway Across America series, which draws several Broadway productions to Pittsburgh each season. The lineup for this season includes Les Misérables, The Book of Mormon, and Anything Goes.
If you’re looking for something fun to do with friends or just a night of exploring, you should consider attending a performance in Pittsburgh’s Cultural District. Not only will it be a memorable experience, but the trip to Downtown alone will help introduce you to the diverse history and wonderful city life in Pittsburgh. There’s much to do in this great city, and as first-years, there are plenty of new experiences to be had.

Well hi, hi, hi there. My name is Alex Price, and I am the current general manager at WRCT Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run radio station. In this weekly column, members of WRCT’s staff will tell you about whimsical musical journeys and adventures, exciting music (old and new) that deserves your undivided attention, and whatever else strikes our fancy — that our editors will let us print.
It’s a safe bet that everything and everyone on campus is competing for your attention, so I’ll get to the point: If you’re interested in just about anything, you’ll find a home at WRCT.
WRCT, known as Radio Carnegie Tech in older times, has been around for more than 60 years. As a free-form radio broadcaster, we are committed to providing quality alternatives to the mainstream commercial programming that dominates the radio. Our DJs, public affairs hosts, and other staff members are not only Carnegie Mellon students, staff, and faculty but also community members from the Pittsburgh area, some of whom have more than 30 years of radio broadcasting experience under their belts.
At WRCT, every DJ has the freedom to play the music of his or her choosing. So, whether you’re interested in bleeps and bloops, kitchen sink recordings, local independent news programming, or Latin American culture, WRCT has a program for you.
If you want to learn more about what we do, we’ll be on the Cut playing music during the beginning of the semester. Please stop by and introduce yourself; we’d love to meet you and take you in as part of the radio family. To learn more about the membership process, email our training director Anna Bieberdorf at training@wrct.org.
Hope to see you soon.

Dear Patrick,
I’m the first of my siblings to go to college, so my parents drove me up to school in their RV to move in. But now they’re refusing to leave. They told me they want to make sure I “get settled” and my dad keeps sliding me condoms and telling me to just use the RV if my roommate won’t leave. How can I get rid of them?
Thanks,
Help! Elders Loiter Incredibly Conspicously, Offer Prophylactics Tirelessly, Embarrass Repeatedly
Dear HELICOPTER,
Just go ahead and hand this over to your parents. They’re probably reading this anyway, since you’re too busy hanging up those lame posters you carefully picked out so everyone would think you’re cool and musical.
Mom and Dad, here’s the deal. Your kid’s going to mess up... a lot. Let him. Now’s the best time to do it. And you’ll have to do this for every kid, so get used to it. By the end, you’ll be kicking them out. I was the youngest of four, and my parents threw a party after I left; there was cake and champagne. Look at it this way: With all the kids out of the house, you’ll finally have some privacy. 
If all else fails, remember: When the van’s a-rockin’, don’t come a-knockin’,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
It’s the first day of Orientation, and I’m really excited to meet all these new people! Orientation seems like so much fun, and I already LOVE my OCs! Do you have any tips for getting the most out of this week?
Thanks,
Desperately Interested Surrounding Orientation, Requesting Interesting, Entertaining, Necessary Tidbits, Encouragement, Direction
Dear DISORIENTED,
You need to know something: Orientation sucks. Since I’m the only upperclassman you’re going to hear from this week who’s not either a) an Orientation Counselor or b) someone who came back to school early to try to sleep with first-years (note that those two aren’t mutually exclusive), I have an obligation to lay it all out for you.
Really, most of the Orientation events are pretty boring. My best advice is to go to the events you find interesting and skip the rest.
Oh, and that “trying to sleep with first-years” part wasn’t a joke. Just remember, condoms cost a quarter at Student Health.
But seriously, upperclassmen are creepy,
Patrick Hoskins (upperclassman)

Longtime University Center fixture Sí Señor has been replaced by a different restaurant, El Gallo de Oro, which hopes to cater to the Tex-Mex taste buds of many students.
Kim Abel, the director of Housing and Dining at Carnegie Mellon, said in an email, “There were significant requests for a Tex/Mex concept. The desire was to create a concept that would have high quality, fresh, and healthy food with providing customers the versatility of adding the exact ingredients and toppings to fit their taste [sic].”
Abel said that El Gallo de Oro will have a very different menu from Sí Señor, in response to what Housing and Dining sees as students’ desired changes. “We wanted a location that would truly focus on Mexican and Southwestern dishes and flavors,” Abel said in the email.
The menu may be different, but El Gallo de Oro is maintained by the same vendor as Sí Señor. According to Abel, Housing and Dining chose to stay with the vendor because of its “expertise and culinary background with authentic Mexican food.” The owners of El Gallo de Oro have, however, hired a new staff and implemented a new training program.
Although the student body at large has yet to try El Gallo de Oro’s food, student reaction to the announcement of the change has been mixed. Some students, like sophomore information systems major Carrie Weintraub, welcome the switch from Sí Señor.
“I think it’s great that the university was in tune with the sketchy reputation that Sí Señor had and is trying to better accommodate students’ wants. Time will tell if they did it successfully,” Weintraub said.
Other students are happy to see more healthy food at Carnegie Mellon. “I always encourage change. Although the name is a bit obscure, I feel like El Gallo de Oro will provide a new and healthier option to CMU’s campus,” sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Audrey Alpizar said.
Junior biomedical and chemical engineering double major Christine Sidoti, however, is more nostalgic about Sí Señor. 
“I think a lot of people will miss Sí Señor’s late-night chicken finger runs,” Sidoti said. “We’ll have to see what the new place has to offer!”

Electrical and computer engineering professor Vijayakumar Bhagavatula has been named the interim dean of the College of Engineering. Kumar, who is also the associate dean of Faculty and Graduate Affairs, is taking over from former Dean Pradeep Khosla. Khosla left Carnegie Mellon in August to take a position as chancellor of the University of California in San Diego.
“That came about relatively quickly and somewhat unexpectedly,” said University Provost Mark Kamlet, who appointed Kumar on behalf of himself and University President Jared Cohon. “Kumar is aware of that timetable, and is graciously willing to stay as interim dean until a new dean is appointed.”
Kumar came to Carnegie Mellon as a Ph.D. student in 1977, and joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty in 1982. During his 30 years as a faculty member, Kumar has taught many courses, but he said that his favorite was Signals and Systems.
“It involves challenging mathematics,” Kumar said. “It uses a lot of complex numbers, complex variables, and these are not always the most appealing things to students, so the challenge is to make the subject interesting and providing information on why we need to know this stuff. It’s challenging, but if you do it well, at the end of the semester, you can see students go on to more advanced courses in this area, and that’s always satisfying to see.”
Between his work as interim dean and his ongoing research responsibilities, Kumar is a busy man. “I still have 10 Ph.D. students that work with me. I still have a very thriving research program in signal processing.... I intend to maintain that research productivity,” he said.
Andres Rodriguez-Perez, one of Kumar’s Ph.D. students, said that he is privileged to have him as an adviser.
“Rumor has it that he is the best adviser in the department,” Rodriguez-Perez said. “He makes every student feel important, and he is very committed to their research projects. He makes, I think, all of us feel as though we’re his only student.”
Rodriguez-Perez said that Kumar is always available to see his students, despite his busy schedule. “He seems to have an open-door policy, where whenever we had a question outside of our regular meeting time, we can just go and ask him. I imagine that might change a little now that he’s the dean, but we will see.”
Kamlet said that Kumar is a strong choice for interim dean. “He’s a very straightforward person, very easy to get along with. Very sharp, very smart. Somebody who I think all the parts of the engineering school will feel very comfortable with. He’s hardworking, very efficient, and a very nice guy. He’s a real gentleman.”
According to Kamlet, the search for a permanent replacement for former Dean Khosla will soon be underway. A search committee headed by civil and environmental engineering professor Jacobo Bielak will research candidates for the position.
“That committee will be in position to hit the ground running as soon as fall semester starts,” Kamlet said. “Those search committees do their thing, and then they bring to the president and myself their recommendations, and we take it from there. That process will take several months.”
In the meantime, Kumar will take on one more role for the university he says he loves.
“I’ve taught 10 different courses and graduated close to 40 Ph.D. students,” Kumar said. “I’ve been on the faculty for 30 years. I’ve been involved in teaching, research, and administration, and enjoyed all of them. It’s been a very supportive place for me personally.”

In early July, Dan Martin was appointed as dean of the College of Fine Arts. Martin has served as CFA’s interim dean since June 2010 — after former Dean Hilary Robinson stepped down — which made stepping into the full position an easy transition for him.
“I felt at home stepping into office,” he said. Between his experience as a faculty member in the School of Drama and his background in nonprofit theater, he said he’s used to handling the responsibilities of CFA’s dean.
Martin was appointed dean after a formal search was conducted by University Provost Mark Kamlet.
Martin came to Carnegie Mellon in 1992 to direct the Master of Arts Management graduate degree, and has been involved in several other arts collaboration projects since, including the Master of Entertainment Industry Management and Technology in the Arts. On a personal level, his son recently graduated from the School of Music, so he has a strong connection with students in CFA.
He described his role as helping each of CFA’s five schools develop and grow by improving alumni relations, marketing the schools to attract funding and outside talent, developing new courses, and working with faculty, school heads, and administrators.
During his time as interim dean, Martin updated CFA’s main website and oversaw the appointment of an interim head of the School of Music.
“The heads are so involved in making their schools the best they can be,” he said. “My role is to look further ahead.”
Peter Cooke, the head of the School of Drama, believes Martin will be a good fit.
“He has a good understanding of all five colleges.... He’s an advocate for all five schools within Warner [Hall] and the community,” Cooke said.
Aside from those outlined duties, Martin’s main goal is to develop the cross-education of arts and technology.
“We have five very strong schools rooted in historical traditions, but students are approaching them with contemporary visions,” he explained. “At the education level, we’ll see a change in how it’s delivered.”
Despite a struggling arts world full of symphonies and museums vying for funding, Martin is confident that students will continue to come to Carnegie Mellon for a “unique and attractive” education that blends classical art skills with a modern twist — something traditional arts conservatories lack.
“The world has changed in how it consumes creative content,” he said. “Our students are better positioned for that world.”
He added that, over the past decade, a growing number of CFA students take classes across many disciplines, including computer science and engineering. The five colleges have followed suit and integrated multi-disciplined courses into their curriculum, such as the recently added Music and Technology degree.
To further combat obstacles in a struggling art world, Martin said he plans to “tell our story better.”
He explained that he believes Pittsburgh doesn’t boast enough. “I don’t think we’ve done enough to say how good it is and what it contributes to the world,” he said.
Reaching out to local artists and organizations as well as alumni across the nation, he hopes to improve communication and “market” students’ talents better.
Barbara Anderson, a professor in the School of Drama and a previous associate dean for CFA, agrees that this will be one of Martin’s challenges as dean.
“The dean needs to keep everyone informed, keep CFA financially solid, and keep good relationships with administration,” she said, adding that he has been successful at advocating CFA to Pittsburgh and the university so far.
Anderson added that she feels Martin truly enjoys the job of dean. 
“He’s a fine man with a good sense of humor,” she said. “That’s important in an administrator.”

This fall, Carnegie Mellon unveiled a new organization management system called The Bridge. Open to all students at the beginning of this academic year, The Bridge is available to residential communities, Greek chapters, and student organizations recognized either through Student Government or an academic department.
The initial announcement of this new website was made in a series of emails to those who would be interacting with first-year students during Orientation week — RAs, CAs, HOCs, and chapter presidents — and included an in-depth description of the system, its intention, and how to use the website.
An email sent by Dawn Sienko, Student Activities office coordinator, explained, “The Bridge is going to serve as the comprehensive involvement tool on campus, now including Greek Life, house communities, annual campus programs, campus departments that provide significant programming for students, and of course, student organizations!”
Student Body Vice President for Organizations Alyssa Danesh said that the tools currently available to participating organizations include the ability to communicate with members through the website, email, or text; the option to create a webpage without the knowledge of web design skills; and event management tools that make use of the flyerboard on the front page.
According to Danesh, The Bridge will also integrate social media, as well as document and photo storage. “This is targeted to students,” Danesh said. “Every single student can log on to the Bridge and learn about events going on to the school, subscribe to organizations they’re a part of, or join them. OrgTracker was much more targeted to just the student leaders of organizations.... [The Bridge is] more of a social platform, in that you can understand what’s going on at the university.”
Lucas Christain, associate director of Student Life for Upperclass and Greek Houses, said that while The Bridge intended to be different from social networking sites, “there are some parallels in ways things get fed to you.”
Christain said, “Organizations will have the ability to communicate with members, create surveys, hold elections, and store documents and web forms. There are a ton of tools that exist for a student leader.”
“We think it has the potential to offer solutions to the comprehensive events calendar, [...] it can be a place where people can go to find opportunities and events,” he continued.
Campus groups and organizations have already been provided with instructions on how to create their Bridge profile, and some have started sending out invitations to members of their d-lists.
The system behind The Bridge is a product from CollegiateLink, and is designed to replace the old OrgTracker system, and eventually BudgetTracker. Data from OrgTracker have already been transferred into The Bridge.
Will Weiner, the recently elected student body president, helped lead student discussion on the creation of The Bridge.
“The biggest value I saw was the need for a better, central place for organizations,” Weiner said.
Weiner thought that The Bridge would best suit a “medium-sized” student organization, with larger groups having their own organization systems, and smaller groups not necessarily needing this tool.
“It has really cool potential for it to change how finance is done for student organizations,” Weiner said. He emphasized that financial data would be available “more in real time.”
Danesh says that, while the Bridge is fully operational, more features are being added. In particular, the Joint Funding Committee’s operations are being added to The Bridge, a step requiring CollegiateLink to work on a new database for Carnegie Mellon and other campuses.
Other functions that will be explored in the future, according to Danesh, include the ability to swipe your ID card at an event to be registered as attending; the development of a co-curricular transcript, which would detail involvement in extracurricular activities, leadership positions, on-campus research, and on-campus jobs; and a service hours tracking component, currently being piloted by the Greek community.
Christain said that features are being rolled out in phases both to effectively stress test the system and to receive student feedback on The Bridge’s functionality. “We’re trying to be thoughtful about this,” he said.

Study finds skin-aging free radicals affect air particles
A study by a group of researchers, led by Carnegie Mellon chemistry, chemical engineering, and engineering and public policy professor Neil Donahue, has determined that natural air particles are affected by the same free radicals that age human skin.
“We have been able to show conclusively that biogenics are chemically transformed in the atmosphere. They’re not just static. They keep going, they keep changing and they keep growing,” Donahue said in a university press release. 
“Quite a few atmospheric models, [...] have been assuming that that doesn’t happen. 
What we really need to have in the models is an accurate representation of what’s really going on in the atmosphere, and that’s what this lets us do.”
Since free radicals can transform the chemical composition of air pollutants, the team’s findings could have an effect on air quality predictions and regulations.
“There’s a very, very strong body of data that establishes that fine particles in the air we breathe have a significant bad effect on people.
What is less well understood is how the size and chemical composition of those particles influences that effect,” Donahue said in the press release.
Donahue’s team also included researchers from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the Forschungszentrum Jülich, the Johannes Gutenberg University, the University of Gothenberg, the University of Copenhagen, and the Paul Scherrer Institute.
Professor’s Bayesian book wins biannual DeGroot Prize
Carnegie Mellon statistics professor Jay Kadane’s book, Principles of Uncertainty, won the International Society for Bayesian Analysis’ DeGroot Prize.
Kadane’s book attempts to explain Bayesian statistics and mathematics. “This book addresses how to think about uncertainty,” Kadane said in the book’s preface.
“It is addressed to those who want to know ‘why.’ I have chosen a particular point of view, the subjective Bayesian view, because this approach has best survived the tumult of doing statistical applications and worrying about the meaning behind the calculations.”
“Jay Kadane’s book ... carries out two fundamental dimensions of Jay’s career in statistics: the subjective Bayesian foundations of the field of statistics and the critical importance that statistical thinking and methods must play in a wide range of application areas,” said John Lehoczky, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, in a university press release.
The press release quotes Christian P. Robert, professor of statistics at Université Paris-Dauphine, as saying, “It represents the legacy he [Kadane] wants to leave for the future. And this is a legacy Jay can certainly be proud of!”
The DeGroot Prize, awarded every two years to a statistical science book, is named after Morris H. DeGroot, the founding head of the statistics department at Carnegie Mellon.

Each week, The Tartan collaborates with University Police to report on the latest incidents occurring on and near campus. For this issue, The Tartan has compiled a special edition of the Crime and Incident section; these are some of the more notable reports of the section from the past year.
Prohibited Solicitation
Oct. 26, 2011
University Police responded to the University Center’s complaint that a group of students were selling nachos without permission. Upon arrival, officers found that the students were cleaning up because the staff had told them to leave.
The group was cooperative and told the officers that they thought they were allowed to sell nachos for a class project. They stated that they believed they followed the proper protocol and there must have been a misunderstanding between them and the staff. No further action was taken.
Disorderly Conduct
Nov. 7, 2011
Police were alerted to an incident that occurred at the Fairfax Apartments in which an unidentified male, who was believed to be a Carnegie Mellon student, became upset over a malfunctioning dryer. The male became verbally abusive to two of the apartment staff members. University Police are working with the staff in an attempt to identify this person.
Mock Crime Scenes
Feb. 8, 2012
University Police responded to several places on campus for a report of chalk outlines of bodies and evidence markers. Mock Crime Alerts were also located.
Further investigation revealed that it was an art project done by a student. Due to the alarm created by this incident to the campus community and the artist’s failure to obtain permission, discipline is pending.
Suspicious Activity
April 1, 2012
University Police were called to Hunt Library for a report of suspicious activity. Library staff told police that upon opening they found a large blue and yellow papier-mâché Pokémon “Snorlax” character, approximately six feet wide and four feet tall, blocking a stairwell. Facilities Management Services was called to take it down.
Disorderly Conduct
April 8, 2012
University Police were called to the Gates Center for a report of students who were riding wheeled chairs down the helix walkway.
Upon arrival, officers met with the students who admitted to riding the chairs. It was explained to the students that it was dangerous and unacceptable behavior. A report was made and the students were warned that if they were caught again they would be cited.
Harassment
April 24, 2012
University Police took a report from a faculty member who was getting repeated mailings from an inmate who is incarcerated in California. A Carnegie Mellon detective is following up with the staff of the institution to get the mailings to stop.

When talking about fast food restaurants, Chick-fil-A is generally out of the main conversation, yielding to larger brand names such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King. But when talking about same-sex marriage and LGBT rights, Chick-fil-A has been front and center for the past month because of Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy’s comments.
In response to these statements, individuals and organizations quickly took sides not just about same-sex marriage but about Cathy’s statements and the rights of companies to state their views without repercussion. One of the most common defenses of Cathy and Chick-fil-A, besides pure LGBT hatred, is the argument that companies, along with individuals, should be allowed to discuss their views without fear of criticism and consequences.
These individuals maintain that, since Chick-fil-A does not discriminate against LGBT employees and customers, the values of the company and its management are of no importance to the consumer. Unfortunately, Cathy and Chick-fil-A have chosen to display their values with more than just words. 
In 2010, Chick-fil-A donated nearly $2 million to anti-LGBT groups through various foundations. By choosing to spend money and eat at Chick-fil-A, some patrons are now intentionally supporting anti-LGBT agendas. This connection brings not only the free speech of companies but also that of consumers into play.
Just as Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife gave $2.5 million to the Washington state campaign to fight for the legalization of gay marriage, more companies and CEOs are using personal and company funds to support organizations with social agendas. 
While there is no legal or moral problem with this, there are still repercussions. Once companies begin bringing social and moral values to the forefront, consumers will begin to consider those in addition to the product.
Chick-fil-A, with its monetary support of hot-button social issues, has encouraged customers to take sides with their pocketbooks. 
Companies and consumers each have the right to express personal beliefs through words, actions, and money. The right to free expression, however, does not include the right to be free of criticism and consequences. 
Boycotts and “support days” have turned companies into polling booths, with profit as the ultimate result. Regardless of the effect on Chick-fil-A’s bottom line, this flare-up has shown the rapid publicity — both good and bad — that comes when companies jump into social issues.
With Cathy’s statements and Chick-fil-A’s donations to anti-LGBT groups, companies’ rights to moral and social stances have come to the forefront of public discussion. Consumers have just as much right to speak with their dollars as companies do, particularly when profits are being used to fund social agendas.
Bringing social values to a marketplace where a company’s success depends on consumer loyalty is a risky proposition fraught with public scrutiny and financial                          consequence.

With the recent abundance of mass shootings in the U.S., the subject of gun safety has once again been brought into the spotlight. These tragic events serve as reminders that stricter gun control policies should be enforced to ensure public safety.
According to The Center for Responsive Politics, gun activists argue that “measures intended to curb gun-related violence, such as mandatory child safety locks, background checks on those wishing to purchase a gun, limits on the number of guns a person can buy, and raising the age limit for gun ownership ... infringe on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.”
What these activists fail to realize is that neglecting to control gun ownership makes our streets more dangerous and violates every person’s right to life and liberty.
While the Second Amendment was meant for protection, guns without regulations give way to nothing but widespread violence and tragedies. In fact, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, there have been more than 61 mass shootings in the U.S. since the Jan. 8,  massacre in Tuscon, Arizona last year.
In what the FBI described as a “domestic terrorist-type incident,” seven people were killed and three injured at a Sikh temple in a Milwaukee suburb at the beginning of this month. In July, 12 people were killed and 58 injured during the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado. Even Pittsburgh witnessed the dangers of guns falling into the wrong hands when a gunman opened fire in the lobby of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in March, killing one and wounding seven.
The government isn’t doing enough in terms of enforcing gun control laws, thus making our streets more dangerous. As of 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that federal law does not prohibit members of terrorist organizations from purchasing or possessing firearms or explosives.
Furthermore, the GAO reported that “between February 2004 and February 2010, 1,225 firearm and three explosives background checks for people on terrorist watch lists were processed through the federal background check system, [and that] of these, 91 percent of the firearm transactions and 100 percent of the explosives transactions were allowed.”
If guns fall into the hands of potential terrorists, it defeats the purpose of the government’s pre-existing gun control measures.
The problem of gun violence needs to be addressed both from a cultural point of view and a political perspective. Guns have always been a part of life, and finding a happy medium for gun control is a daunting task.
The matter of finding a solution to gun violence is complicated by the fact that many gun activists believe  gun control measures do not provide any proven benefit to the public. However, stricter gun control laws have shown an improved general safety outside the U.S.
Australia has succeeded in implementing effective gun control laws, leading to a decrease in both gun suicides and homicides. The Australian federal government persuaded all states and territories to enforce stricter bans on long guns that could be used in mass shootings. While there were 13 mass shootings in Australia between 1979 and 1996, there have not been any since then, demonstrating how such measures have helped make Australia a safer place to live.
The bottom line is that while guns should not be outlawed entirely, there should be stricter laws enforcing gun control policies. In our country, since just about anyone can legally own a gun, it is much easier for tragedies to occur. While outlawing the use of guns is unconstitutional and unrealistic, enforcing proper gun control laws would create a much safer environment for everyone.

If you asked me on Aug. 10 who I was going to vote for, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you. I could vote for Mitt Romney for the sole purpose of defeating Barack Obama — and therefore Obamacare — or I could follow my heart and support my libertarian pipe dream in former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson. 
I’m a Republican-leaning libertarian, but Mitt Romney just doesn’t inspire me; I don’t know who he is or what he’s about. He seems distant, undefined, and wishy-washy.
Fortunately, Romney’s new vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan is just the opposite. The House Budget Committee Chairman represents what Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan calls the “future of the Republican Party.” He’s not part of the old establishment that embodies politics as usual; he’s part of the young, reform-minded group that is seriously concerned about our future.
Ryan has been nothing but consistent on his views. Republicans and Democrats may disagree about his ideas, but by all accounts, he’s a budget expert. 
In the same vein, he’s the only politician who has earnestly tried to address the long-run fiscal insolvency of our federal government.
Bringing those credentials to the table is important. The debate that has long been centered around attacks on Romney’s character will be shelved in favor of the real debate that defines this election. We have a choice between two very different futures: Do we become more like Europe or Singapore? More like California or Texas?
Republicans, embodied by Ryan’s budget plan, clearly favor a pro-market society in which anyone can make it if they work hard enough. Democrats favor a pro-business, entitlement society in which those who make it got there not because they’re smart or work hard, but because the government let them succeed. Choosing Ryan and his budget puts this distinct choice at the forefront of the election almost to the exclusion of everything else.
On a somewhat separate note, there seems to be confusion about Ryan’s budget — his house-passed plan to make America sustainable by 2050. In order to achieve that goal, there are tough decisions to be made, and this budget makes them.
Contrary to popular belief, this plan doesn’t end Medicare as we know it; the status quo ends Medicare as we know it. The program runs out of money in 2033 and that’s it.
Ryan’s budget voucherizes Medicare for those younger than 55 so we can let the market do its work and keep costs as low as possible. If you’re older than 55, nothing changes. There’s no pushing granny off a cliff; granny is fine under Ryan’s plan.
When it comes down to it, Democrats weren’t voting for Romney anyway. Similarly, Republicans weren’t about to vote for Obama anytime soon. This tells independent voters that it’s time to get serious. Now’s the time to make these decisions, and here’s where we stand. We’re going to balance budgets and leave this country in a decent place for our kids and their kids; that’s what the American Dream is all about.
I’m a registered independent and if you asked me today who I was going to vote for, I’d still tell you I’m not sure. 
But now at least I know exactly where Romney stands, and it’s a pretty attractive position.

Like many people my age, I established my basic political preferences via various news forms and dinner table discussions. The political advertisements that spring up during campaign season further influence my political leanings.
While it’s no news that political advertisements flaunt staggering statistics and shocking facts to capture the audience’s attention, this year’s advertisements contain excessive exaggeration and downright misinformation.
As an onlooker to the decadence of political advertising, I cannot help but wonder how much of our political preferences might be based on partisan prejudice. Furthermore, it’s important to consider the implications that dirty advertisements have for younger, more impressionable voters.
While political advertisements can be engaging, I began questioning their validity after a recent exposure to skewed facts.
A pro-Barack Obama PAC released an online advertisement insinuating that Republican candidate Mitt Romney was responsible for a cancer patient’s death. The deceased’s husband, Joe Soptic, appears in the advertisement, blaming Romney for his job loss and a resulting inability to afford the healthcare needed to prevent his wife’s cancer-related death.
Over an appropriately somber soundtrack, Soptic shares: “When Mitt Romney closed the plant, I lost my healthcare, and my family lost their healthcare....” In actuality, Romney was no longer involved in the business when Soptic lost his job and health insurance, and his wife had retained her own healthcare insurance for some years thereafter.
Soptic’s job loss was unrelated to his wife’s eventual loss of her own separate health insurance, and certainly none of their medical misfortune was related to Romney.
Although the Soptic advertisement was particularly questionable, I can’t say I’m surprised. The pro-Obama PAC stooped pretty low, but perhaps it was in retaliation to some equally mucky Republican advertisements.
One example lies in the Romney campaign’s airing a factually inaccurate “welfare ad,” which accused Obama of rescinding the employment requirements to receive welfare. This advertisement was designed to infuriate taxpayers by implying that Obama allows states to haphazardly dole out welfare checks to the undeserving.
In actuality, Obama merely allowed states to apply for exceptions to welfare reform rules in order to test run “demonstration projects” aimed at getting people on employment rolls.
Unfortunately, both campaigns have ensured that their twisted messages are virtually inescapable. Surely, I’m not the only one who feels frustrated when I’m forced to sit through 30 seconds of political slander before watching a YouTube video. Yet, the time taken to air the advertisement may not be in vain. These advertisements are designed to be effective whether we are consciously registering them or not.
Political advertisements seem much less credible this season, and I’ve decided not to succumb to their political pathos. But I believe that, if aired repeatedly, they are bound to make most people think there must be some truth in them.
As for impressionable young minds, dishonest campaign advertisements have tainted our view of the entire political system, perhaps irreversibly. This loss of respect for the process itself is probably the most serious side effect.
Thus, it is imperative that we uncover the raw facts via research, instead of allowing manipulative mudslinging to skew our political perception. After all, every vote counts, and it’s our responsibility to ensure that we are voting on truth.

If we could describe this summer’s Olympics in a word, it would be “modern.”
With its bright and jagged logo inspired by media, communications, and fashion; its captivating and confusing opening ceremony; and its futuristic-looking mascots, the London Games aspired to highlight prevalent issues like health care, sustainability, and the effects of technology.
Britain’s modern approach and theme of “inspiring a generation” was spot-on in setting the tone for this summer’s Games. In particular, the female Olympians seemed to take this theme to heart. With 204 countries and 10,820 athletes participating, the 2012 Summer Olympics marked the first time every country sent a female competitor to at least one of the events.
In categories like volleyball, gymnastics, weight lifting, and boxing, women took the Olympics by storm. Of course, as with most shifts in gender paradigms, there was backlash — sexist online comments, the suggestion that female boxers wear skirts to make it easier to differentiate genders, and other such statements. 
But the internet goes both ways, and female athletes are letting their voices be heard via interviews and blog responses like British weight lifting champion Zoe Smith’s viral blog post addressing sexist virtual commentary.
The unprecedented popularity that the live and television audiences showed for women’s sports, and boxing in particular, is not likely to die down.
Sure, the Games didn’t go perfectly; organizational flaws caused some seating to remain empty, some Olympians were disqualified for various reasons, and many local taxi drivers were annoyed by the street changes. But overall, the Games ran smoothly. The crowd was warm and enthusiastic, and the organizers focused on sustainability in terms of infrastructure, most of which will be dismantled, recycled, or sold. The London hosts succeeded in keeping the centuries-old tradition of the Olympic Games modern, and aware of social undercurrents.

Governor Tom Corbett traveled to sunny California last week — not for vacation, but to talk tech.
The focus of his visit was to promote Pennsylvania as an ideal breeding ground for startup companies and tech firms. The presentation at Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus included several Carnegie Mellon administrators and seven representatives of Carnegie Mellon-initiated startups.
Corbett being proactive and reaching out to tech companies — giant corporations and young startups alike — is a great leap forward for Pittsburgh and the state as a whole.
It’s no secret that our state’s economy is in crisis mode; Corbett’s 2012-13 budget cut funding to the University of Pittsburgh by 30 percent, and the Port Authority had to reduce its services by 15 percent in March of last year with a further cut of 35 percent planned for September. Similarly, job availability seems to be stagnant, and the unemployment percentage has been stuck at 7.5 percent since January. It’s also no secret that Pittsburgh leaders like Mayor Luke Ravenstahl have been trying to entice graduating students to stay in the region for years.
What could bring youth, money, and jobs to an area in one swoop? Startup companies — and Corbett understands this. Marketing his state in this way is attractive to outside companies looking for a place to develop their businesses. Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania need startup companies for the aforementioned reasons, but it’s also true that these companies need this region.
Pittsburgh is similar to what the West was during the Gold Rush — people knew there were riches to be had, but no one had utilized the region yet.
Established in 2002, Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus has served as an extension of the spirit of the Pittsburgh campus. It acted as the perfect backdrop for Corbett’s visit by combining Carnegie Mellon’s message of innovation and the notoriously famous tech atmosphere of Silicon Valley.
Silicon Valley is the leading site in tech startup companies, and to draw them closer to the East Coast, it’s essential to our city’s growth that Corbett showed them that Pittsburgh-based industries and projects can compete and work with Silicon Valley’s. Carnegie Mellon is strongest in its main campus, and showcasing the potential for Pittsburgh through a satellite campus was a smart choice for Corbett.
So while Corbett does not have a spotless record in decision making, he is making the right choice in boasting the state’s potential for tech companies of all sizes.

Although the bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh stopped in April, the FBI pursued the perpetrator to set an example for others who would seek to voice their discontent in the same way. Finally, on Aug. 15, District Attorney David Hickton announced the indictment of 64-year-old Adam Busby of Dublin, Ireland, for emailing some of the threats.
Busby’s arrest discourages future threats by demonstrating the consequences and the lengths to which the government will go to punish those offenses. However, attempts to give Busby a motive in this story will likely not only be fruitless, but will also undermine the FBI’s efforts and unduly validate the anonymous bomb threats as articulate statements of protest.
Without any demands, attempts at coercion, or even opinionated writings, the bomb threats were not statements, but only inarticulate expressions of aggression. This fact is poetically illustrated by Busby’s foreign background and lack of connection to Pitt. Perhaps he never had any reason to care about Pitt at all. But even if he wasn’t foreign and had a connection to Pitt, his actions were still anonymous and without purpose or motive.
Yet still, reporters at the FBI press conference and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette have attempted to discern Busby’s message. These efforts to, as the Post Gazette puts it, give Busby a “face” not only validate the bomb threats as articulate statements of discontent, but also implicitly shift the responsibility of articulating the statement away from the perpetrator and to the victim and the media. We applaud Attorney David Hickton for rightly declining to join in on the speculation.
In a previous issue, we had expressed how we feared that the bomb threats’ success at provoking reactions would popularize and encourage others to use bomb threats as outlets for aggression over other, more articulate, forms of communication. 
Although it comes as a relief that the perpetrator was arrested, it would be a mistake to recognize anonymous bomb threats as one of these forms of communication by attempting to discern meaning from the threats.
