The 25th-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team recently participated in the 2016 NCAA Division III Women’s Basketball Championship. The Tartans won their first round matchup against fifth-ranked Hope College and their second round game against 14th-ranked Ohio Northern University before falling in the sectional semifinal to 10th ranked Washington University in St. Louis. The Tartans finished 21–7 overall, tying the 1990-91 team’s school record for the most wins in a season.
On March 4, the Tartans opened their run in the tournament with a 73–72 victory against Hope College. The Tartans got off to an early lead, shooting for 50 percent from the field and amassing a 21–12 lead in the first quarter. During the second quarter, the Tartans out-rebounded the Flying Dutch 13–5 and scored 11 second-chance points off six offensive rebounds, heading into halftime with a 39–28 lead. In the third quarter, Hope started to make a comeback, outscoring the Tartans 25–21 as Carnegie Mellon’s lead was cut to seven points. Both teams fought hard as time ticked down in the fourth quarter. With 2:17 left in regulation, the Tartans held a slim 68–67 lead. A three pointer gave the Flying Dutch their first lead since making the first basket of the game, but junior center and forward Lisa Murphy quickly tied the game up 70 apiece. The Flying Dutch retook the lead with 21 seconds left, but Murphy earned three points for the Tartans after making a shot and converting an ensuing foul shot. Hope College made one last run to try and take the victory, but Murphy came down with the defensive rebound as time expired. Murphy closed the game with 25 points and 14 rebounds while senior forward Liza Otto tallied 19 points. Senior guard Lindsay Poss finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. The Tartans finished with 50 rebounds to 31 for Hope and 24 second-chance points.
On March 5, the Tartans defeated Ohio Northern University 68–65. The Tartans shot 53.8 percent in the first quarter while holding the Polar Bears to 31.6 percent, but had just a three-point lead after turning the ball over seven times. Two free throws by junior guard Jackie Hudepohl gave the Tartans their largest lead of the period at 13–6 with 5:06 to go. Hudepohl and Amy Bullimore of the Polar Bears led all scorers at the quarter break with eight points apiece. The Tartans grabbed 11 defensive rebounds while the Polar Bears made just five of their 20 attempts from the floor. The Tartans put nine shots in the basket and pushed their three-point advantage to 14 when Otto drained a three-pointer from the left wing for the last basket of the half, giving the Tartans a 39–25 lead at the break. A 14–2 run by the Polar Bears cut the Tartans lead to four with 4:56 to go in the third quarter, but the Tartans closed the third with an 11–6 run to hold a 10-point advantage heading into the final quarter. A 14–5 run through the first six minutes of the final period pulled the Polar Bears to within one point, and Ohio Northern later got their first lead since the first bucket of the game on a jumper in the paint with 2:32 to play. The Tartans answered and retook the lead on the next possession when Hudepohl drove the baseline and banked in a jumper in front of the hoop. After a defensive rebound by Otto gave the Tartans back the ball, first-year guard Jenn Mayberger found Murphy down low for a layup and a three-point Tartan lead before another shot by Ohio Northern brought the lead down to one. Poss was fouled with 12 seconds left and made one-of-two free throws but Otto grabbed the board on her miss and was fouled, sending her to the line with a two-point lead. Otto made the first but missed the second leaving an opportunity for the Polar Bears to tie the game; however, a last second three-pointer by Ohio Northern hit the rim and bounced to the floor advancing the Tartans to the sectional round of the NCAA Championship. Hudepohl led the Tartans with 20 points while Murphy tallied 17 and became the program’s all-time leading scorer with her 11th point of the game and now has 1,602 career points. Poss grabbed a team-high 13 rebounds to go with 12 points while Otto dropped in 11 points. Mayberger scored six points and grabbed nine rebounds to go with three assists.
On March 11, the Tartans fell to UAA rival Washington University in St. Louis 75–69. Back-to-back jumpers in the paint by Hudepohl gave the Tartans a 19–15 advantage going into the second quarter after four ties and two lead changes. The Tartans held their largest lead of 11 points with 1:45 to play in the second quarter and had a 33–26 halftime advantage after the Bears ended the period with two made buckets. Hudepohl was 6-of-6 from the field for the half and tied with Murphy for the leading scorers of the half with 12 points each. In the third quarter, the Bears retook the lead after making six of nine shots. The lead changed hands twice while the score was tied on three occasions through the final five minutes of the quarter with Washington University holding a slim 48–46 lead at the final break. The lead would swap hands nine times with the Tartans holding a 61–60 advantage following two free throws by sophomore guard Anna Novak with 4:16 to play. The Bears then went on an 8–0 run to grab their largest lead of the game, 68–61, before Hudepohl stopped it with a three-pointer from the wing with just under two minutes to play. Otto drained a jumper to pull the Tartans within two, 71–69, with 29 seconds to go but the Bears converted 4-of-4 from the free throw line to close out the game. Murphy led all scorers with 23 points while Hudepohl finished with 20 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Otto closed her career with 11 points while Poss tallied nine and grabbed nine rebounds in the final game of her career.
The season has been full of ups and downs for the Tartans. Though they weren’t able to make it to the final rounds, the season has undoubtedly been a success for the Tartans, who advanced all the way to the Sweet 16 before bowing out. The Tartans have fought hard all season, and the next one will certainly be worth looking forward to.

The Carnegie Mellon University women’s tennis team faced off against the Grove City College Wolverines on Wednesday, and the Tartans dominated their opponents throughout the competition to end the day with an impressive 9–0 victory. The Tartans improve to 9–5 on the season with the victory and are now ranked 7th nationally.
The Tartan women opened the match with explosive offensive play that netted them three victories in doubles play, each with a score of 8–0. The duo of junior Nicholle Torres and first-year Charlotte Deiss quickly swept their match in the second doubles position, while the tandem of sophomore Cori Sidell and first-year Minami Makino did the same in first doubles. The final duo to complete their match was senior Brooke Tsu and first-year Marina Selenica in third doubles to finish the doubles sweep.
At this point, the future of the match looked grim for the Wolverines. A comeback was still possible, but it was visibly evident that the Tartans had completely outmatched their opponents. Despite their growing lead, the Tartans did not become complacent. Carnegie Mellon maintained pressure for the entire competition and there seemed to be no stopping them.
Singles play proved to be no different than doubles as the Tartans picked the Wolverines apart, winning with straight set victories in every single match. Makino started the singles action off with the first point for the Tartans in a clean 6–0, 6–0 victory in third singles, and Selenica followed her lead to win by the same score line in fourth singles. Tsu did give up points in her singles sets, but she showed no signs of weakness as she took the match 6–1, 6–1 in first singles to put the Tartans up a comfortable 6–0. Deiss maintained the tempo by winning 6–1, 6–0 in sixth singles, and first-year Jamie Vizelman showed promising play as she dominated her second singles match 6–0, 6–0. Senior Abbey Hamstra finished the day by winning 6–1, 6–1 in fifth singles, earning the ninth and final point for the Tartans.
The Tartans will use this success as a confidence boost, but by no means will they underestimate their next opponent because of the win. The Tartan women take on Westminster College at home on Monday, March 21 at 4 p.m., and they are going to be hungry for another victory.

While the vast majority of students were enjoying spring break, a few Carnegie Mellon athletes sacrificed their time for a two-day conference battle on the golf course. The Carnegie Mellon Women’s and Men’s Golf teams took on their University Athletic Association (UAA) opponents on the grounds in Sorrento, Florida for the UAA Championships.  The championships both took place across the weekend of March 12 and 13.
On the women’s side, sophomore Summer Kitahara shined, and was named tournament champion for her efforts.  Building off of an 82 on Saturday, Kitahara came back with a 76 stroke round on the second day, tying teammate and first-year Carly Jordan for the lowest one round stroke total in the tournament.
As a team, the women finished third after two days, in what amounted to a solid showing on the course.  Carnegie Mellon fell a bit behind rivals Washington University in St. Louis and New York University on the first day, with a first round score of 364 leaving them 37 strokes out of second place.  But the women saw significant improvement on the second day, recording a 21-stroke improvement day to day for a total score of 707.
The stroke counts for the women were a bit higher than those from the previous weekend when they competed at the TaylorMade-Adidas Intercollegiate Tournament in Dataw Island, South Carolina, where they recorded a 686, but given Kitahara’s impressive display, this still showed strong Carnegie performances. The women also played without a few team members, including a frequent low scorer in sophomore Emma Hoskins.
The Tartan men found some success in a different format, going 1–1 in a match play format championship set up on their way to securing third place at the event.  Junior George Qian secured All-tournament recognition for his team leading performances, recording wins in his head to head matchups on both days.
The Tartans opened up against Emory with a tough setback, contesting almost every individual matchup, but still falling 5–1 with many close losses.  The team’s sole win came from Qian, but was not enough to advance the squad to the final.
However, the group rebounded on Sunday, taking down New York University 4–2, led by a 4–2 win from Qian, and wins by sophomores Nikhil Mohan and Adrian Del Bosque.  The deciding fourth victory came from junior Jordan Klodowski, who won his matchup 3–2 to seal the result.
While neither team performance was outstanding, both teams showed they have the strong play to be competitive going forward.  Both teams will look for consistent depth to back up large contributions from their top performers.
For the women, great play from Jordan, who finished 3rd overall at the UAA championship, shows potential for a team with two individuals scoring under 80 strokes in a round, and the ability to have all five golfers scoring under 85 strokes bodes well going forward.
The men similarly have the chops to put a strong group behind Qian.  Four other men, Mohan, Del Bosque, Klodowski, and junior Brad Jennette have all recorded scores of 75 strokes or lower, showing the team’s capability to score well under 300 strokes in a round if everyone can play consistently.
Both the men’s and women’s teams will now look for a qualifying bid to the NCAA championships in May, although this will be a challenge without the benefit of an automatic bid available in many conferences.
Continuing the following week at the Jekyll Island Collegiate Invitational, the women have shown a spark in their first two rounds, recording the lowest team score for a round in program history with a 318 in the second round.  The men have also had success so far, recording an impressively low round score of 293 in the second round.  If the teams can extend their success, the results may bode well for a shot at an NCAA championship qualifier.

Zeke Rosenberg (Senior Staff, The Tartan): Alright, so my first question is why did you decide to run? And I guess that kind of goes to both of you. Why did you decide to run, how did you decide on running mate, why did you decide to accept?
Trevor Hadick (junior chemical engineering and engineering & public policy double major, student body presidential candidate): I’ll go first. So, I’ve been involved in student government my entire time here on campus. Sophomore year I served under student body president, Ian Glasner, and student body vice president, Shalini Ray, in their cabinet. Then I came as Student Body Vice President of Organizations (VPO) this year and now I’m running as president. The biggest [reason] why is that the involvement has given me a lot of experience. I’ve seen a lot of large discussions. Student Government Executive Branch (Exec) has a lot of really big umbrella topics: discussions about this campus, where we are currently, where are we going. That has included things like diversity and inclusion on this campus and some larger issues in terms of tuition increases. 
Seeing all [of] that and being aware of the impact that Student Government has and what we can do, I think the biggest thing about why I’m running is that there are things that we can change, and I believe that I have the ability to do that, both through the connections that I have from my current role as well as knowing the correct approaches and the procedures to get those things done. That’s why I’m running, and I think that I can do it.
Why did I choose Micah to run with me? Micah is currently my Director in the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSo). The way that CoSo is structured is that we have representatives, and between the representatives we elect directors who both lead a time or [become] representatives and run a process. We have three separate processes. My directors are my right hand and my go-to. We work together on a lot of things. When we have to make tough decision about where CoSo is going in the future it’s me and the three of them. So I establish a really good working relationship with them over the year. Nina Fan is one of my directors who’s also running. Micah and I had a really good working relationship going into this. She has a lot of the same drive and passion that I have, and I thought she’d be really good for the role. That’s why I selected her. 
Micah Rabin (first-year decision science major, vice presidential candidate): Coming in at the beginning of this year I had always been interested in politics and making a bigger impact on wherever I was and whatever I’m doing. So first thing this year I joined CoSo, tried to get on a number of student organizations, and tried to become as involved in student government as I could. After doing that, I saw the impact that we could potentially have on the student body and the impact that I could potentially make. When Trevor asked me to run with him I was very thrilled about it. I am so excited to see what we can do for the students and to push our initiatives and really make things happen, which is what we’ve been doing, and what I started doing at the beginning of the year. I’m excited to run. 
ZR: One quick semantic question before we get into past stuff. I actually didn't know what Special Ticketing meant when I was looking through your platform. Could you clarify that? 
TH: Oh, the online ticketing. In the beginning of the year, one of Assistant Director of Student Activities Elizabeth Rapoport’s goals for coming to this campus was to modernize it. We sell tickets in one of the oldest fashion ways that we can, which is to stand outside and say “Hey, buy this ticket.” That includes paying cash for it. We’re just now starting to get to where you can swipe a credit card and things like that. This really directly applied to student organizations so she and I met. She asked, “Do you see this happening on this campus,” and I saw it happening. Obviously there’s going to be a transition, a rough period, but we worked together to find a solution. 
If you look at the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) allocations we have a discretionary fund, so I used my discretionary fund to pay for the modernized system. We created an organization implementation process so that if an organization wants to use the new system, they meet with the Office of Student Activities and go through an approval process and set all that up. There were some other people who bought into the system like Student Life so that they could use it as well, but I really funded the system. The Student Senate also pitched in, and we worked together to insure that organizations are getting what they need out of it. 
We’ve looked at the numbers and the VPO to decide if we will buy into it next year. It’s a really good opportunity. It’s one of those things where we started with a good number, the system works fine, and now we’re trying to get more organizations to use it. It’s not as vocalized as I think organizations want it to be, but that’s because in the first year we were testing to make sure there weren’t a lot of problems before we say “Hey, everyone use it!” and everything crashes and we can’t do it. The organizations that have used it are Lunar Gala, Student Senate, and the Graduate Student Assembly. It’s for larger events right now. It’s a lot of set up and we are trying to learn, so mainly it was the 200 plus or 100 plus people groups that got it. 
ZR: Thanks for clarifying that. Let’s talk about Summit. Not necessarily Summit in general, but more the application process. From what I understand it seems that meeting with a CoSo advisor has been replaced with an application to streamline the process. Is that an accurate representation of what happened?
TH: The application has always been required because we keep a file of them so that we can go back to past years and look at things. The part that was replaced was the meeting with the representative, and instead there was leadership development workshop. They still had to fill out an application, but the part where you met with a representative was replaced with a workshop. 
ZR: Okay. Is there still an avenue for rerecognition for clubs that are older and have outdated constitutions and bylaws? Is there a way for them to meet with representatives or has Summit replaced that entirely?
MR: I redid the entire rerecognition for mature organizations, which are organizations that have been on campus for more than seven years, this year. The way it works is that an organization will submit an online form and answer a lot of questions. Our representatives are going over all of their organization’s forms, and if they see any red flags then they will meet with those organizations. If any other things come up or if the organization wants to meet with someone to help them along with certain things they can definitely meet with their representative. It’s not mandated for every organization anymore, but we are looking for red flags and organizations that are slipping through the cracks. 
TH: If the organization is young, mature, or new they will go to that [specific] director. A lot of times that director will meet with them because directors are considered to be more experienced and have more background knowledge and [an] overall sense of what’s going on. A lot of times organizations reach out to me as well and I will direct them to a director because the director is a bit more experienced than a representative would be and are more able to help organizations that want the help.  
ZR: Going forward, do you see Summit as one workshop where all of the organizations send one student leader, or do you see it as more of a set of different things that different people can come to and have different learning experiences? Obviously each club has different needs and leadership isn’t even a part of some clubs. Is there a process going forward for tailoring that to specific organizations? 
TH: We are keeping student organizations as a major part of our plan going forward. Director of Young Organizations Hannah Kim is on our proposed cabinet, and Director of New Organizations Nina Fan is stepping into VPO. 
We have reflected on how Summit went this year. This was the first year, and we’ve learned a ton of stuff. How we’ve envisioned it going forward, and this will ultimately be up for Nina to decide, but where conversation is right now is that the Carnegie Leadership Consultants (CLCs) work under Elizabeth Rappaport, and we want to bridge the gap between them and us. We still value leadership development, but we’ve learned that the one all-day didn’t accomplish everything we wanted it to because different organizations have different needs and the time commitment was an issue. In the future there are going to be different sessions on different topics throughout the fall and the spring, and you will have the option to choose what your organization is interested in. What we did in Summit was three topics the whole day. Instead we are going to break that up and spread that out, and organizations will have the option to choose which is best for them. Exactly how many options there will be and how many are required isn’t decided yet, but that’s how we see things going forward. 
MR: The sessions we had at Summit were event planning, finance, and leadership. We are going to break those down into a couple more, and basically do exactly what Trevor said. 
ZR: Okay, let’s move onwards to your platform. The first thing I wanted to ask about was transportation and bike sharing. What form of bike sharing do you envision? How is that going to end up working, and what does that look like in your platform? 
TH: The Student Body Executive Branch started this conversation in the fall because that is when we give a recommendation for the transportation fee. Parking and Transportation brought a proposal to us, and they said, ‘Hey, the University of Pittsburgh is looking into getting into bike sharing. We want to know if you are interested in this being an option for students. We don’t have a lot of information, but should we investigate?’ Unfortunately the Executive Branch said, 'No, we don’t think we should.' I was the sole voice that said 'yes, let's investigate, let's gain more information.' This isn’t a 'yes, we are going to do this.' This isn’t 'yes, we’re in.' This is, 'we don’t have enough information to make a decision right now.' The company was just reaching out to us and the University of Pittsburgh to get where we stand. 
I recently met with the Director of Parking & Transportation series, Michelle Porter, to talk more about this.
MR: We met with her a couple of weeks ago, Trevor and I.
TH: Yeah, we met to discuss where we are going now and what the future looks like. The University of Pittsburgh is working on with them, so I told Michelle to loop back in on that discussion to see where things are at. We’re trying to lower the price. Their initial idea was that we would pay the fee for each individual person, but we said that’s impossible. That would cost us so much. So when we met we told her to continue to investigate we need to get the price much lower. I know that the University of Pittsburgh wouldn’t be on board with paying per person either, so the company will need to think of an option, maybe different packages and things like that. 
So, the bikes that we’re talking about are the —
MR: CityShare. Another thing about that, one of our main concerns when we were speaking with her was where the bikes are placed around the city. You know, are they accessible from our campus? If the only one is in Shadyside then no one is going to use it. And so she sent me a map with where all the bikes are, and there are a couple in Oakland but then she said that she would speak with the company as well and in negotiations with Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh getting into this bike sharing program then add more bikes in Oakland. 
TH: Yeah, and I think the last thing that we were discussing was a good, short, immediate effect to get a Carnegie Mellon discount for students. That can happen very quickly.  
MR: That could happen in the fall.
TH: Right. I think the longer term, when this price actually comes down to what they think they would charge us, is if that is something that should go into the transportation fee, where exactly does that fall, how much is that. That’s a larger discussion that all of the Executive Branch will be included on, but that’s kind of the two tails. This counts now, the exact cost and is that part of transportation fee, and exactly how does that all loop together moving forward. 
ZR: Alright. The second thing regarding student activities fee you want to do is researching ways to lower the student activities fee. How’s research going? Any things you can let us in on that maybe you’d want to do specifically, or is it more just getting down and seeing what there is?
TH: Yeah, so, I think one of the tough things, and [things] we could spend hours going through, is the flow chart. There’s a fiscal flow, this is again an Executive Branch topic. The money that starts in the beginning flows through all these different accounts and organizations are at the very bottom. Seeing where that fiscal flow goes, there are constant percentages and deviations and things break off and it is very confusing. Every time a new Executive Branch comes in we spend two hours to learn it. So, I think some of the biggest things right now is to really evaluate that flow, and to see if that flow is appropriate. Is it flowing to the right places? Are the right amounts flowing in? And sometimes that may come down to not a decrease in the fee but maybe it’s a change in flow to get more money to organizations because that is where the biggest impact is felt. It’s looking at every dollar that flows through there and a lot. 
I would say in terms of research now, we’ve learned recently a lot about the capital funds. A couple of years ago JFC moved capital funds staying inside of their JFC main, and now instead they are in a capital account. I think that’s one major area, looking into that. I think the other main area is looking into the Student Government Operating Reserves, and exactly how things flow into there, because they are all percentages off of other percentages and making sure there is proper recycling and all of that. It’s a lot because it’s a lot of money but two it’s a lot of flow, so really looking through all of that. The Executive Branch has that conversation every fall, we give a recommendation to the board of trustees as to what we think the amount should be. This year, it’s wasn’t unanimous, the board voted I believe 2.1, you guys ran a graph of it so you have the exact [number], but that was not a unanimous 2.1 increase. There were conversations all over the board regarding that. I think it’s [about] continuing to look into that because we’re sticking with inflation, which is why we did a 2.1 or a CPI, but do we exactly need that 2.1? Or do people just raise the 2.1 to raise the 2.1?
ZR: And then, just another area of finance: the media fee. So you’re going to deliver newspapers to people’s doors and stuff. You're going to deliver The Tartan? 
TH: The media fee, right now has been pretty consistent. This is another Executive Branch topic. It’s been pretty consistent. It’s ten dollars. I believe that’s per semester, and basically what that covers is all of what you can find in the news stands. It pays for all that, and we pay per paper. So if we get a hundred of them delivered and ten people take them we pay for the ten we don’t pay for all one hundred. Which is a really good system and several years ago someone fought hard for that system and we’re glad we have it. 
I think some of the investigation that partially goes into this, I’ve worked with the Student Senate on this recently, is they’re looking to get these papers in Entropy. They wouldn’t be free on the weekends, but students or visitors would have the option to buy them. There have been a lot of students who have raised the concern, especially first years, that they would like to buy these papers on the weekend but there is no place to actually buy them here. So even with DineEx they’d be willing to pay for them. In the longer term, looking into Executive Branch finances, how much is spent. There may be options that have those weekend papers for free. There was a time a long time ago, maybe five or six years, that those were free, and no one was getting them at all. So the system was removed, but there can be investigations into whether we should bring that back or not.  
And then the last thing is publicizing that we actually have free codes to get into the New York Times. A lot of students want the online option to get in there, but they say, ‘Hey, we don’t have that,’ but we actually have those codes available. There’s a set amount, and different papers have different numbers. This information is online and Student Senate can also provide that. I hear from a lot of students, ‘Hey, we wish we could do this online,’ and you actually can. You just need the code and the proper information. So, ensuring that despite it only being ten dollars people are getting the most out of that money and all their needs are being met through that fee. 
ZR: Okay, so now moving away from the funding of stuff, a big portion of your campaign it seems has to do with diversity. A lot of these things are unconscious biases. How do you plan to work towards these goals through a top-down approach for Student Government? What can we expect to see that you think will improve the diversity of both people at Carnegie Mellon and the organizations here?
MR: So just to speak on the structure of how we plan to do it, and then Trevor can go into what we plan to do. Basically, the way our cabinet works is we have a director for each of our platform points or initiatives. Brooke Carter, who is our Director of Diversity, has been working really hard and meeting with lots of different administrators, who Trevor can talk about, to really push for that. Then she will bring information back to us and then also bring information back down. It’s a really great system that we’ve created to ensure that we have all the information and we’re not going into things blind, but also the students feel like they have a voice and that it’s getting to us directly through Brooke.
TH: To build on that as it relates to organization and their diversity and inclusion, a lot of the positive feedback that we heard from Summit was that organization leaders got to talk to other organization leaders that they had never gotten the chance to talk to. So some of this was the whole idea of, ‘hey, how do you make this event so successful’ or ‘how do you get people to come’ or there were some groups that were like ‘why don’t people come to my event.’ And people were able to have an honest conversation about ‘people don’t come for this reason’ or ‘this is how your organization is portrayed.’ I think that’s the first step. It’s having those conversations and a lot of open dialogue. Organization leaders are typically pretty open to coming together and having discussions regarding this. They take their organizations seriously. A lot of organizations are very aware and concerned about this. They want to be inclusive, but sometimes they don’t know how. Sometimes they don’t know that to the campus they feel exclusive. So a lot of this is open dialogue. A lot of organizations leaders know me and respect me and bringing those together would be really good as it relates to student organizations.
As it relates to the campus, so far this past year we’ve done a lot of more of a presentation style. There was the President's Dinner that was related to diversity, and Martin Luther King Jr. talks were related [to] diversity and inclusion. But there’s not enough well-timed discussion times. I know one point where people wanted to have a lot of discussion was after the Sexual and Relationship Violence (SARV) reports came out. There was not discussion until two weeks later, and people wanted a lot of discussion that night that it was sent out. There was kind of a disconnect between the administration and us when no one stepped up and said, ‘Hey, we’d like to have a discussion after that.’ But at the same time the administration had the discussion planned but it wasn’t at a well-planned time. Something we’ve already vocalized about when they release the DASH survey about diversity and inclusion [is] that the discussion needs to be that night because that’s when students want to talk. We have a lot on our plates. We’ll forget two weeks from now. We’ve kind of cooled down, and we’ve forgotten what our points were.
Having discussions that night is a big things. There are more surveys in the works. Moving away from this presentation style that we do a lot of for diversity and inclusion. Recently some students in my gender studies class had an open discussion about certain words that people use on campus, you know, ‘how does that make you feel,’ and ‘why do you think people use that.’ So, really focusing on discussions and less on presentations. 
ZR: The second thing about diversity is your LGBT+ initiative. To me a lot of these things occur with physical space and where it is safe to be a LGBT+ person. Do you have anything right now that could speak to that particular concern or just more generally about how your LGBT+ initiatives will work?
MR: So we both, he chairs the committee University Center Allocations Board (UCAB) and I’m the assistant chair for it, so we have been working very closely with the new construction on the University Center. One thing that we made sure is happening is that there are all-gender inclusive bathrooms in the new section of the University Center, and we are working on getting it in other buildings on campus. That’s one of our biggest initiatives when it comes to that, and making sure that LGBT+ people feel safe wherever they are on campus, along with the new housing initiative in Morewood that is offering people who identify as genderfluid or identify as anything they feel and want to live in an all-gender inclusive space the option to do that. So many schools are doing that and we were really behind on that. So, those are our two big points.
TH: And to build on that, Student Senate has also formed an ad hoc committee that is also working on these things. So we are partnering forces with them. The [Cohon Center (CC)] has been a great step forward in ensuring that there were all-gender bathrooms. There are also things in the restrooms as well. I can send you the list of exactly what will be included in you’d like that.
But moving on from that since we already have that kind of achieved, looking forward one of the major things is having a consistent labeling of bathrooms or any spaces in general. I believe it was West Virginia had some, I don’t want to call them riots, but there were some unhappy students because of offensive signage that was used. So being [as] proactive as we are creating these spaces and ensuring that signage is appropriate and not offensive and that it’s consistent across campus. Every building has a building manager, so although my signage here may be appropriate signage in another building may not be. So a lot of those [building managers] will work with Campus Design and Facility Development (CDFD) and with Dean of Student Affairs and Associate Vice President Gina Casalegno and that Student Senate committee to ensure that we have a process moving forward. 
There’s also a very strong push as well to this. Right now it’s practice to have an all-gender restroom in each building, but there’s not actually a policy for that. So although it’s good to have practices like this, it’s better to get them in writing. That’s also something that we’re discussing and working with Gina on. Seeing, you know, exactly what is that wording, where could it be put in. Some of the difficulty with that is that there’s a specific number of bathrooms per building based on size and all that, so it’s ensuring that we don’t put in a policy and then it there’s a small building put up it doubles the cost. So we are trying to be aware of all of those things, but that’s where those initiatives are going forward. 
ZR: With college rankings, this is something the school’s administration has been working on for years, since before any of us got here, trying to get donations and things like that. What do you think, from the president’s position, you’ll be able to do to tangibly improve that?
TH: This partially ties in to the whole transportation aspect. There are so many different websites or companies that rank us, and each algorithm is different. One simple change may change one but may not change all the other ones. So part of it is looking into specific rankings and seeing exactly what their algorithm is and researching what we can do to that. 
One of the most common ones or ones that we recently saw is the Athletics on [SLANT12]Niche.com[SLANT12] was a C and parking was also a C. So as a club sport executive board member I’ve been working a lot with Anthony Miller to see where club sports are, where club sports are going, and what resources they have. Student government used to pay for their coaches, and we ensured that would be kept so we transitioned that to athletics. So there are things like that, and athletics and broad. It’s partially that, and there are things like parking and transportation that also affect us by rankings. By having bike share programs and things like that we can also affect those. I think sometimes because we have a multiyear culture of increasing rankings by getting donations we forget that’s not the only thing that increases those rankings, and I think that’s something for people to know. There are other ways that we can also increase those besides just donations.
But I think the other thing is being supportive of the initiative of President Subra Suresh. There will be times when people need tours done for people who may give donations and things like that. The Student Government Executive Branch has always been open in the past to providing any assistance that we can. It’s keeping that door open and that support so that if there are people who would like to meet with us and hear more about the campus and what student government is doing we are there. 
I think the last thing is that the organization culture is to not really utilize your alumni. There are some organizations that do it really well and have this great alumni networks, and a lot of organizations that want an alumni network but don’t know how to create one. So that’s one of the things that we addressed in the Summit, was how to start that alumni network. It’s not always about the money that you get from the alumni. Sometimes it’s the advice; sometimes it’s the help, the resources. But creating one of those is really great. 
A lot of those rankings differ a lot so there’s not one set thing you can do [to] increase those across the board. It depends where you’d like to focus and on what ranking. That’s why we left it broad. The things we do might increase one but may not increase any of the other ones. So that’s kind of where that is. 
ZR: Those are the things I really wanted to ask about. Is there anything else you want to throw in?
TH: Do you have anything you’d like to add?
MR: No, I think that’s all really great, honestly.

Claire Gianakas (Editor-in-Chief, The Tartan): First off, how did you get interested in running for these positions? 
Olivia Cannizzaro (sophomore mathematical sciences major, student body vice presidential candidate): My freshman year, right off the bat, I was interested in student government and last year I ended up working on the campaign team of [junior mathematical sciences major] Connie Yang, and [senior information systems major] Evan Wineland. Helping them out, I got to see a little bit more of what it was like — what the position would actually entail, the responsibility level, the things you would be able to accomplish — and I got really excited about it. After that I became part of a few other organizations that I felt would allow me to more directly impact the student body. Proud to Be Plaid and Highland Ambassadors let me interact more with members of the administration. I got to see Carnegie Mellon University from both sides and really understand where each side was lacking; where the administration felt that they weren't getting the response that they wanted or needed from students and where students felt that a lot of the time they were not being appreciated or treated the way they would like to be treated for the work they were putting in. I figured that besides joining these different organizations, the way that I could most directly impact the university and do something really meaningful would be from the position of student body vice president. Mike asked me to run last year and I was really excited about it, but I didn't say yes right away. I wanted to think about it. The two of us discussed things like platform, things that we could legitimately accomplish, and what good we could do for the school. Between all of that and the ideas we came up with, I was really excited about the change that I could make. 
Mike McCaffrey (junior statistics major, student body presidential candidate): Unlike Olivia, I didn't know I wanted to become involved in student government immediately. I actually was kind of dragged in by Ashley Reeder (MCS ’14) who sat as the vice chairperson of Student Senate. I was brought into Student Senate and later joined the Joint Funding Committee (JFC). I saw student government from all of these different angles and gained some interesting insight. Later that year, I was brought on as campaign manager for the campaign of [fifth year senior with a double major in electrical and computer engineering and business administration] Ian Glasner, and [masters student in health care policy in the School of Public Policy and Management] Shalini Ray. I later became their chief of staff, so I really got to see what it was like to be in [a] cabinet and what we could do better. What really motivated me to run for student body president is all of my personal relationships with different people and seeing how a lot of different students have all these different struggles that the university doesn't really attend to, which might be because of several reasons, whether it be turning a blind eye or they might just not know or might not have the opportunity to address it.
CG: You’ve talked a lot about student input, especially with regard to healthy food options and overall changes in dining services. Can you talk about how you propose to get the student body involved?
OC: We spoke with Pascal Petter, the director of dining services, to get a little more information about that. Something interesting that we’ve seen consistently among the different administrative members that we've spoken to is that there are so many opportunities in place that students don't know about, that aren't getting promoted in the way that they should be. They just kind of get done, and a few people know about them, attend them, and give their input, but most people aren't even aware that they're happening. Petter told us about a few different ways that students can get involved, about these different meetings that they hold, but we also want to make these administration members seem accessible to students. We could potentially have open forums in which students can voice their complaints. Mike and I are really accessible and we would be willing to hear a multitude of people's complaints, input, and things that they want to do. We could then attend these meetings and be able to say ‘We've heard from multiple students and these are issues.’ One of the things that Pascal said to us was that if we can identify issues and find multiple students that agree, then it's something that he's willing to move forward with. We want to get an idea of what the student body wants to change and help them to communicate that, whether directly or indirectly. 
MM: Another thing we can definitely take advantage of is the student body president office hours that in the past haven’t been well advertised. We hope to just hang out in a room talking about ideas with different people, whoever’s interested, whoever’s passionate about the issues. 
CG: Can you talk a little more about your specific agenda points regarding the dining plan?
MM: One of the big things we want to accomplish if we win is to extend hours at the coffee shops on campus, particularly La Prima. A lot of students spend time in that area and they don't really have access to coffee, so everyone ends up in the library. It gets crowded, and there's a lot of unused space that we would like to take advantage of. 
OC: Another thing is at a lot of different universities, from an administrative standpoint, meal plans are subsidized. All students are on plans because financially it doesn't make sense not to be. They get a good mixture of taking advantage of what's easy on campus and also cooking for themselves outside, and it becomes financially feasible to do both. It's a mutually beneficial sort of thing where students aren't paying nine dollars for some small meal. It’s something on a meal plan that feels easy to purchase and the university overall would be making more money. This is something that we spoke to Petter about as well. The people working with dining are very enthusiastic about this, and it’s something that they're also looking to accomplish, so it’s something that we want to help support and get student motivation for.
MM: To be clear, that's definitely more of a long-term goal. I don't think we'd be able to accomplish that in just our term, but the relationship that we develop with dining would hopefully continue into the future and make sure there is communication and encouragement for students to participate in the dining plan past their freshman year.
OC: Also, in terms of vending machines, we would potentially send out a poll to campus over email to see what sorts of things students want to see in the vending machines. This would then require us reaching out to those brands and asking if they are willing to do some sort of agreement in which we would have their goods in our vending machines. 
CG: Moving on to health, another big point in your platform, can you talk about the need to address health on campus and your proposed changes?
MM: One of the big issues that Carnegie Mellon faces is a lack of support. A lot of people don't know who to turn to when they have problems. It's not easy to turn to friends when you have academic issues or mental health issues because there's a culture — and I hate to use the word stress — but stress culture, where everyone tries to hide that side of themselves. We’ve come up with initiatives to help people share that side of themselves and actually enjoy the university [a] little bit more.  
OC: In terms of sexual health, we want to continue to support efforts that are already in place and make sure that those don't falter. There's been such a headstrong effort towards great progress, and we want to see that be something that gets continued support. One of the things we want to do is continue expansion of the [Survivor Support Network (SSN)] by encouraging people who are in leadership positions on campus to get SSN certified. I was an [orientation counselor (OC)] and they put us through training in which we got unofficial training in how to handle these sexual assault cases. I think it would be invaluable for all orientation counselors, resident assistants, and community advisers to have that. We could come back early in the summer and it would be part of our training. 
With regard to mental health, something that shocked me after OC training was that I had friends with these issues who had no idea about the opportunities available to them. I have referred multiple people who have found it to be very helpful. Similar to what Student Senate is doing right now with their mental health awareness campaign, we would want to definitely support and promote more things about [Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS)] and about services available on campus. We want to hold more mental health certification events on campus, which we have pretty infrequently, and make that something people are aware of. We want to establish a peer-to-peer 24/7 hotline, which would require reaching out to students to see who would be willing to be a part of it. We would probably set it up similar to SafeWalk, where it’s a self run thing that students are able to do. Right now we have 24/7 hotlines with professionals, but other universities have peer-to-peer hotlines, which can make people feel a lot more comfortable. A long-term goal would be to build and foster a support network, which could be similar to the SSN, for mental health, so that if people have a crisis or a breakdown they could say ‘Oh, this person is mental health certified. I can go to them and get help, and they’ll actually be able to give me valuable input.’
MM: For a lot of these initiatives we definitely want to bring in outside organizations. We’re aware of Active Minds, a fantastic organization that started last year. They already have over a hundred people in their organization that are super passionate about these issues and doing amazing things.
CG: Your platform also focuses on global engagement. Can you talk about why you feel global engagement is important for students and what you are planning to do to address that?
OC: I have a lot of friends from home who go to different private schools and politics is something really important to them. One thing that I'm grateful for is that people aren’t crazy with it here at Carnegie Mellon. People don't get vicious about it. There isn't any sort of negative attitude towards it. On the other hand, I feel like we might be at the other end of the spectrum, where we’re not as aware of things as other campuses. There are certain things that are happening that are amazing in terms of diversity and LGBT+ initiatives and we’ve got groups on campus for that. They're doing really good things to make people culturally aware and we want to expand that. We want to support the things that are happening and break the idea of the Carnegie Mellon bubble, a term that seems to have caught on to represent people who feel like ‘Oh, this is happening in the world and I didn't even know.’ We think it's really important to be a global citizen and an informed individual in your daily life and your job. Being able to communicate with people and know what's happening makes you an intellectually well-rounded and mature person.
One of the things we want to do, which a member of Student Senate said that they've also been trying to push, is to secure funding for flat-screen televisions in eating areas like the [Cohon Center (CC)], which would air a variety of news sources with closed captions. When someone is taking a break and sitting, or maybe standing in those incredibly long lines for a salad, they could look up and say ‘Oh, there's what's happening in politics. There's what's happening with this.’ I get that from [ITAL][The]Wall Street Journal[ITAL] app, but that costs money and not everyone wants to do that. We want this knowledge to be accessible. We want to potentially provide students with the opportunity to subscribe to a weekly digest, which would give them an idea of some major events. Similar to apps like [ITAL]The Wall Street Journal’s[ITAL] app, you'd get pop up events. It would be a sort of bullet point list, so everyone could check their email and say ‘Oh, this is what's been going on.’ We also want to make newspapers readily available to students outside high traffic areas. I know that we have them available in places on campus now, but even so I still feel like if I wanted to get one I wouldn't know where to get one off the top of my head. 
MM: All of these initiatives go towards making people more aware of what's going on globally, but more importantly we want to stir discussion between students on campus and make people more engaged with each other in general. 
OC: Absolutely. We're going to be the future, and I think it's important that people who are college-educated have an idea of these sorts of things moving forward because a lot of people at Carnegie Mellon have the potential to do great things in terms of tackling these issues.
CG: With regard to Unity, you talk about improving rankings and our alumni network. Can you talk about your specific ideas regarding these issues?
MM: We are both part of Proud to Be Plaid, which is a committee that works to raise awareness of what Carnegie Mellon actually does for its students, whether it be where tuition is actually allocated and how that money gets spent, or how decisions are made and how rankings work. We mixed that in with our campaign platform and since we see these issues from a Proud to Be Plaid perspective, we're able to identify some catalysts for further unifying Carnegie Mellon as a student body. Some of those initiatives include coordinating mixers between different majors and bridging these big gaps between, say, computer science majors and design majors, because it's not that they dislike each other or don't want to meet each other, it's more that they don't know how to meet each other.
OC: Also speaking on Proud to Be Plaid, this is something that Mike and I are especially passionate about. It's something we've been working on together for two years now and it's very interesting to see this trickle-down effect that happens with it. When you foster this idea of unity among students, students become more excited about their university. It becomes something that they want to reinvest in. They're promoting it, and that's something that factors into our national rankings. It’s something that improves our alumni network. Suddenly people are getting better jobs. People are better connected. We've seen the progress we've been able to make through this committee, and working directly with Student Giving and the Alumni Relations. 
We also want to promote attendance at athletic events and support Carnegie Mellon’s athletes through social events. What we mean by that is continuing to support events like Friday Night Lights that make people excited to attend athletic events. We don't naturally have this enthusiasm embedded in our culture. Not only is it important on our end to be excited about Carnegie Mellon and the things that we're doing and to be proud of the effort that we put forward, but it’s also important to support our athletes, who on top of the really hard workload that we have here are varsity athletes. That's an incredible time commitment and it’s something that should be supported as a whole by the student body. This support would allow us to feel more involved with it, and it wouldn’t feel like a divide between students who aren’t involved in sports and students who are. 
We are also interested in allowing IDeATe courses to fulfill general education requirements across majors, which would also be a long-term thing. IDeATe courses try to integrate business, technology, and art to show students that they have all developed unique skills that rely on one another. Instead of saying technical majors versus arts majors, they say these are all things that really need one another in order to succeed and do something really incredible. If those courses could fulfill general education requirements for any major, people would be more encouraged to take them since it would count as credit and they’d be able to learn more outside of their field of study.
Another thing we want to establish is a sort of overall Carnegie Mellon pride day. When we spoke to Student Senate, they were also interested in doing this, and it’s so exciting to have the support of Senate and to potentially be able to work with them to push what we're doing. This would make what we're doing so much more successful. We have really ambitious goals and it's not something the two of us can accomplish alone. With regard to a university-wide pride day, we currently have the MCS pride day, the [College of Engineering (COE)] pride day, which sort of end up being exclusive events and [require] you to be a part of the college to attend. It looks like a lot of fun, but you're walking by and going ‘Oh, there’s [COE], there’s MCS, there’s SCS.’ We want to establish an overall Carnegie Mellon pride day, potentially like a second Community Collage, which is something you see during orientation. My favorite part of orientation as a new freshman and as an orientation counselor was to look at all the things that Carnegie Mellon students do outside of academics. People are all getting great degrees doing good things, but they're also doing things that they're passionate about that don't just involve schoolwork. It's really impressive and it makes you excited about the sort of community that we have here and the diverse educational opportunities that we have. We spoke to [associate director of alumni relations] Tim Leonard about how we would go about starting to establish this. It's also something we've been looking into in Proud to Be Plaid to make seniors still feel involved.
MM: Circling back to the trickle-down effect Olivia was speaking about, one of the most powerful things is the ability to raise scholarships through this process of giving back. Students don't realize that it's not like you're giving five dollars and it disappears. This five dollars turns up and might help some other student down the road, which is incredible because we all know how expensive Carnegie Mellon's education is. Everyone's very aware, so just making the burden a little bit easier on the next student is something that we want to do.
OC: And we want to let people know how they can contribute. It feels a little annoying when your school asks you for money after you’re paying this much tuition. We want to let students know that you don't just have to say ‘Okay take my money,’ but you can say ‘I have this five dollars and I want this to specifically to go towards a scholarship fund.’ We want to let students know how they can feel like they're making a direct impact.
CG: Your campaign website notes that you “know what kinds of ideas are feasible for the community.” Can you expand on this idea and explain how you have worked to ensure that your platform is attainable?
OC: We ensured this mainly through the administrative members that I've been mentioning. In terms of dining, we sat down with Pascal Petter. We gave him both of our emails so that it wasn't just a one-time meeting and he knows how to reach out to us and communicate. We plan on attending these dining meetings so that we can not only give our input, but also understand how things work. It's impossible for us to do these things if we don't understand how they work. We pulled up our platform with Petter and showed him what we want to do, and he told us that these are all things that are possible. Are they necessarily possible within a term? No, but they are things that we can absolutely promote and get the wheels moving on so that they do happen. Even if the final product doesn't get reached, students will be able to see tangible change in our time. We spoke with people in Student Activities and Student Life about doing unity things and seeing if those are feasible, and they told us they were. We had other ideas that we were told aren't the most feasible, so we didn't want to focus on those. 
The other way we’ve ensured this is speaking with different organizations. When we were at Student Senate, Active Minds came to speak and talk about what they're doing. I sat down with a member of Student Senate who told me about the different initiatives they are pushing that align with ours, and he said that they do have the resources and that with our support it would be something that's possible to accomplish. We've gone through speaking to different established organizations who have similar end goals to us and speaking to different administrative numbers to try and make sure that the things that we want to do can get accomplished.
CG: What do you see as the biggest thing that sets you apart from the other candidates running for these positions?
OC: I sat down with our friend who is helping us with our design work and he said ‘Well we know all the people who are running are doing it to put it on their resume,’ and I said ‘That's not true.” I find it really interesting that people have this perception. I think a lot of people do want to make change, but I think that many people run for this position because of the name of the position. There's a certain amount of prestige that comes with it because there are certain things you can do in this position of power that feel exciting. Personally, if I was running just for those reasons, I wouldn't think it was worth the work to put in. The reason that I am really excited about this is because it's something that I'm passionate about. We have all these ideas and they are super ambitious and they seem like a lot, but the opportunity to create change and to be able to get this position and office and do something where people could say ‘Oh yeah, they changed that. This is something that's a part of our community and I remember when it happened and how it happened,’ is exciting. I want to change the idea that people don't know who the student body president and vice-president are, that the student body president and vice-president are not interacting with the community, and that people don't know how to get involved. I think we really have the opportunity not only to push our initiatives and do something really important for this campus, but also to make people feel involved in the student government process. Even if they don't have time to attend Student Senate meetings or to do this or that, I think everyone can get excited about making change, about coming up with an idea and seeing it being realized, and I think that Mike and I especially want to give people the opportunity to do that. Between the two of us we came up with these ideas, imagine what thousands of people can come up with. Because this is something the two of us are actually passionate about, I think something that sets us apart is just how excited we are to do something good for people and help them actually make a difference on their own campus.
MM: I think one of the differences for us is how approachable we are. We're both somewhat social people and it's incredible that since thinking about running for this campaign we’ve spoken to probably hundreds of people about their different perspectives. We’ve talked to people of all different ages and all different backgrounds and really gathered feedback that way, and it really takes a lot of energy to do something like that. Like Olivia said, it would drown you unless you're actually passionate about it. Being able not only to win a campaign, but also to go a full academic year in the position, be successful, and accomplish the initiatives that you set out to accomplish requires a lot of focus and a lot of energy.
OC: And a lot of teamwork, which is another thing that I think sets us apart. We understand that it's so far from something the two of us can accomplish, which is why I think one of the most important things about our campaign and our platform would be how others can help us and how we can help them.
MM: And that's probably the biggest difference, our team. We have a fantastic team again spanning all these different ages and they already are super passionate about different issues and have latched onto one platform initiative or another.
CG: That’s all I have. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us!

Zeke Rosenberg (senior staff, The Tartan): Why did you decide to run, both individually and as a team?
Barbara Samaniego (junior economics and professional writing dual degree, student body presidential candidate): Since freshman year, I have been seeing several problems with the cultural climate of the school, and they are mostly due to student unity. This leads to other problems such as students not feeling that Carnegie Mellon would adequately address their needs, an apolitical atmosphere surrounding the student culture, and in general, people’s needs being neither addressed nor heard by the administration. I approached several people for running mate because I wasn’t sure whom to choose, but I decided on Raheela because we work well together; we’re good friends; and she’s an excellent speaker and had really similar visions to mine for the school.
ZR: And, Raheela, what made you decide to join?
Raheela Ahsan (sophomore economics major, student body vice presidential candidate): This was partially due to my previous work experiences. I have a huge interest in politics and have been keeping up with the elections. Last summer when I worked with my congressman, I noticed the disconnect between the average citizen and how Washington, D.C. makes laws and how little citizen input there is. I realize now that it’s my second year here, that I see the same things exist at Carnegie Mellon, especially when I’m seeing my tuition increase, but I’m not seeing where it’s going. I’m seeing all of these amenities that Carnegie Mellon offers and advertises, but I’m not seeing students utilize that. There is discord between the students and the separations within the student body that I personally have been a victim of and I would like to see that changed.
When Barbara came to me with her platform, I agreed with a lot of the issues she was advocating for and so I chose to run with her.
ZR: What do you bring to the table as a team? How will you be able to work together to bring about your desired reforms?
BS: Raheela and I are friends. We know each other pretty well and we like working together, so it’s easier for us to coordinate since we know each other so well. It’s easier to plan and flesh out ideas because I’m not afraid of criticizing anything Raheela has to say and Raheela always offers me constructive, positive criticism.
It’s so much easier for us to build on ideas this way because we are running as students who actually care, not as two huge social powers that want to get many votes and offer arbitrary concepts that don’t really address any needs. We are people who have been reaching out to the student body to understand what they need changed, what they want changed, and we’ve been working on it as friends, candidates, and concerned students, not as political figures.
RA: To further what Barbara is saying, it’s also important to recognize that both of us come from different backgrounds. I have more of a math and technical background, and she has more of a literary background. We both have very separate experiences, and we know different aspects of the student body. This has allowed both of us to reach out to a lot of different people and, cumulatively, these are things that we’ve pulled. From our different experiences, we’ve noticed that these common themes were apparent in all these different social groups. That’s what we wanted to change because this is clearly not an “x-specific” issue, this is a Carnegie Mellon-wide issue and complaining about it day after day isn’t enough. At some point, you do need people who are going to advocate for that change and so we figured why not let that be us.
BS: I started talking to people within the English department who are professional writing majors that aren’t really present on the social scene and only really talk to other professional writing majors, and they were telling me about these problems that they were seeing with the school — an apolitical atmosphere, their voices not being represented — and I asked my graduate student friends, they said “undergraduate student politics don’t even care about graduate students, we don’t know what to do with our kids, we want to reach out to you but we have no way of doing that.” These were issues that we saw all across the board and Raheela talked to her math major friends and they said the same thing.
I initially wasn’t sure if I was going to run because I had all of these ideas and I was trying to push policies through other means and through just advocating for them. I decided to run because I had a set of policies that were very specific for a student body president to set in motion.
ZR: Let’s talk about policies. There are some that struck me as difficult to enact from the presidency. The first is Health Services. Affordable service and better hours is a common goal, but how do you plan to actually pursue that?
BS: That’s something we have to petition. We have to petition for a more effective use of Carnegie Mellon health insurance. Instead of that insurance going towards things that are unnecessary such as waiting room water cups, it would go towards free STD testing, free birth control, stuff like that, which students actually need. 
RA: I know that health services, at least in the past year, has seen a change. They hired a new desk attendant and reshaped it.
BS: However, there should be a good reallocation of the funds that Health Services has.
RA: We want to be able, as president and vice president, to talk to administration in seeing whether we can get med students from the University of Pittsburgh as part time jobs or some off-time nurses who can’t work weekdays to come in on weekends so that even if we have limited hours at Health Services on the weekends, at least it’s open, because currently it’s not. 
BS: So there would be at least one person to walk in and schedule an appointment with. Even an EMS student could sit there for five hours; you could pay them by the hour; Pitt students could view it as an internship, things like that. That’s a simple way of figuring out if that student needs further medical assistance or if that student just needs Ibuprofen. I’ve had to call EMS on the weekends because I had a concussion. They just sent me straight to the hospital, which is completely unnecessary and really expensive.
RA: The pressing issue is the cost; maintaining it, getting workers in on the weekends. I personally don’t think that’s a big issue because it’s not that there’s a shortage of funds being allocated towards Health Services. That’s one of the biggest things everyone’s tuition includes — insurance and student safety. A lot of that is allocated towards Counseling and Psychological Services and multiple other things and both of us personally feel, since we both have studied economics, that there probably is some throwing away of funds on useless things when you could channel them into working hours for keeping the facilities open on the weekends. You would have to go through the administration, but that would give us more power as Student Government president to do that.
BS: That was also one of the big reasons we wanted to push for Entropy+ being open 24/7. I know that if you pay with a credit card, then the university loses money, but we want to push for them to allow students to pay with cash and get some discount on it and then, because of the money that the school would save with that, they could have Entropy+ open 24/7 so that students would have access to medication on campus in a central location and food in a central location. If students are sick at 4 a.m. and they need to get Ibuprofen or a fever reducer or they have allergic reactions and they need Benadryl, they have to be able to go somewhere on campus to get water, Gatorade, Tums or whatever to feel better. They just do not have access to anything like that until 7/11 which is all the way in Oakland.
RA: You have to go to Rite Aid either towards Pitt or towards Squirrel Hill], both of which you have to take a bus to and buses stop running at 2 a.m. If it’s cold outside, no one is going to go so you would just rather suffer until 6 or 7 a.m.
ZR: Let’s talk about the expansions you want to make for dining; you want to add options that are Kosher, Halal, vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free.
RA: These are various ideas.
BS: We’re reaching out to various cafes across the Pittsburgh area to have some sort of cheaper deal, like Gluuteny has a deal with Carnegie Mellon where they can have gluten-free products and it’s relatively inexpensive for Carnegie Mellon. The one problem we accounted for is the CulinArt deal so we would reach out to CulinArt and see if they have any of those products and if those products can be expanded.
Our main effort is reaching out to the cafes to actually make sure that there are some food options like that. What we saw as a great barrier to unity in dining not having enough food options is that not having the food options that students need is physically separating students from that eating location and not allowing for there to be [a] central place for everyone to be able to have food. Personally, I’m lactose intolerant, but it’s hard for me to find food without lactose, so I just eat it anyway. That’s not a big problem, but it surprises me how students can possibly find anything on campus if they have to eat dairy-free or gluten-free.
RA: Elaborating on the dining point more, Carnegie Mellon is already in partnership with a halal butcher in the Oakland area and a kosher butcher as well, which is why we have kosher options. I feel like the Kosher push was probably due to the influx of Jewish students that we have and AEPi’s influence because I don’t think Carnegie Mellon on it’s own would just grant kosher options to everyone. For example, Carnegie Mellon has very limited halal options — they have cold cut sandwiches and Rice Bowl serves halal meat — but they have this halal meat coming in from a certain butcher. It would just be a matter of going to them and asking them to increase the amount that they donate or give to Carnegie Mellon from, say, 10 percent to 15 percent. Similarly, Gluuteny itself is an incredible bakery, but they give us all their packaged, sad products that sit in Entropy+ and no one wants to eat.
We want to negotiate to see if they could bring in fresh baked items or provide the dough so that someone can bake it at CulinArt. An issue is that while CulinArt is cooking all this food, all they have to do is swap out different ingredients. The food can continue as is, but you just have to swap out ingredients to maintain accommodation for different diets. This would just mean supporting local businesses here and getting them to supply their ingredients.
BS: That would be the same price if not cheaper because these businesses are local and they would be selling directly to the university.
RA: Especially the imports that CulinArt has to do for their food.
BS: In general, we found that the options we have here that are halal and are kosher are very expensive, so we’re looking at bringing the cost of those down as well so the cost of those options at least equals the cost of other products.
ZR: Expand on exactly what “make #CMYou the best it can be” means.
BS: There are a lot of people at CMU with a lot of ideas and we want to make sure that all of those ideas and voices are adequately heard, represented, and able to be represented. When all of the student body works together to ensure representation, then this school is the best that it can be because these are the concerns and the voices of all of these students.
RA: Making something the best doesn’t exclusively mean changing it, it could also mean making the current product more efficient. There are currently resources and amenities that Carnegie Mellon itself offers that students are unaware of. An example would be more utility of the Career and Professional Development Center, which literally helps you write your resume and analyzes it for you and based on different majors, they give you a different format and template. They also help you write cover letters. You can go get headshots taken in the [Cohon Center (CC)]. You also have access to 3-D printing. There is access to amenities at Carnegie Mellon that students aren’t aware of and your tuition pays for things that you don’t even realize you should or could be using.
BS: There’s such bad publicity of everything for people not in Greek life and for people who are international because they just never get to hear about it because it’s all done through social media, Greek life, and organizations. There’s no central place for people to talk and be aware of the services that Carnegie Mellon offers. This is why people are so upset over the fact that there isn’t a place to have help for academic services and there is, but no one knows about it.
RA: There would be a two-part plan, making Carnegie Mellon the best would be improving your current situation and then also changes that we want to implement.
ZR: Is there anything else you might want to add? 
BS: Another big one that directly addresses student unity is the graduate student mentorship program and graduate student representation on cabinet. We want to inform our cabinet with graduate student representatives because a lot of the needs of the graduate students aren’t being heard and addressed. In general, the graduates feel very separated from the undergraduate population as though they don’t really have a central place. They have a lounge, but it’s not like the [CC] Black Chairs. They have problems with places to put their kids during the day and parking and none of those needs are getting addressed by Student Government or pushed towards the administration because they are so left out and forgotten at the school. This is a huge pool of people who, if we bring into our community more, could help us in return. A lot of people at Carnegie Mellon don’t understand what they are doing. They might need guidance, support, and a mentor to look up to even if they are not in Greek life or an organization or a mentorship program. A graduate student population that exceeds the undergraduate student population means that each graduate student could be paired up on a voluntary basis and then serve as a mentor for the an undergraduate student’s time at Carnegie Mellon. They would have someone to automatically be friends with and to look up to and ask questions.
Another big portion of our platform was sexual health at Carnegie Mellon.
RA: Our main focus is probably student health and safety.
BS: We were looking into various ways of decreasing the rate of sexual assault, which has been growing at Carnegie Mellon for the last three years and having an anonymous support network where students could reach out to and get help with if they are sexually assaulted and make the process of reaching out and reporting sexual assault easier. We do have a system right now [but] it’s not fully anonymous and they do reserve the right to press further action and investigation [so] they don’t remain anonymous to that person. If there was an anonymous hotline that people could call outside of CaPS  — because they don’t actually answer — it would greatly benefit those students.  
RA: Other candidates such as Mike and Olivia’s platforms are centered around issues like this and mental health as well but, unfortunately, they haven’t offered specifics as to what they might fix or what they were going to do, they just pointed out problems.
Personally, as someone who has been a victim of sexual assault, the reporting of that is flawed. Firstly, everyone tells you to go to CaPS, so when you go to CaPS you have to sign up. Then you have the assessment meeting, which is completely useless because you just want to talk to someone and have it resolved right away. Finally you schedule the actual meeting and then it’s a different person and in my experience, I had to go out of my way to remain anonymous. They have a semi-private obligation to report. It would be somewhat anonymous until the charges go through, but then they would have your name on it. I know with CaPS, it’s not anonymous at all, which is a very awful situation because I know other people who have been in worse situations and that creates a lot of difficulty in reporting and taking care of that.
We have Campus SafeWalk and we have the Survivor Support Network (SSN). A lot of people don’t know what those are and a lot of people did not know SafeWalk was a thing. We spoke with our friend who was on SafeWalk for two years and he said he never had to walk anyone home because no one requested it.
BS: I find that really weird because a random person has stalked me down Fifth Avenue and I feel like if I had known that such a service existed I probably would have called them instead of calling my friend. It’s so weird that these services exist but students don’t feel safe. They feel scared of reporting because of this apathetic cultural climate and they don’t want to report sexual assault cases because they don’t want to get the fraternity in trouble, they don’t want friends to hate them, they don’t want to be viewed as slutty or drunk or a bitch or anything like that. They always are and that’s a Carnegie Mellon-specific problem and a climate-specific problem.
That can only really be fixed by student unity. We can try to implement these policies but we’re really going to push for a more unified campus.
RA: As well as support and understanding. Moreover, we also spoke with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and IFC said they have made things a lot stricter with frat parties. Even so, people don’t understand that amnesty is an infinite-usage policy. I know that when I came in as a first-year my RA said that I could only use it twice, which is completely false. People don’t understand how amnesty works and amnesty literally saves lives; that’s the point. 
BS: People don’t understand how that program works. They never want to call because they don’t want to get their organization in trouble.
RA: They would rather be passed out with a chance of dying on their couch rather than get amnesty called on them. Campus police is there to support you. They’re not going to cite you for being drunk. There are a lot of things at Carnegie Mellon that currently exist that you just need to publicize them and make it clear what Carnegie Mellon is here to help you do and what is it not here to help you do.
ZR: I’m going to ask a question about something you said way in the beginning of that. After writing an article a month or so ago about mental health issues, a group approached me that was working on an anonymous support network for people with mental health issues. A common problem with these is that peer-to-peer and anonymous networks can put people in situations they aren’t emotionally equipped or qualified to handle or even people who want to use the network maliciously. How will you ensure this support network is safe?
RA: Student senate has been working on an anonymous hotline program starting this summer that you can use if you just want someone to talk to, which I think is an incredible idea. We’re not thinking of an Alcoholics Anonymous-type sit in a circle and talk about your problems and xyz happens program. The problem is confidentiality and liability issues, which could create so many problems. If you’re twenty and I’m twenty-one, honestly, I don’t trust you to not tell people about my problems. What we were thinking was somehow implementing a policy change. When I go to CaPS or speak with my advisor, professionals would be open with reporting. They sometimes don’t let you know if they’re reporting. That’s happened previously. I believe students have dropped names and then the person they meet with says they mentioned something. If that was against my wishes, then why did you do it? You’re violating your policy and my trust in you as my therapist.
CaPS itself does not have professionals to accommodate for these needs and ideally you want to say hire better people but obviously that’s not something we can fix. We want to see if we can push for SSN or for CaPS in having some sort of voluntary anonymous policy.
BS: More so SSN because CaPS has all of these issues with liability of the school and they have to fill a certain quota and are not really able to do anything at all for anything so we want to make this student run and create a shift in the paradigm of student culture.
RA: Or at least student support and understanding that it’s okay if you go talk about your problems and what happens because the professionals aren’t going to hurt you, they’re here to help you.
BS: At least if someone comes out saying “I was a victim of sexual assault,” we want people to not blame them and say if was their fault, they were too drunk, they did this, they were dressed provocatively, which seems to be very Carnegie Mellon-specific.
For the Health Services cost, we would also like to offer victims of sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking support through a medical clinic so we want to offer them free Plan B, free STD testing, which isn’t offered and you have to pay for it along with a medical examination, which is ridiculous in my opinion. Not only has this happened to you, but you also have to pay for it, which is completely unfair. It’s not looking out for the students.
RA: If you don’t have Carnegie Mellon insurance, a lot of the issues that you can go to a clinic for, if you go here to Health Services, you have to pay exorbitant amounts. For example, Plan B is really expensive and also STD testing is expensive, it’s between $60 and $80 but a clinic is significantly cheaper, sometimes as low as $25 for STD testing. I understand you want to pay lab fees and stuff but sexual health is important, we have to watch out for STDs, we want to find a way to lower the cost of that.
BS: We also want to have more awareness of sexual health at Carnegie Mellon; we don’t think that’s addressed here at all. I went to an all-girls school so I didn’t really understand anything about sexual health until I got to Carnegie Mellon and we had AlcoholEDU and there was some stuff about relationship violence but it was very underplayed, unserious, and uninformative. It’s just something students need to know about when they come into college.
RA: I was on the opposite end of that spectrum, I also went to an all-girls school, but my school was a single-gender environment so we were very open with talking about sexual health and relationship violence and things like that. I grew up with sex ed knowledge way beyond my peers. When I came to college, people didn’t know anything about condoms and safe sex and getting tested. A lot of people are misinformed about that.
All these issues we have brought up, alcohol awareness, SSN, the current amenities that exist at Carnegie Mellon, our solutions to all of these is basically that we want to have a reorientation program. You have freshman orientation, but there are five billion things happening at one time. You’re not just worried about all these things because there are classes and dorms and people and friends in the way. We want to have something implemented after, end of sophomore year and beginning of junior year, so midway through your college career, where everyone takes an online course like AlcoholEDU and looks through it. We need awareness that all these services exist. Your tuition is covering these costs and this is exactly everything offered. Because people’s experiences from their freshman year to their junior year are crazy different, things that you never even expected — like sexual assault help, who ever even thought of that when they were 17 or 18 — are more important things now that you’re 20 or 21.
ZR: Is there anything you want to add before we’re done?
BS: To wrap up, all of these link back to student unity and all of them link back to creating a better cultural climate at Carnegie Mellon, helping students understand each other better, helping students see more services that are offered, breaking down physical barriers that divide students, and creating more collaboration across disciplines both physically and through our cultural climate.
ZR: Alright, then. Thanks for your time!

Sarah Gutekunst (Publisher, The Tartan): Why are you running and why should students vote for you?
Vaasavi Unnava (junior economics major, student body presidential candidate): I think a big part of it is that, as with any position on campus, you really have to make an active decision, especially when it’s a position that’s generally afforded a lot of power. And so, thinking over it, when I came to the realization that I wanted to run for student body president, it was because what I want to achieve on campus, in terms of making an infrastructure so people can take ownership and make their lives better in the community, was something that could only be achievable with the position I wanted to run for.
Aaron Gutierrez (junior computer science major, student body vice presidential candidate): Over my time at Carnegie Mellon I’ve seen many different aspects of how the university operates, and in doing that, you really understand a lot of the things that go on better. I see this as an opportunity to bring that understanding to a much larger percentage of the population. I see this as an opportunity to get everyone more informed and more engaged with their campus, so that they can see how all the pieces fit together.
SG: Can you explain the President’s Initiative?
VU: Absolutely! Sorry I just get really excited about it. [She laughs.] When we [were] thinking about all of these really big cultural issues that are happening on our campus — sexual assault and relationship violence prevention, academic integrity, mental health — every time, we discuss these things, but then we don’t really do anything about it after that. So the heart of the President’s Initiative is creating some sort of infrastructure, almost an incentive structure, so that clubs and organizations can look forward and say 'we know that this is a problem and we’re going to do something about it.' That involves pushing a meeting called "the board of directors," which is typically reserved for executives of student organizations, to the front of the year. Having all the students come together, identify which problems they want to work on for the campus community, and form partnerships across clubs and organizations, so that they can actually do something within their clubs and organizations to create a university-wide conversation within the student body. At the end of the year we’re looking to reward the clubs and organizations that have done the most innovative things with some sort of monetary benefit to show we’re excited for the positive changes they’ve brought to the community.
SG: How do you plan to mobilize the community more fully, to get it to trickle down to the corners that it doesn’t usually reach?
AG: I think a big part of that comes from the fact that the President’s Initiative targets organizations, which for most people is one of the most formative parts of their college experience. Everyone is involved with academics, but that’s not really the defining part of it. So I think engaging people at the organization level is where people are excited to be doing whatever they’re doing, and it’s a way to engage the broader campus community. You’re not going to go to a presentation in the economics department with the same enthusiasm that you would go [to] Dancer’s Symposium. It gives an opportunity to engage students where they’re excited.
VU: I would add to that I think what we’re doing now is an attempt to trickle down. The President’s Initative is an attempt to meet students where they are. Trickling down is having discussions about it, having education about it, which is what we’re doing already, but what we want to do with the President’s Initiative is to say 'look we’re done with that because it’s not working. So why don’t we just take ownership ourselves.'
SG: Great. So what do the Carnegie Mellon tax forms say?
[They both laugh.]
VU: They say a lot! It’s a 250 page document.
AG: And most of that is just saying 'Carnegie Mellon subcontracted some research to the Software Engineering Institute and the Department of Creative Writing.' There’s a lot of internal money transferring that just gets documented in there. I think the meat and potatoes of it is the assets that Carnegie Mellon has but also it gives a brief overview of trustee salaries and executive salaries and [the] highest paid salaries within a department, and also gives some information about what kind of federal grant money we receive, for scholarships where that money goes, what money for scholarships comes from the endowment, [and] what the endowment pays for. It documents that the university is putting federal money to good use.
VU: And it also goes into how the endowment is invested. A lot of people don’t know that the endowment is an investment asset. So when we put money into the endowment, you really get around 6 percent of that money back. The rest of it goes into investing. It talks about the types of income investing strategies that we use, which, to someone who’s interested in finance, [is] really cool. It talks about how aggressive we’re being, where we want to be. It doesn’t give a breakdown of the school’s stock portfolio by any means, but it gives us a good idea of the strategies we’re attempting to use to grow the endowment, and in all honesty the extent to which the university is satisfied with the amount of money we have. If you look at the forms, it’s a pretty aggressive strategy we’re using because they’re trying to grow it as quickly as possible. 
SG: Yeah really. So in your Facebook post declaring your candidacy last month, you said “Let’s forget how we always used to do it.” What things do you want to leave in the past?
VU: So I think part of the resonance that we’ve brought into the answers so far is this idea of discussions. Not because I don’t like discussions. I’m in Student Life, we talk all the time. But at the heart of it, what ends up happening is we lose this bridge between what we’re doing in our major and what’s happening in the real world. We do stuff in class, but then we’re like 'Oh my god. One in five women are sexually assaulted on this campus. Too bad I can’t do anything about it,' which is really not even a little bit true. So how we used to do it was to sit in these two parallel worlds — the first in which we are students and the second in which we are members of community. But in reality we’re both. That’s what I want to forget: this idea that we’re separate selves. We are individuals experiencing the world and trying to make it better.
SG: How do you envision your weekly Tartan column? What do you want to communicate to the community?
AG: I think that’s a great opportunity to just describe the work that goes on that often times isn’t part of the students’ conversation. Issues we’re facing right now, like there’s a shortage in funding for the third floor of the [Cohon] Center to make that space adequate for students, [and] the issues that come up over time that show what we’re doing and why we’re doing it and show that we’re giving these decisions we’re making consideration from the perspective of a student.
VU: A really good example of that, that’s perhaps more sexy, is back [in] our freshman year, they tried to get the student body president paid through an honorarium. First of all, I’m 100 percent against that idea. But the biggest problem is that students didn’t hear about it. So I want to take these issues that are really big in Student Government, and say this is our position, this is what we want to do about it. Because after spending so much time in Student Government, I can promise you every week there is something new to talk about. It goes from working and deciding what the new student health insurance plan will be to paying Student Government officials.
AG: And even [things] like what’s going to go in the Skibo Café location. Things that most certainly have a day-to-day impact on students but they don’t understand who makes those decision and how.
SG: So do you want to publish it weekly?
VU: Yeah!
SG: Awesome! We can talk about deadlines later. I just have one last question, which we’ve kind of touched on. But how do you plan to use your previous experience in Student Government to be a good president and vice president?
AG: So I think a lot of that comes down to like knowing what’s reasonable and what’s achievable. We’ve seen what’s been able to be done in the past and the discussions that happen with university officials. We have a good grasp on how processes work to achieve not only what we want to achieve but what the student body is pushing for.
VU: I think it’s important to note that we have these really lofty ideas, but we’re not being unreasonable in believing that they could happen within a year. Part of the reason for that is we have been in Student Government for so long so we know what’s achievable. But also have you seen that Jerry Seinfeld/Barack Obama interview? There’s this one part where he asked President Obama what it’s like working in government. President Obama said it’s like playing football. He was like 'What?' But the heart of it is, you spend all your time building up your resources so when there’s an opening you take it. And I think a lot of the flaws in SBP campaigns, not just this year but in previous years, is that they don’t try to find openings, they just assume they’re there. We know when to find the openings; we know how to stock our resources up so that we’re ready to take advantage of them when they come. Because of that our ambitions are based in a sort of realism rather than fantasy.

Last year, Carnegie Mellon students broke records with their turnout in the student government elections. With an increase of 8.32 percent, 26.22 percent of all undergraduate and graduate students cast their vote for candidates for student body president, student body vice president for finance, student body vice president for organizations, and Undergraduate Student Senate.
Calling Carnegie Mellon students apolitical is almost a cliche at this point. It's common knowledge that a large chunk of the student body is here solely to get a good education and a good job, and that's fine because that's what we pay for. But this inward-facing portion of the population is beginning to lose out to a quickly growing group of passionate and vocal students. Our student body has the choice to take advantage of the global platform Carnegie Mellon sits on and the resources that come with it. In many cases, this is an opportunity to create change, and more and more students have been taking it.
The Tartan hopes that this trend continues. If you stop, look, and listen while you walk past Doherty Hall or through Wean Commons, it will be so clear how many people have a cause they believe in. The community has been especially mobilized by controversial social issues brought up by national elections. The frightening future that many of us have been forced to consider has been a wake-up call. As our rights are threatened, we pull them closer to our hearts. We've spoken up about issues that affect us to enact change, such as Title IX. This can only inspire more change if we keep up the momentum and live our values.
Every vote has the power to change something and the chance to show student government what the student body wants. We hope that more Carnegie Mellon students will seize that right this year, next year, and every year after that.
The results of each year's election affect every student. Student Government executive and senators have a tremendous say in important issues like the student health insurance policy and even the tuition increase. In addition, anyone involved with one of 346 organizations recognized on The Bridge is affected by the decisions that the vice presidents for organizations and finance make everyday, such as space and money allocations. With the university at such a turning point, pumping out influential changes almost every week, we need elect a Student Government that we can confidently count on to represent the interests of students.
Our democracy owes us the right to vote, but we owe it to the university to cast an educated vote. Students should do the research on candidates' platforms, attend the debates to get answers, and think critically about which pairs can lead us toward a better future. Don't just vote for your friend's friend or who has the prettiest website. Make your vote count by casting a vote that you really thought about.
As our interviews in this issue should reflect, this year's candidates have a lot of ambitions for the next academic year. You can visit the Elect@CMU website to read everyone's platforms. But if you want to do more, you can attend the debates that The Tartan will host Tues., March 22 from 7–9 p.m. in McConomy for the presidential candidates, and Wed., March 23 from 5-6:30 p.m. in the Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136A) for the vice presidents for organization and finance candidates. We will also be building in time for a town-hall style question and answer portion. If what you learn excites or concerns you, you can contact candidates to have discussions. But here's the bottom line: you should vote.
You can cast your vote on the Elect@CMU website beginning at 8 a.m. on March 31 and ending April 4 at 6 p.m., and Senate will ratify the results on April 6. We at The Tartan hope to see record-breaking turnout.

Last Tuesday, as a part of Bennett-McWilliams Lecture, Carnegie Mellon alumni invited Lars Hernquist, a theoretical astrophysicist and Mallinckrodt Professor of Astrophysics at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, to Carnegie Mellon’s campus to give a lecture on galaxy assembly and evolution. 
Hernquist talked about Illustris, a project that uses a new computational model developed by Hernquist and his team, which consists of Volker Springel, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Heidelburg University; Mark Vogelsberger, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics in MIT; and a contingent of students and faculty.
Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe’s large-scale structure. Due to the rapid development of technology and cosmology over the past centuries, there has been a recent explosion in robust observational literature on galaxies, as well as several studies of individual galaxies. In scientists’ effort to explore the universe, it seems necessary to have a predictive theory of galaxy-assembly with which to interpret this massive amount of data and to ultimately understand the origin of stars.
This question has become a very long-standing problem. Starting in the 1920s, various solutions have been put forward, but there’s still no fully predictive theory. The major complications are that the theory needs to account for normal physics — as opposed to anti-matter and the like. The theory will also have to handle galactic scale — from black hole accretion disks to star-forming regions to halos, all at the same time. Also, many processes relevant to galaxy formation and evolution are still poorly understood. The good news, however, is that researchers know where to begin.
The Illustris project description states that: “The Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Lambda-CDM) paradigm of cosmology, currently favored by observations of the large-scale distribution of galaxies in space, implies that the cosmos is filled with three distinct components: normal matter, dark matter, and dark energy. 
The mathematical models which govern the physical behavior of these components are sufficiently complex that they can only be solved exactly for very particular, simplified ‘test’ problems.”
Hernquist concludes that fundamentally, the situation is a computational problem, which requires a numerical approach that is adaptive in space and time.
“A number of fundamentally different methods exist for simulating gas on a computer,” Hernquist said. 
In astrophysics, most researchers have used one of two approaches. The first is smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), where the mass of the gaseous fluid is parceled out to a discrete number of particles. These particles move in response to the combined forces of gravity and hydrodynamics, and their position at any time indicates where the gas is, as well as how it is moving. 
Hernquist continued that the second approach of Eulerian, or mesh-based methods typically utilize a scheme called adaptive mesh refinement, or AMR. Through this method, space itself is divided up into a grid, and the flow of gas between neighboring cells of this grid is computed over time.
The Illustris simulation uses a different approach, employing a “moving, unstructured mesh.” Moving mesh treatment of hydrodynamics offers many advantages over other approaches for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Like in AMR, the volume of space is discretized into many individual cells, but as in smooth particle hydrodynamics, these cells move with time, adapting to the flow of gas in their vicinity. 
As a result, the simulation has particle-based strengths that include geometrical flexibility, accurate and efficient gravity solvers, and continuous refinement, as well as grid-based strengths that include resolution of discontinuities, relatively less diffusive, and well-defined convergence criteria.
Several projects are now being carried out by the team members. With Ilustris, researchers are able to observe fine structures of galaxies and interacting galaxies. Research by Vogelsberger in 2014, and Greg Snyder in 2015, regarding galaxy morphologies and colors shows approximately observed abundance of morphologies of galaxies: 30 percent of spirals, 30 percent of elliptical, and 10 percent of irregulars at z=0. 
Illustris can also help in tracking galaxies in redshift, or progressing farther away, such that the wavelengths that actually reach observers appear more red, though with some variations in simulation forwards and backward because galaxy number is not conserved in our universe due to the fact that galaxies merge at an unpredictable rate. 
By measuring the slope of stellar density profiles in halos, Illustris shows that the slope correlates with the mass of the dark matter halo, thus researchers can estimate dark matter halo mass from stellar halo.  
Researchers can also estimate galaxy-galaxy merger rates directly from Illustris, which shows that the rates have a strong dependence on z (redshift). This result is in reasonable agreement with data, but astonishingly opposes results from semi-analytical models done in the past using crude methods, which show that merging rates have less to do with z, but a lot with mass. 
Also, by dragging the time of Illustris to the future, it shows that matter in the universe is moving more rapidly apart, meaning galaxies are more unlikely to merge. 
Illustris shows promise, and Hernquist estimates that in the near future, in approximately two months, the team will improve Illustris with refined feedback models. The team aspires to improve performance and scalability.

Due to weather, usage, and vandalism, road infrastructure is constantly in a state of flux. It is important that municipalities properly inspect roads in order to ensure the safety of those who use them. 
Currently, the standard method of reporting infrastructure damage is from citizen or inspector reports, or  from specialized vehicles with sensors, which are expensive.
Christoph Mertz, principal project scientist at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute, is researching how smartphones can be used to give municipalities a more efficient and cost-effective way to inspect road infrastructure.
“It is essential to get eyes on every road, during every year in order to stay ahead of what could become costly repairs,” said Jason A. Dailey, director of public works for Cranberry Township, in a university press release. 
“Expensive services are available that have on-board tools and sensors, but these are typically out of the price range of the average community.”
Mertz’s research is comprised of two steps: images are collected, and the data is examined to identify areas of infrastructure that need the most repair. The system uses computer vision algorithms to analyze and categorize high-resolution images of a road.
“Data collection and analysis could take a matter of days, where it would otherwise take months or even years,” Mertz said in a university press release. Mertz’s vision is to put smart cameras on garbage trucks, which go through neighborhoods once a week and would provide infrastructure data often enough that problems could be spotted and addressed quickly.
The data from the smart camera is uploaded via Wi-Fi to Mertz’s computers, where he analyzes the photos for cracks in the infrastructure. All the photos are uploaded to software containing a map of Pittsburgh and are categorized by the urgency  of the problem. For example, a red image indicates there are many cracks in the road, while a green image could indicate a road that was recently paved. The team can also detect winter road conditions along with cracks. 
In collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Mertz placed the cameras on snowplows, and the team was able to determine the percentage of the road that was visible, covered in slush, or covered in snow. They can also detect the state of traffic signs, and have begun to examine street lamps and land markings.
“Mertz had demonstrated a viable advancement that may bring inspection technology into the everyday operations,” Dailey said, “making it not only affordable, but practical.” 
Carnegie Mellon’s Traffic21 Institute, a multidisciplinary research effort that is a part of Metro21, is one of the organizations funding this smart transportation project. 
According to their website, the goal is “to design, test, deploy and evaluate information and communications technology based solutions to address the problems facing the transportation system of the Pittsburgh region and the nation.” 
“The work of Mertz is an ideal example of Traffic21’s vision of research, development and deployment,” Stan Caldwell, executive director of Traffic21 and Technologies for Safe and Efficient Transportation (T-SET), a National University Transportation Center funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation, said in a university press release. “The exciting stage is deploying the technology in the field, making our region a smart transportation living lab.” 
Mertz’s technology has been deployed with the City of Pittsburgh, Marshall Township, Cranberry Township, and with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

The San Bernardino terrorist attack was a tragic event, and we hope that nothing like it ever happens again. But what is the best way of preventing future terrorists? Is it possible to stay safe without giving up our own freedoms? When Apple publicly refused to help the FBI break into the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists, the debate between freedom and security came back into the public spotlight. Last week, Pugwash discussed whether giving governments full access to information is the best way to protect our security.
Before touching on moral implications, some discussion took place as to what the FBI was asking of Apple. iPhones have a security system in place that makes it almost impossible to retrieve data after a certain number of wrong password attempts. The FBI wants Apple to disable this feature, which would allow the FBI to run every possible password until the correct one is found. Apple would have to create a special version of the operating system and then move it onto the phone as an update.
Is this a “backdoor,” or a term used to describe loopholes like master passwords or security risks that are intentionally left in by developers? Or is that word only being used because it has negative connotations and will win Apple support? Hard to tell, but either way, the FBI is asking Apple to weaken their product’s security in a way that could potentially spread beyond just this one instance.
The worry is that the new operating system without the security feature could be stolen from Apple, getting into the wrong hands and allowing anyone to break into iPhones. 
Even if Apple manages to keep a tight hold on the weakened operating system, there are worrisome implications that come with it. If the government is allowed to force a technology company to let them into an individual’s phone in this case, what’s to say that they won’t keep coming back to the tech company and asking them to do it again and again and again.
One idea is that in this case, there is a clear need for it. There might be valuable data on the San Bernardino terrorist’s phone, and no one is harmed by this particular phone being cracked open. 
There’s likely a warrant that makes the contents of the phone legally available to law enforcement, and it’s now just a question of practical possibility. 
As long as the government requests and is approved for a warrant, maybe they should be allowed to access phones and other digital possessions.
However, just because they have a warrant doesn’t mean that it was necessary or carefully vetted. For example, there’s already a court that decides if surveillance requests or justified. Since its foundation in the 1970s, it’s only denied 12 of more than 35 thousand requests. As revealed in the Edward Snowden leaks, some of those requests included things like getting all call details from a phone service provider, for every day the phone was in use — something that many feel is far beyond any reasonable cause.
Regardless of warrants, the United States government has a long history of going beyond the law in the name of national security. 
Even for Abraham Lincoln, often considered one of the greatest presidents, constitutional safeguards of liberty were thrown out the window when faced with threats to national security. More recently, in the civil rights era, government agencies used selective enforcement to target so-called “radicals.” If the government has the capability to do something, they will most likely choose to do it, regardless of the action’s level of legality.
In fact, the government has been forcing tech companies to do their bidding all along. The only reason it’s come to light now is because Apple has enough clout to publicly fight back. Smaller companies, like the email service that Edward Snowden used, folded under government pressure, allowing the government to spy on their services before eventually going out of business. 
Even if consumers want more protection from the government and want to use businesses that support individual privacy, they can’t trust in smaller companies that provide those services because of the government’s power to strong-arm them.
And if the United States government sets (or has already set) a precedent of being able to break into phones and individual’s data, what does that mean abroad or on a global scene? 
Protesters in oppressive regimes often rely on the privacy of their data to organize to better their country, but it seems hypocritical to support their right to privacy while denying that right within the United States.
Since 9/11 and the Patriot Act, the United States has swung heavily towards security on the pendulum between individual freedoms and security. 
Apple’s refusal to the FBI may be step in the other direction, signaling a country tired of being afraid and no longer as fervent in its pursuit of security at all costs.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on privacy rights.

Mechanical watches are amongst the few objects that can simultaneously be called high tech and high art. They seem simple — a circular dial, two or three hands, and some numbers along the sides. 
But underneath this apparent simplicity lies miniaturized mechanisms advanced enough to make most cars look crude by comparison. With no battery life, or threat of two year obsolescence to worry about, these devices just work—often perfectly and without complaint — for decades at a stretch.
Designed and put together by mechanical artists, modern watches pack more technology onto our wrists than any object without electronics has any right to do. Watchmaking, needless to say, is very difficult. Your average Rolex probably contains anywhere from 100 to 300 moving parts, put together by hand in a frame small enough to fit on one’s wrist. People study watches for anything from four to seven years before they call themselves ‘watchmakers.’
Words like mainspring, balance wheel, escapement, tourbillon, chronograph, and chronometer are just a few examples of the jargon watchmakers use. 
While each term might not be as complicated as it may sound, there is certainly some notable engineering going on within each wrist watch. What do these words really mean? Make no mistake, reading on isn’t going to make you an expert; it should, however, explain some of the most basic ideas behind watchmaking. 
First up, when people refer to mechanical watches, they’re really referring to two different things — manual and automatic watches. A manual movement, as the name implies, requires the wearer to wind the watch by turning it’s crown, typically once a day. An automatic, on the other hand, effectively winds itself through the wearer’s hand movements as he goes about his day. 
Automatics were a huge innovation in the early 20th century, because if one wore an automatic often enough, one never had to worry about whether the watch was wound or not. Some of the crucial components of modern mechanical watches, most of which are actually common between manuals and automatics, are explained here. The mainspring is the power source of a mechanical watch. 
When a watch is wound by turning the crown, what is actually being coiled tighter is the mainspring. Alongside the mainspring, watches have what is called an escapement. If we left the mainspring by itself, it would uncoil in a matter of seconds, sending a watch’s hands into a tizzy and rendering it useless to tell time. 
The escapement’s job is to act like a brake, gradually uncoiling the mainspring just enough to keep the watch turning at precisely the correct speed to match the time. For this reason, the quality of a watch’s escapement is usually the best indicator of its accuracy.  
A more deluxe component of watches is the tourbillon. Very few mechanical watches actually have tourbillons, yet if you were to pick up any watch magazine, you probably wouldn’t make it through one article without finding some mention of a tourbillon. 
A tourbillon is considered the pinnacle of watchmaking with regards to accuracy. An escapement can be affected by gravity variations from place to place — thereby decreasing a watch’s accuracy. A tourbillon suspends the entire escapement on a spinning axis, essentially housing a clock within a clock, in order to neutralize gravity’s effect.
Other components of a watch include the balance wheel and rotor. The balance wheel is really the core of the entire movement. Analogous to the pendulum in a wall clock, the balance wheel receives energy from the escapement and oscillates a set number of times per second — essentially ‘keeping the time.’ 
The rotor is the main difference between an automatic watch and a manual. The rotor is a semicircular weight that spins freely on its axis as the wearer’s hand moves. 
This spin is used to wind the mainspring. Finally, a discussion of watches involves the terms chronometer and chronograph. These two similar sounding words actually mean very different things. 
A chronograph is an additional complication to a mechanical watch, much like a tourbillon. Instead of increasing accuracy, however, a chronograph adds a stopwatchor timer, to the watch. A chronometer, on the other hand, isn’t so much a complication as it is a badge of honor. For a watch to advertise itself as a chronometer, it must be certified to be exceptionally precise. 
There are far too many components of modern-day watch mechanisms to explain every one, but this exploration gives both an overview of just how complex watchmaking is.

Physicists turn to micro-scale engines to bend second law
The second law of thermodynamics states, in the most basic terms, that as energy is transformed or transferred it is increasingly wasted. This law is one of the main impediments to designing efficient technologies; the thermodynamic laws affect everything from cars to batteries.
It has long been a mission of physicists to seek out some way by which this law of wasted energy might be bendable. While physics concerns itself with big-picture concepts, some physicists, such as Janet Anders, of the University of Exeter’s theoretical physics department, are taking a closer look and considering the potential of micro-engines, some potentially composed of only three molecules and powered by a single atom. 
Recent experiments to determine whether or not the quantum level is more demanding than the macro-level have found that the second law is actually more demanding at the quantum level. In the words of the English astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, any idea that goes against the law of thermodynamics will only “collapse in deepest humiliation.” While this may be so, physicists refuse to stop trying to break the rules.

Giant spider-bot unlocks secrets of web-vibration sense
Spiders use vibration sensitivity to determine where in their webs trapped insects are struggling and to quickly meet and consume them. However, the mechanism behind these vibration senses, is unknown. Researchers from Oregon State University attempted to find out more, using a large-scale web structure created out of threaded aluminum to simulate the spider’s web and an eight-legged model in the center which detects the vibrations from the web. 
Spider webs use two types of silk in their construction, though there are several other types used for various purposes. The researchers did the same, using both aluminum and elastic rope, attempting to be as true-to-life as possible. Using a large subwoofer, the researchers vibrated areas of the web and recorded the vibrations felt by the centrally located spider. 
This experiment found that spiders feel very complex vibration sensations. In some portions of the web, and at some frequencies, the shaking is heavy, while in other areas, it completely disappears. This allows the spider to know which area of the web the struggling insect might be contained in and to quickly respond by devouring the prey before it can escape.

Metamaterials showcase unique growth properties
Metamaterials are materials that exhibit properties not normally observed in nature. In the case of research performed by Ahmad Rafsanjani, a materials and mechanical engineer from McGill University in Montreal, that means expanding width-wise when stretched, rather than simply becoming thinner and longer. 
The properties of these metamaterials allow them to expand in all directions, effectively “unfolding” into larger structures. They are also adjustable, such that they can expand and return to their original geometric formation without much effort. Rafsanjani gleaned his inspiration from Islamic motifs, which he described as a “huge library of geometries.” In order to actually test out these metamaterial concepts, Rafsanjani created two simplified patterns out of laser-cut rubber sheets. 
Other more complicated patterns utilize complex origami folding techniques. These types of metamaterials are called auxetic, meaning that they are able to expand in all directions as they are stretched. Potential uses for this technology could be found in solar panels or satellite technology, and depending on how finely tuned one’s laser is, these auxetic materials can likely be scaled to the microscopic level.

Portugal’s storks cease migration to scavenge landfills
Researchers from the University of East Anglia are concerned with the migratory patterns of Portugal’s white stork population. The birds usually migrate to Africa for its warmer climates but lately, they have been staying in Portugal year-round. Whenever a species’ behavioral patterns change so drastically, it’s often a symptom of deeper issues, including a possible change in the local ecosystem. Strangely, however, the white stork population has been steadily growing for the past few years.
The amount of landfills within the area have also been growing, and these two factors were found to correlate. In an effort to discover why the storks’ behavior had changed, a team of researchers tracked 48 white storks’ movement patterns with GPS monitors. They found that the birds traveled to landfill sites quite often, and that the landfills had been supplying the storks with fatty leftovers year-round. 
This is problematic for a number of reasons, but one of them is that the storks frequently ingest smaller, inedible pieces of computers and plastic. In the future, this food supply will be dwindling, as landfill regulations and clean-up efforts mount, so perhaps the storks will learn to migrate once again.

Reprogrammed human cells regrow corneal tissue
Researchers have recently been able to coax human stem cells to grow into corneal tissue and utilize these to repair rabbit eyes. The cornea is a portion of the eye’s surrounding membrane, located directly in the front of the eye, and it is important for allowing light to enter the eye, and also for focusing a large amount of that light. 
The first study, performed by Kohji Nishida, an ophthalmologist at Osaka University, involved growing proto-eyes using reprogrammed human cells. These cells formed an eye-like structure, as expected, and when the researchers isolated cells with potential to become corneal tissue, researchers transplanted them into rabbits with corneal damage, and the cells repaired the damage. 
Potential advantages of this technology are tissue repair surgeries, but there may also be advantages beyond surgery as research moves toward tissue self-repair rather than transplantation. One example of this is a study done by Kang Zhang, a stem cell biologist, and his colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, in which researchers tested cataract patients’ eyes and observed that individuals who underwent the surgery were more likely to completely regrow their lenses.

Stem cells from fat used to create and repair cartilage
While many people would like to get rid of their extra fat, Rocky Tuan, the Director of the Cellular and Molecular Engineering Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, is turning liposuctioned fat into cartilage. Tuan is also using fat cells to grow partial tendons and ligaments to support the joints that this cartilage cushions. 
This process is made possible by the high amount of stem cells present in fatty — or adipose — tissue. According to J. Peter Rubin, Chair of Plastic Surgery and Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, fat cells are so multi-talented that they could be used as a sort of complete body repair kit.
One of the benefits of this type of transmutative process is that excess fat from liposuction surgeries can be put to good use, potentially finding its way into the joints of someone in need. There are also implications for this type of procedure in other areas of plastic surgery. Potentially, a similar process could be used to recreate muscle tissue as well. While there is still progress to be made before researchers completely understand each potential application of fat cells, this research could be an important leap in body repair.

Spring break is a time for students to relax and refresh midway through the semester. Some go home and spend time with family and some visit friends at other universities. Others follow in the footsteps of the millions of college kids before them and make the boozy, MTV-esque pilgrimage to the warm beaches of the south. We decided to forgo the rest and relaxation and spend Spring Break 2K16 digging trenches in the hot and humid town of Los Huatales, Honduras.
We’re going to be brutally honest. This was not a trip we were looking forward to. After sitting through several Global Water Brigades meetings and learning all about the holistic model that the organization utilizes to help communities, we wondered what the hell we had gotten ourselves into. Global Water Brigades focuses on helping a community develop a project that will bring clean water to the community. We were excited about the opportunity to go out and make a difference in the lives of rural Honduras, but there were plenty of aspects making us nervous. We were about to be thrown into a culture we knew nothing about, with a language that we spoke little to none of, with a group we barely knew. The possibility of catching Zika was the least of our concerns.
It was 3:45 a.m. on the first Saturday of spring break. With our suitcases in one hand and all the optimism we could muster up in the other, we began our journey to Honduras. Our group arrived at the airport and boarded our first flight to Atlanta. With sleep in our eyes and fear still in our hearts, we boarded our second plane to San Salvador, El Salvador. Unbeknownst to our group, we were arriving in the country at the same time as the Iron Maiden, who is surprisingly adored by a large fan base in El Salvador. The chaos made leaving the airport all the more difficult. We eventually made it out and began our scenic five hour car ride to San Lorenzo, Honduras. 
After traveling for almost fifteen hours, we finally reached the compound that we would be staying in. We were immediately welcomed in by the aromas of traditional Honduran food. We quickly realized that the food was going to be one of our favorite things about our trip, especially the fruit, which was always fresh and never once looked as sad as the fruit in Entropy. After dinner, we had time to settle into our rooms and prepare ourselves for the hard week of work that was ahead of us.
After an exhausting first day of traveling, our 7:30 a.m. alarms hit us pretty hard. We got up, ate breakfast with the rest of our group, and got ready to meet the members of the community that we would be working with. The drive to the community was about 45 minutes, half of which was spent on a rocky, unpaved road, which made for a very bumpy ride. We arrived in Los Huatales and were greeted by the Basic Sanitation Committee and the Water Council, both of which are comprised of community members who volunteered to serve a liaisons between Global Water Brigades and their fellow community members. Following this meeting, members of the community allowed us to visit their homes and see their current living conditions. Many of the homes were small and made of clay and tree branches. The community members explained how they had to walk several kilometers multiple times a day just to access water. Despite not having much, the people were still so optimistic and ready to work with us. We couldn't leave a home without the occupants telling us that they hope God blesses us in everything we do. The optimism of the community members and their well wishes were enough to get us through digging a million trenches. 
We woke up the next morning with the words of the community members echoing in our heads and a completely different outlook on the trip. We were as ready as we ever would be to begin digging trenches where the pipes the that would bring clean water to the town would be laid down in. As we made our way out to the digging site, we immediately knew this would not be an even remotely easy task. It was a smoldering 91 degrees with high humidity. The sun was unrelenting. There were very few shady areas. The ground was purely clay and rocks, and the digging was made all the more difficult because we were on the face of a steep mountain covered in thorny bushes.  After a few hours of digging, what seemed like the only cloud in all of Honduras finally graced our presence. Unfortunately, the cloud left as quickly as it came, and it was back to digging under the sun once again. As a group of students who spend most of their time studying, you can safely assume that we didn’t have a lot of experience with manual labor. Needless to say, working on the trenches kicked our asses. As the first day winded down we looked around at our progress and knew we had a long way to go. Supplying clean water to an entire community is no easy job. On the way back to the compound, the same rocky road that tormented us on the way to the village lulled us to sleep after a long day of work.
After a couple days of extremely hard labor, we attended a fair focused on teaching the children of the community about the water project. It is Global Brigade’s goal to make the communities sustainable, and educating the children plays a major role in the long term success of each of the projects. Following the educational fair, the community members and the students from the various attending universities performed together in a cultural exchange. Children from local schools performed songs and dances native to Honduras. We, as a varied group of Americans, had to rely on pop-culture dance crazes circa the early 2000s. Naturally, the “Cha Cha Slide” and “Cupid Shuffle” were already taken, so our group took it way back to 1995 with a classic — “Cotton Eye Joe." The cultural exchange was the highlight of our trip, and not just because we got a break from pickaxing in the sun. We got to experience Honduran culture first hand with our group members who, over the course of this trip, became our close friends. 
The last night of our trip was an emotional one, as we reflected on the previous week. Looking back on the beginning of this trip, it’s hard to believe that we were so hesitant in coming. In every sense of the world, our trip to Honduras with the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Global Water Brigades was amazing. We pickaxed a lot. We sweated a lot. But most importantly, we learned a lot. We learned so much more from the people of Honduras than they could’ve ever learned from us. It’s impossible to share all of what we’ve learned on our journey to Los Huatales, but some of the wisdom deserves to be shared.
We learned what it truly means to be grateful for something. There is so much in life that we take for granted. We complain about trivial issues when there are people all over the world without access to clean water. The trip really put that into perspective for us.
We learned that the barriers built up by cultural variations and language differences don’t stand a chance against the driving forces of kindness, generosity, and the pure joy of dancing and singing. We learned that giving your time to help others is one the greatest things one can do. One of our translators on the trip, Mario, left us with this quote: “Money is not the most important currency. The most important currency is time. Do not be stingy with your time.” 
Oh, and we also learned that Honduras has way better fruit than America.

(Editor's note: The following article contains spoilers for Netflix's House of Cards seasons 1–4.)
This was it. This is the season of Beau Willimon's House of Cards that sealed it into the hallowed halls of television history. The one that proves that the show is not just an erratic phenomenon, but a slow, pulsing story that shapes the way that we think about politics and the actors behind them. After season three, I was worried. It was showy, dramatic, and over-the-top, and I was left wondering how much longer I could watch these people have no consequences for their actions. The show had reached my limit, and I stopped believing in it.
But then, season four happened. Maybe it's that we're in the middle of an already outrageous election season. Maybe it's that the show had already been renewed for a fifth season. Whatever it is, something about season four made me feel like House of Cards was back with a vengeance. The show opens with a refocus on Lucas Goodwin, the spurned ex-journalist who is still in jail, but is now working for the government. Bringing back a character who got lost in the shuffle of season three was a bold move, but it set the tone for the rest of the season.
With characters like Goodwin, Zoe Barnes, Peter Russo, Tom Hammerschmidt, and Tom Yates coming back into play (albeit some in hallucinations), the series felt like it was referencing its roots and coming full circle as well as adding a sense of closure. However, this season also added new characters that became central to both the plot and the development of the characters whom we had already met. In a brilliant addition, this season introduces Claire Underwood's mother, Ellen Burstyn's Elizabeth Hale. Their relationship reveals a more nuanced side of Claire Underwood's character, as well as giving us more background on the Underwood's relationship than we have ever had before in the show.
Joel Kinnaman's Will Conway, the Republican candidate in the fictitious 2016 election, and his charming family are other additions to the show this season. As Frank Underwood preys on fellow Democratic hopeful and returning character Heather Dunbar, Conway presents another stark contrast to Frank, both in methodology and attitude. 
Though it had more of a cohesive thread to the rest of the series, season four also had its share of shocking moments that kept true to the show's infamous reputation. From the near assassination of Frank Underwood, to Edward Meechum's death, to the open Democratic convention, the stakes continue to climb higher and higher. The beauty of this show, though, is that we as an audience are willing to sit and watch as it gently nudges the boundaries of believability, buying into every plot line and allowing our anxiety to heighten.
The most beautiful moments of the show happen when we least expect them: Frank Underwood finding that Meechum's handprint he had drawn behind a painting had been covered up, Frank Underwood and Claire Underwood taking the stage after being nominated as presidential and vice presidential candidates respectively at the DNC, the determination of Hammerschmidt's quest to validate Goodwin's story and prove that Frank Underwood really did kill people, and perhaps most notable of all, Frank Underwood's threat to Durant.
In the most chilling moment of the show so far, Durant tries to stand up to Frank Underwood and seize the Democratic nomination for herself after finding out that Frank Underwood and Claire Underwood had stabbed her in the back. Frank Underwood jovially picks up a letter opener, tells Durant the whole story about killing Zoe and Peter, and that he'll kill her too. Then he laughs, tells her he's kidding, and asks her to reconsider.
In that moment, you realize how powerful the show is. To capture the attention of an entire nation for thirteen hours so that they can watch a pretend election while a real one is happening is no small task, and House of Cards does it with substance and style to spare.

Josh:
We hopped off the plane at LAX, with just a dream and a cardigan. "Welcome to the land of fame and sex," Jade said.
"Am I gonna fit in?" I asked. 
She said, "No." 
It was my first experience with time travel. We left Pittsburgh, PA at 6:45 a.m. Three hours, fifteen minutes, and 2,200 miles later, we arrived in Los Angeles, California, at 7 a.m. Having become accustomed to the cold, black void that is a Pennsylvania winter, I was immediately taken aback at the discovery that Los Angeles has been stockpiling all of the United States' sunlight reserves. Sunlight is vital to our survival; it feeds our plants and makes some people's skin change color sometimes. It's necessary. As hard-hitting investigative journalists, we decided to try our best to uncover what else this city has been hiding over the years. 
In order to do this, we began interviewing the locals, Humans of New York-style. We asked them the tough questions, and we got some tough answers. First, we accosted a trio of youths at a local Starbucks about this very pressing issue. "What do you think about the fact that we only have 160 sunny days every year, while you have 284?" They simply looked at us through their Ray Bans and sipped their caramocha frappalattecciniatos in contempt. We poked them right in their washboard abs to make sure that these youths were real, not just some North Korean-style pageantry, but they just sipped their bourgeois coffee, their privilege intensifying. We decided that we were fighting a losing battle, so we made a hasty retreat. 
We fled into a local eatery to avoid the prying eyes of the city's youth, but little did we know that our journalistic journey was not over. Not by a long shot. The restaurant was called Buca di Beppo, which translates roughly to Joe's Basement; literally to Giuseppe's Hole. It was neither a basement nor a hole, since we had to ascend a maze of stairs and corridors in order to find our table. Before we even got our menus open, we were greeted by an overjoyed woman who offered to take our picture. She posed us in a variety of ways, then left for a while. We wondered whether they were on to us — whether they were printing out those pictures to post on the L.A.'s Most Wanted List. The terror gradually faded, though, when our waiter came around. He warned us that the portions were super large — "Family Size," they called it. We had unwittingly stumbled onto another conspiracy. In order to investigate these tremendously large portions, we interviewed a nearby gaggle of women. I was unable to get a word in, since they were too invested in their discussion of the ocean, and how they lived so close that their lawns were basically pools, and how the air they woke up to was saltier than we were at hearing this. We never did get any of the answers we were looking for.
Overall, it was a fun time. We almost got kidnapped by Scientologists and pushed off a mountain, and we ate like the privileged youths we are. If I had to go back to L.A., it wouldn't be against my will. 
Jade:
As a native Texan and someone who’s spent their whole life in the South until recently, some things were a little bit less of a culture shock for me than for Josh. I’m used to warmer weather and in fact, California was a bit cooler than what I am used to in Texas for this time of the year. However, the weather seemed to be the only thing I was prepared for. There isn't anywhere quite like Los Angeles. I had only been here once before, and both times I expected to walk off the plane and instantly see celebrities in front of me. I guess I’ll have to hold out hope for whenever I go back because it didn't happen this time. I also expected to see the Hollywood sign as soon as I set foot out of the airport, which also didn't happen. Disappointed with my lack of celebrity and sign sightings, I gathered my things as Josh and I left the airport.
We did a lot of exciting things in Los Angeles, one of which was explore the Universal City Walk, which is where we went to the place that not only stole my heart, but also nearly caused me to go bankrupt: the Los Angeles Sock Market. I had never seen such a place, but as someone who prides themselves on their sock collection, I felt like a higher power had lead me there. It took a lot of self restraint for me to only leave with two pairs, one of which I bought for a friend. I quickly realized at the register, however, why California is called the Golden State. It’s because you need a gold brick to afford anything in that state. I’m also convinced that everyone there must actually grow money because that seems to be the only way to get by. However, Josh and I did not have enough time to investigate this claim so it’s still up for debate.
The most amazing thing I think we did while we were there was visit the Griffith Observatory. Upon arriving, another ton of bricks about the Hollywood sign was dropped on us. Contrary to popular belief (and by popular I mean Josh and I) the Hollywood sign DOES NOT LIGHT UP. When it's dark outside, it can't even be seen if you aren't really close. I figured something as iconic as the Hollywood sign would at least have one light on it, but alas there were none. So with heavy hearts, we continued our trek up the hill until we reached Griffith Observatory. There is one thing about this place that is characteristically un-Californian, it’s free. Not a single dollar is required for admittance which makes the whole experience ten times better.
The view of Los Angeles from the observatory is simply amazing. Downtown sprouts up like a weed among the backdrop of the rest of the city. I expected to see amazing sights here, but what I didn't expect was to run into a future celebrity. We met this little girl named Amy who is definitely going to be the next "it" girl in Los Angeles. Since this is California and everyone is an aspiring something, they all have agents. While Amy might have only been two, she already has an agent that she refers to as “dad” to keep things casual. It seemed like every part of the observatory we went to, we ran into Amy acting out of control and her agent trying to reason with her. I’m not sure what celebrity problem was fueling her meltdown, but her agent was not tolerating it. Josh and I were really honored to just be able to meet a little local celebrity, even if she had missed nap time.
Standing on top of that hill in that observatory, I had a moment of realization. I finally understood why despite how expensive it is and all the other chaos, people still flock there. Looking down on all the buildings that look like Lego bricks in the city where dreams are realized, it hit me that there's one magical thing that pulls people here from all over the world. No matter where you're from, there's one thing that will inevitably pull you here and that thing is
In-N-Out Burger.

It’s always cool to be in a band. One of the coolest new bands on campus is called ‘John Corbett and the Relatives.’ The cool people who make up the band are, you guessed it, a cool guy called John Corbett, a junior computer science major, and his cool friends Anthony Nitche, a junior architecture major, Abigail Adams, who is a sophomore studying music, and Evan Bergeron, a junior studying mathematical sciences. Carrie Qiu, a senior chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major, joins them sometimes to sing for them. As you can see, the whole thing is pretty cool.
John Corbett and the Relatives is an informal group of friends who mainly cover pop-rock songs by bands like Green Day, Blink-182, and the Foo Fighters. We spoke to Corbett and Nitche about how they started the Relatives, what their process is, and how they got into music in the first place.
For the people who don't know professor Riccardo Schulz, he's the long haired guy who inhabits the basement of CFA. In addition to running the Carnegie Mellon recording studio and teaching all the recording classes, he is one of the coolest and nicest people on campus. A lot of collaborations have come out of Schulz's classes, hugely due to Schulz being so actively involved in bringing people with similar music interests together. This case is no different, with most of the band meeting in Schulz's classes, and it isn’t the first time that’s happening. Both Corbett and Nitche agreed that they're never been part of a band formed "on purpose." The bands they have been a part of were always unplanned and formed spontaneously, and they believe that most bands that last start this way.
Corbett is part of a more serious band called Bergman, which is pretty famous at Carnegie Mellon for being one of the best contemporary jazz and funk bands on campus, while Nitche is working on a solo project called 'Lost in Site.' The Relatives was formed mostly for fun, and their objective is to cover popular songs, play at parties, and have a good time. They recently played at the CIT Ball, which was one of their few formal gigs. As all the members already have a more serious side to their musical commitments, the Relatives is focused on being enjoyable and informal. A lot of times the Relatives end up playing songs that stem from middle-school nostalgia, and are more silly than technical. Having skilled musicians play fun old-school songs will take you back to your middle and early high school days, when stress was low and the volume was high!
On being asked about their process, both Corbett and Nitche agreed that the idea for every song they do is always started by one or two band members, and then everyone puts in their bits to form a complete song. Having more than one or two people coming up with an idea for a song does not work and gets very chaotic, as everyone thinks differently and has different tastes and musical backgrounds. Even when writing in a group, the process is usually spearheaded by one person and everyone works around the initial idea.
With regard to musical background, Corbett’s story is very interesting. Growing up, he was exposed to his dad’s guitar playing a lot and took it up himself when he was 11, just because he thought it was "cool." Before long, he found himself in a band with a skilled guitarist and drummer. His journey into bass also started here as he transitioned from guitar to bass and began taking bass lessons, his earliest inspirations being jazz legends like Miles Davis and Coultrain.
Nitche, on the other hand, had a very different entry to the world of music. Suffering from Asperger's as a child, Nitche had problems socializing growing up. It was always a struggle communicating with others. His life changed when he went to see Titanic and was captivated by the soundtrack. Immediately deciding to start learning music, Nitche started taking classical violin training. By the time he reached his teenage years, he was communicating most of his feelings through music and got into more popular styles, diversifying from his classical training. Even today, he is always looking to diversify into other new styles and become fluent with them. As someone with classical training in a pop-punk band, Nitche says he often finds himself in uniquely positioned to incorporate violin into more rock styles.
Both members noted that people on campus looking to get involved with or start a band should make friends to jam with, play music with them as often as possible, and take every gig they can get. Instead of looking to start a band, look for people to play with. Making friends who are active musicians is the best way to get started and involved. The Independent Music Organization is also a great place to meet people, as they have open jam sessions every week.

A couple of weeks ago I had a friend visiting from Princeton and as usual we were scrambling to find a place to eat. He lives in Pittsburgh, and went to high school here, but somehow had never heard of Bangkok Balcony, despite the fact that I — after spending a mere year and a half living in Pittsburgh — have eaten there a good five or six times. He wanted Thai food, and I knew where to take him, and by the end of the meal he was scratching his head, wondering how he had never eaten there before. And that’s no surprise, it is a little difficult to find. 
Bangkok Balcony is nestled on the second floor of a building in Squirrel Hill, above a mattress store, but does have a decently visible neon sign indicating its presence at the entrance, where there are stairs leading up to it. The stairs are a little steep here, and to the best of my knowledge there isn’t an alternative wheelchair accessible entrance, so if you’re planning to take someone who has trouble with stairs, air on the side of caution.
What strikes me the most about the restaurant is its incredibly charming atmosphere. The view from the large window that takes up an entire wall of Bangkok Balcony looks out over Forbes, and at night, when cars are driving past, and the bold neon that lines the window pane light up, the view is unexpectedly gorgeous. I would highly recommend going around sunset for an enchanting experience. The waiters are wonderfully kind and accommodating, and the decor is a wonderful mix of reds and golds, with token Thai decorations. 
Instead of your typical tablecloths, the tables are topped with a white paper cover, and in the past the waiters and waitresses have been kind enough to let me borrow a pen to doodle on its surface until my food arrives. The silverware is a little heavy and has handles that are swirled at the ends, and the food is bright and full of flavor.
A typical dinner dish here costs between 13 to 15 dollars, but the portions are pretty big, so you’ll most likely be packing things up for round two unless you’ve got a big appetite. If you’re looking for something that’s easier on the wallet, I would go for lunch. The lunch special here includes a wonderfully light soup with fresh tofu and a side salad along with your meal. If you order that, a drink, and maybe an extra side then you can still keep your order value under $15 and have food left to take home with you. 
Yellow Curry: This classic sweet thai curry is one of my favorite things to order at Bangkok Balcony. Most of their curry, noodle, and rice dishes come with the option of adding one of many proteins, and for this I usually go with chicken. What’s most intriguing about this dish are the beautifully cooked sweet potatoes. You can cut through them like butter, and they complement the coconut flavor incredibly well. I might even go as far as to say I could do without the chicken. It wasn’t on the lunch specials menu though, which was incredibly disappointing, but if you’re going for dinner, ORDER IT.
Red Curry: Coconutty and spicy, sharp and smooth all at once. This is the curry to go for if you’re not particularly into the whole concept of sweet mains. I will say, though, that as the spice level goes up, so does the chilli flavor which masks the coconut more than I personally would like. So I go for the less spicy option, but if you like the chilli then I say go for that 10 out of 10 spice level.
Duck Curry: If you’re not into duck, I would be a little wary with this one. It’s got a very heavy duck flavor to it and the curry is very sweet and a little watery. I personally was not a huge fan, but I know people who love duck and were quite pleased with this dish.
Lemongrass Noodles: These are flat noodles (sort of like Pad kee mow) with a great and hefty lemongrass and basil flavor to them. If you’ve never tried flat noodles and you love the fragrant end of the Thai flavor spectrum, then I would try these. This is also, apparently, one of the more popular dishes, and is great no matter what the spice level is.
Crab Rangoon: Crab rangoon is one of those hit or miss kind of dishes, and Bangkok Balcony’s salty rendition is a definite hit. The filling is a fine puree that holds itself together, and the outer shell is crispy and delicately crafted. The sauce that comes with it, however, is very sweet, so I personally just dip a small corner in, lest the sweetness overwhelm my palate. They’re also so pretty to look at.
Pad Thai: Pad Thai is somewhat of a defining dish for any Thai restaurant. It sort of echoes the level of mastery of an establishment, given its simplicity and high popularity. For Bangkok Balcony, the Pad Thai was about a 7/10. It has a great balance of flavors, and the noodles were made well, but there was no wow factor. It was a typical Pad Thai that would go well with some curry or a meat dish, but I don’t think it fares as well as a stand alone dish. 
Veggie Tofu Soup: This sounds like a boring dish, and I honestly wouldn’t have tried it had it not been a part of the lunch special, but it’s really an unsung hero. It’s incredibly light, and the vegetables are flavored and go very well. The best part about this soup, however, was the tofu. It was melt-in-your-mouth soft, and didn’t taste like that store-bought stuff you usually get at asian fast food restaurants. It tasted fresh, and the soup as a whole was very refreshing. 
Hot tea with dinner, as you might’ve figured by now, is something that I have regularly. Bangkok Balcony has a decent tea selection including: House, Oolong, Jasmine, or Green. I’ve so far tried the Oolong, Jasmine, and Green tea, all of which taste pretty much like your run of the mill generic store-bought brands. That’s not to say they aren’t satisfying of course, the more bitter flavors complement a coconut-flavor heavy meal — as one would expect in Thai food — really well. 
Thai Iced Tea: If you’ve never had Thai Milk Tea before, I apologize on behalf of all of those who should’ve ordered it for you and never did. It’s positively delicious, and this is coming from a lactose intolerant person. Thai milk tea is a sort of iced chai, but packed with very rich thai flavors. It’s a great way to balance out any spice in your meal because it’s cold, milky and sweet. 
Cha-ching: The place takes cards and cash, and ranges from medium to high prices. It’s pretty reasonable if each person just gets a main and a drink for dinner. 
Meat, glorious meat: There are vegetarian versions of pretty much every dish that can have meat added to it, as well as shrimp for all you pescatarians out there.
Rash Alert: GLUTEN-FREE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE, and the servers are always more than happy to let you know what is in what in case you have any severe allergies.
Are we there yet?: Take any of the 61’s up to the Forbes and Murray intersection and then stay to the right side of the road and keep walking down. It’s above a mattress store called “Levin Mattress.” Here’s the address: 5846 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15217. (It’s also VERY close to Everyday Noodles).
Click, click: The website is quite comprehensive. It's great for looking at menu items and delivery options and it has tons of information about the restaurant. Definitely worth checking out: http://bangkokbalconypgh.com/
For those stay-at-home days: They deliver! (Not if you’re too far away though). Call 'em up and find out if you can have something delivered to your doorstep: (412) 521-0728. This is also the number to call if you want to make reservations or inquire about the menu.
Hours:
Sun – Thu: 11 a.m. – 10 p.m.
Fri & Sat: 11 a.m. – 11 p.m.
21+: They’ve got a full bar and from what I’ve heard pretty good cocktails, and they also do mocktails.
Ambience: Every time I’ve gone, the staff has been very friendly and they know the menu quite well, so it was easy to get recommendations for meals and whatnot. The decor is simple and tasteful, and is a nice take on traditional Thai art and more contemporary design. It isn’t an awfully huge restaurant, but I have yet to go and have to wait more than five minutes for a table. Overall descriptors: Simple, charming, and warm.
College student friendly?: As was previously mentioned, some of the options for dinner are a little on the pricier side, but other than that I feel like I see more college students there than in other places. I’ve also seen lots of college students bring their parents here for dinner, so it’s got a nice mixed atmosphere. 
Overall rating: 4 melons

At 5:30 p.m. this Saturday, the Soldiers and Sailors Auditorium was packed with countless excited members from 16 greek organizations on campus and their friends, families, and professors eagerly waiting for them to perform. There were teapots and clocks, school children and fairytale creatures, and an anxious audience murmuring and taking quick pictures before the show started. At 5:45 p.m., the five minute warning lights lulled half of the audience into anticipatory silence, and the greek organizations into a hushed frenzy, as makeup was touched-up and final best wishes were exchanged. As the house lights dimmed and the stage lights flashed, overall Greek Sing chairs Amanda Branson, a junior humanities and arts major of Delta Gamma, and Erin Persson, a senior civil engineering major of Kappa Alpha Theta, graced the stage in black evening gowns to start the show. 
Greek Sing is an annual philanthropic event put together by Carnegie Mellon’s various sororities and fraternities. The show serves to combine  fundraising for charity with the infectious delight of musical theater. This year the show sponsored “Our Clubhouse,” an organization that supports families and individuals who have been “touched by cancer.” On the whole, Greek Sing set a goal to raise $160,000 for Our Clubhouse over the course of two years and, much to the delight of everyone in the auditorium, succeeded that night. The next organization that Greek Sing will be sponsoring is Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Camp Kesem, which strives to “support children through and beyond their parent's cancer with innovative, fun-filled programs that foster a lasting community.” The current goal is to raise $150,000 over the next two years, and we wish them the very best for achieving this for such an important cause.
As for the show, each organization is given 15 minutes to perform their piece. There were two categories for the evening: singles and doubles. The doubles were collaborations between fraternities and sororities, and the performances were condensed, high-energy renditions of full-length musicals complete with a band, dancers, singers, actors, intricate set designs, costumes, and makeup. Here was the lineup for the night:
At the end of the night, the trophy for first place went to the incredibly costumed and wonderfully quirky performers of Delta Gamma and Phi Delta Theta in [ITAL]Shrek[ITAL]. Their singing was soulful, and the great attention to detail that lingered throughout each number made the performance wholesome and enjoyable. They stayed true to both the musical and the Dreamworks classic that we have all come to know and love. 
In second, were the sisters and brothers of Delta Delta Delta and Alpha Sigma Phi with Mamma Mia, with a co-lead who bore an astonishing resemblance to Meryl Streep. What stood out here was the meticulous fusions between dialogue and song. From the father-conundrum that arose in "Voulez-Vouz" to the captivating performance of "Lay All Your Love On Me," Mamma Mia did not disappoint.
In third were the stylish and polished members of Kappa Alpha Theta and Sigma Chi in Chicago. The choreography was clean and each and every number was executed with finesse, both from the singing and dancing perspective.
While the winners are set, I want to take a moment to recognize the other notable performances that contributed to making the evening the wonder that it was. Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Tau Delta’s Beauty and the Beast was perhaps the most intricately choreographed performance of the evening, with major credits going to Sarah Deluty, a sophomore neuroscience major. The ensemble brought life to the stage, and the leads were expressive and true to their roles. All-in-all, it brought to life an old Disney classic, and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
Alpha Phi and Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Hunchback of Notre Dame carried on the Disney theme, and with witty gargoyles, colorful and lively gypsies, and a multipurpose set that was honestly very well used.
Alpha Chi Omega and Kappa Sigma’s Matilda was something unexpected and heartwarming. Matilda is one of those stories that many of us found comfort in as young readers, and seeing it come to life was magical. Every character was invested, and active and the musical numbers were crisp and inviting. 
Last, but certainly not least, Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha brought to the stage a Carnegie Mellon themed version of everyone’s guilty pleasure, High School Musical. Sharpay was sassy, basketballs were rampant, and best of all we got to hear the leads belt out “Breaking Free.” I honestly couldn’t stop singing along.
As for the singles, it was a face-off for the winning position between Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Alpha Epsilon Pi, performing the first and second half of a mash-up of The Magic School Bus, The Wizard of Oz, and The Pink Panther titled, respectively, The Gizzard of Oz and The Path of Justice (Justice). Sigma Alpha Epsilon lived up to their reputation of performing a sort of free-form, “YOLO” play, which left the audience in tears from laughter. The story followed the path of an appendix seeking to find purpose in life, who encounters Ms. Frizzle and the gang on their journey into the human body of an insanely unhealthy fourth grader. This transitioned into Alpha Epsilon Pi’s story of the investigation of said fourth grader’s untimely unconsciousness, with a friskier Ms. Frizzle and a detective with knack for circular reasoning. The award for first place ultimately went to Alpha Epsilon Pi, but I think I can speak for everyone when I say that the two performances were like Ying and Yang, complementing and bringing out the best in one another.
If you didn’t go this year, be sure to check it out next year. All the organizations put in a lot of effort for a great cause and a great evening, and it really is something special.

The buzz behind Disney's newest animated film Zootopia before its release on March 4 was much less loud than Disney is used to. The trailers set up a world where animals have evolved to be sentient and civilized, living amongst each other peacefully, and an unlikely pair — bunny and fox — have to solve a mystery. Would it be a buddy cop movie? A kid-sized procedural a la Law & Order? Or a 90-minute excuse for Disney to use all of the cliched animal puns it's gathered over the years? After watching Zootopia, however, the answer becomes entirely clear. While it is all of the above, it also happens to be so much more.
Rabbit police officer Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, must team up with fox con artist Nick Wilde, voiced by Jason Bateman, to solve a missing otter case. In the process, they stumble onto a larger conspiracy that could threaten the peace of the animal world. 
The first 10 minutes of Zootopia is dedicated to exposition. A flashback to Judy as a child shows her participating in a school play with her classmates, explaining that a long time ago animals were savage and predators and prey were tireless enemies. But now animals are civilized: they wear clothes, they go to work, they use smartphones, and, most importantly, they live in a world where any animal can grow up to be whatever they want to be. 
Judy, a rabbit, daughter to rabbit farmers, proclaims that she wants to be a cop in the big city. She is quickly shot down because she is a bunny, and the police have never had bunnies on the force before. This, the world of Zootopia, is not completely unlike our own. Equal opportunity is more theoretical than practical and the idea that anyone can be anything is much more complicated than our childhood dreams. 
It is clear that Byron Howard and Rich Moore, the directors of this film, had two goals in mind when creating this film. They wanted to create an entertaining, wildly spinning adventure through a tightly crafted and richly rendered world. They also wanted to introduce kids and possibly re-introduce adults to an approachable vocabulary about racism in our country. Similarly to how Disney Pixar’s film [ITAL]Inside Out[ITAL] used metaphors to personify emotions and humanize the world of mental health, Zootopia uses the dynamic of predator and prey to comment on topics that have dominated the media in the wake of movements like #BlackLivesMatter, which was created to address the racism still pervasive in a society that often claims to be "post-racial." 
The film shows examples of racism, bias, stereotyping, cultural appropriation, microaggressions, white supremacy, and tokenism. At the same time, it only barely hints at any direct correlation for racism in our own world. In one scene, Judy informs her cheetah co-worker Clawhauser that the word “cute” is only okay when bunnies say it to each other, but not so much when other animals say it. This is a clear example of cultural appropriation and it mimics our own discussion of who can say certain words in our culture. At the same time, Nick the fox is instantly accosted when he enters a store because the store owner believes that he will steal something, a story ripped straight from the experience of many young black men and women. The situations are handled incredibly well, and the audience gets what’s happening without feeling like they are being preached to. 
Not only is [ITAL]Zootopia[ITAL]'s content meaningful and introspective, it is also delivered in one of the most enjoyable packages I’ve experienced in animation in the last few years. The script is rife with the aforementioned animal puns. At one point, Chief Bogo, a buffalo voiced by Idris Elba, starts a meeting by “addressing the elephant in the room,” at which point the camera reveals an actual elephant who’s celebrating her birthday. The rye humor of filling the DMV with sloths is definitely not lost for any adult who’s had to block out an entire day in order to get their license renewed. The film is also gorgeously animated, painting varying landscapes like dark rain forests and scorching deserts in equally impressive detail. Each animal has an extremely wide range of emotions unique to their body (Judy’s ears clue us into her emotional state as much as her words do), and this is only improved by the star-studded voice cast.
Zootopia is an important film, and an incredibly fun and moving piece of cinematic animation. It shows that while it may not be the easiest to break down important concepts such as inequality and bias for such a young audience, it’s an endeavor worth pursuing if we want our society to truly be one in which everyone is afforded the same opportunities.

This Wednesday, March 16, Carnegie Mellon’s Student Senate hosted the second part of the three part First Lectures Series. Each part features two current seniors who give a roughly half hour speech to current students on the lessons they have learned over the four years they have spent at Carnegie Mellon University. The First Lectures Series is based on Randy Pausch’s lecture and the book he later published titled “The Last Lecture,” which much of the student body became familiarized with before starting their time here. Mirroring how Pausch imparted his final words of wisdom to the Carnegie Mellon community before his passing in 2008, these groups of seniors hope to impart their own wisdom and reflect on their experiences here at Carnegie Mellon in order to have a lasting effect on current students before they venture off onto their distinct life paths.
Students of all grade levels, majors, and interests gathered in Porter Hall 100 to hear student speakers Rubini Naidu, a psychology major and photography minor, and Nitsan Shai, an electrical and computer engineering major with minors in computers science and music, give their first lectures.
Rubini Naidu’s Story
Naidu began her lecture by reflecting on her familial Indian roots. Although she was born and raised in Michigan, Naidu was very much influenced by the values instilled in her by her family. She talked about the high value that education had in her household. This began with her grandfather’s decision for his son (her dad) to receive an education rather than helping the family put food on the table. “Hearing something like that from my father has instilled in me gratitude for the opportunity of education,” Naidu said, also mentioning that Carnegie Mellon is a rare opportunity that we should take full advantage of.
Honing in on her knowledge of psychology, Naidu began to explain the concept of multiple intelligences to the audience. This idea theorizes that rather than ranking one person as more intelligent than another based on one type of assessment, we actually have nine different types of intelligences. This proposes that while we are all intelligent, how this intelligence is measured depends on the individual. Naidu invited audience members to think about which of the nine intelligence factors they believe they fall into.
Naidu said she feels that based on her interest in psychology and the passion she has for working with people, she falls in line with interpersonal intelligence — the ability to sense people’s feelings and motives — and intrapersonal intelligence — the ability to understand one’s self and one’s wants and needs. It is then no surprise that she sought to become an academic coach for academic development. Through this job, she has been able to put her skills in action by helping those struggling with school work or simply in need of extra help.
Naidu has been able to spend her time at Carnegie Mellon doing what she loves and working to build a future career from it. She even cites the incredulity of her minoring in photography. During her lecture she shared beautiful photos of the sights she saw during a trip to India, ranging from large buildings to flowers. The pride she had in her work was made evident by her expression.
She also told a story that was told to her on one of these trips to India by the mother of a then six-year-old daughter. The woman was struggling with money problems and was unable to sustain music lessons for her daughter. This taught Naidu that while we are concerned with our classes and making certain grades, there are many people around the world that are struggling with the simplest of life’s troubles such as health and money. Naidu states “we not only have the opportunity for an education, but we have the opportunity to be able to make a living doing something we’re passionate about, and that is so rare.” We should not fail to be grateful for the opportunities we have as Carnegie Mellon students, and even as Naidu is about to say farewell to this university, she hopes that current students will be able to move forward with the rest of their academic journey keeping this message in mind.
Nitsan Shai’s Story
Shai chose to focus his lecture on “The Importance of Smiling” even during life’s toughest moments. Shai stated, in response to the notion that he is always smiling, “I don’t particularly notice that I smile a lot … I think what makes me happy is making other people happy.”
Shai portrayed himself as someone that is generally happy and always takes the initiative to become involved in his many passions. Though majoring in electrical and computer engineering, Shai also has a love of the arts, which is evident from his roles in Scotch ‘n’ Soda and Carnegie Mellon’s The Originals a cappella group. Shai is also the student supervisor for academic development.
When asked about how he is able to take part in all these activities, Shai stated “often times, I don’t,” noting that this is a weird answer. While it is important to be aware of your passions and seek this out, it is also important to be able to balance it all. If he is unable to participate in something, he makes sure that someone has got him covered.
Looking at Shai’s history, however, and the hardships he and those around him had to endure, further highlights his amazing ability to see the positive in life. Shai is Jewish and was born and raised in Israel for the first five years of his life. His grandfather and his family, then living in Austria, were sent to different concentration camps. His grandfather and his sister “didn’t meet for another 20 to 30 years afterwards,” Shai said.
Shai stated that the reason his grandfather survived in those conditions was because his uncle took care of him when he got sick after escaping. Shai believes that his family history shows that “helping others, whether they’re your family or just in your nearby community and caring for other people is really the reason I’m here. I wouldn’t be alive if that wasn’t the case.”
Although his family faced many struggles as evidenced by their history, Shai himself was also affected by hardships during his time at Gunn High School, known for “The Silicon Valley Suicides” as titled in The Atlantic magazine. 
In response to this, Shai stated “I’ve been dealing with stress culture issues since my freshman year.” What kept him motivated through this period of time was the activities he partook in during his free time. He participated in musicals, tutored kids, programmed projects he thought were interesting — basically anything that he found interesting that made him happy. “Through doing the things I loved, I continued to smile.”
Shai noted that one of the distinct differences between his high school and Carnegie Mellon is the resources available here. Though Shai thought he was headed for a fresh start once enrolled at Carnegie Mellon, during his first year here there was a campus suicide. Shai questioned “Did I go to the right place? Is this problem following me?”
One of the main things that Shai wanted audience members to take away from his lecture was the amazing resources that Carnegie Mellon has to offer. This is what kept him moving forward during his time here and assured him that he had indeed made the right decision. He wants students to know that we should not be afraid to ask for help when needed, whether that be during our time here at Carnegie Mellon or after our lives here at the university.
The final lecture will take place on April 13 at 4:30 p.m. with electrical and computer engineering and human-computer interaction double major Erik Pintar, and electrical and computer engineering major Wole Idowu. These lectures will take place in Porter Hall 100.

The 2016 Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Trading Challenge took place earlier this year. It is an annual, four-week electronic trading competition where teams of undergraduate and graduate students partake in a simulated environment that immerses the contestants in a professional trading platform where they engage in trading a variety of CME products. This year, 1800 students from 30 countries around the world participated in this competition. Out of almost 500 teams, Carnegie Mellon’s very own team Scotty Dogs of the Dow came in second place.
Scotty Dogs of the Dow is comprised of first-year business majors Preston Bryant, Kimberly Zhang and Grant Glosner, as well as sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Samuel Lee, and sophomore mathematical sciences major Varun Singh. Over the course of the two week final round of the competition, the team managed to create a final simulated account balance of $443,430.00, which landed them in second place and made them one of the four winning teams. In first place was Team Alpha from Nanyang Polytechnic in Singapore. In third was Team Yolo from Concordia University in Canada, and in fourth was Team CU_Ugrad_1 from the University of Colorado Boulder in the United States. Students from each of the four winning teams will receive cash prizes and “are invited to attend a one-day market education conference at CME Group on April 15,” as stated on the 2016 CME Challenge press release. 
The five members of Scotty Dogs of the Dow came together after being selected by the Undergraduate Finance Association (UFA), which then required them to take a test managed by Mark Moskwa, current president of the UFA. “There were about 40 people interested and he was only taking 15 five per team, and then randomized the teams once they were selected,” explained Glosner. And thus the winning team was created. To prepare for the competition, the team reached out to other people that have previously participated in this competition, seeking any useful advice or words of wisdom they could provide. In preparation for the competition, the team members would keep in contact by messaging every day, in addition to holding two in person meetings every week over the four week period.
Each member of the team summarized the motivation and reasoning that led to them choosing to participate in this competition.
“Experience was a huge part of it,” said Zhang. “A lot of other organizations were promoting the competition…. I received suggestions from the Tartan Student Fund executive board that said it was important to familiarize yourself with the CQG software.”
Bryant and Singh also discussed experience. “A lot of us are involved in Tartan Student Fund (TSF) … We’re exposed to a lot of basic stuff, like buying, but in the competition we got to work with commodities and futures contracts,” Bryant said. “It was a way for us to get exposed to different types of assets.”
“I joined because I took Intro to Math Finance, and professor Hrusa talked about the types of futures that they’re trading here, specifically the commodities in this competition, and I wanted to gain experience trading those as well,” said Singh.
“The prestige of the competition,” was Glosner’s motivation. “Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which put on this competition, is the largest commodities exchange in the world, and this is probably the largest commodities trading competition in the world. I just wanted to be a part of it.”
Samuel Lee cited an interest in trading and working in the trading industry, as well as the opportunity to compete on a global level. He believes that “CME Trading challenge is one of the few competitions that exposes participants to professional trading software and live data feeds,” which provided him with “an authentic experience of being a trader.”
In the press release for the 2016 competition, Roberto Caccia, Faculty Director for the Burridge Center for Finance at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said “As a former Wall Street Professional, it’s great to see opportunities like the CME Group Trading Challenge complement what we teach in the classroom. This not only showcases students’ financial skills, but enables them to compete in real-world settings.”
When asked about any words of advice she would want to share to students interested in participating in this competition, Zhang stated, “If there is any hesitancy to join the competition, or any interest at all, don’t hesitate and just go for it, because you don’t have that much to lose. If you don’t place it’s fine, but the experience is invaluable.”
The members of the teams wanted to acknowledge the Undergraduate Finance Organization and Mark Moskwa, who is President of the UFA and a member of the team that placed fourth in last year’s competition. In consensus, the team stated that without this system of support, none of this would have been possible.
Editor's Note: A former version of this article said Grant Glosner was an undeclared first year student in Dietrich College in the transfer process to Tepper Business School, as opposed to a first-year business student.

The United States Department of Transportation named Pittsburgh as one of seven finalists for its “Smart City Challenge” as of March 12. Pittsburgh tied with Austin, Columbus, Denver, Kansas City, Portland, and San Francisco in the final tier of a government initiative that will grant $50 million to the winning city. The winner will then have the monetary capability to address transportation and transit obstacles facing expanding cities.
Pittsburgh excelled amongst nearly 80 cities that entered the challenge in February. The city was then awarded $100,000 to complete its application, which is due in April. The application enables the cities to finalize their ideas on transportation sustainability. Pittsburgh’s application was a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, the Port Authority, and countless other non-profit sponsors.
The team’s application expands upon Carnegie Mellon’s Traffic21 and Metro21 initiatives. By utilizing adaptive transportation systems that evolve with technology, new sensor information would pilot “Smart Spines” to gather statistics on major transportation corridors. This data would foster innovation in new usage for different models for transportation, thus creating new traveling options for underprivileged neighborhoods and increasing safety. Designed on an open platform, the system would propel Pittsburgh to becoming a test site for future transportation technologies.
Pittsburgh’s Mayor William Peduto is an adamant supporter of the “Smart Cities” initiative. “Smart Cities is not just about promoting the latest transportation and energy related technology. It’s about applying those efforts to improve the lives of everyday Pittsburghers by building smarter transit corridors and connections, bridging the digital divide and building greater equity in city neighborhoods, realizing the value of new energy opportunities, and reaching those impacted by displacement or isolation,” said the Mayor in a press release from the Mayor’s office.
Pittsburgh is quickly rising as a leading city for innovation that uses technology to address its changing social climate. With breakthroughs from both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh alike, tech giants have seized the city as a center of growth. Mayor Peduto says Pittsburgh is already implementing new technologies to ease traffic and cut down on pollution. For instance, the Hazelwood steel mill is slowly being converted into a mock city for Uber to test-drive driverless cars. Carnegie Mellon’s partnership with Google and Uber is meant to create innovative equipment to help them win the Smart City Challenge.
The winning city will be awarded federal grants in June.

For many people, ordering take-out food is a hassle. The steps of finding the restaurant, searching the menu, placing the order, and most inconvenient of all, picking up the food are in need of a 21st century revamp. Enter GrubHub, a food delivery service that allows its users to bring their favorite meals to their doorsteps in a few hassle-free steps.
On March 9, the Chicago-based company announced its plans to expand its turnkey delivery options in the Pittsburgh area, partnering with more local restaurants to “bring a broader set of restaurant choices to diners.” The delivery service has been offered in Pittsburgh since 2011, and has already connected 250 eateries with their customers. The platform is very popular with college students, many of whom lack convenient transportation, as well as the means to cook their own meals. Local favorites include Curry on Murray, Mad Mex, Kaya, and Fuel and Fuddle.
Since it was founded in 2004, GrubHub has become the nation’s largest online and mobile food-ordering company. Active operations span 1000 cities in the U.S. as well as London, UK. The company is partnered with 40,000 restaurants, and recently linked with the national chain restaurants California Pizza Kitchen, Bucca di Beppo, Veggie Grill, and Panda Express. Overall, the platform is very user friendly and gives the customer an array of search options.
According to Stan Chia, GrubHub’s Senior Vice President of Operations, Pittsburgh has seen a growth of restaurants over the past few years, and the company is “thrilled to offer residents more delivery options.” Indeed, searching the company’s website displays 65 results just in the vicinity of Carnegie Mellon’s main campus, with everything ranging from Asian to Mexican, Pizza to Falafel. GrubHub even has features that tell the user which restaurants are open, have special deals, and a category for healthy food. Ordering on GrubHub can either be done through the website or through the mobile app.
Based on previous trends, GrubHub is expecting to see a spike in orders with the beginning of March madness. The NCAA event usually increases orders made by Pittsburgh area college students by 11 percent. The significant uptick in orders also comes around the time of midterms, as people stay inside and order their favorite comfort food as they prepare for Carnegie Mellon’s notoriously difficult exams. GrubHub estimates that they will see a nearly 30 percent increase in orders from students around exams.
The company’s goal is “connecting diners with food they love” and “elevating food ordering through innovative restaurant technology.” While many chain restaurants already offer delivery service, GrubHub makes it easier to get food from your favorite mom-and-pop shops. For many small restaurants, Grubhub is the best way to get a reliable and feasible delivery service. While it may be too costly to provide delivery independently, working through the national-scale service provider keeps rates low. The arrangement is such that the restaurants also earn higher revenue because of their ability to reach more customers. This is a win-win situation for both GrubHub and their clients. Those in the culinary industry, such as Chef Bill Fuller of Big Burrito Restaurant Group, praises the model, saying, “we have been happy with the service and appreciate the new customers it has provided us. “
A full list of restaurants using GrubHub’s delivery service can be found on Grubhub.com under Carnegie Mellon University’s address (5000 Forbes Avenue). For the many college students in the area who rely on take-out for their meals, the recent expansion of GrubHub is a real treat!
Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said that the NCAA event increases orders by 11 percent and that Grubhub estimates that they will see a nearly 30 percent increase in orders around midterms, rather than an 11 percent and 30 percent increase respectively in orders from Pittsburgh area college students.

Spike Lee attends screening of his latest film Chi-Raq in McConomy Auditorium
This Saturday, March 19, award-winning filmmaker Spike Lee attended the screening of his latest film, Chi-Raq in McConomy Auditorium. Prior to the screening, Lee also participated in a “Face to Face with Spike Lee” event and Q&A.
Chi-Raq is a satirical musical drama and modern-day adaptation of the ancient Greek play Lysistrata, set against the backdrop of gang violence in Chicago. The title is a combination of the city’s name and Iraq, meant to equate Chicago to a war zone. The film features a star-studded cast including Nick Cannon, Teyonah Paris, Wesley Snipes, Angela Basset, Samuel L. Jackson, John Cusack, and Jennifer Hudson. It won the 2015 African-American Film Critics Association’s Best Independent Film Award. It is also part of the 2016 CMU International Film Festival “Faces of Conflict” lineup, which runs March 17 to April 3 at various locations in Pittsburgh.
Throughout the duration of his career, Lee has been nominated for two Academy Awards, won one Emmy, and is known for using his films to express political beliefs and examine race relations, the role of media, and urban crime.
“*Chi-Raq* and several of our other films point to the conflicts on our own turf,” stated Jolanta Lion, a director of the film festival and assistant director of the Humanities Center in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. “Having Spike address these issues in person is sure to empower our audience to be vehicles of change.”
Carnegie Mellon’s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation hosts Energy Week
March 14 through 18 marked Energy Week, hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation. The event was composed of over 100 renowned experts working to make more efficient, affordable, and sustainable energy. The event is first of its kind at Carnegie Mellon and was open to the public. Each day was themed. Monday’s theme was research, Tuesday’s was policy, Wednesday’s was innovation, Thursday’s was education, and Friday’s were field trips and the energy workforce.
Participants attended talks by top Carnegie Mellon researchers and other experts on the latest topics, participated in discussions and roundtables, and visited Carnegie Mellon labs and research centers to see Carnegie Mellon’s current efforts in energy. Various student competitions were also hosted.
The Scott Institute researches and develops new products in energy storage and distribution, nuclear and shale gas development, smart buildings and cities, electric energy systems, systems design optimization, and assessment in technology and policy. Launched in 2012 as a university-wide research initiative, the Scott Institute pulls together faculty from various departments and colleges in technology, policy, integrated systems, and behavioral science, as well as resources from external partners. It aims to facilitate real-world solutions for energy problems.
“That’s the whole idea of the Scott Institute,” said Andy Gellman, professor of chemical engineering and co-director of the Scott Institute. “We support deep research that leads to new products and new ways of doing things to improve energy and help Pittsburgh and the nation.”

As graduate student leaders, we want to break the silence about what is going on outside of our school. In particular, we want to address all communities of color at Carnegie Mellon, Muslim students, international students, and the LGBTQ community:
The violence at Trump rallies, which recently occured in Illinois, Florida, and neighboring Ohio highlight the extremist views of a very small minority of this country. It is, however, a violent part of America that has just been given a clear national mainstream platform. A lot of us find it difficult to believe that it is happening in our country, and feel overwhelmed by it.
Some of you may need to hear this, so we want to take a moment away from work to say:
No matter who you are, where you come from, or who you pray to, your lives and your voices are valuable in this country.
At Carnegie Mellon, we see and value the diversity that each and every one of you bring to the table day in and day out. Our school and our community are better places because you are here, adding your voice to the discussion and life we see every day. Please remember this as you use your voice and your intelligence to stand up against those who would you treat you as scapegoats. Please support each other in and out of the lab. Remind yourselves of your value.
We would like to also say do not dismiss what is happening regardless of your race and ethnicity. Get involved.
Speak out as loudly and as clearly as you are able to. Even Pittsburgh, despite what it might feel like at times and despite what your windowless office might seem like, is very much part of this.
With love and solidarity,
Allies Grad Executive Board
Indian Graduate Student Association Executive Board

A momentous decade awaits the human race. For better or worse, both ends of the political spectrum are waking up from a deep slumber. Climate change is in full swing. Environmental destabilization is fueling unprecedented political insurgencies. At this rate, the Middle Eastern refugee crisis will be a mere foreshadowing of what’s about to happen on a grander scale in Asia.
Ideas formerly dismissed as radical are now in revival. Canadian journalist and social critic Naomi Klein called this effect the shock doctrine, and then wrote an entire book about it, creatively titled The Shock Doctrine. Desperate times call for desperate measures, creating the perfect breeding ground for dangerous ideologies.
But then again, just as the crises facing humanity could be used to further malevolent agendas, they might also be our last shot at genuine social change for the better. Klein also wrote a book about this, called This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs Climate. “The Right was right,” Klein said. 
Climate change is more than the environmental collapse. It is the living proof that we cannot get away with right-wing “business as usual” policies, and hope to have a habitable planet within the next century. Climate change is the existential threat for the Right, and the momentum we need to put social justice back on the public agenda.
This should be the time when we perform checks on authorities of all kinds, from the patriarchy to oppressive race-relations, from government inspections to the “War on Terror,” from law enforcement to the very foundations of the justice system. This should be the time we demand our colleges to divest from fossil fuels, our governments to stop keeping artificially low oil prices, and, perhaps most importantly, demand each other to empathize and reflect on these structural deficiencies.
We as college students are especially responsible. Despite commonplace condescension and ridicule, the political correctness campaign across colleges nationwide put privilege-checks back on the agenda. Fewer people think it is okay to believe that they could have ended up a place like Carnegie Mellon on pure merit without acknowledging the role of luck or privilege. Ever since the 2008 crash, more students respond “make the world a better place” to inquiries regarding their plans after graduation. Tides are changing, but every social movement can be paired up with its backlash.
GOP candidates like to assert that they value “correctness” over political correctness. They’d rather give you the facts, without fear of whom they might potentially offend. Despite outright doublespeak — the sheer fact of climate change does seem to offend Republican candidates — there is a dangerous sentiment at the heart of that mentality. 
The truth of the matter is that unless you are experimenting on gravitational waves, reason and emotion not only coexist, but also are inseparably entangled. Politics and economy are nothing but structural manifestations of differing values. And when any non-scientist attempts to hide their radical propositions under the veil of cold-blooded rationality, that is when the responsible citizen ought to call foul.
When the Reagan-Thatcher-Friedman “cartel” claimed pure rationality in the seventies, it resulted in the greatest income gap seen in modern history, often euphemized as neoliberalism. When Wall Street did it, we had the 2008 crash. When Lenin did it, he inspired the most famous dystopian novel ever written. When Hitler did it, we had the, well, we had a bunch of things happening. A claim to objectivity in government affairs often signals a recipe for disaster.
I’ll have the millennial plea for sensitivity over right-wing claims to economic efficiency any day of the year. Go out there. Get involved. Voting is not the most democratic right you possess. It’s not even close. What you essentially have is a pick between the clown, the chief architect of the rabid Democratic shift to the right, and a self-proclaimed revoluRionary. If you honestly believe that as citizens of the freest nation in the world, all you get to do is decide which one of those gets to move into D.C. in November, well, that’s just depressing.

Last Sunday, Germany held regional elections in Rhineland-Palatinate, Baden-Wurttemburg, and Saxony-Anhalt. Frauke Petry’s far-Right party, Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), made resounding gains in all three elections at the expense of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the center-Left Social Democratic Party. This news is worrisome for several reasons. The first is that it comes on the heels of Merkel’s open door policy to Syrian refugees and shows significant xenophobia within the the German electorate. The second is that Germany has been Europe’s strongest economy for a long time and has significant sway over Europe as a whole. Movement toward the far right in Germany would have an outsized effect.
The third reason is a little more chilling. While that previous paragraph may have felt at home in 1932, there are key differences between AfD and the Nazis. The first is that AfD is a much less violent group and less prone to genocide (although this seems like an increasingly frail argument as their policy platform leaks further). The second difference is the powers surrounding the rising AfD. England, France, and other nations resisted the genocidal drive of the Nazi Party. If Germany does succumb to nativist forces, there might not be a similar power in their path this time. The far-Right in Europe has been on the rise for a few years. Countries like Hungary and Switzerland have been ruled by far-Right parties for years, while countries like Finland and Norway have had far-Right movements as part of ruling coalitions. Poland joined those nations in having a far-Right party in power, while in nearly every country across Europe, groups like Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France and Nigel Farage’s United Kingdom Independence Party have been increasing their strength in European governments and even threaten to take prime minister titles. Germany has broadly resisted the far-Right to this point, but AfD’s rapid rise to becoming a legitimate political player indicates that those days are over.
The far-Right parties in Europe are somewhat different from America’s political parties. Economic liberalism is pretty much the standard in European politics and their economic policy is rarely subject to major change. However, their Right and Left leaning parties tend to be decided on scales such as foreign policy (Euroscepticism, an opposition to the EU, is a common buzzword here, as is interventionalism) and cultural politics appeals to national identities (read: white supremacy) are at the core of this branch of policy. This makes the far right in Europe much scarier. To create a parallel to American politics, the far-Right in Europe is not similar to the Republicans; it is similar to short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump.
The rise of the far right in Europe has been a complicated phenomenon. While the Great Recession absolutely slammed Europe (some countries such as Denmark are still facing negative growth and nearly all of them are peaking close to 0 percent), it is not the only struggle the continent has faced. Several horrific policy failures from the North American Trade Orginization (NATO) (notably America’s decision to ignore Iraq in 2009 before we were certain the government was stable and NATO’s bombing campaign in Libya that led to the death of Libyan leader Muammar al-Ghaddafi) led to massive numbers of people becoming displaced and fleeing to Europe. Suddenly, many of those people who identify with the right felt their “national identity” was being threatened by the economic hardship and the influx of migrants.
Europe’s response to this is not surprising, but it’s incredibly disheartening. When economic anxieties rise, we ought to band together. Countries that initially resisted these blatant politics of racial resentment like Germany and America are now crumbling in the face of mounting fear that’s being fostered by demagogues like Petry and Trump. 
Sure, current events threaten us economically, but the economy is only good for measuring utility on a large scale. If our response to fear is to cut some people from our moral consideration, then talking of things in terms of economics and national security is moot. Slamming our doors in fear and playing hot potato with the migrant crisis gets us no closer to a global solution, but a lot closer to a violent and fractured world order.

One of the most common advertisements on Indian television is for a fairness cream, very creatively called Fair and Lovely, that supposedly lightens one’s skin color by two shades. Since 1975, these advertisements have featured a young girl with the lack of something, be it confidence, a job, or a husband. Then, a female figure helps this poor, poor girl by handing her the tube of Fair and Lovely, and after using it she becomes radiant, gorgeous, and the object of everyone else’s envy after all her dreams come true. 
Gender-swapped and introduced after 2005, new advertisements aimed towards the male population introduced Fair and Handsome — the fairness cream for men. In India, this obsession with fairness starts as early as childhood. It is a common practice for children to be scrubbed with turmeric paste, milk, and honey to lighten their skin color. In a culture where arranged marriages are the norm, being fair is often used as selling point for a prospective bride or groom. Throughout one’s life, the idea of being fair is tied to beauty.
Not only is this an unreasonable beauty standard, but it also promotes a kind of societal segregation on the basis of skin color, often called colorism. Darker women end up perceiving themselves as inadequate, not beautiful, and incapable. A society that perpetuates colorism often withholds opportunities from women of darker skin, with Indian cinema being the greatest testament to the bias that “fair is beautiful.” This attitude is as harmful as body shaming. No one should have to deal with such an unreasonable point of view.
In response to this illogical demand of society to be fair skinned, Pax Jones along with sisters Mirusha and Yanusha Yogarajah, all students from University of Texas, have launched a campaign on social media called #unfairandlovely, which brings to light this stigma. By allowing all women to publicly accept themselves by posting selfies with the hashtag, such forms of social change are rapidly gaining popularity among Indian youth. While this movement is a step forward towards rationality, inclusion, and feminism, I still think that it should be more inclusive of men and people in the non-binary gender spectrum. Although I will also say that women face greater pressure to adhere to beauty standards than men. It’s high time all people of color “celebrated the melanin” in their skin.
While colorism is definitely an issue, it is also interesting to question how such beauty standards came into place in India. One might say that, with its history of colonization by the British, having whiter skin came to be associated with beauty. It also could be due to the fact that staying indoors came to be associated with wealth and a higher class status.
However, Hindu mythology often speaks of dark-skinned gods, goddesses and royalty, venerating such figures, and speaking of the beauty of their dark skin. While this is not representative of all of India, it does represent a portion of it, where colorism is dominant. Were these stories created at the time to fight against colorism or did somehow, with the passage of time, the perception of dark skin shift?
It’s not just India that needs to face the injustice of its beauty standards, but also the rest of the world. Beauty standards are a threat to diversity and self-expression. It doesn’t matter if a person has dark skin, a curvy body, or curly hair. It is unhealthy for a society to push its people to model one frame of beauty. Now, this may be obvious, but people have a right to their own body and they have a right to not be judged for it. If you’ve read Scott Westerfeld’s book, Uglies, you will see the world where everyone has the same beauty standards as nothing short of a dystopia.

Pending the passing of a U.S. Senate-approved financial package which aims to combat opioid abuse nationwide, the federal government released $94 million in funding to care centers and hospitals nationwide. Pennsylvania’s piece of this pie amounts to $1.8 million.
In terms of impact, this funding could be huge; according to an article in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, this funding, spread out among Pennsylvania care centers, could allow each center to hire “one additional provider to identify and treat addiction,” and nationwide, this amounts to doctors being “able to see 124,000 more patients ... in addition to the 23 million already treated.”
However, none of this money will be going to the greater Pittsburgh area’s care centers.
Funding was administered on a competitive basis, and while all care centers nationwide were encouraged to apply, there has been no information as to whether Pittsburgh care centers applied, refrained from doing so, or if they were actively rejected.
Pittsburgh is in drastic need of this funding, given that this area has the second-highest heroin-related death rate in the state, with these numbers growing on a yearly basis. Whether or not the care centers applied for the funding, they should be receiving it. 
Allocating funds for such a vital effort on a competative basis fails to account for the real world distribution of the effects of heroin in our state. If they simply did not request it, then it’s a matter of willful ignorance of a problem plaguing our county; if they were not awarded this funding, it’s a matter of administrative oversight and blatant neglect at the hands of the state. Either way, those responsible to the safety of Pittsburgh citizens failed to protect those in need of help and treatment.
In the past few years, deaths by drug overdoses have surpassed the number of deaths caused by and related to car accidents in Pennsylvania, and while this is largely attributed to prescription drug abuse, it’s in the same vein of addiction. According to a White House profile of the state, Pennsylvania drug-related deaths are higher than the national average, and heroin is cited as the number-one addiction for which treatment centers admit patients. 
With drug-related deaths increasing yearly, and Pennsylvania 
leading the nation in young male overdose deaths, there is a clear problem that isn’t being addressed where it matters most.
While one of the newly funded treatment centers is located in Philadelphia, the area of Pennsylvania with the highest rate of opiate abuse, Allegheny County is not far behind. Philadelphia has 41.98 drug-related deaths per 100,000 residents, and Allegheny County has 24.93, which, while less than half, is far above many of the other counties’ statistics, four of which have 0 drug-related deaths per 100,000 residents. With such aggressive data coming from every direction — most notably from the federal government itself — it’s a wonder that Pittsburgh is not receiving comparable funding to combat this epidemic. 
Within the Appalachian region, drug addiction has been a frightening issue. 
Our own senator, Patrick Toomey, has recently spearheaded a bill which would address some serious prescription drug abuse within the state he serves. 
While prescription drugs are a necessary evil, and require heavy monitoring, heroin usage is slightly more cut-and-dry. There needs to be more of a focus on rehabilitation and recovery, and without the necessary funding, care centers in the Allegheny area are ill-equipped to handle the growing threat that addiction poses to our community. 
Unless our treatment capabilities can grow with the number of drug-related deaths — and hopefully aggressively lower them — the chasm between the problem we must tackle and our ability to do so will only increase.
