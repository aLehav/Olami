Day 130.
That is how long it took for the NBA lockout to reach its lowest point. Even with reports of internal party disputes and discussions of player decertification, the two sides are still too stubborn to agree on 2.5 percent of basketball-related income (BRI). 
Instead of watching the opening night of the NBA season on Nov. 1, we continued to discuss the lockout. Instead of NBA fans watching two of the league’s elite stars battle, Kobe Bryant watched Manny Pacquiao train and Kevin Durant watched HBO with teammate James Harden as the Los Angeles Lakers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder game was simulated by stat-o-matic on espn.com. 
NBA Commissioner David Stern has cancelled the first month of the NBA regular season — all games through Nov. 30. The chance of basketball being played on Christmas is about the same as a Dwight Howard three-pointer, and the chance that we might not see any basketball this season is becoming a serious threat. 
It was just one week ago that we had predictions of the lockout ending, with just two weeks of basketball cancelled and enough time to hopefully make those games up. The National Basketball Players’ Association (NBPA) and the NBA owners were steamrolling through many of the issues keeping us from basketball: revenue sharing, maximum contracts, the amnesty clause, and the salary cap.
Those discussions happened on Thursday, Oct. 27. The two parties met the next day, with reports saying that a deal should soon be made for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). But the tables flipped faster than fans could blink, and a disagreement over 2.5 percent ended all hope for a full season. 
The divide on basketball-related income has been the decisive mountain in these labor talks. The last CBA allotted the players 57 percent of BRI and the owners 43 percent. The players have made significant concessions on this front, but are holding firm at 52.5 percent. The owners, however, are stalwart on splitting BRI 50/50. The players conceded over a billion dollars in BRI; it is time that the owners met them in the middle. It is called a collective bargaining agreement for a reason, and an imperative element of agreement is compromise. 
But 2.5 percent is the difference between NBA games and no NBA games. 2.5 percent is estimated to be $100 million, yet the amount of money lost from a month of cancelled games is an estimated $350 million. When will the owners realize that the best thing for everybody — them, the players, the teams’ staffs, the employees of the arenas, the surrounding businesses of arenas, and the fans — is to just play ball?  Time to pull your weight, owners. The players’ concessions in CBA discussions currently totals to over a billion dollars. Yet a transfer of prospective wealth of an estimated 1 billion dollars from the NBPA to the owners is still not enough to end the lockout. 
Derek Fisher, NBPA president, and Billy Hunter, NBPA executive director, are trying to do right by the hundreds of active NBA players and all the future NBA players over the duration of this new CBA. There is no league without its players, so the owners need to agree on this BRI split and end this lockout.
On Saturday, Nov. 5, the two parties met again, with hostilities high and chances for agreement bleak, in another attempt to reach a deal. Stern said in a press conference that the owners would settle on 51 percent of BRI for players, and that the deal would be on the table until Wednesday. If the players don’t accept that offer, Stern said that the deal would get much worse, and the owners would offer 47 percent of BRI to players.
NBPA’s attorney Jeffrey Kessler then said that the deal does not allot players 51 percent of BRI, but really 50.2 percent, and the idea of the players ever getting 51 percent is a “fraud.” After Saturday’s deliberations, the chance of the season being entirely cancelled is all the more probable, as is NBPA decertification. But players remain vigorous and undaunted by Stern and the owners’ ultimatum, trying to reach an agreement with the interests of all future NBA players in mind.
“[The players] want to play, they want a season, but they are not going to sacrifice the future of all NBA players under these types of threats of intimidation. It’s not happening on Derek Fisher’s watch; it’s not happening on Billy Hunter’s watch; it’s not happening on the watch of this executive committee,” Kessler said.
So here we are at day 130 of the lockout: the two sides still far apart, unable to reach compromise. In a couple days, we could see games through Christmas cancelled. Fans are still waiting, hopeful on salvaging at least a shortened season. But when talks have so quickly dissolved to ultimatums and decertification, hope is in very, very short supply.

As one of the premiere franchises in the NFL and in all of sports, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the most analyzed teams in the game today. Prior to this year, many experts and other fans thought the Steelers would take a step back, considering that their already-old defense aged another year and their division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens, looked to be even better with younger players.
In the beginning of the season, it looked like the Steelers were lowering themselves to those expectations, as those very same Ravens pummeled them with a score of 35–7. Almost instantly, the city of Pittsburgh went on alert. Many fans worried that the experts were correct and that this team was destined to miss the playoffs, or suffer a first-round exit in the playoffs. Luckily, the NFL has 16 games in a season. The Steelers have gone 6–1 the rest of the way, with their only loss to the Houston Texans, and they are in the driver’s seat for the first seed in the AFC and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Looking back on the season so far, it was pretty ridiculous to panic about the Steelers, seeing as how they brought back the same team from last year’s almost-championship run. Sure, the defense is old, but in a season where there was almost no training camp, it may be better to be old. This team is full of veterans that have been playing together for years, and this has likely been a big reason for their current success. Even with injuries to linebackers James Harrison and LaMarr Woodley, the defense has been a strong unit, and it has only given up greater than 20 points in one contest this year. Their secondary, which I have long pointed out as a weakness, has really stepped it up this year, as cornerback Ike Taylor has performed as a top-10 CB and William Gay hasn’t hurt them as much as expected.  
Just last week, the Steelers had a vintage performance against the New England Patriots, who, at the time, were considered the best team in the AFC. Leading up to that game, fans were still doubtful as to whether or not Pittsburgh could come away with a win, because some of the Steelers' wins over bad teams had not been convincing. However, the Steelers dominated the Pats from kickoff to the final kneel-down, using short passes to eat up the clock and keep Tom Brady off the field. When the Patriots did get the ball, the Steelers were able to limit the amount of production from quick receiver Wes Welker, who has eaten teams alive throughout the year. All of this led to a classic Steelers win, where the offense eats up clock and depends on the defense to win them the game in the end. This win has changed everyone’s perception of the Steelers, as they have gone from perceived third or fourth in the conference to first. There are even some experts picking them and the Packers to meet again in this year’s Super Bowl in Indianapolis.  
With a fairly easy schedule coming up for the Steelers, my prediction would be that they pick up the first seed in the AFC, which is a huge advantage, especially since they are one of the best home teams in the league. Expect the Steelers to run through the rest of their schedule, with a potentially tough game against the 49ers. A 14–2 regular season is not out of the question, but even 13 wins or possibly 12 should get them through the first round for sure. Either way, the Steelers will be making noise in the playoffs once again, something that I’m sure everyone in this city has come to expect.

The Tartan recently caught up with the only woman on the Carnegie Mellon ice hockey team, Bryn Loeffler. Loeffler is currently a sophomore majoring in global studies and Hispanic studies, who is interested in joining the Peace Corps and eventually pursuing a career in foreign services.
Loeffler began her hockey career at a young age in Massachusetts. “It was actually a mistake,” Loeffler said. “My parents signed me and my brother up for ‘Learn to Skate,’ so we did that for a year. The next year, the rink changed the times of their programs, so the only other option was to do ‘Learn to Play Hockey,’ which my parents thought would be similar. My brother and I learned to love the game through this first exposure, and it became a passion for both of us. My dad even started to put up a backyard rink every winter, which definitely helped to develop my skills during the season.”
Loeffler began to play hockey competitively in sixth grade when she joined her first club team, the Natick Comets. She did not always play on a men’s team though. “This has actually been my first experience playing with all guys,” Loeffler said. “I grew up playing on various women’s club teams in my home town and in neighboring towns, and we were always in all-girl leagues. My high school got a girls’ hockey team my freshman year, and I was captain my senior year.”
When asked how she feels about being the only woman on the Carnegie Mellon team, Loeffler said, “I absolutely love it. I get all of these wonderful guys to myself! It also gives me an interesting perspective when I see how other teams react to me. My team is obviously used to me being there, but other teams will either not touch me or hit me as hard as they can just because I’m a girl. It’s always an adventure.”
Loeffler loves being on the hockey team. “My teammates are amazing,” she said. “They are the funniest, most talented and supportive guys and I couldn’t ask for a better team. At first I was so intimidated joining the team, but they have made me feel like an integral part for the small role I play, and I really appreciate that. There’s never a dull moment, and I know they always have my back. If I had not joined the hockey team, I never would have met any of them, so I most appreciate the fantastic people I’ve met through hockey.”
Loeffler has had many proud moments on the ice. “I’ve had a few good plays on the ice, but I’d say my proudest moment was earlier this year when we played California University of Pennsylvania,” Loeffler said. “We had so many injuries during the game [and] practically no defensemen, but we were still able to come back and force the game to overtime and then a shootout. Even though we lost in the shootout, I was so impressed by how my teammates stepped up and got the job done. Cal is such a big team, and they have the resources to pay for more ice time and practices, so it was great to just show them we could still give them a run for their money. My team never ceases to amaze me, and it’s games like this one that remind me just talented they are and how lucky I am to be a part of this team.”
Tartans hockey is 6–0–2 this season, making a strong push for a second consecutive playoff appearnace and subsequently a championship, and Loeffler’s contributions have been more than crucial to the team’s successes.

At many Tartan varsity sports events, your Tartan pride will be led by the Carnegie Mellon cheer squad. The cheer team currently consists of four members: senior Alexandra Riedl, senior Briana Cook, fourth year architecture major Sydney Zalewski, and sophomore Connie Chan.
The cheer team is looking for more members, both women and men, in hopes of increasing the size of the squad and the spirit of the fans at games. “Cheerleading is a great way to represent Carnegie Mellon and get the crowd involved,” said Zalewski.
The Tartan met with the cheer team as they prepare to host an information meeting to increase the size of the squad. Cook has been cheerleading since she was ten years old and throughout her time at Carnegie Mellon. Fellow senior Riedl started cheerleading in college; having had previous dance experience, she wanted to find a new way to explore her talents. The cheer squad was something she always wanted to try, so she looked up tryouts and went. Zalewski began cheering in the eighth grade, but it was only last year that she started cheerleading in college. Chan began cheering in high school and came to college looking to continue pursuing her passion.
All four members are dedicated to the cheer team and have found their experiences on the team very rewarding. “I couldn’t imagine my life without cheerleading,” said Chan. “The most rewarding part of being on the team is practicing a lot and landing the stunts that we have been working on for a long time,” Chan continued. Cook had a similar reaction to the cheer team. “For me, it is all about the hard work, progress and mastering new skills that I haven’t learned before,” said Cook. “I didn’t do stunts or tumble in high school, but now I do so there is always more to learn.”
“Cheerleading is a lot more than what is on the surface, so many things translate back to cheerleading,” said Cook.
The cheer team practices on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. and they cheer at home football and basketball games.
The cheer team is hosting an information session on Monday Nov. 14 at 6:30 p.m. in the Danforth lounge. The members of the team and the cheer team’s new head coach Emerald Huggins will be present to answer questions.  “Our coach believes in us a lot and pushes us to be the best that we can be,” said Zalewski.  
No cheerleading experience is needed to join.  The team is very welcoming to new men and women who are interested in learning more about cheerleading.
Connie Chan is a member of The Tartan’s copy staff.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team began its home season with a meet against Division II Clarion University on Saturday. The men won the meet 167–133 while the women fell to the Golden Eagles 116–182.
Opening up the meet for the men, first-year Andrew Yee won the 1,000-yard freestyle race in 9:55.58, with first-year David Campbell placing second in 10:05.01. With nearly half the men’s team consisting of first-years, the new talent helped the team start fresh this season.
Grabbing crucial placing points, sophomores Austin Bohn and Eddie Sears came in second in the 100-yard breaststroke and 100-yard freestyle races, respectively. Being the first home meet of the season, the men had a slightly different mentality. “Last week at Rochester we got a little ahead of ourselves and weren’t mentally comfortable swimming fast. This week we were,” said Bohn.
Near the end of men’s meet, first-year Cole Um won the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:12.64, and Yee picked up his second victory of the day in the 500-yard freestyle.
The women had numerous second place finishes Saturday, fighting hard against the Golden Eagles. Junior Breanna Stillo placed second in both the 100-yard breaststroke and the 50-yard freestyle, with times of 1:08.47 and 25.31, respectively.
In diving, senior Olivia DeFazio came in second in the three-meter board and third on the one-meter board. Following soon after the first diving break, sophomore Soleil Phan finished the 100-yard freestyle second with a time of 54.92, before first-year Kelley Sheehan came in second in the 200-yard backstroke. Shortly after, Sheehan also came in second with a time of 2:14.65 in the 200-yard individual medley.
Commenting on the new practicing techniques she was exposed to this year, Sheehan said, “We are getting as much training in as possible, which means not resting for meets. It is really important for us to learn how to swim when we are tired at this time of the year.”
With hopes of getting relay teams to nationals this year and winning UAAs, the Tartans continue to train hard this season. Every meet is crucial from here on out.
Their next meet will be at home against Grove City College next Saturday, Nov. 12 at 1 p.m. Last season, the women’s team beat Grove City, 217–160, and the men’s team won 214–158. The Tartans will look to continue their dominance over the Wolverines.

On Saturday, Nov. 5, the Tartans traveled to Chicago to play the University of Chicago Maroons. In this UAA Conference battle, the Tartans prevailed 28–13, moving the Tartans to .500 in conference play (1–1), and 5–4 overall. This victory was the 500th in Carnegie Mellon franchise history.
A five-play drive to open the game led to a 7–0 Tartan lead. On a halfback draw, junior running back Patrick Blanks found a hole up the middle, then bounced to the outside for a 27-yard run for the touchdown. 
The ensuing drive by the Maroons ended with a field goal by kicker Joe Saurer. The drive lasted eight plays before the 29-yard field goal.
With the score now 7–3, the game would see turnovers on consecutive drives, with each team fumbling the ball. But the Tartans recovered to score on an 11-yard run by Blanks, yet again, to make the score 14–3.
The Tartans’ defense dropped off at the end of the first half, allowing the Maroons to cut the lead to one. After a seven-play, 94-yard drive, quarterback Kevin Shelton scored on a one-yard run. Then, as the clock ticked to end the first half, Saurer kicked his second field goal, this one a 39-yarder. At halftime, the score was 14–13.
To start the second half, the Tartans marched 77 yards down the field, featuring a 45-yard pass from sophomore quarterback Rob Kalkstein to sophomore wide receiver Tim Kikta. Two run plays by senior running back Chris Garcia were all it took for the Tartans to find the end zone. The score was now 21–13.
Blanks scored his third touchdown of the game on a seven-yard run early in the fourth quarter. That ended an 11-play, 93-yard drive, and giving the Tartans the 28–13 lead, good enough for the win.
Blanks ended with a career high 171 rushing yards, 16 carries, and three touchdowns to lead the Tartans. His 171 rushing yards were 40 percent of the Tartans’ total offense (428 yards). 
Junior linebacker Nick Karabin led the Tartans’ defense with nine tackles, and sophomore linebacker Eric Rolfes added eight. Junior cornerback Sam Thompson tied the school record for most interceptions in a season with his two interceptions in this game, for a total of seven on the year. 
The Tartans’ regular season ends Saturday, when they face the Case Western Reserve University Spartans at Gesling Stadium. Kickoff is at noon.

With increased demand for energy as the world population climbs over the 7 billion mark, many experts are stressing more than ever the importance of alternative and renewable energy sources. Two Carnegie Mellon researchers have honed their skills in conceptualizing an efficient system that converts switchgrass, a versatile grass that grows easily in much of the U.S., into an energy-rich biofuel.
In the past, producing fuels from other types of biomass, such as corn, has proved successful, but the process comes with unwanted impacts on prices in the food market. For example, if only a fraction of corn grown on a plot of land is being used for food while the rest is being used for biofuels, the corn for food would then be more scarce, which would increase the price of corn in the food market. Switchgrass, however, has no such impact.
“Switchgrass grows everywhere in the U.S. The yield from the ground to the biofuel is quite large without competing with the production of food, and it almost grows wild,” explained post-doctoral researcher Mariano Martin, who was the head author on the study.
In the study, which was recently accepted to the journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, Martin looked for the optimal set of processes and conditions needed to convert switchgrass into diesel fuel.
Why diesel? Martin explained: “In the U.S., diesel is not used commonly for cars, but for trucks. For example, the Carnegie Mellon shuttle runs on biodiesel. So we need a certain supply for a diesel substitute.”
The process of converting material such as switchgrass into fuel involves a few steps. First, the material goes through a process known as gasification, which involves the reaction of the material at temperatures up to 900˚C without actually burning the material. This produces a gas, known as “syngas” (short for synthetic gas), which then goes through a reforming and cleaning process that removes unwanted chemicals. Lastly, a series of chemical reactions, known as the Fischer-Tropsch process, converts the gas into liquid fuel. In the case of this particular study, the target liquid fuel is diesel.
Martin and his colleague, professor Ignacio E. Grossmann of the chemical engineering department, ran a model that evaluated a collection of alternative methods and conditions in which the conversion process should occur to optimize efficiency. The team found that indirect gasification, which involves two separated chambers, one for heating and one for producing the heat, was the best and most energy-efficient way of conducting this process. The process would also need to use steam for the reforming step.
Besides minimizing energy consumption, Martin and Grossman’s process of converting switchgrass to diesel fuel also reduced the amount of water used. “In order to be sustainable, we not only have to take care of raw material or energy consumption,” Martin explained, “but also water, because even though there has been a lot of water for some time, it is now becoming scarce and becoming another concern at the same level as energy consumption.” 
Typically, Martin said, conventional crude oil-based fuel companies use between 1.5 and 2.5 gallons of water per gallon of fuel produced. The process found in this study uses well below one gallon.
Since the improved process is currently only conceptual, Martin said that more detailed design work would need to follow this study before a plant could be built to utilize this technology. He hopes that this kind of work will allow people who wish to invest in these technologies to make the best decision on which fuel-deriving processes to utilize. “So, of course, to those who are going to invest, they should check this option first,” he said.
Martin urges this type of work for the benefit of humanity into the future: “I think we have to look for more alternative sources of energy in the near future because it’s the only we can maintain our way of living.”

Since the onset of Marcellus Shale drilling several years ago, much of Pennsylvania has been environmentally or economically affected. The sedimentary rock formation found thousands of feet under the Earth’s surface is one of the largest shale resources in the country. In accordance with the drilling, two Carnegie Mellon researchers presented a policy analysis discussing the dangers of abandoned gas wells, which can have negative impacts on economic, environmental, and human health concerns. Their research presents feasible economic incentives to solve this state-wide problem.
Austin Mitchell, a Ph.D. student, and Elizabeth Casman, a professor, are both in the department of engineering and public policy in CIT. The two presented their findings in a recent issue of Environmental Science & Technology.
They published their research at a time when Marcellus well drilling is in full swing. Since drilling of Marcellus Shale began in 2007, 2,974 wells have been implemented and 7,388 well permits have been issued in Pennsylvania, according the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Casman and Mitchell’s paper delves into the current environmental, economic, and human health risks associated with deserted gas wells. These wells usually become abandoned when the gas reserves below the well are depleted. The paper specifically mentions that well construction is expected to disturb up to 310,000 acres of Pennsylvanian forest, and that vacant gas wells may also cause permanent changes to their natural location, killing nutrient-rich topsoil and increasing the amount of sediment in fresh water. When a gas well isn’t plugged correctly, the ground water around it can become contaminated, leading to unsafe conditions for residents near it.
Abandoned gas wells are particularly harmful because the risk of groundwater contamination increases over time as the well structures deteriorate. The paper adds that wells can hurt one’s property value and release methane into the atmosphere.
Mitchell and Casman proposed three different financial incentives to help make sure that the state of Pennsylvania has sufficient reclamation funds that would pay for the reclaiming of the deserted wells. The first proposal, an up-front “no-risk” bond, would have the gas drillers pay a fee that would cover the full cost of reclamation before they even break ground. Although this option would protect the state regardless of the well’s prosperity, it would prove the most expensive for gas companies.
The other two options the authors discuss are adding a severance tax on gas production and offering a reduced pre-drilling fee. The severance tax would gradually collect and reinvest monies to total the value of the reclamation. The reduced pre-drilling fee would require an up-front fee like the no risk bond, but would not charge the full cost of reclamation.
These solutions are meant as possible options for the state government. “The main point of this paper was to put the options out there and make the legislators do their due diligence,” Mitchell notes.
In terms of covering reclamation costs, all three of the researchers’ options put greater responsibility on the gas companies than the current Pennsylvania law — the Oil and Gas Act of 1984 — that requires a $2,500 reclamation fee for one well, or a $25,000 “blanket fee” for any wells a company wishes to drill in the state. Estimating that reclamation costs total around $100,000 per well, Mitchell and Casman illustrate that these current fees are not enough to properly cover the costs.
In response to the increased gas drilling, both the Pennsylvania Senate and House of Representatives have put forth new bills that modify the current Oil and Gas Act. Mitchell, however, believes that “both proposals are still very far from where they need to be, and they don’t answer the question of how much [well reclamation is] going to cost.” He plans to travel to Harrisburg next week to meet with legislative aides regarding the published research.
Mitchell, who began his research in February, hopes to make some important changes in Harrisburg. “I am optimistic. I wouldn’t do my work if I didn’t think I could make the world a better place, or inform the debate going on,” he said.

Jimmy Zhu, an electrical and computer engineering professor, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) distinguished lecturer, and the holder of 12 U.S. patents, is currently the director of the Data Storage Systems Center (DSSC) here at Carnegie Mellon. Despite many contributions to his field of research, many CIT first-years know Zhu simply as an Introduction to Electrical Engineering recitation instructor. In an interview with The Tartan this past week, he shared details of his groundbreaking research, his current work, and some humorous anecdotes about grad school.
Zhu considers his work in the field of magnetic data storage — namely in hard disk drives (HDDs) — as his greatest research accomplishment. “When I was a graduate student in the mid-’80s,” he said, “the HDD could store only 10 megabytes, and people thought ... that was it!” To increase drives’ capacity, Zhu began work on the nanometer-scale microstructure of the metallic coating of the drive. This 10-nanometer-thick metal is filled with polar particles. When the transducer, which floats very slightly above the disk, applies a magnetic field, the particles line up in a certain way, some producing magnetic flux, others not. These physical states are analogous to ones and zeros, allowing data to be stored.
The process of keeping the transducer floating precisely over the disk, polarizing only the right particles, is immensely difficult, Zhu said. “In terms of scale,” he said, “it’s like keeping the Sears Tower hovering sideways a millimeter off the ground ... without consuming much power.” Ultimately, he developed this technology and revolutionized the field; in fact, Zhu’s method of magnetic data storage is still in use in the hard disk today, allowing drives to store terabytes of information.
Zhu is currently working with magnetoresisitive random access memory (MRAM). As the name suggests, this technology stores memory in magnetic states, which gives it three advantages over conventional static RAM and dynamic RAM. First, MRAM requires 10 times less power. Second, since it retains information even when the computer is powered off, booting up with MRAM is instantaneous. Last, it is far more secure than conventional RAM in outer space, where cosmic rays can disrupt data.
While he is heavily involved with research, Zhu shared some of his more light-hearted pursuits as well. He reminisced about his time at the University of California, San Diego, and how he often gathered his fellow researchers for a game of basketball to escape the monotony of the lab. He also enjoys traveling, both for work and to meet up with acquaintances around the world. “I’ve graduated 35 Ph.D. students, and I’m often invited to dinner with them when I visit the area,” he said.
When asked about his long list of achievements, Zhu said that he owes a lot to his physics and engineering backgrounds: “From my graduate school days, I’ve had the mind of an experimentalist. As an engineer, I can apply the results of these experiments to the real world.” 
Over time, he said, he has developed his own personal philosophy, one that can apply to researchers in all disciplines. “When it comes down to research, I know I’ve got to make a measurable impact.... That’s my criterion for success.”

How can one transform the mundane, impersonal task of glancing at a thermostat into a fun and engaging experience? Ray Yun, a Ph.D student who works in the department of architecture’s Computational Design Lab, just might have a solution with his RayMatic device.
The RayMatic, named after its creator, utilizes what Yun refers to as an “anthropomorphic interface.”
“It uses human facial expressions to represent messages or data,” Yun explained. “It’s human-friendly and engaging as well.... Employing a face to represent an agent has been shown to increase engagement and motivation and makes a user pay more attention.”
The RayMatic is composed of a touch screen and an Arduino microcontroller (with temperature sensors attached), all housed within a picture frame. The device communicates ambient temperature information to a user by displaying video of Yun’s upper body on the screen. A person observing the RayMatic frame in a room with normal temperatures would see Yun smiling on the display. If it were to get too hot, the video would change into one where a frowning Yun is fanning himself with his hand. Should the temperature get too cold, a shivering Yun puts on a scarf instead. All of these transitions are made seamless by Adobe Flash actionscript, the programming language Yun used to program the device’s logic. TinkerProxy, an open source project, was utilized to allow actionscript to communicate directly with the micro controller.
Aside from the touchscreen, Yun said that “it’s cheap and it’s easy to make. But the touch screen costs a bit ... like $400.”
However, employing a touch screen interface grants the RayMatic a level of user-friendliness unachievable by typical data communicators. At any point in time, the user can “poke” Yun and watch him flounce back in pain. Changing the thresholds for what the RayMatic considers to be too hot or too cold is made simple by adjusting notches on a sign Yun holds up on the display.
So what exactly inspired Yun to create such a device? Readers familiar with the popular Harry Potter films might have already guessed.
“There are a lot of great things in the Harry Potter movies,” Yun said. “But one of the things is a picture frame. There’s a person in the picture frame that actually has an emotion and expresses that emotion. I thought it was really interesting, and [I realized that] we have sensor technology so that we make a smart picture frame. That was the first start for me.”
Though Yun brought this concept to life with the RayMatic for a fall 2009 class project, the device has since been attracting the attention of observers from all over the world. Recently, he was given the opportunity to show off his invention at the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction Conference held earlier this year in Portugal, as well as the 2011 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Computer-Human Interaction Conference in Vancouver. Both of these conferences are well regarded for their exhibitions of advancing trends in the field of human-computer interaction. At both events, Yun stated that he received positive feedback for the device.
The RayMatic has also landed Yun a featured article in the ACM Interactions magazine, a pending patent, and a commission from at least one company to build them a RayMatic device.
In spite of its apparent success as an interactivity device, Yun mentioned that the RayMatic still isn’t where he wants it to be. Unfortunately, in its current state, both the touch screen and Arduino microcontroller have to be plugged into a computer to function, adding cost and space issues that block the way to an easily marketable product.
“The cost can be made cheap if it could run on the iPad and iPhone,” Yun said, noting that such a move would eliminate the additional costs of a computer, as well as a touch screen. “The Arduino and other stuff costs less than $50.”
Other possible future plans Yun suggested included extending the RayMatic to incorporate a noise meter (where Yun covers his ears on the display), an air pollution meter (where Yun coughs on the display if the ambient air quality is below a certain threshold), and/or adding voice functionality to the device so that it “talks” to whoever’s using it.
But even in its current state, Yun did not underplay the significance of his invention. “The RayMatic points to a style of interaction with household appliances and devices that is simple, fun, and friendly.”

Birds find a friend in LEED
Some emerging building technologies are being called “bird-friendly” by the American Bird Conservancy. The group has worked with the U.S. Green Building Council to incorporate such measures into the Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) green building rating system. These largely consist of increasing the “visual noise” of reflective glass that birds often crash into. One example is to colorize windows with ultraviolet markings, which are perceptible in a bird’s vision but not in a human’s. In the U.S. alone, up to one billion birds die from colliding with buildings annually.

How to avoid stress: Ride a bus
Swedish researchers recently published findings on how the duration and mode of a daily commute are correlated with negative health outcomes. According to the study, long commutes are generally tied to heightened levels of stress, poor sleep quality, and degraded general health. The overall trend, both for drivers and transit riders, was that the longer one’s commute, the worse the effects are on one’s health. Interestingly, transit riders with commuting times less than a half hour experienced less stress compared to the the control group (“active” commuters who biked or walked to work in under thirty minutes).

Looking for aliens in the dark
Astronomers engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence scan radio frequencies hoping to find anomalous signals that might indicate life elsewhere in the universe. In a recent paper, astronomers from Harvard and Princeton argue for another approach: look for aliens when it is dark outside. The researchers figure that extraterrestrial civilizations would illuminate their planets during the dark diurnal cycle as we do, and they have developed a technique that can look for this type of light.

Cheer up, you might live longer
Eleven thousand people over the age of 50 were recently studied in an effort to correlate happiness with lifespans. The study found that subjects with more positive moods were less likely to die in the five years that the study lasted. Four times a day, researchers asked subjects to rate their mood (e.g. how happy, worried, or anxious they felt). Similar previous studies are flawed, according to lead researcher Andrew Steptoe of University College London, in that they use an unreliable metric to assess happiness. The problem is getting subjects to “assess how they are actually feeling [versus] how they remember feeling.” By asking about mood at regular and frequent intervals, researchers were able to pinpoint the effect of day-to-day happiness on the lifespan in old age.

Giant amoebas found in deep sea
Using cameras sealed in high-pressure resistant glass bubbles, scientists from the Scripps Institute for Oceanography have found gigantic amoebas living deep within the Mariana Trench of the Pacific Ocean. These single-celled organisms, named xenophyophores, often grow longer than four inches and were found at a depth of 6.6 miles, two miles deeper than in any other previous study. According to Doug Bartlett, the lead scientist of the expedition, “the identification of these gigantic cells in one of the deepest marine environments on the planet opens up a whole new habitat for further study of biodiversity, biotechnological potential, and extreme environment adaptation.”

This is your brain on dreams
In a recently published experiment, self-proclaimed “lucid dreamers” — people who are aware that they are dreaming and can control their actions within the dreams — were put into a brain scanner by German psychiatrist Martin Dresler. The subjects were instructed to perform a simple task while dreaming: alternately clench and unclench their hands into a fist. The brain scans of the dreams almost identically resembled brain scans of people actually performing the task while awake, as well as imagining performing the task. Although a simple example, this is the first evidence scientists have that the dreaming brain behaves like the awake brain.

What would a robot burlesque be like? How do I cast magic spells? What kind of alien would I be in an alien vaudeville act? 
These atypical questions are the ones that students in Pop Cabaret: Performance Art at the Andy Warhol Museum, a Carnegie Mellon course in performance art, seek to answer. Through the bizarre and the eccentric, this class of 12 diverse students create short solo and group performances that draw from an assortment of cultural issues. The class consists of two major performances: The first — a free Halloween variety show — was presented this past October and was entitled “I Put a Spell on You.” The final winter performance will be held on Dec. 16.
Associate professor of art Suzie Silver teaches the course and encourages her students to find inspiration in club- and cabaret-style performance. “There are multiple reasons why we are focusing on club and cabaret-type performances,” Silver said. “The pop art focus of the Warhol and the wonderful, permissive vibe that exists there reinforces that these are performances that can be done almost anywhere.” Pop Cabaret is a first-time college course collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and the Warhol Museum and was spearheaded by Ben Harrison, the Warhol’s curator of performing arts.
As a museum that is continually redefining itself in relationship to contemporary life, the Warhol is the perfect place to host a performance art class. “The idea of it being a pop cabaret class is really cohesive with what the Warhol represents,” senior Julia Cahill said. “You know, it’s a pop art museum and a lot of the art deals with contemporary issues. For the pop cabaret class, we’re all dealing with issues that are contemporary as well.” Cahill, who is on track to get her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a concentration in sculpture installation and sightwork, joined the class because of her love for performance and the Warhol Museum.
“There’s only 12 [students] in the class so we’ve really bonded,” Cahill said. Although the class is small, the diversity within the group is stunning: Cahill, Ann Stone, Mitsuko Verdery, Chelsea Lupkin, Adelaide Agyemang, Ippei Mori, and Stephanie Ross are in the College of Fine Arts; Harrison Apple, Julie Mallis, Kinji Cheri Ho, and Murphi Cook are in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences; and Tim Sherman is obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in computer science and the arts. “We have a really diverse class that no matter who you’re put with you’re going to have a really interesting idea,” Cahill said.
The first show the class put on lived up to the standard of “diverse” in every sense of the word. Pop Cabaret’s Halloween show featured short solo and group scenes ranging from three to five minutes each. The performance followed the format of a variety show, with random sketches loosely tied together by a spooky Halloween theme. For his part, senior Tim Sherman told a scary story by flashlight. “I was in another piece about everyone having bizarre alien genitals,” Sherman said. “And I also did a lip sync to this song called ‘Big Fat Fuck’ where I was eating cheeseburgers and stuff. We’ve definitely had a decent spread of content and style.”
Another sketch featured Cahill in a robot burlesque. She developed the idea over the summer after searching for a way to incorporate the unexpected in her art: “I was like, ‘What can I do with burlesque that isn’t the typical female showing her body, but still make it something interesting?’ And then I was like, ‘Yeah, robot burlesque!’” Cahill collaborated with her group to create a scene with two female burlesque robots and one over-excited HAL 9000, played by Mori. “So for that performance these two robots are trying to make the HAL 9000 happy and he gets too excited and overdoes it.... We called it gear-gasming.”
“In another skit, Ann [Stone] and I did a twisted sister thing where we sing this kid song that goes like ‘nobody likes me, everybody hates me, so I guess I’ll go eat worms,’” Cahill said. “So we did a play on it where we’re sisters singing it, and then we started choking each other with worms. It was a strange, weird, kind of sexy, two-sisters-having-a-pillow-fight thing — but taken to a really grotesque place. Some of it is bizarre and goofy, but I think a lot of it draws from things we experience on a day-to-day basis, which is what makes it a pop cabaret class.”
Just as the title hints, Pop Cabaret is a strange and bizarre amalgamation of political issues and avant-garde performances; it’s a fun way to explore issues. The students’ pieces range from the ridiculous to the serious. Although many sketches are strange ideas that the students have fleshed out just for fun, others have a more somber tone. Apple, a junior humanities and arts major, performed a dance piece using his own hair and a song that describes a man taking boys and burying them. It was described as “a dark piece” by Apple’s classmates.
However, this variety of scene is what makes Pop Cabaret such an unusual class. The class is categorized as time-based, as all performance art is, and allows its students to create temporary, wide-ranging scenes that are unique and new. The focus on cabaret and contemporary culture lets the students explore their own interests: If someone wants to lip sync, create a monologue, choreograph a dance, or sing, they have the freedom to do so.
In many ways, Pop Cabaret is finding its own place in the Carnegie Mellon community, and the Pittsburgh community at large. “I hadn’t done performance in a while — in a couple of years actually,” Sherman said. “So when it was offered it sounded like something really unique and different. There really haven’t been live performance art classes.”
Cahill also commented on the lack of performance art. “In the four years I’ve been here, there hasn’t really been a rise of performance art in the art department — or any department, for that matter,” Cahill said. “I mean, you have the drama school, but that’s more aimed towards theater, and performance art is more of a combination of non-traditional theater and art.” 
Because the class is an all day event (every Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.) and is removed from campus, students feel less like students and more like a legitimate acting company. Dedicated to the show, students took time to gather outside of class to practice and hone their sketches. “We’re becoming a performance troupe in a way because it’s not like a class,” Cahill said. “We’re practicing on our own time and everyone is dedicated — no one feels forced. They’re in the class because they want to be.”
Both Cahill and Sherman noted that the cultivation of a community of peers has helped them gain confidence both on and offstage. “I’m not afraid to go onstage and try something,” Sherman said. “It’s in a separate space and I can be wholly in that moment in that class working and watching, and that’s really, really nice.”
It’s unclear whether Pop Cabaret will become a regular class, but the students have high hopes that the trial run they participated in will turn into something more permanent. “Having this group of people get away from campus and get into the Pittsburgh art community is probably the most successful progression of this class,” Cahill said. “Not just for the art department but for Carnegie Mellon to show that we’re actively getting into the community.”

“Sick moves. Great beats. Fly costs. Hot people. For a great cause.” These were five reasons to attend Bhangra in the Burgh, according to the promotional posters floating around campus the past few weeks. On Saturday, 2,500 people filled up the auditorium in Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall to watch the fifth annual bhangra dance competition. The event did not disappoint, as the audience got exactly what was promised in the flyers.
Eight competing teams from around the country came to show off their dance skills in the high-energy competition. Bhangra is a dance style originating from Punjab, which uses traditional, beat-heavy folk music, but modern versions often combine this with popular hip-hop or club music. All the teams — D.C. Bhangra Crew, Anakh-E-Gabroo, Cornell, First Class Bhangra, D.C. Metro Punjabi Arts Academy, Virginia di Shaan, Drexel, and UNC Bhangra Elite — had extremely high levels of skill and technique. Dressed in brightly colored clothes, the performers seemed to glide across the stage from one formation to the next.
Given the high caliber of each performance, it was inevitably an intense competition. However, “a good show is a competitive but friendly show,” said administrative chair Sonum Garg, a sophomore mechanical engineering major. This was evidenced by the teams cheering for one another during each dance. The sportsmanship demonstrated by the teams was probably facilitated by the fact that the Bhangra in the Burgh committee organized a mixer the night before, so that the teams could get better acquainted.
The night was full of laughter, thanks to charismatic Master of Ceremonies Suraj Baxi, a senior social and decision sciences major. He and co-host Stefan Dezil, a senior drama student, created smooth segues between the acts with their wit and charm. The insertion of non-competitive exhibition acts also helped with the flow of the show.
The exhibition acts included non-dance groups such as Carnegie Mellon’s all-male South Asian a cappella group Deewane, as well as dance groups of other styles, like Tanah and SoulStylz. Additionally, the audience saw some fresh faces when groups from outside Carnegie Mellon performed. Boston University’s dance group Jalwa was a crowd favorite with its fast-paced and high-energy performance, and Northwestern’s Brown Sugar a cappella group serenaded the audience with beautiful harmonies.
Among all the excitement of the dance, it was easy to forget that the event was a charity fundraiser. Of the proceeds, 75 percent went to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The remaining 25 percent went to the Bhangra in the Burgh grant, which “is committed to facilitating the service-based endeavors of the students of Carnegie Mellon University,” according to the show program. In order to remind people of the philanthropic efforts of the event, a representative from St. Jude’s presented a short and touching video at the end of the competition on the type of patients that the proceeds support.
The subdued mood in the room was short-lived, however. As Carnegie Mellon’s own Bhangra team took to the stage, the crowd cheered with excitement. The Bhangra in the Burgh staff members swarmed into the aisles of the auditorium to get a better view of their home team, who performed energetically and passionately on stage. It was hard not to join them.
The show as a whole ran smoothly, with only a few minor technical issues such as missed or botched music and lighting cues. Although performers may have been irked at such mishaps, the audience seemed not to take much notice, as they were too caught up in the excitement of the night. Even the intermission was made enjoyable, with inexpensive and tasty samosas for sale as audience members chatted excitedly about their favorite teams.
Unfortunately, the results weren’t announced until later in the evening, and many audience members had already left before the winner, UNC Bhangra Elite, could be announced. This may be a testament, however, to the way that the show focused not on competition but rather on spreading awareness of Indian culture and bhangra in general. As Liaison Chair Reema Thawrani, a junior business major, said, “It’s a great cultural experience.”

Brahms, Mozart, and Beethoven — these are the names we typically assign to classical music. But at Carnegie Mellon Night with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) at Heinz Hall last Friday, there were none of the compositions of those long-dead European men. In fact, the pieces on the program were exclusively 20th- and 21st-century works. Carnegie Mellon Night at the PSO offered a vibrant and contemporary program to Carnegie Mellon students in the audience and showcased the talent of PSO members.
Despite the concert’s advertisement as Carnegie Mellon Night, young people were a minority in the audience and many of the seats were empty. Though a fair number of students came out for the discounted prices and special student reception after the performance, many missed the opportunity and the concert hall was mostly populated by older patrons.
The program began with a very new composition, both in years and style. Cindy McIntee’s Double Play, written in 2010, featured clashing elements, such as frantic strings and unusual percussion, that put listeners out of their musical comfort zones and forced them to appreciate a more innovative interpretation. By contrast, Ralph Vaughan Williams’ Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus, though also a contemporary piece, was a warm, rich, and passionate complement to McIntee’s jarring piece, with swelling dynamics and lyrical violin and cello solos.
In addition to showcasing the skill of the full ensemble, the orchestra also brought two of its members to the forefront. Principal PSO violist Randolph Kelly performed the solo in Walter Piston’s Concerto for Viola and Orchestra with extraordinary richness. On top of Kelly’s obvious skill, it was refreshing to have a viola brought to the limelight — an instrument that is often neglected between the show-stealing violin and the deep, lush cello. On oboe, Carnegie Mellon faculty member Cynthia Koledo DeAlmeida played with poise and grace. As another instrument that is not frequently featured, the oboe hovered cleanly over the orchestra’s accompaniment.
The program’s conclusion — and a favorite among audience members — was the orchestra’s interpretation of Benjamin Britten’s The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra. Britten’s piece guides new classical music listeners through the ensemble, first introducing a majestic variation of a theme by Purcell with the full orchestra and then featuring each instrumental section in turn. The PSO, however, decided to literally have young people guide the audience through the orchestra: 10- to 12-year-olds with microphones seated on stage introduced each section of the orchestra with a short description of each instrument. This take on the piece was an endearing choice on the part of the PSO and was well received by the audience.
After the concert, Carnegie Mellon students were invited to a special reception with desserts and a few words from orchestra members, including faculty member DeAlmeida. The small event gave students the chance to mingle after the concert and was a nice gesture on the part of the PSO.
As guest conductor Leonard Slatkin said on Friday night, “Tonight is show-off night” for the PSO. Carnegie Mellon Night certainly demonstrated the prowess of the PSO and the particular talents of some of its individual members. In selecting a program of exclusively contemporary music, the PSO made a daring but rewarding choice: rather than lulling its audience with the familiar comforts of favorite classical artists, the orchestra decided to test its listeners’ palates and expose them to less traditional forms.

“ ‘Jane Austen meets Raging Bull ’ or ‘Regency Rocky.’ ” This is how Kelleigh Greenberg describes her screenplay, titled Blood Bound, a script that won her a spot as a finalist for the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting.
Greenberg, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1995 with a degree in directing, was one of 10 screenwriters chosen out of a record 6,730 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a finalist for the fellowship this year. Every year, the Academy awards up to five Nicholl Fellowships of $30,000 to screenwriters for unproduced scripts.
“It’s really the closest one can come to winning an Oscar with an unproduced script,” Greenberg said.
Set during the Regency era in Britain, Blood Bound is a mentor and mentee story of an African-American slave-turned-fighter who must confront his past when he agrees to train a fighter with a similar background. “His sense of self develops as he’s remembering bits of who he once was and reevaluating these new values that he’s taken on,” Greenberg said. “If you took the tradition of the classic sports film and smashed it together with a period drama or social comedy of manners, [_Blood Bound_ is] what you’d get.”
Period pieces have fascinated Greenberg since she was a child, when she would watch classic films on loop and read historical fiction novels. “I just was born in the wrong era, and my way of going in search of where I should have been is to just lose myself in history books and historical fiction and classic literature,” she said. “It’s been my intended career path and mission statement to make the past relevant, whether it’s an adaptation of a Tolstoy novel or Chekhov play or whatever it is, to find what is relevant and contemporary feeling in those works.”
Greenberg has modeled her career after English theater directors who later went on to direct films. Describing her decision to study directing at Carnegie Mellon, Greenberg said, “There I was, an 18-year-old girl from Texas, and I thought, ‘How do I be more like my heroes, who are middle-aged English men who have come from a theatrical background?’”
Since graduating, she has been applying her knowledge of cinematic tradition to write screenplays and explore the human condition through period films. According to Greenberg, “I like to look back and see where we’ve come from and see that, really, the human condition doesn’t change. And perhaps if we look to these historical and fictional characters in the past, we can learn a lot about who we are.”
Greenberg currently lives and works in Los Angeles and has spent the last week with members of the Academy and fellow writers. “It’s been a bit of an idealistic week, but it’s great. You need that out here, when so often it’s not about that,” Greenberg said. “Even if the work is great, it’s usually about what is commercial or what can sell, and this was just pure idealism. It was a table full of emerging writers, who had worked very, very hard to be at this point, and Academy members, who have made some of the greatest films of all time, really just discussing the importance of cinematic art. None of the things that naturally get in the way of that in the business end of it came into play, and it was extraordinary. It really reminded us why we all do this.”

Nic Snyder, the founder of 1,2,3, described the band's single "Work" as being about a "working class ethic."
Pittsburgh may be its hometown, but the band 1,2,3 has already been making itself heard far beyond the boundaries of western Pennsylvania. Nylon magazine listed the group as a “band crush” in April 2011. The Guardian first started raving about the band mere months after it began posting music in 2010. The band has toured across the nation, yet singer and guitarist Nic Snyder has not abandoned his Pittsburgh roots: “I’ve been here my whole life and I’m proud of it,” he said in a phone interview.
1,2,3, which is opening for Tokyo Police Club in Rangos Ballroom on Nov. 12, was formed by Snyder and percussionist Josh Sickels. The two have been “friends ever since we were in junior high,” Snyder said. The duo has been playing together for about 10 years — “we needed a drummer for our band and he didn’t drum at that point, but he said he did, and we’ve kind of been playing together ever since,” Synder recalled.
They were originally both in the band The Takeover UK, which formed in 2004, but the group broke up after several years. “We had every music industry nightmare horror story happen to us that you can imagine, and it got to be too much for us after a while,” Snyder said. Despite his frustration, Snyder did not stop writing music. “I had a stockpile of songs that were in a fairly different direction — and it wasn’t like I tried to write in a different direction,” Snyder said. “My tastes had just changed.”
While The Takeover UK’s sound was squarely in the pop-rock genre, 1,2,3 is far less peppy, with sounds reminiscent of everything from ‘70s rock to electronic to “Appalachian fiddle music.” Snyder cited modern R&B, The Beatles, and Bob Dylan among some of his influences.
Pittsburgh has also been a major influence: “I’ve seen this sort of stuff everyday — the old factories — and whether you go in [meaning] for it to influence you or it just happens subconsciously, it does in one way or another,” he said.
Pittsburgh’s influence is most evident in the single “Work.” Snyder explained, “My boss at the time was trying to convince me to write some sort of working man’s song, and I told him that I didn’t really think that I would be able to do that — but I would keep it in the back of my mind. I had the music for ‘Work’ but I had no melody... it just came out that I felt like having it be about some sort of working class ethic.” The music video for “Work” makes explicit ties to the working class ethic, with gorgeous shots of Pittsburgh’s bridges and industrial areas mixed with shots of men working in the Strip District.
While Snyder is proud of his Pittsburgh roots — “I’m proud of it and I have absolutely no problem with it shining through in [my] songs,” he said — he did emphasize the importance of leaving Pittsburgh. “That’s how it works in Pittsburgh — you leave Pittsburgh to succeed [in the music industry]. You can’t just continue playing around Pittsburgh,” he said. “We’ve always lived in Pittsburgh, but we always make sure we go to New York and L.A. and overseas. And it’s just important, you know, if you want to do it for real.”
Snyder described Pittsburgh’s music scene as very small, and said that “I feel like people could definitely be more creative” when making music. He is hopeful for the future of the local scene, though: “I feel like I’m waiting for some band of 19-year-olds to come and blow us out of the water... I hope there’s a group of four or five guys and girls sitting in their garage somewhere making music.”

Mohit Moondra, a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, was crowned Mr. Fraternity 2011 on Friday night in Rangos Hall before an ecstatic crowd of Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff at Kappa Alpha Theta’s “The Fraternity League.”
The pageant-style event featured 10 men representing most of Carnegie Mellon’s fraternities. The show included the men strutting about the stage in beachwear, showing off superhero costumes, performing a variety of talents, and donning formal wear. The event concluded with a Q & A session.
Kappa Alpha Theta first held the event in 1985, after the tragic death of a sister named Karin Johnson during her sophomore year at Carnegie Mellon. Half of the proceeds from the event will go to the Karin Johnson Fund, an organization managed by the Central Ohio Breathing Association. The other half of the proceeds will go to the Kappa Alpha Theta Foundation and the Court Appointed Special Advocate Association.
The event was made possible by the hard work of sophomore decision science major Ashley Chen. Chen is Kappa Alpha Theta’s philanthropy chair, and worked to plan and successfully execute the show, including getting contestants, running rehearsals, and decorating the hall. She explained that the Court Appointed Special Advocates donations “[go] to our local chapter here in Pittsburgh.”
The show included plenty of laughs, from a choreographed opening to a clichéd question and answer session. At times, though, the show seemed to drag on at an awkward pace, as if the audience was just waiting for an act to end. Students enjoyed the more comedic acts but seemed bored during more serious parts of the show.
Based on the audience’s reaction, the talent portion of the evening was the most entertaining. A majority of the acts were intended to make the audience laugh and have a good time for a good cause. Plenty of singing — such as first-year business administration major Jason Buckman’s rendition of The Little Mermaid’s “Under the Sea” for Beta Theta Pi — had everyone cracking up.
Mohit Moondra, a senior math and economics major, stole the show at the end of the talent portion, and it was clear to those in attendance that his performance won him the crown. He began with an impressive hip-hop routine, and then, thanks to some well-choreographed moves, was suddenly wearing a bhangra outfit and accompanied by two other bhangra dancers. This part of the show was the crowd favorite, and was entertaining to watch.
Some parts of the show were lost underneath the applause or yelling of audience members. The Kappa Alpha Theta members reading about contestants often did not wait for the applause to die down in order for the audience to hear what they were saying. A few microphone problems also started the show off on a slightly awkward note. Most audience members were so caught up in cheering for their favorite contestant, however, that they hardly seemed to notice these small blunders.
The winner was decided based on audience votes, Coin Wars donations, and judges’ scores. Audience members voted for their favorite contestants using ticket stubs during intermission. Coin Wars took place outside Doherty Hall during the week, and coins correlated to “positive points” for the contestants. The coins were also part of Kappa Alpha Theta’s efforts to raise money for their philanthropies. The judges also gave contestants a score.
The event concluded with Moondra being surrounded and cheered for by his Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity brothers. Later, Moondra and the sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta posed for pictures and celebrated the success of a fun evening for a good cause.

Even for the apolitical movie-goer, The Ides of March — directed by George Clooney and starring Clooney, Ryan Gosling, and Evan Rachel Wood — is a political thriller that entertains. With an ill-boding title referencing Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, it is a suspenseful drama full of mind games and manipulation. Every character’s purpose is to twist another’s, and complicated relationships lead to morally compromising situations. Fast-paced and intense, the movie reflects one simple, universal opinion: Politics is dirty. 
The Ides of March follows the ambitious Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) as a major player on the campaign staff for Democrat Mike Morris (George Clooney), governor of Pennsylvania. He must secure Morris’ win in the Ohio primary by gaining the crucial support of a North Carolina Senator (Jeffrey Wright). In the process, he struggles to evade the critical New York Times journalist Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei), who aggressively pursues a good story to break, often at the Democrats’ expense. 
Myers finds a formidable rival in the opposing Democrat’s campaign manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), a seasoned and scheming manager who tests Myers’ noble convictions and loyalty. Duffy attempts to lure Myers to his side of the campaign by presenting two options: remain on the front line of a losing candidate and work in a consulting firm, or switch to the winner’s team and spend the next four years in the White House.
Overall, the film succeeds at highlighting the ugly faces of human nature — hypocrisy, an “every man for himself” mentality, and forbidden desires — but is not completely devoid of flaws. For example, some audience members will have a hard time believing Wood, who is supposed to be a flirtatious 20-year-old intern, is significantly younger than Gosling when she looks at least 25. This is important because her age is a significant source of conflict in the film. There is room to sympathize with her character, however. She is a young, hopeful college student wanting to get her foot in the door of a prestigious organization to secure a future in an occupation she loves. With Myers, the audience can feel what it’s like to be a qualified employee eager to jump at chances for promotion.
Politically aware audience members may have strong opinions about the ideas presented by the presidential candidates, including abortion, gay marriage, and religion. For others, controversy is overshadowed by powerful acting and an effective score (courtesy of Alexander Desplat). In the end, The Ides of March can be applauded for remaining interesting from beginning to end and leaving no character untarnished, even the heroes we root for. By successfully telling a good loss of innocence story, Clooney achieves an outstanding cinematic experience.

Hello,
A young guy writes to you because he is hopelessly vacillating on whether to play his Batman video game or get laid when his long-distance girlfriend comes to visit? Really? In your experience, how often do readers send you questions that are as obviously made up as this one, and why do you choose to waste time on them? (Then again, this IS Carnegie Mellon we’re talking about, so there’s a slight chance that it’s a real question).
Calling BS on this one
P.S. unless all of the questions are made up, in which case I just missed the disclaimer when you first started writing the column.
Dear BS,
Clearly you haven’t played Batman: Arkham City. Let me explain it like this: Remember when you were eight and made your own Batman costume and ran around the house yelling “I am the night”? This game is even better than that. You get to punch out a shark!
And I’ll have you know that neither of my two beloved readers send me “questions that are so obviously made up.” I have received many real questions over the years. You seem to think that my time is actually valuable. This is pretty much all I do. It’s a sad, lonely existence.
Okay, so they’re pretty much all made up,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
What do you mean all your questions are made up!? You mean someone didn’t write in last month about possibly murdering someone? I’m shocked and outraged! You have broken the sacred bonds between awkward person/mediocre advice columnist. How can I get over this heartbreak?
Thanks,
Eschewing Totally Trusting Undergrad Boys’ Rambling, Untrustworthy, Tiresome Exhortations
Dear ET TU BRUTE,
I know. I too was shocked when I realized I made up the question about waking up in an abandoned fraternity. I should’ve said, “Hey, this question looks pretty suspicious. Why would the first thing you do after waking up in a frat be to write to an advice column?” I should have known I was making up almost every single question.
But so what? Just because the question is made up doesn’t make the advice less valid. If I make up the question, it’s because it’s an issue I’ve encountered either personally or through the people around me. Even though my advice may not be addressed to a specific person, it can still help someone struggling with something similar.
Or we can just accept it’s BS and laugh at the jokes,
Patrick Hoskins

I used to be on the fence about Real Estate. It seemed really boring — identical to other jangly surf-pop groups like Beach Fossils and Best Coast. Also, my friends from home were obsessed with it, deterring me from the group even more. (I have this personality where I don’t like things that other people like.)
I finally decided to give Real Estate a chance after listening to its first single, “It’s Real,” from the group’s sophomore album, Days. I listened to it on the music blog Gorilla vs. Bear on a whim, and I instantly loved it — it’s ridiculously catchy. Although my expectations were set unreasonably high after listening to “It’s Real,” I fell in love with Real Estate’s new album as soon as I listened to the first track.
Days is a beautiful album. It’s structurally simple but melodically complex. Featuring autumnal guitar-pop with soft vocals, nostalgic lyrics, and breezy melodies, the album is accessible and puts listeners at ease. Its effortless catchiness recalls Pavement, while its intricately composed songs are reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac. All of the songs are generally related in lyrical content and melody in that they evoke a coming-of-age melancholy. I could imagine Holden Caulfield listening to this album as he contemplatively walked around New York City in the fall. It’s actually the perfect album to soundtrack your walk on a warm autumn day— there’s a reference to “decomposing leaves” in one of the songs that will either make you chuckle or roll your eyes in exasperation during your stroll.
Real Estate is coming to Garfield Artworks on Nov. 20, and I’m definitely going. Garfield Artworks is the perfect venue for the group — it’s small and intimate, and it has interesting art lining the walls. Even if you have a lot of work, which seems to be the most common excuse for Carnegie Mellon students to not do things, you should go to hear some great music.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, visited Carnegie Mellon as part of his East Coast recruiting tour on Tuesday. In his first trip to the university, Zuckerberg spoke to groups of faculty and students. Over 1,000 audience members filled Wiegand Gym in the University Center and overflow seating was available in McConomy Auditorium.
The invitation-only event began with Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Kamlet and School of Computer Science Dean Randy Bryant welcoming Zuckerberg to the university. Associate Dean Mark Stehlik, the primary undergraduate adviser for computer science students, joined Zuckerberg on the stage to moderate the event.
Although Stehlik began the discussion by asking Zuckerberg about his decision to include Carnegie Mellon in the select three colleges he visited, along with MIT and Harvard, the majority of Tuesday's event consisted of Zuckerberg responding to preselected questions from students.
"We have a lot of Carnegie Mellon alums at Facebook, and a lot of them are some of our best engineers," Zuckerberg said at an informal press meeting before his speech. "When we organized this trip to go see a few colleges, Carnegie Mellon was at the top of the list."
"Facebook looks for real entrepreneurial folks," Zuckerberg continued. "People who are trying to have a big impact on the world, and who have the ability to look at any of 100 different problems at once and say, 'this is the one we need to solve'.... And thats really what the biggest thing we look for.  That and really good technical skills."

Vice President Joe Biden told a crowd of over 300 people at the University of Pittsburgh on Friday that the government must ease the burden of debt on college students.
“America is expected to reach more than $1 trillion in student loan debt by the end of this year,” Biden said to the audience, which consisted almost entirely of students from Pitt and surrounding universities. “That’s more than all the credit card debt in America. Average debt for a student graduating in America from a university is $20,000. At some schools, people are graduating with ... $80,000 of debt. It’s a huge burden. And the question for us is, ‘What, if anything, are we going to do about it?’ ”
Biden stressed that good and widespread college education is a necessity if the United States is to remain a world leader. He explained, “My wife has a great expression. She says, ‘Any country that out-educates us will out-compete us.’ ”
But, Biden added, it’s becoming harder and harder for parents to provide their children with a quality education.
He illustrated the hardships of modern American families with stories of his own father’s economic troubles, and he talked about how he personally paid for his children’s expensive college educations.
“[My children] graduated with debt that ranged from $120,000 to a low of $68,000. You know what I was able to do that your parents can’t do? I had a home that we lived in for 25 years that significantly accumulated in value. And when they graduated, I sold that home. I understand what your parents aren’t in a position to do.”
In past decades, according to Biden, middle-class parents could pay for their children’s college educations using their houses or retirement plans. But in the current economic downturn, those are not options for many parents.
Biden said that in his extensive travels around the United States since becoming vice president, he’s been most disappointed in the lack of hope he sees when he talks to parents around the country.
“My father — when he told us he was going to have to leave us in Scranton with my grandfather, because there were no jobs in Scranton — he said it was going to be okay,” Biden recalled. “He believed that. Parents today, they’re just not at all sure it’s going to be okay. The middle class is being decimated.”
Will Zhang, a Carnegie Mellon senior computer science major who attended the event, said that the vice president made good use of the stories he told. “He’s a really great character. He has a really engaging personality,” Zhang said. “He used a lot of great anecdotes that really appeal to young people.”
But, Zhang said, the speech was also politically charged: “It was clear that he wanted to get more young people to support him and Obama.”
Biden spent a long section of his speech discussing the upcoming presidential election and detailing the ways in which he disagrees with the view Republicans have taken on how to fix the economy.
“They think that the way to get back the economy is to take away all the new regulations placed on Wall Street. The last time we deregulated Wall Street, we put the middle class in chains. I don’t call that liberation,” Biden said, referring to a speech in which Speaker of the House John Boehner (R–Ohio) said he wanted to “liberate the economy.”
By contrast, Biden said, in the two years before Republicans took control of the House in 2010, he and Obama increased the Pell grants available to the poorest students and eliminated private middlemen from student loans.
Biden also touted the president’s recent executive order that caps student loan payments at 10 percent of a person’s annual income.
According to The New York Times, students graduating in 2012 or later with certain kinds of federal loans will be able to consolidate those loans and then pay 10 percent of their income for 20 years, at which point the loans will be forgiven. Only students with low discretionary incomes would be eligible for the plan.
Biden said that the 2012 election will provide a clear choice for the American people about the direction in which they want to take the country.
“This is going to be a choice. And if the choice is made that we win, we will know that will be a mandate,” Biden said. “I think we’re going to be able to make significantly more progress the next four years than this, because people will make a choice. And we’ll live by the choice.”

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg will visit Carnegie Mellon for the first time this Tuesday.
Zuckerberg is currently on an East Coast college tour; in addition to Carnegie Mellon, he will be visiting MIT and Harvard University, the latter of which he attended from 2002 to 2004.
During his stay in Pittsburgh, Zuckerberg will meet with faculty and students and host a discussion with an invitation-only audience.
This lecture will also feature Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s vice president of engineering.
The audience will primarily consist of computer science and electrical and computer engineering students, but it will also include students with interests related to these fields and other topics at the core of Facebook’s business.
Though this will be Zuckerberg’s first visit to Carnegie Mellon’s campus, he and his colleagues at Facebook are well acquainted with the university, as the company is a major recruiter on campus at the fall Technical Opportunities Conference.
“We are very excited by the prospect of hosting a visit by Mark Zuckerberg,” said Randal E. Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science, in a university press release. “Facebook has profoundly changed the nature of social interactions worldwide. Supporting these interactions requires massive information processing capabilities, for which Facebook has become a leader in advanced computing technology.”
The event will be held in Wiegand Gymnasium, with overflow in McConomy Auditorium. Seating is limited to 1,000. Last Thursday, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff registered for tickets online. Students reported that registration was open for less than half an hour before all tickets had been claimed.

Carnegie Mellon’s 18th annual food drive is being held across campus from Oct. 31 to Nov. 11.
The event, which is sponsored by members of Staff Council, benefits the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (GPCFB), a nonprofit agency that collects and distributes food in 11 counties in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The main highlights of the food drive are “One Can/One Day,” held in the University Center last Wednesday, and “Cans Across the Cut,” to be held this Wednesday. The One Can/One Day event was mainly aimed at staff members, who dropped their contributions off at a desk in the University Center.
In addition, dropboxes have been placed all around campus to collect food. Donatable items include non-perishables like cereal and rice, or canned and powdered items. Household essentials such as toilet paper, toothpaste, and cleaning supplies are also being targeted.
The Food Drive Committee is responsible for planning, organizing, marketing, and implementing the drive.
Carole Panno, Carnegie Mellon’s senior associate director of annual giving, has been part of the food drive for about 18 years. She said that she cannot imagine not having enough to eat and not being able to enjoy a special meal for Thanksgiving.
“The effort that I — and other members of the committee — put into the food drive each year is to ensure that members of this campus community continue to provide the leadership and support for those less fortunate members of the greater Pittsburgh community,” Panno said in an email.
According to Associate Director for Reunion Giving Katie Lambrou, the need for food continues to grow in Pittsburgh. 
“Since Carnegie Mellon University has always been one of the largest initiators for collecting food, now it depends on us to take up and lead the initiative,” she said.
The Pennsylvania Department of Labor estimates that more than 95,000 people were unemployed in the Pittsburgh metro area as of February 2011. The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania is 8 percent, which is below the national average of 8.8 percent. 
However, according to a GPCFB brochure, seven out of 11 counties served by the food bank have unemployment rates above the state average, with five counties above the national average.
The GPCFB serves more than 120,000 people per month through a network of 400 affiliate food banks and other food assistance agencies, as well as contributions made by individual donors.
The annual drive has seen increasing response from members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
According to Lambrou, 1,355 pounds of food were collected in 1994. Last year, 9,026 pounds were collected. “This year we hope to collect more than 10,000 pounds,” she said.
The amount of money donated per year is also improving. Lambrou said that participants in 2000 donated just $90 for the benefit of the drive; last year, the amount increased to $2,607.
Cans Across the Cut will be held on campus Wednesday. At this event, student teams collect food cans and lay them across the Cut; the team that collects the most cans wins. Lambrou said that last year’s winning team collected 611 cans.
She hopes that at least 10 teams will actively participate this year. Six teams were signed up as of Saturday.

Brent Scarpo, a motivational speaker, allegedly made derogatory and false remarks when talking to the Greek community about alcohol poisoning and alcohol education. In reaction to the widespread controversy over his talk, the Greek Life staff held an open forum for students to voice their concerns last Tuesday night at 9 p.m.
During Scarpo’s visit to Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday, Oct. 25, he performed multiple skits that many students in the audience found offensive. 
At Tuesday’s forum, participants said they felt he made both racist and sexist remarks, such as “that’s what she said” jokes. Scarpo also conveyed false information about Carnegie Mellon’s amnesty policy, according to junior English major Aurelia Henderson, at which point students raised their hands and stood up to correct him.
Lucas Christain, the associate director of Student Life for Greek houses, chaired last Tuesday’s forum to address Scarpo’s talk, along with Coordinators of Fraternity and Sorority Life Monica McGee, Ariel Weaver, and Aaron George.
“We didn’t get what we expected that night,” Christain said to the audience of about a dozen Greek members when the meeting began. The open forum was designed to “clarify the approaches we took,” he explained. He also emphasized that the forum was not a place for blame; it was an opportunity to voice concerns and to learn from the incident. “We wanted to have an open forum after Scarpo.... We heard a lot of feedback from students, and the folks up here share a lot of those concerns,” Christain said, motioning to the meeting chairs. 
Christain said that he was confident that Scarpo was an aberration in what is normally a smooth process. Typically, speakers brought in for the Greek community are taken out to dinner beforehand to get a better sense of who they are. However, with Scarpo, this could not be done because of certain time constraints.
“People had seen him before,” McGee said in explaining why Scarpo was originally chosen as a speaker for the Greek community. “Scarpo is a speaker endorsed by major Greek associations that our fraternities and sororities are a part of.” McGee said that the Greek Life staff had gotten a lot of feedback from the Greek community, both immediately after the show and in the days following.
Christain stressed that Scarpo’s speech was a learning experience for everyone, especially the Greek Life staff. He explained his reaction as he listened to Scarpo talk. “This has to turn a corner.... I did that for 45 minutes in my head.” 
The other staff members agreed, and said that they wished they had stepped in. Weaver, Christain, George, and McGee all expressed the need for a contingency plan so as to better handle future challenging situations.
Students offered possible solutions to avoid similar mistakes. Cora Goldston, a junior social and decision sciences major and member of Alpha Chi Omega, said, “We should talk to the speakers beforehand, so they get a better idea of what to expect in our community.”
Clare Graziano, a senior drama major and member of Delta Delta Delta, suggested creating a hand symbol for whether students were comfortable or not. During Scarpo’s skits, he had asked for student volunteers. Once the skits became derogatory, those on stage appeared uncomfortable, but could not easily make an exit or leave. “That was a big issue for me,” she said. “Feeling how uncomfortable they were [on stage].”
Near the end of the discussion, McGee added that she and the other Greek Life staff voiced their and students’ concerns directly to Scarpo. She said that he was sorry for what happened. “[We] gave him a critique to help him change the program in the future,” she said. McGee also encouraged sorority and fraternity members to utilize their councils and bring their concerns to them to enact better workshops.
Many at the forum emphasized the need for an ongoing conversation about the incident; multiple students in the audience said they wanted to continue  to discuss improvements and solutions to unexpected, and controversial, situations. “We are going to continue to encourage students’ talking,” Christain said. 
Weaver agreed and added, “[We] appreciate the people who did come to this.... It’s the only way to move forward as a community.”

The Tar Sands Action organization, along with several other nonprofits, put on “Hands Around the White House,” a protest against the Keystone XL Pipeline extension, on Nov. 6 at the White House.
Among those in attendance were several Carnegie Mellon students from the Sustainable Earth organization.
The Keystone XL Pipeline, initially proposed by the Canadian oil and gas company TransCanada in 2008, is an extension of the existing Keystone pipeline connecting oil refineries in Illinois and Oklahoma to the Athabasca Oil Sands in Canada. The extension would consist of a more direct connection to Oklahoma and Illinois as well as additional pipelines to refineries in Texas.
Since its proposal, however, the extension has been met with controversy and protest over its environmental impacts. 
“It would be tapping into the second-largest pool of carbon on the planet, so the CO2 emissions would be enormous,” said Daniel Kessler, a spokesperson for Tar Sands Action. “The pipeline also poses great risk to our air, land, and water if there is a spilling.”
President Barack Obama is expected to make a decision by the end of the year on whether to approve construction of the pipeline, and environmental activists are urging him to veto the proposal.
“[The] Hands Around the White House rally quite literally has the ability to determine the decision Obama will make,” said sophomore architecture major Leah Wulfman, who attended the event on Sunday. “We hope that the decision, in part because of the rally, will be a veto of the proposed pipeline.”
According to Wulfman, approximately 12,000 people attended the rally on Sunday. The protesters surrounded the White House hand-in-hand, forming a ring about seven rows deep.
But while this protest may be the first of its kind, Kessler said that people have been protesting tar sands for a decade.
“People on the front lines in Canada have been fighting development of the tar sands for a very long time, because it’s leading to destruction of their community, higher cancer rates, and other health problems,” Kessler said. “Over the last few years, people in the U.S. have been getting more involved because of the pipeline and the growing awareness about climate change.”
In addition, some protestors and organizers are characterizing ‘Hands Around the White House’ as a part of the larger Occupy protests that have been sweeping the nation in such states like new York and Pennsylvania.
“In the face of this threat to the 99 percent — what does the US State Department have to say about Tar Sand oil exploitation? Drill-baby-drill,” reads the description on one of the Facebook pages for the event. “Fight the global plutocracy — as Chomsky refers to it, ‘the rule by the wealthy or power provided by wealth that is destroying life on this planet.’”
However, Kessler emphasized that from his organization’s perspective, the main goal is to convince the president to veto the Keystone XL proposal. “We’re just protesting the extension. The other existing pipelines aren’t relevant to this protest,” Kessler said.
And while Wulfman has similar expectations, she also hopes that victory in Washington will help spark other environmental movements. “We want this to be the long-awaited and fought-for turning point where we move away from destructive fossil fuels,” she said.

Freelance writer and translator Ashok Gurung delivered a speech at Carnegie Mellon last Thursday regarding his life as a Bhutanese refugee.
As event co-organizer Inyoung Song described, Gurung spoke about “how his journey took him to Pittsburgh.”
The event was organized as part of a speaker series for the StuCo Refugee Studies in Pittsburgh (98-170). 
The Refugee Studies StuCo class is taught by Song, a second-year master’s student in public policy and management, and Audrey Williams, a senior international relations and politics and clarinet double major who is also pursuing an accelerated master’s degree in public policy and management.
“The format of our class deals with refugee issues, and having the perspective of a refugee really crystalizes this,” Williams said.
The speech was delivered to a crowd of roughly 20 people. Many attendees were enrolled in the class, but several were students unaffiliated with the course. In his speech, Gurung reflected upon the experience of leaving his country in 1990 as a fourth grader.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, the Bhutanese refugee problem came about in the early 1990s because of ethnic conflicts within Bhutan. Tensions had been growing throughout the second half of the 20th century due to the growth in the population of Nepali-speaking southern Bhutanese citizens. In 1988, the Bhutanese government reclassified many of these ethnically Nepalese people as illegal migrants. 
Protests prompted the mass deportations of ethnic Nepalese from Bhutan, an action that has attracted attention from groups such as Human Rights Watch and the United Nations. 
Further complicating matters, Nepal itself claims little responsibility for these refugees, leading many Western nations to sponsor resettlement efforts.
As Gurung explained, in 1988 the Bhutanese government enacted the “One Nation, One People” policy which, in turn, began the conflict between the Bhutanese government and ethnic Nepalese residents of southern Bhutan.
“[The Nepali-speaking Bhutanese] speak a different language and believed in a pluralistic culture,” Gurung said. He contended that the cultural conflict could be attributed to those differences. 
He said that the act caused “a lot of harassment for the Nepalese people,” and detailed that in addition to the imprisonment of many people, including his father, systematic beatings, rapes, torture, and other abuses were also carried out under the law.
Gurung described the 17 years he spent in a refugee camp in Nepal, and the life he lived there. He spoke of the crude, “superstitious” medical care available, as well as the briquettes provided for cooking that flooded the villages with smoke, and were linked with respiratory diseases.
In addition, refugees were not allowed to leave the camp unless given direct permission, a daunting restriction on individual freedom that Gurung managed to overcome by receiving permission to pursue his higher education off the grounds of the camp.
Gurung concluded his speech by acknowledging the role of foreign nations in funding refugee efforts and accepting refugees into their countries. The city of Pittsburgh in particular, according to Gurung, houses approximately 2,500 Bhutanese refugees. Upon arriving in Pittsburgh, he found people to be extremely helpful. Gurung has since taken up residence, and is considering applying for U.S. citizenship.
However, when asked if he would return to Bhutan, Gurung replied, “I would definitely go,” stating that he’d love to visit his mother, who still calls him every day.
Nick Zuniga, a sophomore biological sciences and psychology major, enjoyed the lecture. “You see in movies horrible things happen but you just think ‘well, that’s just TV,’ but this actually happens,” Zuniga said.
Wrapping up his talk on a hopeful note, Gurung revealed that policies within Bhutan are “slowly being changed,” and that he is hoping for a better future for his country, and people.
Editor's note: This article was modified on Nov. 13 to clarify the legal and ethnic status of the Nepali-speaking people of Bhutan.

Students and faculty members gathered in the Connan Room of the University Center  last Thursday to participate in a conversation with Vandana Shiva, an eco-feminist and physicist.
Shiva came to Pittsburgh to accept the Thomas Merton Award given by the Thomas Merton Center, a Pittsburgh-based non-profit, for her remarkable contributions to world peace and social justice.
In her lecture, Shiva shared personal stories and talked about a wide range of topics, from biopiracy — the practice of exploiting nature for commercial gain, as when a particular seed is patented by a company — to hunger.
“I grew up in the Himalayan forest. My father was a forest council officer,” she said. “I’ve seen the Himalayan forest rich and dense, but I remember the particular day when I went swimming and my favorite tree wasn’t there because forest trees were chopped down for an apple orchard.”
Shiva said that her childhood memories exerted huge impacts on her values and the path she would take later. In 1991, Shiva founded Navdanya, a national movement in India to protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seeds.
Shiva’s work has involved her in the campaign against biopiracy. She said that no one can invent and have ownership of a plant simply by introducing a gene into it. However, companies such as Monsanto genetically modified seeds and then tried to patent them so that farmers had to pay for every “patented” seed to those companies. 
Shiva gave the audience a personal analogy of biopiracy, using her own physical disability.
“Now I was wheeled very kindly to [the Connan Room] in this wheelchair,” she said. “Do I turn around and say because I’ve introduced a new element to the room, this room built in Carnegie Mellon is something I created? And now Carnegie Mellon gives me rent? It’s a ridiculous notion. And all we’ve done in genetic engineering is just shoot a gene.”
“I believe in integrity of biodiversity,” she added. “And for me, it’s ethically wrong to say that ‘I’ve invented this life form.’  ”
In 2004, Navdanya scored a victory against biopiracy when the European Patent Office in Munich revoked Monsanto’s patent on the Indian variety of wheat “Nap Hal.” Back in India, Shiva’s organization has helped set up 65 community seed banks across the country to protect diversity of seeds.
Students and professors had positive feedback following Shiva’s lecture. 
Caroline Acker, a history professor and a historian of medicine and public health, supported Shiva’s ideas. “I appreciated Dr. Shiva’s discussion of the patenting of life forms such as seeds. The idea of patents was developed so as to encourage innovation and thus a diversity of possibilities. Ironically, as Dr. Shiva noted, the patenting of seeds and the insistence on selling them contributes to monoculture and to cultivation of single varieties of crops.”
Jihoon Min, a Ph.D. student in the department of engineering and public policy, said, “I think [Shiva] is great, because she was educated through a totally Western perspective, which can be an obstacle that will prevent average people from having a holistic view about the world, or from respecting the local knowledge of local people. She went beyond this obstacle and made people around the world sympathize with the environmental issues and the corporate violence.”

Associate professor chosen to serve Steering Committee
Alex London, associate professor of philosophy and acclaimed expert in bioethics, has been selected to serve on the International Commission on Missing Persons’ (ICMP) Steering Committee on Forensic Science Programs.
The ICMP works with governments to locate and identify people who have gone missing as a result of armed conflicts, other hostile situations, or violations of human rights. To date, the commission has helped to identify over 18,000 missing persons.
According to a university press release, the purpose of the Steering Committee is to “stay current with information on advanced methods and best practices.” To find missing persons, the IMCP relies heavily on forensic techniques combining DNA testing, archaeology, anthropology, and pathology.
London will be one of 11 experts, selected from the fields of forensic archaeology and anthropology, pathology, odontology, genetics, statistics, human identification, quality management, and bioethics, serving on the Steering Committee on Forensic Science Programs.
London is the director of the Center for Ethics and Policy. His research focuses on ethical issues in human-subjects research, issues of social justice, and methodological issues in theoretical and applied ethics. His most recent work looks at ways to improve risk vs. benefit estimates in human drug trials.
CMU researcher finds online privacy tools to be unusable
Carnegie Mellon researchers have found that internet privacy tools are not useful to the average person.
According to a Wall Street Journal technology blog, the study, coordinated by computer science professor Lorrie Faith Cranor, tested nine “opt-out” and “blocking” tools which allow internet users to disable advertising networks and block websites, respectively.  
The nine tools, according to PCWorld, were each tested by five different participants, none of whom were technical experts. The study found the tools to be universally ineffective. “None of the nine tools we tested empowered study participants to effectively control tracking and behavioral advertising according to their personal preferences,” the researchers wrote in their study.
“On the usability front it is pretty bad news,” Cranor told the Wall Street Journal. “I was actually somewhat surprised about how difficult it was for everybody.”
PCWorld reported that the major issues that the study found with the tools were unclear instructions; inefficient default settings that placed the burden on users to figure out what privacy settings they wanted; a lack of information regarding the list of advertising networks which users could opt out of; and insufficient feedback to users.

“What else are we going to do?”
America has been hearing this statement a lot lately. We’ve heard it from the few businessmen and women who led our country to its current economic destitution, from sports players interviewed on their steroid use, and currently from the Pittsburgh public school system's very own superintendent, Linda Lane, according to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The district has no choice: It must cripple its so-called "extracurriculars" in order to help reduce its $38.2 million deficit projected for 2012.
The district’s proposed plan includes required weekly music, physical education, and art classes for the elementary and middle school levels, as opposed to the current optional multiple-times-a-week system. For some this is at least a beginning, but for others this is dramatically weakening the program.
Doesn't sound too bad — until you get to the part about all the itinerant music teachers being cut. According to Natalie Ozeas, professor of music education at Carnegie Mellon, the music classes would be taught by classroom teachers, most of whom have little experience teaching music.
Sure, this would save money — assigning one itinerant teacher to go to three or four schools once a week and cutting the rest tends to do that — but it would also keep the students from learning anything, especially those in middle school. It would encourage only those with enough money for private lessons to pursue their instruments, and even then the schools wouldn’t provide nearly enough supplementary support.
Speaking of private lessons, the plan also proffers to remove private lessons from the curriculum at Pittsburgh CAPA, the city’s magnet school for the creative and performing arts. Normally, I wouldn’t view this as much of a problem — I went to a regular public high school, and I had to buy my own lessons — but when considering the school's student population, losing the free private lessons would be disastrous, not only for the students but for the school as well.
According to David Knapp, CAPA's instrumental department chair, 85 percent of music students would be unable to sufficiently pay for private lessons. Music is, after all, an expensive business. While an inexperienced high school student might charge $20 per hour-long lesson for a fifth grader, professionals' prices range from around $40 to $240 per hour; the most common prices go from $50 to $100. For a lower-middle class family, weekly lessons — indisputably crucial for musical development — are tertiary to having a home to live in and sending a child to school, even if the child is musically gifted.
Thus, for over three-fourths of CAPA's music students, the only sources for individual improvement would be the internet and intuition. This 85 percent would have no role model for musicality, and no one to teach them proper technique or practice methods. And when the skill of the students goes, the school's prestige leaves with it.
Our country has a history of cutting the arts in public schools, especially in the past 10 years, and quite often these "proposed cuts" are already done deals by the time they hit the table publicly. Granted, steps must be taken to fix a deficit of $38 million, but I believe there is always a choice. There are untapped resources here in Pittsburgh, such as our own Carnegie Mellon School of Music, that could save the music programs from destitution.
Carnegie Mellon has at its disposal the most prestigious music school in the state. And yet the School of Music only has one organized outreach program, the Carnegie Mellon Arts Alliance, which gives current students opportunities to perform solo and chamber works in the Pittsburgh community. While this is certainly useful, offering valuable performance experience to Carnegie Mellon students and hopefully inspiring members of the local community, it does nothing to directly support music in Pittsburgh's public schools.
Many Carnegie Mellon music students are capable of and willing to directly assist in educating burgeoning young musicians. 
I recently contacted Knapp about offering my own services to the students at CAPA who would be without a private teacher if the district follows through with its proposed cuts. I would charge on a need-based basis, and parents would only pay me what they could; if that means that I don't get paid, then fine. I would hope that other Carnegie Mellon music students would be willing to do the same thing.
This is only a small example of what students can do to support music in Pittsburgh's public schools. Ideally, the district would find other ways to lower its deficit — parcel taxes, for instance — but as it is, the district seems quite taken with its current plan. Carnegie Mellon's School of Music needs to be ready to act as a lifeline for Pittsburgh public schools' music programs if these cuts go through, or they'll have no hope for survival in the coming years.

In the last decade, no one has shaped our culture’s understanding of privacy more than Mark Zuckerberg. He has created a phenomenally successful online service that makes it normal for us to post every detail of our personal information for our friends, families, and the world to see.
Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, is speaking at a recruiting event at Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday. He will speak to a capacity crowd in Wiegand Gym, and his talk will be simulcast in McConomy Auditorium. Pre-registered students, faculty, and staff will be attending.
If Facebook has its way, though, you won’t be seeing photos of Zuckerberg’s Carnegie Mellon visit on your friends’ walls. Both photographic and audio recording devices are strictly prohibited at Tuesday’s event, and media outlets’ attempts to cover the event have been rebuffed. 
This ban is not only misguided, it is also futile. Nearly every person in the audience will be carrying at least one — if not several — devices equipped with multi-megapixel cameras, digital recording, video capabilities, and constant access to social networks.
But even if the ban is impossible, it is decidedly misaligned with Facebook’s goals. Facebook’s stated mission is to “give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.”
Zuckerberg’s talk is closed, and Carnegie Mellon and the media are being denied the power to share it. Coming from a CEO and company whose guiding principle is openness, this denial can only be seen as highly hypocritical. 
Sure, Facebook might promote openness because its leaders actually want information to flow freely across the internet. On the other hand, they might just be looking to bring in more advertising dollars through the page views that they know sharing on their network brings in.
If Zuckerberg and his company wanted to show their dedication to the ideals of universal sharing and a more open and connected world, and prove their goal is not just increased advertising dollars. Tuesday’s event should be an opportunity, not a media challenge. This week’s recruiting trip will be limited to three universities (Harvard, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon); no doubt students around the world would be interested in hearing what Zuckerberg has to say.
Allowing Carnegie Mellon to stream Zuckerberg’s talk would support the open and connected world that Facebook claims to support. The news media was sharing information long before Zuckerberg came up with the idea for thefacebook.com, and denying it access denies people the access to information that Facebook claims to support.
While this may be Zuckerberg’s first campus tour, other members of Facebook’s leadership team have conducted similar closed meetings with other universities. Such precedents should be discouraged because they allow Facebook executives the ability to say whatever they please, without being held accountable to the media or other independent sources.
If Facebook and Zuckerberg are serious about their mission, they should apply its principles to everything they do. They should prove they aren’t just an advertising company in disguise. 
Facebook events should be held in the spirit of Facebook the network. The restrictions placed on Tuesday’s event are against the spirit of openness that Zuckerberg and Facebook claim to prize.

I sauntered out of my dorm room on the Saturday night before Halloween in a sexy biker chick outfit: a bra and a mini skirt.
Grabbing my jean jacket for warmth, I tried to remember the last time I was this naked on Halloween — I was four, and my Princess Jasmine costume revealed my belly button. As I staggered down Forbes’ sidewalks in three-inch heels and passed a shivering crew of half-naked Ke$has, grown up Little Bo Peeps, and sexy schoolgirls, it became official: Snow on Halloween truly separates the daring girls from the phonies.
Of course, I am definitely putting my risqué getup on the list of things not to tell my mother, but if she does find out, my excuse is that I was only following tradition.
While it appears to be a millennial fad, sexy costumes have been prominent since the 1700s. If a modern girl showed up at a fraternity Halloween party wearing trousers, you and I might gawk at her dearth of sexiness. But 300 years ago, people would have stared at her for daring to dress so provocatively. The founding mothers of sexy costumes date back to the 18th and 19th centuries — a time when it was scandalous for a woman to show her ankles, let alone her midriff, and such attire was used as an escapist mechanism.
If only the Victorian feminists could see us now. For costume parties and masquerade balls, women donned milkmaid outfits instead of French maid outfits and not-so-short skirts instead of booty shorts. They revealed slivers of skin as they flaunted their calves instead of their thighs, and dressed up as sailors — the real kind, not lingerie with a sailor hat. I think it’s funny, in an ironic sort of way, that the 1700s’ version of sexy is the 2000s’ version of prude.
Maybe it is easier to relate to the 20th century, when sexiness became prominent within everyday clothing, and then culminated in the 1970s with cult classics like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. During those Halloweens, corsets, fishnets, and garters flooded into the streets and replaced witch hats, princess tiaras, and vampire fangs. Those who were too old to trick-or-treat had no problem taking Oct. 31 to an R-rated place, and generations since have followed in their footsteps.
Elle Woods showed up at a party as a Playboy bunny in 2001’s Legally Blonde. Three years later, Mean Girls’ Karen Smith declared that her lingerie was supposed to be, “A mouse — duh.” While millennial teenagers are not, in fact, the queens of sleaze when it comes to costumes, we are the sleaziest.
Yes, channeling your wild side on Halloween is trashy, inappropriate, and you always run the risk of catching a cold. Yet it is one night of the year, and, for the most part, it is just dressing up. Besides, you can always justify wearing a revealing Halloween costume by saying you are just following the traditions of history. So don’t be afraid to be creative next Halloween: Be a sexy toilet plunger, a sexy trash collector, a sexy Dumbledore, a sexy Voldemort, or a sexy hobo.

While reading Matt Mastricova’s article “999 Tax Plan Does Not Solve Economic Problems,” I could not help but agree with his analysis of capitalism, which concludes that it necessarily creates income inequality. Yet the article implied something more. Mastricova states that “it should be logical that our taxation system account for [the disparity between the rich and the poor].” I disagree. The underlying assumption that keeps this logic afloat is that people in this country are owed something beyond the guarantee of life.
Immigrants came to our nation not because they were handed anything upon arrival, but because they were given the opportunity to create a living for themselves through hard work. This opportunity was guaranteed not by welfare programs, but by our economic freedom.
The 999 plan has generated so much popularity for Herman Cain is because it represents a return to the ideology that the U.S. was founded on: the notion that if you work your butt off, you can create whatever kind of life you want for yourself. This country was created and perpetuated by people who displayed that kind of hard-working, individualistic mentality. These people did not view the wealthy as villains, but as role models. They were living proof that if you work hard enough, you too can achieve the American Dream.
There are still people in the U.S. who feel this way about wealth, and Cain is one of them. People vilify Cain and other like-minded individuals for saying, “If you’re poor and unemployed, it’s your own damn fault.” People call this ignorant, but I find this statement incredibly candid. Who else’s fault would it be? Maybe it comes as a shock to people who have been living on handouts and receiving unemployment benefits for almost two years, but citizenship doesn’t guarantee you anything in the U.S. aside from life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If you want any kind of lifestyle, modest or luxurious, you need to create it for yourself.
It is the abandonment of this ideology that has created a large social entitlement state and augmented the slope of our progressive taxation scheme to the point where, according to the National Taxpayer’s Union, nearly half of the country pays no net taxes.
Mastricova’s article states that the 999 plan would raise taxes for the bottom 80 percent of earners, while lowering them for the top 20 percent of earners whose income is 80 percent of the nation’s wealth. Though this idea in unpopular, I think it’s extraordinarily fair. This means that the portion of the nation that doesn’t contribute to the system at all would actually have some skin in the game and be forced to earn the benefits that come its way, even if it isn’t a dollar-per-dollar trade-off between taxation and benefits.
Criticism of the 999 plan from the perspective of social justice is incompatible with the founding principles of our nation. Up until recently, social justice meant that people get from the system what they put in. Now it means that those who contribute to the system need to subsidize those who don’t. This ideology is unsustainable and is contributing to a myriad of problems in our nation, from joblessness to the debt crisis. These problems could be solved if people stop expecting things to be handed to them, but instead go out and create for themselves, remembering that if it’s to be, it’s up to me.
It isn’t too late to make the necessary policy changes in a bipartisan manner either. Flat tax has been a surprisingly bipartisan idea. In 1992, the runner-up to Bill Clinton in the Democratic primaries advocated a flat tax. Entitlement reform can be bipartisan as well. It wasn’t too long ago that John F. Kennedy, a Democratic president, said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.”

Now, I know you all have Nov. 18 at the forefront of your minds: the day the general public will be bestowed with the latest theatrical segment of the Twilight saga. However, you should remember to mark Nov. 16, 2012 in your calendar as well. Why? Because this is when The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 will be released, truly bringing an end to this tale of mythological romance and to Hot Topic’s relevancy.
Creating two films based on a singular episode of a preexisting franchise is a growing trend in Hollywood. The Harry Potter movie series recently reached its grand conclusion, splitting the final tome, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, into two smaller narratives released almost eight months apart.
Next year, we see Peter Jackson’s recreation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit on the silver screen. However, to see the story from start to finish, you will have to wait until 2013 to see The Hobbit: There and Back Again, based on the second half of the novel.
This trend in Hollywood seems to stick to a certain genre. By reincarnating every comic superhero in existence or creating films with large production values, amazing effects, and little-to-no depth (known in the industry as “Michael Bay-ing”), film studios seem to lean toward the fantasy genre to make profitable movies.
Stories in this genre, ripe with intricate plots and characters, often require a lot of time to tell the full story. In some instances, the only feasible way to tell this story and maintain its integrity is by splitting the film into multiple parts.
Knowing that the movie industry, like any other, exists to make a profit, one could come to another conclusion. When a film studio recognizes that a loyal fan base will do anything to see the conclusion of a franchise, it may very well exploit that by dividing what chapters are left in the series into multiple parts. Thus you, as a loyal fan, are paying twice as much to see a single story that could have been formatted to fit in a single film.
I don’t deny that increased profit may inspire studios to split films, yet I feel that the amount of content these films convey is the primary reason for this practice. One of my favorite pair of films that happens to support this is Kill Bill. While not based on any preexisting source, it’s known that writer and director Quentin Tarantino always intended to have a sole film. However, it would have been over four hours, so it was split into two volumes, allowing the epic to stay intact.
As fans, we want to experience the best possible version of a story that a film studio can create. This may require splitting a singular story into multiple movies, so long as the content maintains its spirit and appeal. 
With this noted, film studios are accountable for their actions. If it takes two more movies to resolve the love triangle between a girl, a vampire, and a guy without a shirt, then it better be worth it.

After five years in captivity, Israeli Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit was exchanged for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners on Oct. 18. It has been a difficult time for his family and the state of Israel, and his release is a symbol of enduring freedom and perseverance.
Although his return home made me overjoyed, I’m confused as to how the “swap” represents freedom for both sides (a sentiment vaguely presented by worldwide Arab leaders in the BBC article “Israeli-Palestinian joy at Gilad Shalit prisoner swap,” published just minutes after the trade). 
It represents a deserved and long overdue freedom for Shalit because Hamas captured and kept him in captivity for five years. The Palestinian prisoners, however, became prisoners because they committed acts of terror. To say that freedom is being enjoyed on the side of Hamas — a known terrorist organization — is, frankly, disgusting.
When dissecting the trade mathematically, its folly becomes clear. The trade ratio was 1,027 Palestinian prisoners for one Shalit. These prisoners orchestrated acts of terrorism such as the 2001 Sbarro restaurant bombing, the 2002 Hebrew University bombing, and the Passover bombing that left 30 people dead and 150 wounded. 
In contrast, Shalit has never murdered anyone. Yet, he was exchanged for people who possess a high probability of murdering again. About 40 percent of the 1,027 prisoners were serving long sentences for terrorist acts considered to be among the worst in Israeli history.
In theories of international relations, the question of whether or not the “ends justify the means” is integral. On one hand, an innocent man was set free. On the other hand, 1,027 terrorists were released to continue pre-incarceration terrorist behaviors. 
I place fault on both sides of policy makers for resorting to such an inequitable exchange. I ultimately feel that Israeli leaders backed down, opening the floodgates for an escalation of terrorism on both sides of the border.
Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank have said that they will capture more Israeli soldiers until every single Palestinian (there are about 5,000 in Israeli prisons) is released. 
After the exchange, Hamas leader Moussa Abu Marzouk publicly stated that “the rest of the prisoners must be released because if they are not released in a normal way they will be released in other ways.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a leader I have long revered, genuinely dropped the ball when classifying this exchange as a monumental and peaceful one. After the exchange, he commented that he understood “the difficulty in accepting that the vile people who committed the heinous crimes against your loved ones will not pay the full price they deserve.” These sentiments, though well-intended, should have been made prior to the actual exchange.
At the end of the day, the swap brought joy to many Israeli families (mine included), but froze any amelioration of the long-standing conflict.

Is there nothing more beautiful than watching the dawn break? Some would blindly agree, while others would think you were making a reference to the final installment of the Twilight saga (I am).
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn is the first part in a two-part series finale (in true Harry Potter fashion) and will be released on Nov. 18. With this series I have noticed people’s sentiments are typically concentrated at one end of the spectrum: you either love it or you hate it. People seem to love hating on the movies.
Guys, they really aren’t that bad. Don’t get sucked into a vortex of pejorative criticism against what has become another highly successful book-to-film saga. Some criticisms against the films lie with the characters and the representation of vampires. I think it’s interesting to take an archetype and remold it into a more pre-teen and teen friendly version for those more conservative parents. I am confused when people become so enraged about Meyer’s vampires glistening in sunlight, as opposed to burning into a crispy bacon strip. If you want to see the latter, there are plenty of other vampire worlds that you can subscribe to.
I am not suggesting that these movies are incredible or that they should be extolled as extraordinary works of art. Not at all. I am suggesting that they are not as bad as critics claim them to be. They are decent romance movies with some decent action. For instance, in Eclipse, there is an impressive war at the end between vampires and werewolves. It is a very enthralling action scene for a vampire movie.
I think people enjoy criticizing easy targets like Twilight; the franchise has a large fan base in the teenage demographic, which means that it will have components that are going to appeal to them. This is reminiscent of Justin Bieber, another famous cultural figure. Like Twilight, many people criticize Bieber even though he has an impressive voice.
People need to stop harping on the negative aspects of Twilight and consider the audience that the story is geared towards. There are aspects of the films that are lackluster and could be improved, but then I remember it is a movie made for teenage girls and not an Academy Award candidate. 
When you hear your friend (we all have that friend) talk about how excited they are for the movie to come out, hold back your eye-rolling, heavy sighs, and sharp criticisms. Remember who the movie is made for and try to focus more on its redeeming qualities. Then you can better understand why so many people have such a strong affinity for it, as opposed to closing yourself off by jumping onto that bandwagon of sharp banter.

Motivational speaker Brent Scarpo visited our campus Oct. 25 to give a speech titled “Last Call” to the Greek community. Instead of motivation, Scarpo gave Carnegie Mellon Greeks derogatory, sexist, and racist skits. Although he allegedly had no harmful intent, Scarpo crossed the line between being relatable and being offensive.
The Greek Life staff asked Scarpo to speak to the Greek community about the seriousness of alcohol, and to inform students on how to avoid making a “last call” to a parent or friend due to an alcohol-related death. Yet during his speech, Scarpo performed offensive impersonations of African-Americans and sorority women in an attempt to get a few laughs. He also made light of serious issues, such as drunk driving, on which he was supposed to be educating the audience.
At one point in his talk, he asked students to raise their hands if they had ever driven drunk. Although a few students raised their hands, Scarpo nonetheless asked for everyone to be “honest” and egged on the audience, promising he “wouldn’t judge anyone.” 
Taking such serious subject matter lightly and being oblivious to the crowd’s discomfort did nothing but detract from Scarpo’s credibility as a speaker.
As any speaker knows, being familiar with one’s audience is essential. Scarpo seemed to have missed that memo. He was unfamiliar with what the Carnegie Mellon community, or its Greek community, is like. We have a greater variety of demographics and personalities than many other schools Scarpo has visited. 
But even though our community has a large number of ethnicities, nationalities, and religions that make us accepting of and ready to defend diversity; the skits and quips Scarpo used portrayed stereotypes that do not apply to Carnegie Mellon, and should not be applied to any university.
The Greek community did not sweep Scarpo’s speech under the rug, however. Immediately after the speech and during the following days, students gave an outpouring of criticism and feedback. An open forum was held last Tuesday to continue the conversation and allow students to air out any remaining concerns.
We commend the Greek community for its immediate and responsible reaction to the speech. The feedback and the open forum allowed the members of the community to channel their justifiable outrage into a positive outcome.

In a rare example of Republicans and Democrats agreeing on something, both houses of the Pennsylvania state legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill last week that outlaws motorists from sending or reading text messages while driving.
The bill, SB 314, calls for a $50 fine on any driver caught “using an interactive wireless communication device to send, read, or write a text-based communication while the vehicle is in motion.” This includes text messages, instant messages, and emails — as well as browsing the internet — but the final bill still allows drivers to dial numbers for the purpose of making calls. Police officers are not authorized to confiscate drivers’ phones, but they can pull drivers over for texting as a primary offense.
Voting in both the state House (188–7) and Senate (45–5) was nearly unanimous, as it should have been. Keeping Pennsylvania’s motorists safer may not be as headlining an accomplishment as solving the national debt crisis or getting the economy back on track, but we’re glad to see at least one subject exempt from the endless partisan bickering that has dominated all levels of politics this year. Governor Tom Corbett has indicated he’ll sign the bill into law, but a date for the signing is not set.
We hope the governor gets this sensible piece of legislation taken care of as soon as possible. Tuesday night, a Butler County teenager died in a single-vehicle accident when she drove into a tree, just hours after the texting-ban bill cleared the Senate. Investigators found a cell phone with a half-composed text message at the scene. Thirty-four other states already ban texting while driving; Pennsylvania should not waste any time in becoming the 35th.
Local officials, police officers, and the public at large should follow the state legislature’s example and support the texting ban once it becomes law. Civic leaders must be serious about awareness and enforcement, and motorists must be willing to change their driving habits.
In these days of fragmented politics, we should all capitalize on this uncommon opportunity to get something done for the common good.

“Occupy the Fence Political Discussion” is a Facebook event that you probably didn’t hear about. This is unsurprising, considering nine people were listed as attending, another nine were listed as maybe attending, and 68 didn’t even bother responding. It was supposed to be held last Thursday at 10 p.m., but only Chris Palmer, a junior electrical and computer engineering major and one of the event coordinators, and two of The Tartan’s reporters showed up.
It didn’t help that the event’s description was “come paint the fence and talk about the latest news from the Kardashians” and that KGB had taken the Fence that night to advertise its game of Capture the Flag with Stuff. Poorly advertised and poorly planned, “Occupy the Fence” was an event that was supposed to talk about the politics of Occupy Wall Street, but ended up becoming a joke.
If the event had been well planned and better advertised, a real political discussion could have taken place. This is especially important given the weight of a Carnegie Mellon degree in today’s job market; many students, by the sheer nature of their career paths, will end up as members of the one percent in the not-too-distant future. Many of them already come from families in the one percent themselves. The responsibility that comes with that kind of wealth is no small matter.
It’s time that students start thinking now about the kinds of choices they’ll make when they wield the financial power that so many of their predecessors have abused. That abuse, along with other factors, has led to the situation we’re in today — and it’s up to us to determine how to be more responsible than those who came before us. With the degrees we get here, we will be establishing precedents for the next few decades that will either bring prosperity to this country or will ultimately ruin it.
For that reason, it’s even more depressing to see events like “Occupy the Fence” crashing and burning; after all, that may be one of the few forums we have to chat with our peers about the issues we will someday be involved in. While the university sometimes feels insular when it comes to current events, this is something that is very real for all of us. Instead of taking advantage of Carnegie Mellon’s open and mature atmosphere, though, we’ve only had apathy and silence. Maybe someone bold (and organized) enough can man up and change that.
