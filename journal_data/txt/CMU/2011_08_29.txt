As the volleyball team ends its preseason and the players get ready for the regular season, senior Emily Baddock spoke with The Tartan about her academic life and her team’s upcoming season.
Baddock, an international relations and politics major and French and francophone studies minor, will be starting the Heinz College’s accelerated master’s program this fall, where her focus will be public policy and management.
After completing her master’s degree, Baddock is considering law school as the next step toward her goal of working in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Department of State or a nonprofit focused on international development.
Last spring, Baddock had the opportunity to study at Georgetown University as part of the Washington Semester Program.
In this program, Baddock was able to study international affairs and public diplomacy. During her time in D.C., Baddock also completed an internship with D.C.-based online journalism site The Daily Caller.
“My favorite part of D.C., aside from getting to know a variety of students from all over the country, was definitely the atmosphere of D.C. The available resources in the D.C. area are unmatched, and as a politics junkie there was never a shortage of drama and news coming straight out of the Hill,” Baddock said.
Baddock is passionate about Carnegie Mellon volleyball. “I love that I am still getting the chance to play in college, but I also really love the team aspect of the game,” she said. “The team brings together girls from all areas of CMU and each season we grow together and become closer as players and friends.”
As a first-year, Baddock and her team earned a spot in the NCAA’s tournament. The tournament begins in November, and Baddock hopes to have another shot at it this year with the team.
Baddock has witnessed the volleyball team improve tremendously during preseason, and she hopes it continues to grow at the current rate.
“Our team dynamic and chemistry has developed faster than in years past, so I think that we will be able to practice harder and push farther from the very start of the season,” Baddock said.

The time has finally come. After a long summer of drama because of the NFL lockout, we now get ready for America’s favorite sport: football.
It definitely has been an eventful summer, as many people were extremely skeptical about the NFL actually having a season this year, and negotiations were publicly critiqued and analyzed. However, earlier this summer, the NFL Players Association including its owners were able to work out a deal just in time for the preseason.
Now, halfway through the preseason, we await opening weekend, which will occur in two weeks.
So, what can we expect from this season? Well, we know which teams will definitely be good, such as the Patriots, Steelers, Jets, Falcons, Packers, and a few other teams that consider themselves elite at this point. But who are the steadily improving teams that we should look out for? Some of the teams I have pinpointed are the Lions, Rams, and Texans.
The Lions, who have been notoriously bad for many seasons, have a young quarterback in Matt Stafford who has shown that he can be a top quarterback in this league, but hasn’t proven he can stay on the field. He only has 13 games under his belt over two seasons, and has already garnered the label of “fragile.” Given the fact that the Lions have potentially the best defensive line in the league, along with one of the best receivers in the league in Calvin Johnson, Stafford can take this team to the next level and get them their first winning season in a while.
The Texans, who have always been a hype team, look to stop that trend once again this year. They bring back a similar team as last year, except with huge improvements on the defensive side.
With Colts quarterback Peyton Manning slowly recovering from a neck injury, you get a division that is up for the taking. I would be surprised if the Texans and Colts are not close in the divisional race at the end of the year.  
One of the huge stories of this NFL offseason was free agency, which was dominated by the Philadelphia Eagles. They dished out over $200 million in contracts this offseason, and some members of the team, such as backup quarterback Vince Young, have referred to the Eagles as a “dream team.”
Personally, I think the Eagles come into the season as a great team, but to refer to them as a dream team is ridiculous.
The Packers are just as good at every level, and are coming off a season where they won the Super Bowl with relative ease.
Not to mention that I would take Aaron Rodgers over Michael Vick any day of the week. Rodgers is more durable, a more accurate passer, and doesn’t bring as much injury risk as a quarterback who is known to run a lot. One thing that many Eagles enthusiasts fail to realize is that teams began to figure out how to defend against Vick at the end of the year. We shall see whether or not the Eagles are able to adjust to this and take the next step for their first Super Bowl ever.
Of course, this couldn’t be a full article without a paragraph on the Steelers. Coming off a Super Bowl appearance and a disappointing loss to the Packers, the Steel Curtain comes back again with a strong team, one that is extremely similar to last year’s.
Obviously, they are going to be a good team, especially with Big Ben at the helm for the whole season instead of 12 games, and they will most likely win the NFC North and enter the playoffs as a No. 2 or 3 seed.
However, their main problem from last year, their secondary, has not been fixed, and I again think this will be the downfall of their Super Bowl hopes. Ike Taylor, who they re-signed to a big deal in the offseason, isn’t a great No. 1 cornerback, and Bryant McFadden isn’t a great No. 2 cornerback. And of course, there is William Gay, who is notoriously bad and is a liability when he is on the field.
Another worry is the status and health of Troy Polamalu, who hasn’t been healthy for a full year for a long, long time. Either way, expect the Steelers to be a force this whole season barring injuries, and they will definitely be in the thick of things come the end of the year.
I cannot even describe how excited I am for the season this year. It should be interesting how the lockout affects the quality of play in the beginning of the season, and also the health of the players. Some teams, like the Giants, have already suffered some major injuries.
This could be a sign of things to come for other players who didn’t take care of their bodies in the offseason. It should be a great year, and I know that football fans are probably just as excited as I am to see the NFL back on the field.

Natural gas extraction from the Marcellus Shale, a giant rock formation that runs through much of the northeastern United States, has been a polarized and highly debated subject during the past few years.
Advocates for extraction argue that it will help create jobs and lessen the country’s dependence on foreign oil, while opponents of extraction articulate their concern over the detrimental effects the extraction processes may have on the environment. Specifically, residents of western Pennsylvania are concerned with the way gas extraction from the Marcellus Shale may affect the quality of drinking water, as well as local air quality. Recently, a team of Carnegie Mellon researchers looked at one aspect of these possible environmental impacts: greenhouse gas emissions.
“The essential tool of this study is the life cycle assessment methodology,” said Mohan Jiang, a Ph.D. student in the department of civil and environmental engineering. The life cycle assessment methodology is a way of quantifying all of the impacts of an entity; in this case, natural gas extracted from the Marcellus Shale, over the course of its entire lifetime.
Greenhouse gases are emitted during almost every step of the process of turning natural gas into energy, from extraction all the way to the burning of the gas to convert it into electricity for consumers. These greenhouse gases, which act as heat absorbers and aid in and warming the Earth, are of major concern for climate.
Jiang explained that in order to look at these greenhouse gas emissions, the life cycle of this natural gas was grouped into two main parts: the extraction of the shale gas from the Marcellus Shale, and the process of converting the gas into electricity. The emissions that were considered for first part of the life cycle, the extraction procedures, were from processes such as trucking water to and from the well site and operation of the drilling and fracturing equipment. The emissions involved in the second part of the life cycle, the conversion of the gas into electricity, were solely from combustion: natural gas is burned to create energy, and this final step is where the bulk of the greenhouse gas emissions were found.
The results of this study, which were recently published in Environmental Research Letters, show that energy derived from Marcellus Shale gas results in 20 to 50 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than energy produced from coal.
“I state clearly that we are only considering the greenhouse gas emissions,” Jiang noted. “There is a lot of water involved in the development of the Marcellus Shale gas, and this may have very bad impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, but just in the sense of greenhouse gas emissions, it is obviously better than coal.”
The study also mentions that extraction of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale is slightly different from extracting natural gas from conventional sources. “We estimate that shale natural gas has slightly higher emissions than conventional gas for production, but the production emissions are typically small compared to combustion emissions,” explained Chris Hendrickson, a professor and co-author of this study in the department of civil and environmental engineering, in a press release. The reason for this difference is the fact that the Marcellus Shale is much further underground than conventional natural gas sources, and requires more energy and resources to recover.
As Jiang mentioned, there are many more aspects to the environmental impacts of shale gas extraction to be studied, and she plans to integrate more of these issues into her future research.
“I’m going to look at the life cycle assessment tool application in the water-use impacts assessment,” Jiang said. “I will try to implement the tool in the Marcellus Shale water-use, and then to make our study more comprehensive to take into consideration the water as well.”

In the age of the Internet, consumers are buying nearly everything online, from books to groceries and even prescription medications.
Online pharmacies have become a growing trend in the past few years. Some of these pharmacies order medicine in countries where it is not as expensive and then sell it in countries such as the United States or United Kingdom. A group of Carnegie Mellon researchers has recently found that many of these online pharmacies are unauthorized and illegal because they do not require a prescription when selling prescription drugs, and that much of the time the users are unaware of the pharmacy’s lack of legitimacy.
These online stores often have to resort to unsavory methods to promote their wares. Most Internet users have already experienced one form of these methods: e-mail spam. However, e-mail spam is unsolicited and untargeted, making its success rate very low.
Illegal online pharmacies are using a more targeted approach: manipulating the links to legitimate pharmacies in a way that causes the consumer to be redirected to the illegal pharmacy when clicking on links in search engine results.
In order to get to the top of search engine results, the illegal pharmacies have to use search engine optimization (SEO). According to the Internet marketing service company SEO Marketing World, “black hat SEO” is a term used to describe a large number of unethical methods that result in boosting the search engine rankings of websites in ways that violate the terms of service of the search engine provider.
Hackers and spammers use black hat SEO to increase Internet traffic to their manipulated links. When the user clicks on a relevant-looking link that has been bumped to the top of the search results, the link is then frequently redirected to a different site, such as that of an illegal online pharmacy.
Nicholas Christin, associate director of the Information Networking Institute (INI) at Carnegie Mellon and a senior systems scientist at the INI and CyLab, worked with his colleagues to examine how prevalent this form of search manipulation is in getting users to the websites of illegal online pharmacies.
The study, which was published in the Proceedings of the 20th USENIX Security Symposium, involved gathering the top search web results for 218 drug-related searches from April 2010 to February 2011. It was found that nearly one-third of the search results, from a total of 21,000 results, were infected websites that redirected users to hundreds  of illegal pharmacy websites. According to a press release on www.cmu.edu, “One quarter of the top 10 search results were observed to actively redirect to illicit pharmacies, and another 15 percent of the top results were for sites that no longer redirected but had previously been compromised.”
Christin’s team concluded the study by using estimates of the popularity of drug-related search terms and payment-processing websites used by pharmacies to determine that that search engine manipulation is, in fact, much more efficient than e-mail spam. “To those who aim to reduce unauthorized pharmaceutical sales, more emphasis needs to be made in combating transactions facilitated by Web search,” Christin said in the press release.

A team of Carnegie Mellon researchers led by David Klahr, a professor in the department of psychology, has published a review in Science assessing methods to advance scientific thinking in the minds of young children. The findings raise serious questions about how scientific subjects are traditionally approached in preschool and elementary school curricula.
Klahr and his colleagues looked at a challenge many teachers of young students face at the beginning of each school year: Their students arrive with misconstrued notions of basic scientific principles. For example, a survey from the journal Cognitive Development of 19 first-grade students showed that an overwhelming majority of them thought that the sun revolves around the Earth. Only by the third grade did these beliefs give way to sun-centric views, but even these were still largely error-prone. Klahr and his colleagues cited this finding among others to show that children do not necessarily enter school as empty vessels into which scientific knowledge can be poured, a common belief that has shaped early schooling curricula until recently.
Even as teachers work to correct misconceptions that young individuals bring into the classroom, another challenge emerges: How does an educator foster scientific curiosity in the minds of his or her students?
The researchers’ review highlighted a conflict in the current approaches to early science schooling. Educators on one side argue for a more hands-off methodology. They claim that preschoolers go through a natural flow in scientific cognitive development — a flow that should not be interrupted by explicit teaching. Another approach stresses exactly the opposite philosophy — that, essentially, early intervention via direct instruction can help children develop a rudimentary understanding of the complex concepts involved in scientific reasoning.
There does seem to be some merit to the direct approach. In one of their experiments, Klahr and his colleagues created three different classifications of learning labeled “discovery learning,” “Socratic instruction,” and “direct instruction.” These approaches were then executed in actual classrooms. During  discovery learning, students designed, conducted, and assessed their own experiments on a topic with no assistance from the teacher at all. Socratic instruction was similar, but the teacher offered probe questions to help steer students in the right direction. Direct instruction involved the teacher designing, conducting, and explaining the experiment while students observed. Direct instruction proved the most effective for immediate, short-term, and long-term retention of the relevant scientific concepts among the young students involved. Other researchers have also reproduced similar results. These findings directly contradict the popular belief that early learners in preschool and kindergarten need a more hands-on experience, similar to “discovery learning,” to learn better.
Klahr, who has been studying children’s scientific thinking processes for the past 30 years, pursues this research in the hope that better identifying the right methods to teach science at an early age can translate into better scientific performance in a child’s later years.
“It is clear that we need to find more effective ways to teach science, as indicated by all of the international comparisons between our students and those in other countries,” Klahr said during an interview.
The Science review points to a recent Programme for International Student Achievement assessment that compared the academic performance of 15-year-old students from each of the developed nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). This assessment discovered that, from the 30 OECD nations, the United States ranked 21st in scientific literacy and 25th in mathematics literacy.
If a solid connection between preschool scientific performance and high school scientific performance is made, Klahr and his colleagues’ research could help substantially in improving this situation.
But even Klahr acknowledges that there is still a lot of work to do in quantifying preschool scientific performance.
“The challenge is to come up with a clear definition of what curiosity is, and a way to measure it that is consistent with the definition,” he said. “This is important because most preschool programs aim to increase children’s scientific curiosity, but no good measures of the success of those efforts have been available.”
The authors of the review do acknowledge, however, the progress that has been made in the field in recent years, and conclude their study by saying, “All of this bodes well for the future of this field and suggests that we will continue to see substantial progress toward solving many of the challenging issues surrounding effective science education for our children.”

Statistics released for social networks
The number of American adults using social networking sites has risen from 5 to 50 percent in the past six years, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. The same study also found that 89 percent of adults aged 18–29 are users, and they are twice as likely to integrate the habit into their daily routine. Although such forms of communication are becoming widespread, the same study found signs of a slowdown; one in five participants described their usage as “boring” or “time-consuming.”

New evidence of archaic humans
A group of human fossils belonging to what researchers dub “Denisovans” were recently discovered in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. After the discovery, several top anthropologists gathered at the archeological site to determine what information the discovery yielded about the ancient world. Researchers believe the Denisovans inhabited Earth around 30,000 to 50,000 years ago and may have contributed immune  system cells that are still present in modern humans.

Hurricane Irene hits East Coast
Hurricane Irene, a Category 1 storm at landfall, struck the East Coast Saturday, causing millions to evacuate their homes. Irene made landfall with 90-m.p.h. winds in North Carolina and continued up through New England Sunday. New York City declared mandatory evacuations for areas near the water including Battery Park. Governors of seven Mid-Atlantic and New England states, along with District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Grey, have declared states of emergency and urged citizens to evacuate.

Virginia hit by earthquake
A 5.8-magnitude earthquake centered in Virginia sent waves of shock across most of the eastern seaboard last Tuesday. This was the strongest quake in 67 years for the East Coast. Most of the damage was only superficial, but the natural disaster shut down Washington, D.C. and many businesses for the day. The epicenter was about 87 miles south of Washington, but aftershocks spooked residents as far as Jacksonville, Fla.

Botox approved to aid bladder control
Botulinum toxin, or Botox, has just been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat urinary incontinence. Researchers found that injections of Botox allowed patients with neurological conditions to have more bladder control. Since its approval in 2002, Botox has also been cleared to treat six other health maladies, including migraines and sweating. Overall, sales for Botox treatments in 2010 reached $1.5 billion.

Pittsburgh is probably best known as a “steel city” with top-notch sports teams. Gawker.com recently lauded Pittsburgh as the “true unheralded urban gem of Pennsylvania,” and noted the important Pittsburgh tradition of putting french fries on sandwiches. But beneath the steel, sports, and sandwiches, Pittsburgh provides a thriving arts community that holds nearly every artistic medium one could want, from opera to experimental dance and everything in between. Operating on a college student budget, though, can make it difficult to indulge in concert tickets and theater performances. Luckily, Pittsburgh abounds with plenty of low-cost — or even free — ways to enjoy its cultural side.
Music
Pittsburgh plays host to plenty of big-name artists thanks to concerts at the Consol Energy Center, but those tickets can easily cost upwards of $50. Why spend so much money on one concert when there are plenty of cheap or free concerts happening, often right on campus? Thanks to the AB Coffeehouse, Underground, and Skibo committees, there are always plenty of concerts on campus throughout the school year. The first on-campus concert of the semester will take place this Sunday in Rangos Hall, with Javelin and Hood Internet, two production duos that specialize in mash-ups of hip-hop and indie rock tracks. Best of all, this concert is free to Carnegie Mellon students.
For those more interested in classical music than classic rock, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra offers discounted student rush tickets for to those who show up two hours before the start of the concert. You can also get a student subscription, which allows you to choose to attend either seven, 14, or 21 of the PSO’s performances for the mere cost of $12 per concert. You don’t have to travel downtown, though, for high-quality symphonic performances. The Carnegie Mellon School of Music has a plethora of orchestral groups to choose from, including the Philharmonic, Symphony Orchestra, Baroque Ensemble, Wind Ensemble, and choirs, all of which have cheap or free concerts throughout the year. The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic’s first concert of the year will be Wednesday, Sept. 21, at 8 p.m. in the Carnegie Music Hall, so you can stroll through the music hall’s marble foyer feeling like a million bucks without having paid a cent.
Art
Most Carnegie Mellon students are aware that their student IDs grant them free access to any of the Carnegie museums, including the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Andy Warhol Museum. What they might not realize, however, is how many other free art opportunities there are throughout Pittsburgh.
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust hosts the Gallery Crawl — “a free quarterly showcase of art and entertainment in the heart of the Cultural District,” as the Pittsburgh Cultural District’s website explains it. Patrons can meander from location to location throughout the Cultural District, enjoying free admission to multiple galleries, theaters, and exhibitions. Free art, films, and dance lessons aren’t the only incentive to attend, though — there’s also free food. At the last Gallery Crawl in July, First Commonwealth Bank gave away free snow cones, and Le Cordon Bleu Institute of Culinary Arts had “edible art creations” available for a donation. Gather up a group of friends and go explore at the next Gallery Crawl on Sept. 30.
If art and free food sounds like a winning combination, keep an eye on the events calendar of the Andy Warhol Museum. The museum often hosts special events and receptions in the evenings that are included with admission — which, for Carnegie Mellon students, is free — and aren’t necessarily limited to visual art. For instance, this Friday, the Warhol is presenting “Undressing the Body,” a poetry reading that will also include a South Asian-inspired reception and a Bollywood and bhangra dance party.
While the Andy Warhol Museum and the Carnegie Museum of Art may be the art museums most familiar to Carnegie Mellon students, there are other art museums in the city with plenty of opportunities for students. The Mattress Factory, contrary to what its name might suggest, is in fact a contemporary art museum tucked away in the North Side. Admission is free for students, and while the 40-minute trek by bus may discourage some, the innovative installation art and quirky atmosphere make it well worth the trip.
The Frick Art & Historical Center, located in Point Breeze, has free entrance to its art museum and its Car and Carriage Museum. The Frick also occasionally hosts free events, although most of these events occur during the summer; the last event in its First Fridays at the Frick series, a summertime outdoor concert series, will take place this Friday when the Frick’s lawn will play host to a free concert by the St. Petersburg String Quartet.
For those who don’t want to leave campus, The Frame Gallery, located on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street, showcases student artwork in various exhibits throughout the school year. The Miller Gallery, meanwhile, has had its exhibitions reviewed in publications such as Art in America and Artforum. Although currently closed, the Miller Gallery will open on Sept. 16 with its branch of the 2011 Pittsburgh Biennial, a city-wide art exhibit featuring local artists.
Theater
There may be plenty of theaters downtown, but if you’re on a tight budget, there’s no need to leave campus for high-quality theater performances. The School of Drama will put on six performances this year, three each semester, all of which have $10 tickets for students. This year’s season includes the classic Tony Award-winning musical Sweeney Todd and Suddenly Last Summer, a one-act play by Tennessee Williams.
If you have a passion for Shakespeare, or merely enjoy seeing free outdoor theater performances, consider going to see The Merry Wives of Windsor, presented by Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks. The performances take place every Saturday and Sunday in September at 2 p.m. at a different city park each weekend; check out Shakespeare in the Parks’ website, www.pittsburghshakespeare.com, to see which location the group will be performing at each weekend. The organization also hosts an informal “Bring Your Own Bard” reading series at Té Café in Squirrel Hill, usually on the last Thursday of the month, at which amateurs and professional actors alike may read their favorite Shakespearean monologues or scenes that revolve around a particular theme for each reading.
Movies
This summer, Pittsburgh’s Citiparks hosted Cinema in the Park, where movies were shown outdoors in various parks around Pittsburgh, including Schenley Park. Unfortunately, this series is coming to a close this week, but you can still see Clash of The Titans for free this Wednesday on Flagstaff Hill. AB Films is, by far, the cheapest movie option for students — it shows four films a weekend, each for only a dollar for students with their IDs. If you wish to venture off campus, Pittsburgh Filmmakers operates three movie theaters in Pittsburgh that “feature alternatives to the multiplex,” as the organization’s website explains. Foreign films, local films, indie films, and American classics all get the chance to shine through Pittsburgh Filmmakers, which offers Carnegie Mellon students the discounted ticket price of $4.
This list, of course, is merely the tip of the iceberg of inexpensive opportunities abounding in Pittsburgh for students. If you take a chance and poke around below Pittsburgh’s sports-obsessed surface, you’ll find a city teeming with culture and an appreciation for the arts.

It’s no secret that art is a product of both the artist’s expression and the tools and materials used. A song played on a guitar will be different from the same song played on a piano, and a pencil will encourage different types of art than a brush will. The question is: How exactly do these tools affect the art, and how or why does an artist use a particular tool? Today, as technology tools — including Photoshop, Tumblr, and C++ — are being introduced, updated, and distributed very rapidly, these questions become more relevant than ever, particularly at a school like Carnegie Mellon where the line between technology and art is often blurred.
These types of questions piqued the interest of artist Cory Arcangel in New York, and much of his art explores the relationship between the tools, the artist, and sometimes even the viewers. Arcangel has been called one of today’s hottest art stars, and he is the youngest person ever to have a one-man show at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
In a phone interview, The Tartan learned a little bit more about his creative process.
The Tartan: I understand that you were initially a music major at Oberlin. Can you tell me about that experience?
Cory Arcangel: I went to the conservatory there to get a degree in classical guitar, and I ended up switching my degree a couple years in to a degree in technology in music and the related arts. A conservatory is a very special experience. It’s almost like class-based. You take music history, you take music theory, you take listening skills. I remember it being very challenging and quite difficult. But at the same time, I learned a lot.
TT: A lot of your music training has influenced your art. I really enjoyed your “Arnold Schoenberg’s Opus 11” piece played by cats.
CA: That’s a perfect example of me coming back around to a lot of stuff I was taught in the conservatory and re-evaluating it and working with it. That piece is basically an accurate realization of the score. With the cats, I had found a way to approach that music with my current interests while still respecting the original composer.
TT: Are you interested in cats or Web memes?
CA: I’m interested in cats and cat videos, but I’m more interested [in] what are the types of videos that a media system like the Internet encourages. When you get something like YouTube that allows hundreds of millions of people to upload videos, what videos come to the forefront? I’m interested in all types of videos that fit under that inquiry, but especially cats, since cats have been around in media for a long time. One of Edison’s first films was of two cats boxing.
And there’s also the joke in the piece that a cat walking across a piano sounds like modern music. In several of the YouTube comments for videos of cats walking across pianos, you will see people joking about how it sounds like modern music. There are many different kinds of jokes in that piece.
TT: Most people use old technologies to create something new, but in this, your [“Paganini’s Fifth Caprice”], and [your interpretation of the] Bach Goldberg Variations, you’re using new technologies to create something old.
CA: In specific to those three pieces, [the video] is a legitimate expression of the score. Those pieces are still being played, and it’s just that this type of way of doing it was not available hundreds of years ago. I’m still not doing anything against the grain of what the score is.
But I do like applying technology to older stuff, and especially with Schoenberg, I wondered if I had the cats playing Schoenberg, would the cuteness help draw people into music which is for most people inaccessible. It’s very difficult music for most people to hear, because they are used to listening to music on the radio or modern pop music.
TT: Why do you think you tend to gravitate towards older and obsolete technologies?
CA: Actually, I feel like earlier on in my work, I gravitated towards older stuff, but now I play 50–50. I either will use something very old or something very new. So for example, in the Whitney show, there are these huge Photoshop gradients. These are huge kind of C-print photographs, but the imagery isn’t from a camera. It’s from default gradient patterns built into the program Photoshop, and those pictures are printed absolutely as hi-tech as possible. The work gathers its strength from the fact that it’s the most technologically advanced [application] available to photographers today.
But at the same time, I will just find some old computer or whatever and make something out of it. It’s just an interest of mine, the kind of cycle of fashion and obsolescence tied to technology and culture. I can’t explain it, but it’s interesting to me to see things go in and out of fashion or in and out of youth.
TT: In another interview, you talked about how the aesthetics of software could affect the relationship between the user and the tools. Do you think that interactive design software like Autodesk or the Unity game engine skew the art people create with that software?
CA: Well, I don’t have any experience with Autodesk or the Unity gaming engine, so I can’t speak toward those particular software packages, but I think I have two interests in software. The main interest is how people use software or technology, and web design is a great example. I’ve had a long-standing interest in folk web design and folk web design elements, like animated gifs and stuff that came out of the early Web because the tools were [used] a specific way.
The other interest is how artists use those tools, but I’m not sure my work, or at least anymore, is such a conscious comment on how artists are using tools, but more a comment on how these tools are used by people in everyday life, and how this can be reflected by fine art. Each tool has its own properties and its own plusses and minuses. That situation is of interest to me. All these new tools are coming along, and people are responding to them, and that’s the type of thing that I love.
TT: You have this sort of ephemeral view on technology, so what motivated you to teach yourself how to program?
CA: I think it was a true fascination with technology. It wasn’t for fine art or to make some grand point. When I was a junior in college and the dot-com boom was happening, all these new amazing websites were coming up. I was just so fascinated by it that I had to learn how to program for it. I remember FTPing for the first time, and just the idea that you could put a file on another computer somewhere else and make it publicly available was fascinating. After that I wanted to learn “When you pull down a webform, how does that work?” and “When you hit the submit button, where does the information go?” I was just so fascinated by it all that I had to learn it.
TT: What got you into sculpture, such as “Dancing Stands”?
CA: I wanted to do a show where I didn’t turn off the lights. My shows up until a year or two ago were all video based, and when you do a video show, you have to negotiate with the gallery about whether they can cover up the windows and whether the light is dark enough. I thought I would love to do a show where I don’t need to do a drastic architectural rethinking of the space.
TT: How have you changed over the years?
CA: You change by trying things and getting bored of things. I’ve learned not to say anything ever concretely. Like, this is the way you should or that is the way you should do it. I’ve learned that everything is malleable, and that fashions and trends change. There is no right or wrong, really.

You can put down Catherine now; the indie game of the year has arrived. I promise. 
Amid a sea of unoriginal 2-D action titles released over the last year or so, Bastion manages to distinguish itself nicely. A new XBLA and PC title developed by the independent studio Supergiant Games and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Bastion combines the smooth-as-butter, dungeon-crawler play style of Diablo and Torchlight with lusciously detailed artwork and a compellingly minimal story told in bits and pieces. After an apocalyptic “calamity” destroys the world in Bastion’s backstory, the main character, known only as “the Kid,” must rebuild his home town piece by piece. It is a romantic game, part end-of-the-world story, part fairytale, and part adrenaline-pumping thriller. Not sold yet? The clincher: Your entire game experience is personally narrated by a war-weary version of Morgan Freeman.
Bastion’s unique dynamic narration system is what makes it truly shine; from the first scene in the game through every level, each moment — whether the player is changing weapons, falling off the edge of the world, or drinking the last healing potion — is elaborated upon in exquisite detail by an omniscient narrator (later revealed to be tough-guy character Rucks, voiced by Logan Cunningham). Rucks also delivers much of the backstory as if told by a dear old friend: “There’s three things I always miss, though. One — not having to watch my step all the time. Two — ah, forget about two. And three — I miss the songs. Folks from Caelondia knew how to carry a tune.... Those were the days.”
The narration changes over time, too, eventually going on to remark about the player’s personal style of combat and choice of paths within each level. Rather than distracting from the gameplay or becoming repetitive, Cunningham’s narration converts Bastion into a whole new animal. Rather than a passive auditory experience, it becomes an interactive storybook — a playable novel; the player creates the story as much as he or she also observes it.
The gameplay admittedly is the weakest part of Bastion. The game itself is short, barely four or five hours’ worth of play without completing the available side quests and optional “Proving Grounds” levels. With a total running length shorter than even Portal, players might well be wary of purchasing; then again, for $14.99 on Steam, it’s not a bad bargain. For a total of $9.99 extra, players can also get their hands on the official soundtrack. With everything from backwater bluegrass to melancholic violin pieces to lullabies, it’s composition work that, one could argue, rivals the work of Nobuo Uematsu, of Final Fantasy fame.
Actual play, on the other hand, is nothing players haven’t seen before. The Kid is outfitted with multiple weapons (up to two at a time) which can be fired or used with a single click. Enemies attack in small scripted formations and clumps, and each level revolves around balancing available health potion refills against onslaughts of tricky enemies, all the while attempting to collect key items within the level.
There is one new trick in the bag, though: The base-building aspect of Bastion lends itself to player creativity. Players are given the choice of building different venues within their bastions, and no two bastions are built the same way. As players also gather new pets and NPCs to their bastion, a new town slowly begins to come together.
Ultimately, Bastion’s success can be attributed to a solid combination of nicely polished mechanics and a brief, almost Braid-like narrative that begs thoughtfulness and introspection on the part of the player. More than that, it’s a novel concept — fresh in a way that precious few games attempt to be in today’s Metacritic-formula-driven market. And with any luck, this is just the first in a legacy of great titles from Supergiant Games.

If you were looking for a fantastic adventure flick to tune in to this summer, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is definitely a movie to see — especially if you are an adamant fan of the amusing, idiosyncratic character Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp.
This fourth installment to the series was directed by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Rob Marshall and focuses on a darker plot than the previous films, all of which were directed by Gore Verbinski. It includes new, mysterious characters but still attempts to retain the witty dialogue, reckless mischief, and the chain of escapades and thrilling encounters that are essential to the series. These elements combined to create an enjoyable new addition to the hit movie franchise.
Instead of merely branching off from the story that the third Pirates movie left behind, this movie begins with the focus solely on Jack, allowing viewers to follow the swashbuckling, diversions, and mischief that seems to always follow him. The film is centered around Jack’s newest objective: finding the folkloric Fountain of Youth. The central conflict is that he is not the only one thirsty for the enchanted water: The ruthless pirate captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his entire crew are Sparrow’s main rivals, joined by Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz), Jack’s apparent former love interest. Naturally there are a number of tense encounters and conflicts between the two groups as well as external complications, such as attacks from a barrage of vicious, siren-like mermaids.
It is understandable that many people feel skeptical about the quality of this fourth film — sequels rarely reach the greatness of the original movie. In addition, the production had to deal with the significant loss of a number of key characters and the elements they brought to the films including the romance between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, the terror and complexity of Davy Jones’ background story, and the pirate lore that shaped the storylines for the second and third films.
Although it is clear that an attempt was made to replace these elements that intrigued viewers, the absence was still very much noticeable. The love/hate relationship between Jack and Angelica is not nearly as passionate and engaging as the love story between Will and Elizabeth, or even Davy Jones’ empathetic story.
Overall, the film seemed to fulfill its purpose of thrilling and entertaining the audience. Of course, the contents of this movie include astoundingly choreographed fight scenes and Jack Sparrow’s elaborate escapes. The gorgeous score by Hans Zimmer embody and uplift the film, and the enthusiasm of the actors permeated through their enthralling performances.
Although it is hard to compete with the old storyline in terms of really captivating the audience, this film is just as audacious as the others, and it is a very satisfactory continuation of Jack Sparrow’s adventures.

For a lot of girls (and guys), retail therapy is the best kind of therapy. Recently, however, more and more shopaholics are becoming environmentally conscious and are trying to add a green touch to their wardrobe. Designers are catching on to this trend, which is not only proving to be a profitable corner of the market, but is also good for the planet.
Sustainable fashion, or eco fashion, follows the design philosophy that a product should be created, produced, and distributed with the lowest possible impact on the environment. This includes practices like making the product out of biodegradable materials and lowering the carbon footprint of manufacturing the product. To apply this mindset to your next shopping spree, try to buy clothes made from natural fibers like organic cotton, bamboo fiber, wool, hemp, or silk, and check the tag to see if it’s made in the United States. Buying things that are made in the United States is an easy way of being more environmentally friendly since it eliminates the large carbon footprint created by shipping products from overseas.
The problem with sustainable fashion is that stylish eco-friendly clothes are usually not very wallet-friendly, and many eco-friendly options leave you looking like a cross between a third grader’s craft project and someone on their way to a Phish concert. And you definitely don’t want to end up being the crazy tree hugger who has a shirt made out of toilet paper and a vest made from old cigarette butts — you can look them up, they’re both unfortunately real.
Don’t worry, though. With some time and creativity, you can avoid both extremes and add some fashionable yet economical and sustainable clothes to your wardrobe. A good place to start is a thrift store, a garage sale, or even your own closet. Get some old clothes made from natural fibers, some scissors, and a sewing machine, and you can upcycle an old T-shirt into a miniskirt or an oversized floral nightgown into a summer dress. If you’re not very skilled with a sewing machine (or you can’t bear to keep that hideous hat you bought on a misguided whim), just donate your old clothes and restock your closet with newer, more eco-friendly ones.
Shopping green doesn’t only have to apply to your clothes; it can also apply to your beauty products. Makeup, shampoos, and cleansers with harmful artificial materials are not only bad for the environment, they’re bad for you, too. Try switching up your routine by trying out natural beauty brands like Burt’s Bees, Origins, or Aveda. Or, if you’re not too keen on shelling out $20 for 4.2 ounces of organic hand cream, why not fall back on classic DIY beauty products that won’t cost you a cent? Honey and avocado will give you a refreshing face mask, coconut oil can deeply condition your hair, and if you mix together a cup of brown sugar, raw oatmeal, and olive oil, you’ve got yourself an exfoliating scrub.
So, if you’re a fashion-lover-recently-turned-environmentalist, don’t think that you have to completely wipe out your entire wardrobe and start over. If you start being more environmentally conscious in your shopping and encourage your friends to do the same, you will make a difference. After all, being green is always in style.

This past school year, when making plans for the summer, I decided that if there ever were a time to travel and study abroad, it would be the summer of 2011. I looked at several study abroad programs and sought out advice from Carnegie Mellon’s Study Abroad Office, but ended up applying to and choosing a program that I stumbled upon while browsing the Internet. On July 6, I left from Boston Logan Airport on an overnight flight, arriving in London some seven hours later. 
I chose Michigan State University’s Reporting in the British Isles program because it was not only a program that traveled to a variety of locations, but it also focused on a subject of study particularly relevant to my own field of study here at Carnegie Mellon. As a group of nine selected students from all over the United States, we traveled to London, Oxford, Dublin, Belfast, Glasgow, St. Andrews, and Edinburgh. We met and interacted with staff and representatives from various newspapers, publishing houses, and media outlets, while writing daily for our own travel blog.
Although my time abroad was very work intensive, we still got to enjoy the sights. We did all the typical touristy activities: We rode in an open-air London tour bus, toured the Olympic site, explored the Guinness factory in Dublin, went on a witchery tour in Edinburgh, and took pictures on the 18th hole bridge at the St. Andrews main course. We also did a few things that most tourists do not get to do, like meeting and interviewing the Lord Mayor of Belfast. (The perks of being a journalist!)
It turned out that we were in the British Isles at one of the most interesting times for international media and newsrooms. When visiting the offices of The Guardian, the BBC, Vogue, The Irish Independent, Caspian Publishing House, and more, we learned more and more about the News of the World scandal as it developed.  
Soon, the front pages of newspapers and tabloids all over the United Kingdom were brimming with news of the fall of a fellow publication: After 168 years of print, England’s most widely read and distributed newspaper, the News of the World, had printed its final issue. What would appear to be an unfortunate development for journalists and publications, given the recent decline of readership and close of several newspapers, instead brought the industry into the limelight; headlines discussed nothing else. “We’re in a unique situation right now,” said Duncan Hammond, a commercial representative for The Guardian during an interview on July 8. “Currently, the media is all about media.”
The controversy, now commonly referred to as the “Murdoch phone hacking scandal” by the English and international media, began back in 2006 when Clive Goodman, a former royal editor and reporter for the News of the World, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired by the tabloid to intercept phone messages, were accused of hacking voicemail messages of members of the royal family. Since this initial incident, several journalists and staff members associated with the News of the World have been accused of illegally hacking the phones of celebrities and politicians and using acquired voicemails to build stories and scandals.
After years of development, it just so happened that the Murdoch scandal was unfolding right before our eyes, and this group of young journalists could not ask for more to write about. We hit the streets of London and Dublin, interviewing local residents, CEOs, and employees in the local news and publishing industries, and filming and writing reports on protests outside the offices of News International Ltd. on the News of the World’s final Sunday printing date.
It was an incredible opportunity to be an American journalist witnessing firsthand the public reaction toward the scandal. On July 10, I was there tweeting live as a group of around 20 protesters burnt copies of News of the World near the door of News International Ltd. and waved signs with the words “BREAK UP THE MURDOCH EMPIRE” as boss Rupert Murdoch arrived on scene. 
Soon enough, the opportunity of being on location during breaking international news turned my study abroad experience from one of learning into one of doing; my report on the July 10 protests, my various interviews with local residents and employees from The Guardian and The Irish Independent, and my analysis on the effect that the close of the most highly circulated newspaper in the UK would have on the industry resulted in three published articles back in the United States. 
While touring England, Ireland, and Scotland was in itself an incredible experience, I was so thrilled that I was able to return from studying abroad having seen the sights, learned too much, and gained professional experience in journalism that I never dreamed I would.

On Aug. 30 Hella will release its fifth full album, Tripper, marking their first time officially releasing music as a group in four years. Hella’s core members, gutiarist Spencer Seim and Zach Hill, have been anything but reclusive, though. Seim has released solo material as “sBach”, while Hill has worked with musicians such as Joan of Arc and Bygones, and has even released some of his own solo material.
Looking at Tripper solely as a Hella album, there is nothing fantastic about it. Hella is known for playing very complex compositions incredibly fast. It changes time signatures at will, abruptly stop whenever it feels like it, and sometimes ditch a groove right in the middle and jump headfirst into something completely different. On this release it lives up to that reputation in full. Each song sounds like it’s on the verge of collapsing at any moment. Hill’s drumming and Seim’s guitarwork interweave totally, resulting in a chaotic, cluttered maelstrom of sounds that conceals a logical underlying theme. Sometimes Hella might sound like it has no idea what it’s doing, but in reality it is obsessively attentive to every detail.
What’s interesting about Tripper, though, is that it is the follow-up to There’s No 666 in Outer Space. That album marked the first, and only, time that Hella would feature Aaron Ross (vocals), Josh Hill (guitar), and Carson McWhirter (bass, keyboards). The result sounded more prog rock than math rock, with the intricacy of the compositions scaled back to accommodate Ross’s wailing. In all, There’s No 666 could’ve been released by the Mars Volta. Tripper did away with all of this. Ross, Hill, and McWriter are nowhere to be found and all of the songs are instrumental. But this wasn’t some misguided attempt to assuage fans and critics who were less than impressed with the pretensions of the group’s previous album. In fact, when Spin, a music magazine, trashed There’s no 666, Hella printed Spin’s review on a shirt and sold it in their merch store. The transition into Tripper is a testament to a band that plays whatever music strikes them at the moment and is uncompromising in its musicianship.

Dear Patrick,
Orientation was so fun! There’s just one problem — my OC won’t go away. He keeps coming to our all-girls floor to “hang out” even though no one really wants to talk to him. He was cool during Orientation, but he’s a borderline stalker now. How can I get him to stop creeping?
Thanks,
Hill 4 Lyfe <3 <3 <3
Dear — No, I’m not typing that,
You’ve just discovered the real reason guys become OCs — to hit on first-year girls. The reason he was cool during Orientation is that he was not allowed to hit on you. Now that Orientation’s over, all bets are off.
Since you’re at Carnegie Mellon, you’re going to need to learn really quickly how to get rid of creepy guys. They’re everywhere. First, he’ll start off acting like your friend. This is a trick. Do you notice him breathing heavier when he gets close to you? Red flag. At this stage, being rude will probably get rid of him. If that doesn’t work, he’ll move on to phase two. He’ll “accidentally” bump into you around campus and stare at you. A lot. You can either wait for him to ask you out (and then turn him down), or get a boyfriend. If all else fails, you or a guy friend can give him a talking-to, making it very clear you want him to leave you alone.
Or just try a restraining order,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I just got out of a serious relationship. I’m a little shaken up about it. My girlfriend and I parted on good terms, but I’m just not sure what to do now. Should I start dating? Should I just go after floozies? With the new school year, there are a lot of choices on the horizon; I’m just not sure which ones to make.
Sincerely,
Single, Only Sad
Dear SOS,
Here’s what you should do: Go home and have a drink. Maybe one more. Feeling good now? Put that beer down. Drinking’s not the answer. You can’t drown your problems, man. Okay, you’re a little buzzed now, and you probably want to cry into your pillow for half an hour. Go ahead, take your time. Okay, ready? Now, here’s the plan: We’re gonna go out, talk to some people, and relax. Don’t talk about your ex-girlfriend, and talk to some girls.
Now, what’d we learn? Take some time to relax and get over your ex. You sound like you aren’t even ready to be picking up some floozies. Take your time, have some fun, and get out of your head. The world is your oyster. Just don’t show up at your ex’s house drunk and crying.
Unless she’s into that sort of thing,
Patrick Hoskins

100 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 28, 1911
The sophomore class defeated the first-years in the annual “class contest.” Events included wrestling matches, a relay race, tug-of-war, an “Indian ball event,” and a “push ball contest.” Just try explaining the events at House Wars in another 100 years.
50 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 20, 1961
Among many other summer changes to the Carnegie Tech campus, The Tartan reports on the construction of a new women’s dorm on Forbes Street (today’s Morewood E Tower), the extension of the CFA Lawn (the planned site of all future graduations), and the planting of the garden adjacent to the new Hunt Library.
25 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 10, 1986
“Every place must have its downfalls,” opines a Tartan staffwriter, using Hamerschlag House as a case in point for Carnegie Mellon. According to the author, ’Schlag’s cinder-block walls, angular rooms, and ambient smells earn it the title of “the armpit of the school.” On the bright side, “If it wasn’t for armpits, where would you put your deodorant?”
10 YEARS AGO -- Aug. 27, 2001
The outlook for the 2001 Tartan football team is “generally optimistic,” following a rebuilding period with a host of new starters the year before. Still, the previous year’s 6–4 record, though Carnegie Mellon’s worst since 1988, is nothing to sneeze at.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- Aug. 28, 2006
Researchers in the Robotics Institute unveil Ballbot, a mobile robot that gets around by balancing on a sphere instead of using legs or wheels. Though novel, the creation — lacking a head, arms, and sufficient motors — was not yet ready to “serve a particular purpose to the public.” We still haven’t seen Ballbot at the circus, either.
ONE YEAR AGO -- Aug. 23, 2010
A News article describes Dozen Bake Shop’s move from Squirrel Hill to Craig Street, a more central location for the cupcakery’s student-heavy customer base. Not heavy enough, apparently: The last two Dozen locations closed in July.

Win Win
8 10 12
In Win Win, stressed-out attorney Mike Flaherty (Paul Giametti), who works part-time as an unsuccessful high school wrestling coach, inadvertently ends up housing a runaway named Kyle (Jeffrey Tambor). When Kyle turns out to be a wrestling star, things finally start to look up for Mike — that is, until Kyle’s mom shows up, fresh out of rehab, and threatens to ruin everything. Win Win has been received well by critics, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone calling it a “gem, hilarious and heartfelt with a tough core.”
Limitless
8 10 12
This 2011 thriller follows Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a recently dumped, struggling writer whose fortunes change when he runs into his ex-wife’s brother, who gives him a drug that allows him to access all of his brain’s potential, rather than the usual 20 percent that humans use, as the brother claimed. Suddenly, Eddie can write an entire book in a day, become immediately fluent in other languages, and make a killing on the stock market. As his fortunes increase, however, so does the danger — soon, he finds himself fighting for his life.
Rashomon

A priest, a woodcutter, and a common man take refuge from a rainstorm in an old gatehouse in this Japanese crime mystery film from 1950. The priest and a woodcutter begin to share their experiences with the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife. The film, which was directed by Akira Kurosawa, was nominated for multiple awards around the world, including an Academy Award for Best Art Direction and a BAFTA Film Award for Best Film.
Full Metal Jacket
7:30 10 12:30
This classic Stanley Kubrick film looks at the effect that war and the military mindset could have on soldiers during the Vietnam War. The first half of the film follows a group of Marine recruits in basic training under the command of the cold Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey); the second half follows one of the recruits, Joker (Matthew Modine), as he covers the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Fun Fact: R. Lee Ermey was actually a U.S. Marine drill instructor during the Vietnam War and ad-libbed most of his dialogue in the film.

After several days of behind-the-scenes preparation, Carnegie Mellon announced a full day of celebratory events on Wednesday, Sept. 7. The university is celebrating a record $265 million gift from Trustee William S. Dietrich II. The Tartan will be following events, so check this page for updates throughout the day.
University leaders announce Dietrich's gift.
4 a.m.: The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Carnegie Mellon has received a $265 million gift from former steel executive and current Trustee William S. Dietrich II. The gift is the largest in Carnegie Mellon's history, exceeding David Tepper's $55 million gift in 2004. According to university calculations reported in the article, it is the eighth-largest gift to a private institution in the United States. In honor of the donation, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences will be renamed after Dietrich's mother, Marianna Brown Dietrich, to become the Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The Post-Gazette's full coverage is available at http://www.postgazette.com/pg/11250/1172681-455-0.stm.
11 a.m.: At a ceremony held on the Cut, Carnegie Mellon leaders announced Dietrich's donation and the potential consequences for the university. Speakers included Ray Lane, chairman of the Carnegie Mellon board of trustees; Jared Cohon, president of the university; Ed Frank, trustee and chairman of the Inspire Innovation capital campaign; and Aaron Gross, a master's student in information systems. Dietrich also spoke, sharing recollections of his mother and her wholehearted love for her family.
2:30 p.m.: A party was held on the patio of Baker and Porter halls, the home of the newly named Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Faculty, staff, and students all gathered to celebrate the college and its accomplishments. Free refreshments and commemorative blankets were handed out as a live band played. Notable attendees included John Lehoczky, dean of Dietrich College, and Shilo Raube, director of media relations, along with a number of Carnegie Mellon trustees. Lehoczky said he viewed the event and the endowment as a "coming-out party" for the humanities and social sciences, referencing a growing public perception of the college as an elite institution, on the same level as Carnegie Mellon's frequently recognized engineering and arts programs.
8 p.m.: Guster performed at a free concert on the Mall. Hundreds of Carnegie Mellon students attended, as well as some faculty, staff, and surrounding community members. Although the concert was scheduled to occur regardless of weather conditions, no rain interrupted the event. The band played for a little over an hour, interspersing songs with comments about Dietrich's gift and Carnegie Mellon's reputation. At the conclusion of the concert, fireworks were set off behind the stage in the direction of Hamerschlag Hall. The fireworks lasted several minutes, during which Guster played classic songs like "Stand By Me."

President Barack Obama spoke on the morning of Friday, June 24, at Carnegie Mellon’s National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), located in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood.
Obama addressed an excited crowd of about 150 invite-only guests, the majority of whom were chosen by the White House in addition to a select list chosen by Carnegie Mellon. The invitees included students, faculty, university leadership, alumni, and corporate partners. The president announced a new initiative called the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a national effort to unite industry, universities, and the federal government to invest in innovation and technology with the purpose of creating high-tech manufacturing jobs and becoming a more globally competitive nation. According to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, the president’s plan is slated to invest at least $500 million in existing programs and proposals.
Obama introduced his new proposal at a time when national unemployment rates were at 9.1 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. “If we want a robust, growing economy, we need a robust, growing manufacturing sector,” Obama said. “And that’s why we’re here. Carnegie Mellon is a great example of what it means to move forward.... Innovations led by your professors and your students have created more than 300 companies and 9,000 jobs over the past 15 years.”
Bruce Brown, CEO of Proctor and Gamble, attended the president’s address. Brown cited research institutions such as Carnegie Mellon as “part of the United States’ competitive advantage.” He agreed with the president on the importance of advanced manufacturing. “I think advanced manufacturing is really important to a vibrant U.S. economy. It’s also very important to innovation, because we know at P&G that breakthrough consumer innovation relies on advanced manufacturing to produce large quantities of consumer-preferred products consistently and reliably at low costs,” Brown said.
Obama’s visit to Carnegie Mellon was announced June 17 by the White House, leaving university affiliates one week to prepare for his visit. It was his third visit to Carnegie Mellon since 2008 and his second as president. “It seems like every time I’m here, I learn something. So for those of you who are thinking about Carnegie Mellon, it’s a terrific place, and you guys are doing just great work,” Obama said.
Before his televised address, the president toured the NREC facilities with CIT Dean Pradeep Khosla, where he saw demonstrations of Carnegie Mellon’s own cutting-edge engineering and robotics, as well as technology produced by RedZone Robotics, Proctor and Gamble, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Khosla later remarked that he was impressed with the quality of the president’s questions during the tour. According to Khosla, Obama asked specifics about the uses of the technology, job creation potential, and its impact on people’s lives. Regarding the launching of the AMP, Khosla said, “I think that this public-private partnership is the right model of doing business. I think it brings the best from both sides, and that it allows us to work toward a common goal and make progress.”
William “Red” Whittaker, founder and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Field Robotics Center, was pleased with the president’s visit. “Robotics is a growing and going game, and it is really changing the way we live and work. It’s very fulfilling and very satisfying to see today.”
Carnegie Mellon is one of five universities involved with the AMP, along with MIT, the University of Michigan, UC Berkeley, and Georgia Tech. Other AMP members include chief executive officers from manufacturing corporations such as The Dow Chemical Co., Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corp., and Honeywell.

Carnegie Mellon shuttle service operations have been altered for the 2011–12 school year. Additional routes have been added, and several new services have been introduced.
“We had a couple of things we tried to accomplish when we did this,” Lieutenant Joseph Myers of the Carnegie Mellon police said, “and one of the things was to take a load off of the escort system, which was bursting at the seams.”
The escort system takes students who live outside the range of the fixed-route shuttle system to the intersection nearest to their home. According to Myers, ridership of the escort system rose 26 percent last year, and the same percentage the year before.
Last March, the Port Authority announced the elimination of 29 routes and the restriction of 37 others, amounting to a 15 percent reduction of service. Several of the affected routes served the Carnegie Mellon area. Meanwhile, Myers said, students are moving further away from campus. As a result, the escort service has become overburdened.
According to Myers, the Carnegie Mellon police consulted with shuttle drivers and student groups to determine the best way to fix the system.
“We looked at adding one more escort [bus], but we were restricted due to our resources and money situation,” Myers said. Instead, the police worked with drivers and students to determine what the best changes were to make to the shuttle routes.
The largest change to the shuttle service is the addition of a Squirrel Hill route, which runs from 7:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m., five days a week. The Bakery Square, Oakland, and Shadyside routes have also been expanded. The new routes stretch as far as Beechwood Boulevard in Squirrel Hill and Shady Avenue in Shadyside. The combined Oakland/Shadyside route, which runs on weekends and from 11:15 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays, now runs on a 45 minute loop, as does the Squirrel Hill shuttle. The individual Oakland and Shadyside routes, which run from 6:45 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., and then again from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays, continue to run on 30 minute loops.
Carnegie Mellon police have also added several new services to make it easier for students to use the shuttle service. The shuttle and escort service website has been revamped, with maps of the new routes and pages listing the stops on each one. A Twitter account called @AndysBuses now reports up-to-the-minute updates of traffic jams, bus breakdowns, and service changes.
The shuttle service has also collaborated with the creators of Locaccino, a GPS-tracking application, to let students locate shuttles using the application.
“Over the past year, a number of people have been asking if Locaccino could also be used to help them track the [Carnegie Mellon] shuttles,” Norman Sadeh, computer science professor and leader of the Locaccino development team, said in an e-mail. “As it turned out, our timing was perfect as they were just looking for a solution to do this. So over the summer, we went ahead and instrumented to have them report their locations to our servers.”
Students can access Locaccino from either a computer or smartphone, and see exactly where a shuttle is at the moment.
Despite the changes, some students do not feel that the shuttle service meets their needs.
H&SS junior Paul Carboni, who lives in Bloomfield, plans to walk to and from campus. “The nearest shuttle stops to me are halfway to campus,” Carboni said. “By that point, it’s easier to just walk the whole way than wait for the shuttle.” The escort service, which could theoretically take a student to Bloomfield, only runs in one direction; students cannot ride an escort bus to campus.
But Myers said that the shuttle service is much improved.
“We’ve had a lot of input from a lot of people,” Myers said, “and hopefully we’ve put together a reliable and effective transportation service, and kids will take advantage of it.”

The Fence was subject to vandalism on the night of June 22 for the second time this year, as someone used what appeared to be a saw along multiple areas to cut off layers of paint. About 20 students gathered at midnight the following night to cover up the damage by repainting the Fence. The perpetrator also wrote a message on one of the Fence’s posts that said, “Hey CMYou you are a babe! NOT... Just kidding or am I? Now get back to studying...weirdos...”
Clare Graziano, a senior drama major and an Andrew Ambassador for the university, explained that she and the other ambassadors first noticed the damage the morning of June 23. With university officials’ permission, Graziano helped organize another repainting of the Fence. “We wanted to make sure the Fence was ready as a positive message for the pre-college students when they arrive on Saturday,” she said.
Gina Casalegno, the Dean of Student Affairs, said in an e-mail, “The actions taken by students thus far to repair and repaint the structure are ones I applaud. One of the hallmarks of the Fence tradition is the way in which it is grass-roots organized and implemented, and to have students engaged in the response to such an incident is well-placed and appropriate. As such, any discussion of possible steps to take from here would be ones I would like to engage and involve student leadership in considering, which I intend to do as more hopefully emerges from the investigation.”
Will Weiner, a junior social and decision sciences and statistics double major and a Student Senator, reinforced this emphasis on student leadership. “Something student government is going to look into is to see if we can use some sort of security camera around here or some sort of security feature, so that’s going to be one of the higher priorities when school gets into session, if not this summer,” he said. “[It’s] something we want to look into to see if there’s a way we can get some sort of protection because ultimately that’s part of our job, to protect our campus.”
Despite the circumstances, the overall attitude of the evening was positive. Weiner said, “I said this last time, and I’ll say it again: It’s awesome to see so many people are coming out in support of this — in such short notice, in the summer, with finals tomorrow — from all different divisions of the school.”

CulinArt is teaming up with Housing and Dining Services to plan a series of new events to officially begin the Fall 2011 semester.
They have scheduled three events during the month of September that are “like nothing ever done by any Carnegie Mellon food service vendor in history,” said Shelby Cole, the Student Activities director of CulinArt.
CulinArt has planned a taste testing/vendor showcase, a Luau buffet, and a tailgate party.
To start the semester off, CulinArt is hosting a “Welcome Back Vendor Showcase” on Aug. 31 at the Merson Courtyard of the University Center. In this free event, students and staff will get to taste 14 new products from CulinArt vendors and vote on their favorite ones. The top three most popular products will then be sold in Entropy+ for a limited time. Vendors that are attending the event include Pepsi, The Chico Bakery, Pepperidge Farms, and a few others.
CulinArt is also hosting a “Welcome Back Luau Theme Night” on Sept. 7. This event will be co-sponsored by the Asian American and Pacific Islander Graduate Student Caucus. It is a buffet-style event that will feature luau-themed dishes. The main dish of the evening will be a traditional roast pig.
“When you’re stuck on a meal plan and don’t always have your own kitchen, campus food can get pretty boring, so it’s good to be aware of whatever variety is available,” said Corinne Rockoff, sophomore psychology major and Mudge mentor. “The Luau night definitely sounds different from the usual CulinArt food.”
The Luau Night is also being entered into a National Association of College and Unversity Food Services (NACUFS) special events competition, competing for the Loyal E. Horton Dining Award. According to the NACUFS website, the award “celebrates exemplary menus, presentations, special event planning, and new dining concepts.” NACUFS frequently has competitions among schools; past winners include Iowa State University, Brock University, and Washington and Lee University. Just last year, Carnegie Mellon chef Aldo Ramirez participated in a NACUFS Culinary Competition and won a bronze medal.
The final event is a “Tailgate Party” taking place on Sept. 25, which will be hosted in the Tartans Pavilion.
In traditional tailgate fashion, the event was planned to coincide with the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Indianapolis Colts football game.
It will feature a live performance by the band Julia McGinley, a student group, which frequently performs at Carnegie Mellon and won the 2010 Carnegie Mellon Battle of the Bands. The Tailgate Party will also feature prizes, giveaways, and “food specials for both block and non-block students,” according to a press release.
When asked about CulinArt events, Max Illfelder, a sophomore computer science major, said he “had not heard about any of the previous CulinArt events” as “the events have not been very well publicized,” but likes the idea of some of the new events that are to come.
Specifically, he said he is excited for the Vendor Showcase, as it will provide an opportunity to see new products.

On Aug. 19, during the afternoon, a thunderstorm swept across Pittsburgh, covering the city in nearly two inches of rain. The storm resulted in severe flooding on campus. Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, and the FMS building were hit the hardest and suffered the most damage from the flood. FMS workers were immediately called to the buildings to start the clean-up process and repair damages.
“The sources of these floods are two very large, brick-lined sewers which drain much of the Squirrel Hill and Bellefield areas of the city,” said Jim Skees, the director of building facilities for the School of Computer Science, in an e-mail. “[T]hese two sewers join together in a mixing box and that box empties into a line which is significantly smaller in cross section than the two lines which feed it. So one doesn’t have to be an engineer to understand why, during very heavy rains ... these sewers back up and flood.... This flooding not only causes damage to any laboratory equipment within a few feet of the floor, but it also poses a major health hazard and stops research work from taking place in those labs until it is cleaned up.”

Technology Review magazine selects CMU professor as one of its 35 ‘top innovators’
Christopher Bettinger, an assistant professor of materials science and biomedical engineering, has been selected by Technology Review magazine as one of the world’s 35 top innovators under the age of 35. 
Bettinger was selected by a panel of judges and the editorial staff of Technology Review, who evaluated more than 300 nominations.
In October, Bettinger will join the other honorees to discuss their achievements at the Emerging Technologies Conference at MIT. “This is a tremendous honor for me as I continue to hone my skills and research for developing technologies that will improve the field of medical devices and the patients these devices serve,” Bettinger said in a university press release.
Bettinger has worked in the fields of materials science and biomedical engineering for more than 10 years. His research aims to better integrate medical devices with the human body. Bettinger has been developing synthetic materials that mimic soft tissue and biodegradable electronics.
“Technology innovation is key to driving growth and progress in the areas of research, medicine, business, and economics,” said Jason Pontin, editor-in-chief and publisher of Technology Review, in a press release. “We look forward to profiling and working with these technology leaders each year.”
CMU Silicon Valley campus introduces new  and accelerated entrepreneurship program
Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus has launched an accelerated entrepreneurship program that is designed to promote Internet-based and technological innovations and push them into the national economy. Students enrolled in the program will work on projects alongside industry partners and prestigious guest speakers.
Classes begin Monday following a mandatory eight-day innovation “boot camp” designed to challenge students to think outside of the box and act decisively. The program mixes technical and business skills through its 12-month, full-time schedule.
The entrepreneurship program follows Carnegie Mellon’s recent “Greenlighting Startups” initiative, a group of five organizations created to help students, faculty, and alumni further spread their innovations into the marketplace.
“There is this perception that the greatest innovation in Silicon Valley comes from 20-something, college drop-outs with cool ideas who are creating the next billion-dollar companies in their garages,” said Ray Bareiss, director of educational programs at Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley, in a university press release. “Becoming an entrepreneur not only requires a good idea; it also requires the ability to build a winning team.”

This week marks the beginning of the academic year, which means new classes, new friends, and new school supplies. “Back-to-school shopping” has become a familiar phrase in most homes across the nation and the world. Whether you define necessary supplies for school as notebooks and calculators or purses and jeans, back-to-school shopping is a hallmark of academic life:
$7.4 billion: amount of money spent at American family clothing stores in August 2010
9,373: number of office supply and stationery stores in 2008
$2.2 billion: amount of sales at bookstores in August 2010
28,429: number of family clothing stores in the U.S. in 2008

Multiple incidents this summer have warranted notifications from the Carnegie Mellon administration in the form of Official Communication e-mails and University Alert text messages. While we are thankful for the emergency alert system, several flaws have impaired the effectiveness of many emergency notifications. The alert system has a history of getting messages out well after an emergency, giving inaccurate and incomplete information, and failing to provide actionable information.
The Aug. 19 flooding in Pittsburgh demonstrated how the current usage of the alert system fails to warn students and faculty about important issues. Granted, we do not expect the system to be omniscient and send out notifications before a natural disaster strikes. We do, however, expect the university to communicate clearly and in a timely fashion when long-lasting, developing events are taking place and when a well-timed alert could make a difference.
Although e-mails were sent out about flooding, water damage, and power outages in more than four campus buildings, no texts or voice messages were sent. In addition, warnings about staying out of said buildings came via e-mail after many faculty and staff tried to return to campus to assess the damage done to offices and workplaces. By sending alerts with explicit instructions through texts and Twitter, the alert system could have maximized the safety of our community and kept faculty, staff, and students away from contaminated floodwaters and the threat of tetanus.
The Aug. 23 earthquake that traveled from Virginia to Pennsylvania is another example of how the alert system is not being effectively used. Alert text messages and e-mails were received 40 minutes after the earthquake hit Pittsburgh. When an alert is received more than half an hour after a very minor earthquake, there is nothing useful that the alert will accomplish and no specific action that needs to be requested. However, if an alert is sent out during a developing situation like flooding, it has the opportunity to get actionable information out to everyone in time to use it.
Thankful as we are for the alert system, we believe it is not being used to its fullest potential. In the future, more timely instructions and widespread communication can keep the Carnegie Mellon community safe and well-informed in an emergency situation.

It’s summertime. I’m watching Food, Inc. and eating Chef Boyardee, a bad combination to say the least. As the enriched wheat flour noodles slide down my gullet, aided by the melted, enzyme-modified cheese sauce that covers them, I begin my eye-opening journey to the truth behind America’s food.
Since the early 20th century, the American food industry — the meat-packing industry in particular — has had trouble maintaining quality products and staying transparent with the public. Everyone is somewhat familiar with Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and its shocking exposure of the meat-packing industry. After the publication of Sinclair’s book, public outcry led to the enactment of the Meat Inspection Act, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, and the creation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930.
Things seemed to get better; more regulation was put in place, and food quality and working conditions improved. However, in recent years, and especially this past summer, a rash of food scares has revealed the complacency striking the food industry. There have been 27 food recalls this summer alone, a bit much for my taste. The most recent one was  a turkey recall by Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation, which infected 111 people in 31 states with salmonella. Large food recalls like this demonstrate the inability of the government and major food industries to consistently produce safe and nourishing food.
The regulatory system that is currently in place is obviously not cutting it, and hasn’t been for some time. Kevin’s Law, a proposed piece of legislation named for Kevin Kowalcyk — who died at the tender age of two of E.coli-tainted hamburger meat — would have given the Department of Agriculture the power to shut down plants that repeatedly produced tainted meat. Kevin’s mother, Barbara Kowalcyk, has been  fighting since 2005 to have the law instated. However, Kowalcyk has faced a mountain of litigation for speaking out about her views on the meat industry. In her interview with Food, Inc., she went so far as to decline to talk about her diet because of fear of further litigation.
While heavily subsidized products like corn, poultry, and soybeans aid the fast production of cheap food, subsidies place an obscene amount of power in the hands of corporations in control of those foodstuffs. If you are legally attacked by one of these conglomerates for merely airing your views on food, nine times out of 10 they will win, because they have the money to hire the best lawyers and fight until your resources run out. Only in extreme cases, like Oprah Winfrey’s 1996 legal battle against cattle companies, does the “common man” — or in this case the extremely rich celebrity — win out.
When former executives of massive food corporations like Monsanto are appointed to influential positions in the FDA, the future of food regulation isn’t exactly going to be fair. For example, Michael Taylor, a former Monsanto executive, was appointed the FDA’s deputy commissioner of Office of Foods in 2009. Call me paranoid, but I wouldn’t exactly trust a former executive of a company that controls one of the biggest crops in the nation to make unbiased decisions.
Other aspects of the food production industry — like pesticides, genetically modified organisms, cloning, labeling laws, farming conditions, and working conditions — ensure that the food Americans are eating is ultimately not food, but something very close to it. The tight control that food corporations have on the quality of food production, combined with their close relationship with the federal government, will continue to cause problems if left unaddressed. If you want to find out what is really in your food, and the reason massive food recalls continue to happen, do a little digging and the results might surprise you. 
For myself, I don’t think I’ll be eating Chef Boyardee again any time soon.

As The Tartan's News section reports today, students and other members of the university returning this week are being greeted by reworked shuttle and escort routes between campus and surrounding neighborhoods.
We are pleased to see University Police, which runs the shuttle service, and the university administration at large taking an active role in campus transportation. President Jared Cohon discussed the possibility of university-provided transportation to the East End in a meeting with Staff Council in March; the extension of shuttle coverage to Squirrel Hill and eastern Shadyside makes good on that claim. The new C route to Squirrel Hill is a genuine transportation improvement, and we — along with the thousands of students who have been crammed into overcrowded 61Cs — applaud it. However, in the case of the A and B routes, University Police should have left well enough alone. 
Posters placed around campus earlier this month grandly advertised “new routes, new times, new stops,” but failed to mention when these major changes would be taking effect. To further confuse matters, new maps and schedules appeared at the Morewood Gardens shuttle stop during graduate student orientation week, but the shuttles continued running on their old routes and times. Presenting conflicting information to thousands of new students is not the best way to say “Welcome to Carnegie Mellon.”
The shuttle extensions have been billed as a service improvement, but that depends on your point of view — or, more likely, your place of residence. 
Commuters from eastern Shadyside and East Liberty can now ride campus shuttles to and from their homes, but the consequence is an overall reduction in service for residents in North Oakland, Bloomfield, Friendship, and Western Shadyside. Shuttles that formerly traversed these neighborhoods every half-hour now arrive every 45 minutes except during peak hours, and the drive to campus from the earlier stops can take upwards of 30 minutes. These transportation delays provide a disservice to neighborhoods that are not otherwise well connected to campus by Port Authority bus, whereas much of the new eastern shuttle coverage overlaps with the Port Authority’s 71B and 71D bus routes to Fifth and Morewood.
Although we are thankful for the work being put into the transportation system, serious improvement to the Shadyside shuttle should have increased frequency, not decreased it. And, no matter the service levels, route changes needed to be communicated coherently and correctly.

At a time when the Tea Party has redefined compromise as capitulation and Rick Perry (governor of Texas) and Michele Bachmann (Minnesota House Representative) are the faces of the Republican Party, running for the presidential nomination on a platform of rational thought seems like a losing strategy. 
The presidential primaries and caucuses do not take place until 2012, yet most of the Republican field is already racing to the far-right fringe. Secure in their ignorance, these radical Republicans are not afraid to sacrifice reality to appeal to an extremist base.
For that reason, it is refreshing to see a few Republican presidential candidates running on facts and logic. Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman has marketed himself as the moderate of the field, taking atypical positions such as support for evolution and belief in global warming. While by no means a moderate, Representative Ron Paul (R–Texas) also shows signs of clarity and reason. In the debate before this month’s Ames, Iowa, straw poll, Paul accurately rejected the idea that the United States Constitution puts the same limits on states as it does on the federal government while simultaneously criticizing President Obama’s health care mandate.
This willingness to accept reality puts Paul and Huntsman in an entirely separate category from candidates such as Bachmann and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum — not to mention one of the debate panelists, Fox News’ Chris Wallace — who either misinterpreted or ignored the Constitution. 
Contrasting Huntsman’s and Perry’s public statements neatly summarizes those two candidates. While Huntsman tweets, “To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy,” Perry tells a child about evolution, “That’s a theory that is out there — and it’s got some gaps in it.” Unfortunately for the nation as a whole, running on the far edge of the political spectrum tends to be a winning strategy for primary races. Only the most dedicated and energized voters turn out for primary elections, leaving the middle ground empty.
This summer’s debt limit fiasco showed that politicians elected for their refusal to compromise or listen to reason are not afraid to put the well-being of the United States at risk. Republican voters should listen to their candidates’ views, but they should also consider whether these views are realistic.

According to multiple news sources Libya’s leader Moammar Gadhafi will fall. Last week’s military action in Tripoli revived many people’s faith in the rise of a new Libyan democracy. I, however, am not one of those people. Libya still has a long way to go before it even comes close to achieving a functioning democracy.
Despite the end to Gadhafi’s tumultuous 42-year regime, it is foolish to assume that the necessary pieces of a new government will fall into place. Successfully toppling a dictatorship does not equate to dismantling it. As  the problems arising between Sudan and the newly formed South Sudan show, forming a new government from the ground up is no easy task. Libya’s societal attitudes, bureaucratic processes, and economic infrastructures all have to undergo drastic changes. It is true that bringing Gadhafi to justice and ending his regime were big steps (and bigger accomplishments) in the grand scheme of democratizing Libya, but harder work is just beginning.
To prevent Libya from slipping into total anarchy, the rebel forces need to work with citizens in laying the groundwork for a new era of government. This will undoubtedly be the most difficult part of democratizarion; it is easy to unite under a common enemy, but it is hard to unite under common laws and values. Libya is home to a large number of ethnic demographics as well as tribal groups. Each faction of the population may have its own ideas about how to best form a new nation. The fighting between dictator and rebels may have ended, but the fighting between citizens is about to begin. Unifying the diverse population of Libya should be the topmost priority in the coming months, if not years.
Libyans are in a particularly perilous situation. Gadhafi built very few modern state institutions during his regime. His dictatorship tore apart any sense of political processes, such as competing parties or any body of government that checks power. Without proper government institutions it will be difficult for the transitional government to create effective infrastructures and political bodies. There seems to be only one solid course of action for Libyans: building something from nothing. This could make or break Libya; a blank slate could aid the creation of a new government and economy, or it could become an obstacle in the path to a functioning state.
Another issue that any new Libyan democracy will face is basic security and a sense of protection. Through the NATO military actions and rebel attacks, Libya has become a war-torn country. Looters and gunmen roam city streets and dead bodies pile up, especially in areas of high action. In Tripoli, for example, there are a myriad of rebel checkpoints and vigilante groups defending their neighborhoods. Without a sense of stability and security in the nation, convincing citizens — as well as foreign investors — to have faith in the country will be a difficult feat. The transitional government needs to gain control of its country and put an end to the chaos running rampant in the streets.
As I have stated many times, Libya has a lot to deal with before it can find any sort of stable ground. Bringing down Gadhafi was definitely an achievement worth celebrating, but there are still large obstacles this nation must face. Unifying the citizens, building a completely new government from scratch, and bringing stability to a warring nation are not going to be easy tasks. I suspect it will be a long time before the world sees Libya as a functioning, stable state.

For the past month or so, Iowa has been the stomping ground for Republican presidential hopefuls, all of whom were trying to get a good start in the presidential race by succeeding in Iowa’s Ames straw poll. 
They have inundated Iowa citizens with television and radio commercials trying to win over their votes — but, as they did, Iowans were also watching a very different sort of political commercial, one funded by none other than comedian Stephen Colbert, who has decided to form his own super-PAC.
A super-PAC, officially titled an “independent expenditure-only committee,” is an organization or committee that can essentially spend as much money as it wants on an election, so long as it does not directly coordinate with a political party or candidate. For example, American Crossroads, a conservative super-PAC, spent over $38 million on advertisements supporting Republican candidates in the 2010 election.
As a Colbert Report employee said in an interview with The New York Times, “We decided that we would just see how far we could go. And it turns out that, like everyone else raising money in politics, we can pretty much do what we want.” He also noted, “Not even the actual news reporters want to cover campaign finance.”
Which, of course, begs the question: Why not? As Colbert has proven, it’s fairly simple to infiltrate the system and learn about the free rein that corporations can have by forming a super-PAC. Why did it take a comedian to bring attention to this large issue within our political system?
Perhaps, as Mark Feldstein, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland, said in The New York Times’ article, “he is taking advantage of loopholes to set up an organization that is not a legitimate political action committee, if there is such a thing, to make the point that the current system is a form of legalized bribery. Try making that point as a member of the mainstream media and holding on to your objectivity.”
True, it may not be possible to objectively criticize PACs, but at the very least the mainstream media should report on them so readers can have the opportunity to draw their own conclusions about the flaws of the system. Newspapers might not find campaign finance as compelling a story as Howard Schultz’s favorite Seattle Starbucks location — an actual article that graced the homepage of The New York Times’ website Saturday night — but as journalists, it is a story they should feel a duty to report.

After making promises in his 2008 campaign to bring change to immigration policies in America, President Obama finally came through last week when he announced a policy change that would focus only on deporting those illegal immigrants that are convicted criminals or a threat to the public. Although this is a small step in dealing with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in America, it is a much-appreciated one.
Obama had previously failed to make any changes to immigration policy and deported an unprecedented 800,000 people in the past two years. The changes the government proposes would help the same immigrants that long-stalled legislation like the Dream Act would have aided. A viable solution must be found for those 12 million undocumented lives. These immigrants live with no assurance of a future in the very society that they contribute to. Many undocumented immigrants are extremely intelligent and ambitious, but simply have no opportunity in their country. 
The argument that immigrants take opportunities from Americans is completely false; in fact, the majority of U.S. unemployment lies in the highest-educated segments of the population. Because of increases in this segment of the population, the demand for low-skilled workers increases every year. However, these workers live in constant fear of being found and forced to leave their homes, families, friends, and jobs.
Many illegal immigrants entered the country legally but have expired visas from traveling, studying, or working. Take, for example, the highly publicized case of Jose Vargas. Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Post writer, recently outed himself as an undocumented worker and has gathered the sympathies of millions — including myself. Vargas’ mother sent him to America from the Philippines when he was 13 in the hopes that he might live a better life. In fact, he did not discover that he was in the country illegally until he was 16. Because of this, he cannot leave the country, his opportunities have been limited, and — worst of all — he has had to live in daily fear of being outed and deported.
Many of us have — knowingly or unknowingly — met and even befriended undocumented workers. The U.S.’s policy has been inhumane, often separating mother and child, husband and wife. The small number of temporary visas for skilled workers is 5,000 — an obviously inadequate number for a vast country like America. In a nation built on opportunity, diversity, and freedom, it is absurd to force someone who has lived here for the majority of his or her life to leave.
