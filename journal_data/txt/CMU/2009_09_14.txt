The Carnegie Mellon football team kicked off their season with two wins at home in Gesling Stadium, overcoming Ohio Wesleyan College 19–7 and outlasting Grove City College 45–40 a week later. The Tartans, who were ranked third in a University Athletic Association preseason poll, moved their record to 2–0. 
Tartans sophomore running back Chris Garcia opened the first quarter with a touchdown just 7:22 into the game against Ohio Wesleyan. During the second quarter, the Tartans’ defense faltered, letting a touchdown by the Bishops go through to bring the score 6–7 with Ohio leading by a point. 
Garcia repeated his feat in the fourth quarter, scoring a second touchdown 13:22 into the period to give the Tartans the lead again at 12–7.  With only 50 seconds left on the clock, senior Devin Murray ran 25 yards to score a touchdown, securing the Tartans' victory. Junior place-kicker Elliot Carnevale scored the extra point to end the game with final score 19–7. 
Against Grove City, the Tartans encountered more resistance but were able to pull out a win 45–40. 
Garcia took the initiative in the first quarter and scored Carnegie's first touchdown with 12:41 on the clock. Just eight minutes later, however, the Wolverines tied the score 7–7. The second quarter saw more action for both sides, with runs scored by Garcia, junior running back Justin Pratt, and a field goal by Carnevale to bring the score to 24–7 by the end of the first half. 
Pratt started the scoring again in the second half on a touchdown with 12:30 left in the quarter. The Wolverines responded by scoring two touchdowns, with 10 and three minutes left in the game, to narrow the gap to 31–14. Senior Brendan Howe started off the fourth quarter with a touchdown to give the Tartans a 38–21 lead. The Wolverines struck back with a touchdown two minutes later. Eight minutes later, Pratt scored his third touchdown of the game and brought the score to 45–27. The Tartans let in two more touchdowns before the clock hit zero to give them their second win of the season with final score 45–40. 
Pratt led the team in total yards rushed with 157 yards out of 317 total for the team, followed by Garcia with 107 yards.
The Tartans will travel to Geneva, N.Y. to play Hobart College at the season's first away game, set to kick off Saturday, Sept. 19.

The opening week for volleyball proved to be a full one for the Tartans, who dropped their opening match to Marietta College 3-1 on their home court, but rallied quickly to offer up a decent 2–2 showing at the Battlefield Classic, hosted by local Gettysburg College. They continued their momentum and took the Oberlin College Invitational by force, emerging victorious both days, winning 3–2 on Friday against Notre Dame College, followed by 3–2 and 3–0 victories on Saturday against Manchester College and Oberlin College, respectively.  The Tartans now stand at 5–3 overall for the season.
Home court advantage did not prove to be helpful in the first game of the season against Marietta, where the Tartans took the first set 25–15, but found themselves overpowered the rest of the match, losing the next three 16–25, 17–25 and finally 20–25.
Four days later, the Tartans geared up again to participate in the Battlefield Classic in Gettysburg, Pa. They got off to a good start, putting away Gallaudet University 26–24, 25–13, 25–9 and St. John Fisher College 25–18, 25–16, 25–16. However, the Tartans dropped the next two matches against Salisbury College 0–3, and Gettysburg 1–3. Senior Samantha Carter was very productive, ending the weekend being named to the All-Tournament Team with 103 assists and 34 digs. Junior Caroline Size also shined for the Tartans with 19 total kills, while junior Cameron Griffin contributed 18 digs and six aces. 
A week later, the Tartans traveled to Oberlin, Ohio for the Oberlin Invitational and wowed fans with an exciting five-set victory against Notre Dame College. After dropping the first set 24–26, the Tartans battled back to claim the next two, winning both by a score of 25–23. The Blue and White fought back to snatch the fourth set 18–25 to force a tiebreaker. The Tartans stepped up their game and finished off their opponents 15–8. Juniors Aislinn McCloskey and sophomore Maddie Rosnick each had 12 kills, while senior Jessica Brackinand, McCloskey, and Size led in blocks, with eight for Brackinand and seven each for the other two. 
Still feeling adrenaline from their exciting victory, the Tartans took care of business Saturday by shutting down Oberlin 3–2 and Manchester 3–0 to take the trophy. Against Manchester, the Tartans rolled easily through three sets to take the win 25–17, 25–16, 25–22. McCloskey led the team in kills with 16, followed by senior Jess Brackin with 11. Senior Sam Carter put in 75 total assists, while Size contributed eight kills each game.
Competition resumes next Tuesday in Latrobe, Pa. against St. Vincent College, and on the weekend when the Tartans play host to the Carnegie Mellon Crossover.

After a very strong preseason, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team made sure to maintain their great form in the first two weeks of the season. After six games, the Tartan men have beaten a nationally ranked team, won an invitational, and are now 5–1.
In their first game of the season, the Tartans took on Washington and Jefferson College on the road, defeating them three goals to none. Goals were scored by seniors Ryan Heuler (two) and Ryan Browne (one). Three days later, the Tartans took on one of their most challenging opponents of the entire season, number 6 Ohio Wesleyan, in Ohio Wesleyan’s Fred Myers Invitational tournament. Although the Carnegie Mellon men were outplayed, the score line definitely did not tell the story. Both teams came out strong, but Ohio Wesleyan got the crucial first goal. Frustration continued to mount as Ohio Wesleyan got a second goal and then a quick third off a questionable penalty call in what ended up being a 4–0 Bishops’ victory. The next day, however, the Tartans came out and won comfortably against Rutgers-Camden 2–0. Ricky Griffin and Brett Roller got their first goals of the season.
The momentum carried over into the second week of the season when the boys won all of their next three games. In their home opener, the Tartans rattled Westminister College 4–1. Goals came flooding in early as Keith Haselhoff scored just 43 seconds after kickoff. The Titans then answered back four minutes later. First-year John Crawshaw then scored a wonderful goal off a cross from Ricky Griffin in the 10th minute. Jon Simon and Ryan Browne put away two more to make it 4–1. The game was also the first game back from injury for senior forward Pat Lutz. Lutz had a terrific game as he consistently put pressure on a nervous Westminister back line and he ended the game with two assists.
Hosting the Radisson Invitational this past weekend, the Tartans started things off with an upset victory against number 18 Johns Hopkins on Friday. Lutz got the Tartans on the score sheet with a fantastic header from outside of the box. The next day, the Tartans easily defeated Penn State-Altoona, 6–0. After going up by four in the first half on goals scored by Griffin (two), Lutz, and Browne, the Tartans put in their reserves, made up mostly of their younger players. The reserves played beautiful soccer in the second half as fan favorite Kevin Pierce and Brad Edelman got their first goals of the season. A lot of credit should also be given to the Carnegie Mellon back line and senior goalie Maks Khurgin as the defense collected their fourth shutout win of the season.
Amid the success of the soccer team, a very exciting story has been developing off the pitch as a group of first-years created an unofficial “football [soccer] supporters group” called “the Tartan Army.” The “Army” has come out to every home soccer game and has made sure to sing their voices out. Currently, their numbers are small, but they are recruiting very heavily. Membership is free and the only requirement is to wear red or maroon to the games and to sing and chant enthusiastically.
The Tartans’ next match will be away against the Gators of Allegheny College this Saturday, Sept. 19.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team is off to somewhat of a rocky start this season, losing their season opener at home and playing to a 1–3 record through their first four games. The Tartans fell 1–0 against Denison University on Sept. 1, followed by a 3–0 win over Oberlin Sept. 4, a 5–4 loss to Centenary College, and a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Johns Hopkins University.
Opening the season at home, the Tartans played well against Denison in a game in which the winning — and only — goal wasn’t scored until the 75th minute. First-year keeper Becca Gold performed well, saving three shots while allowing just the one goal, scored by Denison’s Kim Oshita. 
The Tartans managed to pull off four shots, including two shots on goal, but couldn’t beat the clock in the well-played game. Their best chances both came in the second half, when sophomore Elsa Wu managed to take two shots, with one shot on goal in the 48th minute, and first-year Katie Davis kicked a shot on goal in the 55th minute, but both attempts were rendered fruitless by Denison keeper Courtney Cobb.
Against Oberlin, the Tartans had control of the ball most of the game en route to their 3–0 win. In the first half, senior Casey Garth and sophomore Carmen Easterwood each had two shots, while sophomore Nicole Bayley and junior Adrienne Pajer each took one. Pajer’s shot nearly went in as she took Bayley’s rebound and directed it at the goal, but the shot was blocked. 
The Tartans scored all three goals in the second half, starting when Katie Davis scored in the 56th minute off a pass from Wu for her first career goal. Wu scored herself four minutes later after junior Caroline Danka’s shot was blocked, but not held, by Oberlin keeper Christie Zelnik. Junior Emily Overstreet also scored, in the 79th minute, off a pass from Bayley. The Tartans’ defense was stalwart, not allowing Oberlin to take any shots the entire game.
The uplifting win, however, was followed by a tough loss on Friday at the hands of Centenary. The back-and-forth affair started with the Lady Cyclones scoring in the 12th minute. Roughly a minute later, Tartans sophomore Korinne Mills tied the score with her first career goal, knocking in the rebound off a corner kick. Centenary’s Jazmine Farrell, however, quickly took back the lead with her second goal of the game in the 21st minute. Her goal held up until one second before halftime, when Carnegie Mellon first-year Lissie Arndt kicked the ball over the keeper’s head to tie the score at 2. 
Once again, though, Farrell took the momentum back with her third goal of the game in the 59th minute, and her goal was quickly followed by another Centenary score to make it 4–2. The Tartans once again fought back by scoring two quick goals of their own, with sophomore Ava Murphey putting in Garth’s rebound in the 64th minute and Overstreet kicking one in from 20 yards back a minute later. Unfortunately, two and a half minutes later, Centenary scored their fifth goal to put the game away and end the see-saw scoring.
Finally, on Saturday, the Tartans played their fourth match of the season against Hopkins. The game was somewhat reminiscent of the Tartans’ game against Oberlin, as the first goal was not scored until 42:52 into the game, when the Blue Jays’ Ava Scheininger headed the ball past the Tartans’ keeper, junior Anya Rosen. Hopkins then scored again in the 51st minute to secure the 2–0 win. Aside from the two goals allowed, Rosen played a solid goalie, saving seven shots.
The women’s soccer team will next play Sept. 19 against number 25 Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio.

After transferring to Carnegie Mellon from Duquesne University two years ago, senior Keith Haselhoff has had a strong showing on the soccer field while playing center midfielder for the Tartans. Haselhoff has consistently delivered with assists and a few goals of his own, and this season he is following that same trend. Just this past weekend during the Radisson Invitational, Haselhoff was instrumental in delivering assists to his teammates to secure the squad’s 2–0 record for the tournament.
Growing up in White Oak, Pa., Haselhoff was encouraged to try a variety of sports, from baseball and basketball to swimming and hockey, on top of playing the prevailing soccer. Instigated and inspired by his brother and their competitive athletic nature, Haselhoff honed his soccer skills playing one on one in the backyard of his home. 
Haselhoff has maintained his family-oriented background, satisfied with his decision to stay close to home while attending college. Haselhoff is able to reap the benefits of going home for Sunday dinners and being around to watch his younger sister grow up and develop her own soccer career, all of which helps to provide Haselhoff with a comfortable balance between the stresses of a busy school and soccer schedule.
Haselhoff decided to make the switch to Carnegie Mellon to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering, while also minoring in biomedical engineering. While at first he had planned on being a professor of mathematics, Haselhoff craved a more concrete field of study and followed in his father’s footsteps to become an engineer. There may have been courses that proved to be incredibly challenging, but Haselhoff is pleased with his decision and excels in academics in a similar way to his performance in soccer.
True to Pittsburgh native fashion, Haselhoff is a big Steelers football fan. In fact, the song Renegade by Styx, a regular crowd favorite during the games at Heinz Field, makes an appearance on the Tartans warm-up mix before games and is Haselhoff’s favorite from the playlist. While there may not be many other pregame rituals or superstitions that Haselhoff follows, his goals for the rest of the season are strong and steadfast. As Haselhoff puts it, “My personal goal for the rest of the season is to do whatever I have to do to help our team win. Some team goals we are all working hard towards are a UAA Championship and a long run in the NCAA playoffs. Anything less would be a major letdown.” The coaching staff, families, and fans hope that the Tartans can do just that.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team has begun the fall season with a bang, winning Allegheny College’s Heath Invitational this past Saturday. In their opening match, the Tartans swept Allegheny 9–0, before defeating a tough Case Western team 8–1 to win the invitational. The Tartans now have a record of 2–0 to start the year.
All three doubles victories came easily for the Tartans against Allegheny, with the first doubles team of first-year Duke Miller and junior Bobby MacTaggart dropping only two games to win 8–2. Seniors Niko Ljuboja and James Muliawan played the second doubles spot, and outplayed their opponents 8–6. Bringing in the third win was first-year Civan Orhan and sophomore Jeremy King, who also won 8–2.
After the doubles matches, the Tartans lost no time getting down to business and putting away all six singles. At first singles, for the first time in his tennis career, Jon Spero led the Tartans with an easy 6–4, 6–2 victory.
About the overall match, Spero said, “The freshmen did well. Some of them struggled early, but most of them got into a good groove after a few games and pulled out their matches pretty easily. I had my college debut at number 1 singles and I was very excited. I played a guy who I trained with before college and it was a good win for me.” 
He added jokingly, “Our number 1 doubles team looked really good, and freshmen phenom Duke Miller carried Bobby the whole time.”
At second singles, first-year Harsha Rao fought to victory, dropping the first set 2–6, but rebounded to take the next set 7–5 and the tiebreaker 10–0. Miller took third singles 6–4, 6–1, followed by first-year Jooho Yu, who swept his opponent 6–0, 6–0. Rounding out the last two spots were Orhan and first-year Neil Soni, who won 6–4, 6–1 and 6–2, 6–3 respectively.
Against Case, the Tartans had a tougher time but swept singles and took two of the doubles. Again at first doubles, the team of Miller and MacTaggart added an 8–4 win to go along with the duo of Ljuboja and Muliawan, who won in a close 9–7 victory.
For the singles lineup, coach Andy Girard decided to mix things up. At the first spot, MacTaggart fought a tough opponent but managed to come up on top, winning 7–6 (7–4), 6–3. Muliawan added a win, shutting down his opponent 7–6 (7–1), 6–2, followed by Rao, who had a bit of trouble but won 6–1, 4–6, 10–3. Spero easily won his match at fourth singles, 6–2, 6–3, while Miller and King each added their wins to the total.
“I think the freshmen performed at a level not indicative of true freshmen. They played as though they were upperclassmen, which I was pleasantly surprised to see,” observed assistant coach Mike Belmonte. “The men’s team will be improved from last year and we will look to make another run at NCAA regionals.”
The Tartans have a short three-week break before they travel to Virginia to participate in the ITA Regional Championship hosted by Mary Washington.

When the name Carnegie Mellon University is mentioned, the first thing people think of isn’t usually sports teams or dedicated student athletes. The truth is, at the end of the year, there won’t be too many Tartans in the NFL or NBA draft or competing at the Olympics. So, you may ask, what’s the point? Student athletes at Carnegie Mellon have a particularly demanding daily schedule. Not only do they have the countless hours of studying typical for a Carnegie Mellon student, but they have two-plus hours of practice every day, extra weight training and conditioning at least twice a week, and weekend trips or early Saturday morning alarms that cut into their social lives. They are stressed to the limit, putting their bodies at risk for injury and illness. If professional sports are not even an option, why risk it?
Coach Andy Girard recruited me to play tennis at Carnegie Mellon. We started optional practice during orientation week, playing several hours a day. Season started and we traveled to a few matches here and there, and I thought this wouldn’t be too bad. The winter season came and we practiced indoors from 9–11 p.m., sacrificing crucial study hours. That was just the winter. During our hectic spring, we practiced two hours a day, and sometimes for conditioning we ran afterward. We traveled to matches just about every other weekend, and even had to miss Carnival. As the season came to a close the weekend between finals, after a 5–3 loss to Washington and Lee on our home courts to qualify for nationals, I sat in a circle with my teammates. As I sat there, looking around campus, tired as could be from pulling several all-nighters to finish my studying, I realized for the first time in my tennis career that I had never once throughout the year questioned why I was a student athlete. The friendships I developed with those girls around me, and the pride and passion we had representing our school on the tennis courts heavily outweighed the work we put in throughout the year. Memories of the trips we took spun through my mind; our week-long spring break trip in California, the weekend away from Carnival, and the various other social occasions we missed stood out as exciting bonding times with my team, not as things I missed because of tennis.
During the summer after my first year, I developed an injury to my right shoulder. My range of motion was slightly limited, and my strength weakened. I was severely disappointed, and couldn’t imagine not being a part of the tennis team. When the doctor told me it was my decision whether or not to play because my shoulder wouldn’t get much worse, I was all for it. I told my coach I could only participate in doubles because it demanded less of my shoulder than playing singles, and he trusted me to tell him when I had enough. The excitement of the successful season and the endless encouragement from teammates to succeed on and off the court was enough for me to make it through the end of the year. But when I saw the doctor this past summer, he wasn’t so sure I had made the right decision. Though I had been able to stay on the court before, he wasn’t so sure I would ever get to experience that again. I underwent an experimental procedure to help fix my shoulder, and to my luck and the doctor’s astonishment, it worked. After some therapy, and a little bit of pain, I am back on the tennis court participating with my team.
However, not all people are quite so lucky. Sometimes, passion for the sport and for the team just isn’t enough to keep student athletes on the field. Luckily, Carnegie Mellon has excellent athlete support. Each team meets with a nutritionist who understands the demands of their sport. Specific dietary guidelines are explained to student athletes in hopes of filling their bodies with the proper nutrients needed to keep their bones and muscles healthy under rigorous demands. A sports psychologist also meets with the teams. He discusses how to cope with the demands of being a student athlete and how to develop time-management skills and other strategies to be the best on the field and in the classroom. Strength and conditioning coach Kevin Schultz has also dedicated time to surveying student athletes about which muscle groups they feel are most prone to injury. He develops a special workout including agility exercises and weight training techniques to develop, strengthen, and rehabilitate these muscle groups for each team.
The demands of a student athlete are incredible, but the Athletics Department is doing its best to offer the necessary programs to allow their student athletes to feel that passion and excitement on the field while still having the energy and time to perform in the classroom. Perhaps that’s why Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are comprised of UAA Champions, National Champions, and All-Americans while still as a whole maintaining a higher GPA than the general student body.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country teams got off to a great start this season, competing at the Duquesne Duals Sept. 5 and the Wayesburg Invitational Sept. 12. The teams performed well at Duquesne, with the women beating five of seven teams and the men beating two of three. Both teams placed first overall at Waynesburg.
At Duquesne, the men’s team defeated Niagara University and St. Bonaventure University, and nearly defeated St. Vincent College, falling by merely one point. Junior Nate Bussiere was the fastest Tartan, finishing 10th overall in a time of 26:20, followed by senior Josh Finkle, who placed 48th with a time of 27:59. First-year Ben Finch and Marc McGeary finished 54th and 56th, respectively.
On the women’s side, the Tartans defeated five teams, including Division I local rival University of Pittsburgh. They also defeated Niagara, Juniata College, St. Bonaventure, and Wheeling Jesuit University. First-year Emily Wobb crossed first for the Tartans with a time of 19:08 to finish fifth overall, while junior Courtney Baker placed ninth with a time of 19:20. First-year Jackie Altshuler and junior Danielle Morse came in 26th and 29th overall, respectively. Sophomore Danielle Montanaro finished 36th overall, while junior Laura McKee came in 39th.
The Tartans ran roughshod over their opponents at the Waynesburg Invitational, as the men swept the top five places and the women swept the top six, leading to a victory for both. First-year Emily Wobb led the women with a winning time of 23:39, directly followed by first-year Jackie Altshuler (24:20) and junior Danielle Morse (25:01). Sophomore Cassie Wallace finished in 25:17 to take fourth, junior Laura McKee finished fifth in 25:20, and sophomore Danielle Montanaro rounded out the sweep one second later in 25:21.
For the men, junior J.P. Allera won the race in 26:06, followed by sophomore Matt Jacob and senior Dario Donatelli, who finished second and third, respectively, with times of 26:14 and 26:17. Junior Nate Bussiere crossed in 26:56, good enough for fourth place, and senior Chris Rizzo placed fifth place with a time of 27:13 to complete the dominance.
“The freshmen did well in both races and the upperclassmen are in good shape going into the heart of the season,” said Rizzo.
Both teams will compete next at Dickinson College on Sept. 19.

This year I was asked to join my friend’s long-running fantasy football league — one of the highest honors within the male social circle. I grew up in Vermont, well within Patriots Country (hold on Yinzers, let me finish), but I have never been an avid football fan. However, since becoming an American citizen, I have drunk the Kool-Aid, or rather the Bud Light, and learned to tailgate with the best (read: “We are Penn State!”). So, I fired up my computer and started reading every fantasy ranking list and blog I could.
Once I officially registered my team, the Steel Sidi Champs, I asked whoever would listen for fantasy pointers. You have to pay attention to bye weeks (each team has a week off); past performance is not necessarily a good indicator for fantasy points; look for the sleeper picks, which is a term for underrated players; and don’t worry about drafting a kicker till the last round. Like anything impossible to master, everybody has different views and tips when it comes to fantasy sports. I took each with a grain of salt and in the end decided that nobody really had an upper hand or dominant strategy. During the first couple of rounds you take whatever ringers you can get. After that, it becomes very difficult to distinguish the 40th-ranked player from the 50th.
Adrian Peterson, Aaron Rodgers, Ray Rice, and the Titans’ defense sans Albert Haynesworth: these are my fantasy ringers. In the comfort of my favorite armchair with a beer and some pepperoni pizza, I marked my first fantasy football draft. I was lucky enough to have the second overall pick and was even luckier that the first pick chose Tom Brady. We made history amid the egregious trash talk from my buddy’s younger brother. On any given Tuesday, teams are born and champions are made. 
For the first time ever, I am very excited for football season and I can’t wait to see how my team will fare 17 weeks from now. The quantitative side of fantasy football really hit home with my technical background, and I’ve already started my spreadsheet for next season. A month ago, I couldn’t have told you who any of these players were, but now, as I ride the bus and listen to ESPN’s Fantasy Focus Podcast, I am proud to say that I love football and I love America.

On Sept. 10, Carnegie Mellon’s University Lecture Series guest speaker Douglas Boucher gave a talk on the importance of climate change education and the problems with deforestation.
Boucher, an active member of the Union of Concerned Scientists and previously a professor at the University of Quebec and McGill University, said he treads a fine line between academics and politics.
“Currently, I’m a recovering academic. It’s nice to be back in an academic setting, especially since there is a lot going on right now involving climate change around the world,” Boucher said. “And fortunately, it’s all coming to town.” What Boucher referenced is the G20 Summit that is drawing nearer. “The Obama administration specifically chose Pittsburgh for this meeting as an example of what can be done in terms of a transition from an old energy economy to a new energy economy,” Boucher said.
He highlighted that one of the only ways to have changes made in politics is through public pressure. Boucher advised students to get involved, in one way or another, in the G20 Summit.
In his lecture, Boucher talked about the possibilities that could happen if conversations like the G20 went well. Boucher brought out a map of the world, skewed to show each country’s size proportional to its carbon emission. Then, in a diagram of countries who are supportive of environmental action and those who have power, Boucher showed that many of the G20 members are holding back in terms of environmental activism. “Some countries like Japan are way up there in support,” Boucher said. “Then there are the possible deal breakers. These countries, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, don’t want there to be an agreement on climate change for obvious reasons.” 
He also noted that some less powerful groups, such as the Association of Small Nation States, literally see climate change as a threat to their existence because a small increase in water levels could wipe out entire groups and islands. He also noted the impact climate change could have on Pittsburgh locals. 
“If we go by the business-as-usual scenario, we are going to shift the climate in western Pennsylvania so that, by the end of the century, it resembles the climate we have in Alabama,” Boucher said.
He stated possible scenarios of how our world’s future could look, depending on our actions. If we curb our emissions by over 80 to 90 percent, Boucher claimed that we could live in a world with relatively low environmental damage. Boucher’s message to students, and the focus of his research, is to prove that this fantastic feat can be done, and it can be accomplished in a way that is not only economically feasible, but also economically beneficial to us. 
Boucher explained this using an analogy of his newly purchased hybrid car. Even though his car was an expensive investment, he ended up saving money after a few years due to the amount he would have otherwise spent on gas. An environmental group that Boucher is part of, the Union of Concerned Scientists, showed a study to explain how it is practical and realistic to cut our energy consumption by 2 percent over the next decade, and do it efficiently.
Boucher is sure of the possibilities for improvement because he believes it is American politics to try every other solution before policymakers arrive at the right answer.
“We always do the right thing after we’ve tried everything else. I think we are getting to our Churchill-ian moment where everything we have done has failed, so now we are finally going to do the right thing,” Boucher said.
Boucher said that Carnegie Mellon is a hotspot for green technologies and it is crucial that, as a school, students take initiative to constantly improve these technologies and make climate change goals more feasible.
He concluded by noting how the changes made now will affect our future. “Our grandchildren are going to live in a planet and atmosphere based upon our decision and the ones made in Pittsburgh in the next few weeks,” he said.
Indira Nair, the Vice Provost of Education, saw this lecture as a crucial part to educating Carnegie Mellon students about climate change.
“We only see the storm [of climate change catastrophes] in temperature changes. We don’t have the eyes to see the storm, and this lecture really helps us have the eyes to see it,” Nair said.  “It was a truly exemplary talk for an educated public.”

Partying, and consequently alcohol, has always been a large part of college life. But while you are partying, your body remains at work processing and removing the alcohol from your body. This issue of Health Talk discusses how the body deals with alcohol and how it is ultimately flushed out of the body.
The familiar alcohol in drinks is actually an organic compound known as ethanol; alcoholic drinks are made when it is mixed with water and other ingredients. As soon as it is ingested, it starts being absorbed. 
Taking a sip of vodka allows alcohol to pass through the lining of the mouth and throat and be absorbed by blood vessels even before it reaches the stomach. 
Since alcohol is a small and simple molecule, it does not need to be broken down before being taken in by the bloodstream; it flows in by diffusion.
Alcohol can also be absorbed through the stomach, but in reality, most of the alcohol is taken up through the small intestine. This is the basis for the “eat before you drink” doctrine; eating beforehand tells the stomach not to release its contents to the intestine, as the food needs to be digested and broken down into smaller particles before it can be absorbed.
Because the alcohol is blocked from entering the small intestine, it is not absorbed as quickly. The idea that bread “absorbs” alcohol, like a sponge, is not actually true; eating only delays the process.
The small intestine is designed to absorb chemicals from food and pass them into the bloodstream. The alcohol is carried through the bloodstream to the liver, where it is further processed. 
Once absorbed, the liver metabolizes the alcohol with the help of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. Alcohol is converted into an acetaldehyde, and then further converted to acetic acid, which is harmless to the body. Acetic acid is further broken down into carbon dioxide and water and is released from the body. 
An intolerance for alcohol is caused by an nonfunctional version of alcohol dehydrogenase. However, the liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol at one time; the rest remains in the body and is what causes the effects of drunkenness. The unprocessed alcohol in the bloodstream travels toward the brain. The brain is usually is protected from unwanted chemicals by a barrier called the blood- brain barrier. However, alcohol is allowed to pass into the brain because of its molecular shape. 
The alcohol reaches the brain and affects the different lobes that are responsible for functions like judgment, balance, and speech. 
These effects of alcohol on the brain give rise to the personality change often seen in intoxicated people.
The morning-after result of intoxication — a hangover — is caused by many factors, including dehydration and the type of alcohol drunk. However, the belief “liquor before beer, never fear,” may not be entirely accurate; there is no evidence to show that order has any effect on the feeling one has the next morning. 
In fact, it is thought that congeners are one of the causes of hangovers. Congeners — toxins produced during the fermentation process of making alcohols — are found in liquor, and darker liquors have more than lighter liquors. 
Other factors giving rise to hangovers are the amount drunk and the pace at which one drinks. However, it is difficult to judge what would cause a bad hangover and what would not.  Hence, the best way to avoid a hangover is to limit consumption.
While possibly the most common drug among college students, alcohol’s danger is easily the most overlooked. 
It is not easy to abstain from drinking forever in college, and drinking with restraint is the best way to stay safe.

Climate change, global warming, and ozone depletion are issues that have been discussed time and time again in the past few years. These issues basically boil down to two main points — first, that we are harming the environment, and second, that our actions are ultimately harming us. 
However, what exactly is happening to the environment that is so harmful for us? And more importantly, what is it that we are doing to harm the environment? 
While the topic of environmental damage is very vast, this article will address the issue in terms of one of the many problems we are facing today — that of ozone depletion.
To understand what the problem we face is, it is important to have a little background information on the subject.
 Earth’s atmosphere is divided into five main layers, starting from the nearest to the surface of the earth and going upward. These are, respectively, the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the thermosphere, and finally the exosphere. 
The ozone layer is found in the second layer, the stratosphere. This layer is made up of ozone molecules, which are made up of oxygen. 
While each molecule of the atmospheric oxygen that we breathe in is made up of two atoms of oxygen, ozone is made up of three. This change makes ozone vastly different from atmospheric oxygen. 
For one thing, ozone is blue in color and has a characteristic odor, and for another, the ozone layer is able absorb radiation that comes from the sun.
As explained on www.nas.nasa.gov when an oxygen molecule absorbs a short wavelength photon of light, the energy causes the molecule to split into two atoms of oxygen. One of these atoms collides with another two-atom oxygen molecule, forming a molecule of three atoms of oxygen — ozone. A similar splitting process occurs with the ozone molecules when they are broken down. 
Ozone formation and destruction thus goes on continuously, maintaining a constant ozone concentration. This cycle of ozone destruction and production is the reason behind the layer’s ability to absorb the radiation, especially the harmful ultraviolet radiation, coming from the sun.
A portion of ultraviolet light, called UVB, is especially harmful, as it can cause cataracts and a variety of skin cancers, damage crops, and also harm marine and wild life. 
As long as the ozone layer continued to absorb this radiation, the Earth was safe. 
However, with the thinning of the ozone layer, exposure to this radiation has become a serious concern. 
This raises the question of why the ozone layer is thinning in the first place.
Elements like chlorine act as catalysts in the breakdown of ozone. This means that they speed up the process of ozone breakdown without altering or getting depleted. 
According to an article on www.epa.gov, one molecule of chlorine can degrade more than 100,000 molecules of ozone before it is removed from the atmosphere. With atoms like chlorine present in the atmosphere, ozone gets depleted faster than it is recreated, and this results in the depletion of the ozone layer. Initially, chlorine was not much of a threat to the ozone layer as there was hardly any chlorine that high up in the atmosphere. 
However, with the advancement of technology, this scenario changed. As the article explained, science came up with new so-called “miracle substances” — chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs were not very toxic, not flammable, and very cheap to produce. Industries therefore flocked toward these substances and used them in a variety of applications — in hair sprays, as refrigerants, and in a variety of different solvents. 
It was not until the 1970s that people began to realize the harmful effects of CFCs. CFCs contain chlorine, but unlike many other chlorine-containing agents, CFCs are very hard to destroy. Most chlorine-containing compounds dissolve in water and come back down to the earth through rain. CFCs, however, do not dissolve in water. 
Hence, they cannot come down with rain and end up going higher and higher in the atmosphere. Ultimately, they reach the stratosphere, where the chlorine in them harms the ozone layer. 
Although CFCs are not the only substances that harm the ozone layer, they make up the majority of ozone-harming substances. The result of all these CFC emissions is that there is now a “hole” in the ozone layer that centers on Antarctica. The thickness of the ozone layer over a particular region changes with the season. The ozone hole over Antarctica is not really an area with no ozone, but one with a very thin layer.  NASA satellites have been keeping a tab on the thickness of the ozone layer over this area and send readings every day. However, it is not only Antarctica that has to worry about ozone depletion. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cites a study in which it was discovered that ozone levels in the middle latitudes — where most populated nations lie — decreased by 10 percent during the winter and by 8 percent during the summer. From 1973 to 2001, ozone levels have decreased by 2.3 percent every 10 years.
Although these statistics are somewhat depressing, governments around the world have taken steps to protect the world from the harms of ozone depletion. 
The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987. However, it was not until the year 1996 that the countries that had signed the protocol completely stopped the production of CFCs. Although no more CFCs were released into the atmosphere after this point, the harm that was done was already quite great. 
However, pacts like the Montreal protocol were useful in curbing the subsequent damage to the environment. 
Although harm has already been done to the environment, pacts like this have ensured that we do not harm the environment any more.

Polluted water harms citizens
The Hall-Massey family in Charleston, W. Va., has experienced horrible scabs on their arms, legs, and chest from painful rashes, as well as decaying teeth. This is due to the tap water that runs in their home. Tests show that their tap water contains such chemicals as arsenic, barium, lead, and manganese. Chemicals like these at such high concentrations could contribute to damage to the kidneys or nervous systems, or even cancer.
The Hall-Masseys are currently suing nine nearby coal companies for putting dangerous toxins in the water. It seems that this incident is part of a rising number of violations of the Clean Water Act that began many years ago.

Scientists find MRSA at beaches
For the first time, a dangerous staph bacteria has been discovered in the sand and water at five public beaches. Methicillin-resistant Staphyococcus aureus (MRSA) has been found along the coast of Washington, but scientists think that other states may also have this problem. MRSA infections are very difficult to treat and are usually rarely seen outside of hospitals. This bacterium causes skin infections and pneumonia, and is spread mostly through human contact. The fact that this germ exists at the beach must mean that people are picking it up and transmitting the bacteria at a higher level than scientists had originally thought.

H1N1 spreads across the nation
Health officials, on Sept. 11, announced that swine flu has now spread to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. H1N1 now represents the cause of the majority of the nation’s flu. Anne Schuchat, head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says that 98 percent of the viruses circulating are this H1N1 strain, the highest percentage that health officials have seen this early in the season. She explains that widespread vaccination against the flu would reduce its spread. A single 15-microgram dose of the H1N1 vaccine is well-tolerated and could boost immune response in healthy adults. Around 45 million doses of this vaccine are expected to be delivered by mid-October.

Gene for Alzheimer’s affects all differently
The gene variant known as APOE4, which increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, affects the brains of people in the mid-20s differently. In a study of 24 healthy adults, 12 of whom had the gene variation, both groups that had performed a series of memory tests achieved similar scores.
However, those with the gene variation have brains that are working harder or less efficiently. Co-author of the study, Jeffery Browndyke, director of the Functional Imaging Neurogenomics of Disease Lab at Duke University, believes this gene still needs further studies to determine its true effect on brain development and cognitive function of those who are at risk for Alzheimer’s.

Motorola releases new phone
Motorola has revealed a new smartphone called the Moto Cliq on Thursday that uses the Google Android operating system. 
This is the first Android phone for Motorola, and the main focus of the device is on social networking. Motorola has modified the Android user interface to stand apart from other Android phones by building on top of it. The unique aspect of this phone is that it comes with a service called Motoblur. 
Motoblur is built around social networking, and it features live widgets that integrate Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, MySpace, Yahoo, Last.fm, and more.
The Moto Cliq will be available on T-Mobile later this year during the holiday season.

Google to develop cheap solar panels
Google in 2007 announced that it would start scientific research in many areas, including areas of green energy sources. Currently, Google is looking into developing cheap solar panels that would cut costs by at least 25 percent. 
Google is trying to do this by using different materials to construct the reflective mirrors of solar panels; these mirrors would cost one half of the current price of mirrors. 
Although there is potential in this idea, the lack of government funding is slowing the process for further studies in green technology and testing of cost-effective solar panels.

Scientists find cause of potato famine
The Irish potato famine occurred in the 1840s and 1850s, and scientists have now unlocked the genetic code of potato famine. The potato famine was caused by a plant pathogen called the Phytophthora infestans. 
The genome of the Phytophthora infestans is very large, and this allowed the pathogen to take over the potato.
The size of the pathogen’s DNA is so large that it is similar to the size of an animal’s DNA. The pathogen’s DNA is large since 75 percent of the genome is filled with repetitive DNA that appears to evolve quickly. Scientists believe that this large size enabled the pathogen to infect potatoes that were genetically modified to resist such pathogenic attack.

Open source software helps cameras
Stanford scientists are on a mission to reinvent digital photography by designing open source software for digital cameras. This will allow a community of programmers to develop new tools for digital cameras. No longer will a camera’s performance depend on the manufacturer’s software, but more on a worldwide developing community.
The open source camera can be modified in many ways, including focus, exposure, shutter speed, and flash. The open source software will be made public with a year, and it might be a while before your next Canon or Nikon runs on open source.

“It’s really bomb!” said senior fine arts major Robin Scheines, as she dug into one of Oh Yeah!’s signature waffle and ice cream desserts. “I mean, who doesn’t like ice cream for breakfast?”
It’s easy for one to be intimidated upon entering the hippie ice cream haven on South Highland Street. Yet, bombarded by the list of over 100 toppings and “swirl-ins,” this intimidation is quickly replaced by an overwhelming urgency to be creative. What, exactly, can I make? Everything, apparently.
Oh Yeah! offers obscure add-ons for their waffle and ice cream creations, such as balsamic vinegar, baklava, Nilla wafers, marshmallow fluff, and — wait for it — love. After some serious deliberation, we decided to put our waffle fate in the hands of the knowledgeable ice-creamista, Oh Yeah! employee Alex Esker.
The $7 vegan cinnamon waffle creation Scheines and I tested, with raspberries and chocolate chips baked in, and complete with a Kahlúa ice cream topping, may seem a bit pricey, but the dessert is worth every penny. The waffle is crispy on the outside but has a flavorful fluffy interior, perfect to be combined with one of the soy or dairy ice cream flavors Oh Yeah! has to offer.
The regular waffle is big enough for two to split, so consider a “haffle” for $3. If choosing to cut the amount of batter in half, don’t skimp on the number of scoops or toppings — the reputable (and fantastic) Dave and Andy’s Ice Cream of Oakland supplies Oh Yeah! with their tubs of ice cream goodness. It really is difficult to go wrong with any ice cream flavor or topping — even if one was brazen enough to try the squirrel meat flavor.
Squirrel meat aside, this is not your average ice cream venue. Oh Yeah! exudes a unique, homemade feel. The owner, who goes by the name “Rooster,” built the counter and coffee bar from materials he found at Construction Junction, and keeps second-hand books and records in the back corner for those who want to take their sweet time savoring their creation or making use of the free wireless Internet. The walls are a gallery of license plates and highway signs, and cork boards post announcements of upcoming art exhibits in the area. The coffee bar is equipped with turquoise ceramic espresso mugs — a cheerful accompaniment to your daily dose of caffeine.
Esker warned of the crowds that begin at 8 p.m. on weekend nights and last until midnight.
“We get a lot of students from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, and a lot of locals as well, who are regulars at the coffee bar. On Friday and Saturday night, there is usually a line out the door.”
Although Oh Yeah! is in a more affluent neighborhood in Shadyside — surrounded by independent antique shops and nice restaurants — it is definitely tailored to a younger crowd. Oh Yeah! is off the beaten path for students, but, oh yeah — definitely worth a taste for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or a delicious dessert.
Oh Yeah! is located on S. Highland Ave in Shadyside. Visit their website at customswirl.com or contact them at 412.253.0955.

The Fat Koko is a cheese steak sandwich stuffed with french fries and mozzarella sticks. Now, if that doesn’t sound mouth-wateringly, arteries-cloggingly filling — how about peeled Chicken McNuggets boiled in a paste of their own breading and served over pureed fries?
The world of food blogging is full of these bizarre combinations and innovative recipes. The best sites do it all with a dash of humor and a pinch of salt. Add in a snazzy presentation and you get some of the most popular blogs on the Internet.
Dressing up droll foods
On a website garnished with the familiar color pairing of yellow on bright red, a warmly-lit picture features a moist creme brulee served alongside a strawberry tart. These decadent desserts, however, boast a rather humble beginning: a box of Dunkin’ Donuts.
Each entry on fancyfastfood.com comes with a recipe describing how to transform cheap fast food into more extravagant meals. In the case of our erudite sweets, the fillings of eight Boston Kreme, a vanilla cream, and three strawberry jelly doughnuts are extracted, morphing into the creme brulee, tart topping, and tart filling, respectively. Meanwhile, the actual pastry gets ground up and mashed together to form the tart’s crust.
From McDonald’s to 7-Eleven, the inexpensive offerings of many fast food restaurants are featured on this relatively new blog. Some entries even embed videos to illustrate how to create these radical recipes.
A feast for the eyes
A double bypass burger teeters precariously, weighed down by two fried eggs, five slices of bacon, and four slices of cheese. Being wedged between two grilled cheese sandwiches doesn’t help its foundational stability, either.
Photographs of this and other stomach-turning dishes on thisiswhyyourefat.com practically ooze fat onto your computer screen as your eyes bloat from the caloric intake. Each hunger-inducing image is accompanied by a tantalizing description like “Oreo cream centers removed and melted into a dip.”
While some of the ideas can nauseate even the most adventurous eaters — anyone for a burger topped with Easy Cheese inside a jelly doughnut? — the tendency of our species to crave fat and sugar is enough to drive this blog to popularity for a very long time.
Professional doesn’t always mean quality
Imagine going to a shop to get a personalized cake made. You have decided that you want the guest of honor to hack into his own face, so you provide the bakery with a flash drive on which you have provided the perfect picture to transfer onto the cake. As you open the box, you are presented with a painstaking replica of your flash drive in all its frosted glory. This true story is one of many painfully hilarious tales on the menu at cakewrecks.com, a blog devoted to bewildering blunders of professional cake decorators.
From malformed cartoon characters to misunderstood instructions — one gorgeous chocolate cake with a chocolate-dipped strawberry on top was marred by the inscription “Leave Blank” — Cake Wrecks does not fail to amuse and delight its readers with some of the worst excuses for professional products ever to come out of the world of cake.
A little taste after dinner
The simple formula espoused in American movies and television shows is that if a man takes a woman out to dinner, she is obliged to return the favor by providing a little “dessert” afterward. This is the creative energy behind cooktobang.com.
The recipes might be easier than pie for Julie Powell, but they are certainly presentable enough to entertain that fine guy or gal you’ve been hoping to coax. The savory “Atkins for Trouble Burger Salad” takes only 10 minutes and $8 to make and is a perfect protein-rich choice to precede some strenuous physical activity.
The simple dinners and quick desserts are designed to give the illusion of restaurant-quality food in the hopes of standing in for that expensive meal. What makes this blog so well-read, however, is that every entry drips with sarcasm and even peppers in a few jabs at the reader just for tuning in.
Playing with your food
From the delectably adorable to the certifiably peculiar, insanewiches.com offers readers a taste of some very unusual sandwiches — if you stretch the definition of sandwich a little.
One entry serves up a bread computer mouse with ham for buttons, paired with a USB cheese stick. Another gives you a sandwich somewhere between breakfast and lunch (though the author assures us it’s not brunch): a turkey and cheese club served on waffles — four of them — instead of bread.
While this blog doesn’t serve up the same kind of wit as the previous two, each entry is unique enough to bring readers back for more. After all, who wouldn’t want to see the next daily special from the site that brought you the ham, salami, capaccolo, and pancetta sandwich in a wine glass?
Rule 34, which, according to urbandictionary.com, states that “if it exists, there’s porn on it,” makes the Internet seem like an often frightening place to graze, but don’t let that stop you from enjoying the sugar and spice of funny food blogs. If you’re feeling creative, send an entry their way; these bloggers are always on the lookout for new ideas to broadcast to the world.

A friend of mine once told me that the most important moments of my life always occur around food, and this last summer was no exception. While at the French capital, I rode on the Parisian metro, walked my way through Paris, drank champagne on top of the Eiffel Tower, and tasted all the meals as if they were a dream.
I spent my time at École Centrale Paris, a French version of the California Institute of Technology, and I didn’t speak French then and still don’t speak it now. First of all, the name of the institution is misleading. There is nothing central about the location of the school, and it is situated in a town called Châtenay-Malabry, in the south of Paris.
École Centrale Paris is an engineering school and the alma mater of famous engineers, like Gustave Eiffel and Andre Michelin. But to the French, engineers are not just highly skilled technicians; they are entrepreneurs, managers, and much more. 
For this reason, the engineering curriculum at Paris includes such diverse subjects as philosophy and fine arts. During my time there, I took international business classes with other American students, and yes, the classes were in English.
There were some downsides to life in Paris, though. For example, there were no air conditioners in any of the school buildings (aside from a tiny hallway heading to the underground computer lab), and, for some reason, the French do not use deodorant, making situations uncomfortable for obvious reasons. 
But what I liked least about French lifestyle was the breakfast. On campus, breakfast was served between 7:30 and 8 a.m., while our classes began only at 9, and what made it worse was how the French enjoy having only bread and coffee in the morning. To be fair, they served baguettes and occasional croissants, along with coffee and juice, but these breakfast shortcomings were easily overcome by the delicious French cuisine.
At the first dinner hosted by the program, the school took us to a fancy restaurant. It was a French-Italian place, and the meal began with an appetizer of fresh, mild, and soft goat cheese sitting on a bed of rough tomato puree. The main course was pan-seared chicken on lentil risotto and the dessert was a mouth-watering amber apple upside-down pie served with coffee ice cream. Our professor asked us if we would like to have some wine because, at 20, it is legal for me to drink wine in France. Bread, wine, and cheese — what more do you need in life?
Wine in Paris is actually quite cheap. For four to six euros, you can buy some splendid wine. Once, I walked out of a fromage store — a French cheese shop — with fragrant bread, non-industrialized cheeses, and a bottle of red wine for less than 5 euros in total. A French lady taught me that you always get red wine with cheese and you should drink it at room temperature. I’ve never drunk wine aside from sipping wine from my parents’ glass, but now, every time I sniff a glass of Côtes du Rhône, the perfume reminds me of my time in Paris.
In France, my life flowed at a different pace. According to my schedule, class started at 9 a.m., but I could wake up at 9 and still be in class by 9:20 a.m. without missing anything. On the days I had class, the lectures were all three hours long, meaning that by four in the afternoon, I would have sat through six hours of lecture on the same topic. In this respect, I missed Carnegie Mellon. Lunch hours were different, too, stretching much longer, as the French are famous for their lunches.
I went to a restaurant called L’Ami Jean on the left bank of the Seine, and there I spent two hours having a glorious French lunch. At this small restaurant owned by the respected Stéphane Jégo, the bread on the table was a great sign because, from my experience, good bread promises excellent food. 
I started my meal with caramelized foie gras on a bed of seasonal mushroom with seared baguette. This foie gras was the best thing I have ever put into my mouth. It was not too fatty and was packed with flavor. The generous slab was lightly dusted with sugar and torched with fire, and the caramelized taste and salty aroma of the foie gras was heavenly.
The lady who served me was running around the little place trying to serve everyone else, too. Still, she patiently gave me a tour of the menu and recommended a sweet white wine to go with the foie gras. While I was waiting for my main course, a gentleman at the table to my left saw how I was beaming while eating my meal and struck up a conversation with me. I also had a conversation with a Canadian couple on my right when they saw me take photos of the food. Good food opens people’s hearts, bringing them together.
For the main course, I had lapin — French for rabbit — which had an intense flavor with various herbs seasoning the meat and the sauce. The French man who served me told me to “dig in,” and I used my hand, feeling the meat and the bone with my fingers, and savoring the experience. To finish off my meal, I had a delicate vanilla rice pudding, cooked to perfection. Every time I think about that meal, my heart beats faster, and I am reminded of why I love food as much as I do.
Like French food, the French are complicated, ornate, and effortlessly elegant. They don’t streamline, mass-produce, or industrialize their cuisine, their life, or their view of the world. The respect the French have for food, not just French cuisine, is the same kind of respect they have for their life. I am, truly, in love with Paris.

The Antonian Theatre at Carlow University attracted a large crowd last Saturday night. Fans of an incredible and electrifying genre of music, classical-rock fusion, were present to see a leading band that has made this fusion their trademark — Indian Ocean.
Indian Ocean is a unique band. With songs in over 30 different languages, their music is about the characteristics of a human being and the journey through life. The band members: Susmit Sen (lead guitar), Asheem Chakravarty (tabla, tarang, vocals), Rahul Ram (bass guitar, vocals), and Amit Kilam (drums, flute, gabgubi, vocals) are a group of very talented individuals who combine their skills to produce some of the most inspiring music out there today.
With five highly successful albums released so far and having performed in more countries than they can remember, including a show at Trafalgar Square in London, they truly are a band that is here to stay.
Sitting in the audience, watching them perform songs ranging from one about the journey of a bird titled “Bhor” to a Syrian prayer hymn titled “Kandisa,” I couldn’t help but notice the trance everyone around me was in. People were dancing in the aisles, clapping their hands in unison to the beat, and shouting out their requests — it was a sight worth watching. Fortunately for me, I also got a chance to interview one of the band members and co-founders of the band, Sen, and here are some excerpts from the interview:
The Tartan: How did you decide on the name “Indian Ocean?”
Sen: We went through quite a lot of options, but in the end it was my father that gave us the name “Indian Ocean” to reflect how we drift between different cultures and traditions.
The Tartan: How was the band formed?
Sen: I met Asheem at a concert in 1984 and we began doing duo sessions together. In 1990, Rahul joined us replacing Anirban [a previous member] on bass. In 1994, Amit joined us and the band has stayed the same ever since then. There was a lot of initial struggle as no music label wanted to invest in instrumental music, but slowly we found our place in the industry, and here we are today.
The Tartan: Your music is of a very different make. What are the major influences behind this form of music?
Sen: Well, there is no major influence as such. Since childhood, we have learned to keep our eyes and ears open to what’s happening around us, and it results in the way we think about our music. We usually don’t write our own lyrics. They are written by Sufi poets or other budding writers and we give those lyrics a sound that resonates its meaning. So essentially there is no major influence as such. If we like what we see, then we try and use our creative talents as artists to give it a form that can be heard by many others.
The Tartan: What do you do in your spare time?
Sen:  All of us quit our jobs way back and made the band our sole career. I have a lot of other interests besides music. I love painting; I am an ardent photographer; I also love cooking and experimenting with food. My biggest passion besides the guitar is probably wildlife, especially ornithology. I also enjoy watching and playing sports, especially cricket and soccer.
The Tartan: What are the future plans for the band?
Sen: Currently, we are on a 15-concert tour of the United States. You can visit www.indianoceanmusic.com to see our schedule. We have composed the soundtrack of one Bollywood movie so far, called Black Friday, and are in the process of composing music for a film called Shoonya.
At the end of the concert, Indian Ocean held a unique auction, asking audience members to bid for two songs that they wanted the band to play, and successfully raised around $1900 for Association for India’s Development (AID) Pittsburgh, the charity the concert benefited. Go to www.aidindia.org to learn more about their work.

Hayao Miyazaki, the mastermind behind Howl’s Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Totoro, has come out with another beautiful movie to add to his already impressive filmography.
Ponyo is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen’s tale “The Little Mermaid,” but contains a distinctly Miyazaki-esque touch. The new “mermaid” is a little goldfish named Brunhilda, later renamed Ponyo by the human boy, Sousuke, who finds her and takes her to preschool with him. Ponyo’s father, a sea wizard, is distraught at his daughter’s disappearance and eventually contrives a way to have her return. However, Ponyo doesn’t give up that easily. She drinks one of her father’s magical potions, starts to grow legs and arms, and then uses her newfound powers to free her other goldfish sisters to help her find Sousuke.
Ponyo, as is characteristic of Miyazaki’s films, has an interesting duality between man and nature. Ponyo’s father, it turns out, has forsaken living on land as a human because of the way that humans treat the sea, always polluting it and wreaking havoc with its ecosystem. He instead turns to the ocean as the source of his power and his home. Interestingly, the film explores the relationship between magical and non-magical worlds. While Ponyo is transformed into a girl, she is unable to perform magic, but can do it when she changes back into a goldfish. At the film’s end, she must make the choice of giving up her magic and living on land or keeping it and continuing to live under the sea.
Fans of mythologies and fairy tales from around the world will delight in the references and roots of magic explored in Ponyo. From classical myths to Japanese folklore to the intriguing inventions of Miyazaki, Ponyo is a feast of characters and enchantment, sure to please viewers looking for a new perspective on modern magic.
While Ponyo is entertaining, movie-goers are advised that, at heart, it is a children’s film. It does not have the same scope as Princess Mononoke or other deeper films of Miyazaki. This doesn’t prevent it from being a good film to watch or a fun experience, but it does mean that older viewers might find themselves wondering why certain things are happening the way they are — such as characters’ laughing at silly jokes, or the little kids’ being so willing to accept the balance between the magical and the mundane.
However, Ponyo allows Miyazaki a chance to exercise some of the whimsicality not seen since his celebrated character Catbus in Totoro. Ponyo’s father moves around in a chariot made of squids; he can summon schools of fish with a wave of his hand; and in order to survive on land and retain his magic, he must keep his feet wet at all times. Ponyo’s character also celebrates the strangeness of the undersea world, whether by her exotic name Brunhilda or by her immediate penchant for ham.
Overall, Ponyo is an admirable addition to Miyazaki’s films. Fans of his work should definitely check the movie out, keeping in mind that it’s much more like a Totoro for this generation than a film that is meant to ask deep questions. It can still be thought-provoking, but it does so on a reduced scale. Viewers be warned, though: the ending song of Ponyo is extremely catchy, if a little too sing-song, and will be stuck in your head for days to come.
As an animated film, Ponyo is highly recommended. Given the glut of computer animation crowding the children’s market at the box office these days, Ponyo’s careful, hand-drawn animation is a rare treat.

Junior electrical and computer engineering major Manasi Patil sucked delightedly on a lemon quarter. “This tastes just like lemonade!” she exclaimed. While it might sound strange that Patil felt she was drinking sweet lemonade straight from a sour lemon, she wasn’t imagining it in any way. She was, in fact, experiencing the effect of a marvelous creation called the miracle fruit tablet.
A freeze-dried form of a wondrous African berry called miracle fruit, this tablet, like the berry, has the ability to change the way the consumer tastes sour things and makes them taste sweet. It blocks the taste receptors in the tongue that taste sourness with a substance called miraculin, which allows sour things like citrus to be perceived as sweet. The effects can last from 15 minutes to an hour and can be eliminated by drinking some tea or hot water.
Last Friday, the Miller Gallery hosted a Taste Odyssey Reception, intended to provide a taste-tripping experience to the first 150 visitors by rewiring their taste buds with a miracle fruit tablet and presenting them with a plethora of sour foods to sample. Spread across two tables were glasses of sour lemon quarters, bowls of bright pink vinegar punch with yellow lemon slices, pale-green vinegar bubble tea, a plate of colorful sour gummy worms, boiled vegetables like radish and carrot, tiny cups of hot Tabasco pepper sauce, bowls of salty, vinegary potato chips, and pickled cabbage.
Visitors who wished to experiment — not all were very willing — were handed a tablet and instructed to let it dissolve gradually in their mouths. Once the tablet was all gone, the experimenting could begin.
Under the influence of the tablet, the sour gummy worms and potato chips were deliciously sweet, the vinegar punch milder than its usual self, the vinegar bubble tea milky, and, as mentioned before, the lemons tasted like lemonade. The effect on the Tabasco sauce was not very impressive, and the sauce retained its original fiery taste.
What was most exciting and confusing about the experience was the conflict between the senses of smell and taste. While drinking the vinegar punch, one could still smell the acidic odor of vinegar, but its taste completely contradicted what was expected. Also, it still caused a burning sensation in the throat, and Miller Gallery staff members advised against drinking too much of it, no matter how harmless it tasted, since it still had the same effect on one’s body.
These miracle fruit tablets are used for more than just recreation and do have a very useful purpose. They are given in unlimited supply to some of the most unlikely people — chemotherapy patients. Some of these patients, who have lost most of their sense of taste due to the continuous exposure to radiation, are using these pills to make food more enjoyable. Children who are cancer patients are also being administered a dose so that their medicine tastes better.
Miracle fruit is a unique manifestation of the mysterious ways of nature, and its effects are so surprising and delightful that everyone should, whether in berry or tablet form, give it a try. The tablet can be purchased online and one of the popular brands to look out for is Miracle Frooties. They sell a pack of 10 large-sized tablets for $14.95.

Set to debut on Sept. 18, HerCampus.com is an online magazine for female college students run by Harvard undergraduates, and senior English major and editor-in-chief of Carnegie Mellon’s first music magazine, The Cut, Elyssa Goodman, has been accepted as a writer and contributor to the magazine. Goodman says she is very excited to be “writing articles that appeal to the audience that I am actually a part of.” 
Founded by Stephanie Kaplan, Annie Wang, and Windsor Hanger, HerCampus is an expansion effort by these women who have already had a successful experience with their previous website FreezeCollegeMag.com, an online women’s magazine that’s been featured on rugby.com, seventeen.com, and collegecandy.com. Their clever tagline, “crimson is the new black,” sits below the masthead at the top of the website.  
In a letter published in the summer 2009 issue, Kaplan and Hanger, editor-in-chief and executive editor respectively, wrote that they were excited to see Freeze grow into HerCampus, with plans to establish branches at different colleges across the country. They, along with Freeze board members Annie Wang and Kelly Peeler, were one of the winners of Harvard’s i3 Innovation Challenge — a business plan competition put on by the Entrepreneurship Forum, Harvard Student Agencies, and Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard (TECH).
Their website is currently still under construction, but according to their Facebook page, their magazine is meant to “pave the way for the media industry to successfully make the transition online to keep up with today’s world. By providing both national and local content, Her Campus represents the future of online media.” 
Their redesigned logo is very attractive. The black-and-white photo features five silhouetted women, each active in their character, displaying a different facet of the female nature. An earlier draft of what Wang, their creative director, had been working on, shows a looser hand-drawn outline of five different women. This one has a more Sex and the City vibe going on with them standing in a row, arms interlocked like they are all good friends. 
“HerCampus is one of the few magazines aimed at an audience of college women. I think that what people can gain from it is feeling of connectedness to their demographic, one that has previously been overlooked by magazine publishers,” said Goodman. “HerCampus will be a place where people can read articles that actually pertain to them and their lives. Few, if any, other magazines currently do that.”
In the “Mission” section of their Facebook page, it says the editors “are launching Her Campus to provide writers with a needed platform to publish their writing while simultaneously filling a hole in the media marketplace, and advertisers with a new way to reach this valuable demographic.”
Using Ed2010.com, an online magazine job resource, Goodman applied, submitted her résumé and clips, and after making it to the next round, she pitched stories within the six article topics; style, love, careers, dorm life, world news, and health. Twenty girls were selected from students that applied from colleges and universities across the country. 
There are already suggestions for what will appear in the first issue on Friday. Facebook’s discussion board features two posts, one posing the question “What would like to see us write about?” with one response from Jean Kleimeyer, a student at Miami University in Ohio, saying, “I think a great topic would be the fat acceptance/positive body image movement.” 
Elyssa said she could balance this commitment with her senior year studies, adding that she is “proud to be working on a magazine that was started with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision of its goals. It reminds me of The Cut in that way. I know from experience that this isn’t an easy thing to do, and I respect the girls running it very much for that reason.”

The Steelers’ opening night victory brought much celebration in Pittsburgh. Since it was also the opening game of the NFL season, the spectacle was almost as big as the game, and country star Tim McGraw headlined a free concert for Steelers fans before the game. With all the talk about “America’s Favorite Sport” — and the debate over whether it’s baseball or football — I figured I’d give a little history on “America’s Favorite Music.”
According to a radio survey, more than 77 million American adults listen to country music on the radio every week. It is undoubtedly American, a part of the stereotypical American image here at home and overseas, and it has become “as American as apple pie,” despite the fact that the dessert has its origins in Europe. So how did it get this way? We owe a lot to one man: Ralph Peer.
In 1927, in Bristol, Tenn., Peer set up a recording studio in a barn and started running ads in newspapers and flyers looking for artists. Some people who had already recorded with or knew of Peer came first, then more people came as they began to hear about the kind of royalties his artists were getting ($3600 a year). Among the musicians who recorded were the famous Carter Family, the “First Family of Country,” and Jimmie Rodgers, the “Blue Yodeler.” Both acts found huge success, with Rodgers selling over half a million copies of his song “T is for Texas.” While so-called “hillbilly” recordings had sold fairly well earlier in the decade, these latest recordings were something new altogether. Blending secular ballads and gospel music with blues and a hint of jazz, along with a few good-time party and comedy songs, the music took off. The themes resounded even more during the Great Depression, and while most businessmen were out of luck and money on Wall Street, Peer continued to make large amounts of money simply from royalties. 
The legacy of the Bristol recording sessions is beyond measure. Besides the debuts of two of the biggest country music stars, they gave country a new sound. Where before what was labeled country was a mixture of hick tunes and old ballads, the recordings gave old folk songs and gospel hymns a cleaner, more refined sound. Country became more successful and began to speak to a wider audience. This paved the way for stars like Hank Williams and Johnny Cash.
So the next time you listen to any kind of country music, whether old or new, you can think back to a little barn in Bristol, Tenn., where it all got started.

Dear Rohit,
I have this really good friend of mine who’s just gone through a breakup. Unfortunately, she seems really caught up in it and it’s become the only thing we talk about these days. It’s come to a point that I just want to say “STFU,” but I know I shouldn’t because I really value our friendship and want to be there for her when she needs me as a friend. How can I forcefully say that while I feel her pain, I don’t think she’s benefiting from dwelling on it? She’s definitely the type of person who dwells on things rather than moving on. How can I tell her to stop thinking about it and return back to her normal friendly self?
—Painful Aftermath of Love
Dear PAL,
That’s a tough tightrope to walk — you want to be supportive of your friend, but after a while you get so sick of hearing the same thing over and over that you just want to tell her to get a grip on her life. You can try talking her out of it, but if she is the kind of person who dwells on things, then that approach just isn’t going to work. 
In my experience, the best way to get out of a situation like this is to gently push your friend toward new experiences. Try getting her involved in activities that will take her mind off the breakup. Avoid conversations that could lead to a talk about her relationship. If she’s complaining about something that happened, help her figure out something to do or say. Make sure you always take a hard stance on self-pitying statements. If she ever pulls out the “I’ll be alone forever, nobody will ever love me again” card, point out to her both the absurd falseness of that statement and the fact that she’s a beautiful, strong woman who doesn’t need a stupid boy. I am sure that eventually you will have her back as the friend you always liked.
Love is a two-edged sword,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
It’s the fall of my junior year, and my friends have started turning 21. Now, I would be celebrating, but my birthday isn’t until May! What am I supposed to do for the next eight months while pretty much everyone I like is bar-hopping?
—Sober in Skibo
Dear SIS,
First of all, if you’re going to be sober and sad, you shouldn’t do it in Skibo! It’s definitely not the most ideal place for it. The frozen yogurt might tempt you, but it’s best to take that order to go. More importantly, did you learn nothing from AlcoholEdu? If you can’t bear to be around friends that are mocking you with their drinking binges then get younger friends. Just realize that not being 21 is not a huge deal.
I am sure that there are other legal ways you can have fun. I personally recommend getting addicted to a TV show — they are really great to watch in a group and then discuss every single detail about them. You can also try and figure something out with your friends born after May.
I am sure that you will turn 21 in no time and be able to enjoy that Long Island Iced Tea. You can buy one for me, too. 
Bide your time,
—Rohit

100 Years Ago
Sept. 22, 1909
A “Special Notice” advertises that the only way to ensure getting The Tartan regularly is to subscribe at a lofty price of $1 for the year. I don’t know what kind of overhead costs there were 100 years ago, but I’m proud of the fact that you can all read my musings and ramblings completely free of charge (your Student Activities fee paid for all of this, of course).
50 Years Ago
Sept. 23, 1959
“Anyone Care to Shoot Bullets?” Quick, duck! No, wait, that’s just the very politically incorrect headline advertising varsity rifle team tryouts in Margaret Morrison. Apparently, the rifle team also gets its own beat writer — a luxury not given to other sports, such as baseball and water polo.  
25 Years Ago
Sept. 18, 1984
Apparently, over-selling of parking permits — which cost $130 apiece — was a problem 25 years ago due to construction in the lots at Skibo, though the Parking Department claims that the lots are not full. It’s a shame Carnegie Mellon had to go and develop its campus, losing precious, cheap parking spots that could have let certain drivers avoid street cleaning fines.  
10 Years Ago
Sept. 14, 1999
“Bookstore pisses off faculty member” is the headline in a letter to the editor (in poem form) from a professor at Carnegie Mellon. The professor is upset about current problems ordering books and is surprised to find bar codes lying in toilet basins. In layman’s terms, Carnegie Mellon was keeping inventory on piss — indirectly, of course.

A restaurant review for Zenith Antique Shop, located in the South Side, appears in this week’s issue. Zenith is a vegan restaurant that possibly has the greatest brunch menu in all of Pittsburgh — and yes, that more than includes Schatz. The premises also house an antique store that sells vintage clothing and an art gallery.

A Forum article argues that new corn syrup commercials that urge consumers to eat foods containing the product have been perpetuating unhealthy eating in America, where everyone is fat. The accompanying art even depicts a mountain of ice cream, cake, and fattening food sitting on the dinner table, while all the healthy items are out in the recycle bin.

On Sept. 9, Carnegie Mellon opened its doors to a variety of volunteer organizations, turning Rangos Hall into a venue for creating communities through volunteering and providing services that help benefit people all over Pittsburgh. 
It is an annual tradition that brings dozens of organizations to meet the different interests of the diversity of students on campus.
Some of the organizations present were Gwen’s Girls — which works to empower girls ages 8 to 18 to have productive futures through gender-specific programs, education, and experiences — and Dress for Success, which donates professional clothing to underprivileged women so that they can feel more comfortable in their work environments.
Jaime Rhodes, the development manager for the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, discussed the importance of fairs like this one.
“It allows students to learn about organizations that do not have a well-known name. Many people have never even heard of Crohn’s disease or colitis, so this fair lets us inform the public and also ask for their help.”
Katherine Forsyth, a first-year biology major, agrees with that sentiment.
“I found the volunteer fair to be very helpful because I was able to find a bunch of organizations that I wouldn’t have heard of if I didn’t come.”
Students who weren’t able to come to the fair still have a variety of options available to them to get information on various volunteering opportunities on campus and in the Pittsburgh area.
Elizabeth Vaughan, a coordinator for Student Activities, wants students to know that if they ever have a question about volunteer opportunities, they are welcome to come to the office of Student Activities located in the University Center.
“We will be more than willing to hook students up with organizations that spark their interest. Students can also visit www.cmu.edu/service to find out about some of the opportunities they may have missed.”
For students who are worried about the time commitment but still want to get involved, Student Activities has set up a Service Saturday, when they transport students to a different volunteer location every Saturday morning. Students can work every weekend or just once.
Emily Lambert, an AmeriCorps Scholar in Service, said, “There is a stigma that volunteering has to be a huge commitment. But volunteering can be whatever you want. It can be every day or it can be a one-time thing.”
Jim Bruhn, a volunteer and basketball coach for The Pittsburgh Project, an organization that works to build a community in which people can feel safe sitting out on their porches, said he was happy to be at the fair. “I am touched by the number of CMU students that visited the fair. 
We respect them all for coming.”
Successful volunteer programs in the past include the 1000plus program from last semester. 
The campus participates in one day of service in which many activities are occurring in Pittsburgh as well as on campus. 
The goal of the program is to get 1000 students to volunteer for the day. Check with Student Activities for information about 1000plus and other volunteer opportunities.

Free food was available throughout the University Center last Tuesday as the campus was presented with a Taste of the Tartans, a Dining Services showcase of all the dining options available on campus. Rangos Hall was home to this endeavor where students sampled food from the new café that will arrive in the Gates Center as well as food from the company in charge of our vending machines.
“It was a good way for people who may not be on a meal plan to get a taste of the food on campus without having to dip into our pockets,” said Chakana Mentore, a junior history major. “I was really impressed by the quality of the food. It really makes me consider jumping back on the meal plan next year.”
Along with the food vendors, tables were set up to represent green practices, offering information and tips on how to be environmentally conscious. Dining Services also set up a table where entries into a raffle for prizes were being taken. Winners could receive coupons for discounts at vendors on campus.
“I like that Dining Services is being more interactive with the students this year. With the addition of CulinArt, I’ve noticed more reasons for students to get excited about eating on campus, such as the coupon cards and the discounts often offered at the different eating locations,” said Saskia Op Den Bosch, a junior cognitive science major with a minor in Chinese studies.
Along with featuring the new food available on campus, Taste of the Tartans also served to promote other changes in dining, such as the Monthly Premiere program. This Thursday, in the Tartans Pavilion, CulinArt will sponsor a marathon of seasons one and two of the television series The Office from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m., followed by the season six premiere at 9 p.m.
There are also many other dining special events, including half-priced menus, raffles, samples, and nutritional advice. Providing healthy eating options was a student concern that Dining Services wanted to address.
“We know [students] have enough to think about without worrying about [their] next healthy meal,” said Anna Bullet, one of the culinary and nutrition specialists available to the campus community.
“I really appreciate Dining Services’ interaction with the student body and how they really care about our opinions and concerns,” said Eduardo Benatuil, a junior economics and global politics major and member of Student Senate. “When Kim Abel came to speak at our Senate meeting, she demonstrated that [Dining Services] is invested in pleasing the campus.”

“Being a Latino is definitely more than growing up in a Latin American country, speaking Spanish, or enjoying Latin food; it’s an innate attraction to do a little foot work when you hear salsa, to add extra sazon to food, and to celebrate all things specific to Latin culture,” said Alejandro Fernandez, a senior computer science major and former president of SALSA, the Spanish and Latino Student Association.
Hispanics across the nation will begin celebrating their rich variety of cultures this Tuesday as a result of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s declaration of Hispanic Heritage Week, later changed to the month-long celebration from Sept. 15–Oct. 15. The month gives Hispanics the chance to share their culture, their music, food, and entertainment, with everyone.
Hispanic Heritage Month commences at Carnegie Mellon this Friday with a Hispanic Networking Event at 5 p.m. in the Peter and McKenna rooms, followed by the University Center late-night event “Noche Latina” on Saturday, Sept. 19. 
The Office of Student Affairs will release further information about events planned throughout the next month.
Last year, nearly 300 people attended the popular “Noche Latina” late-night event.
“A big event celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month was missing when I came to CMU,” said Lynna Martinez, an academic adviser in the Carnegie Mellon Advising Resource Center (CMARC), from whom the concept of the event came. 
“It’s about music, dance, art, food, and inviting everyone to partake in the Hispanic culture.” 
Last month, the nation read headlines of the newest associate justice of the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to hold this position. Her election represents the growing representation of Latin Americans in government. 
About 46.9 million Hispanics currently reside in the United States as of July 1, 2008, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Latino population serves as the fastest growing minority. They are soldiers and colleagues, blue- and white-collar workers that take a handle in the wheel that spins the nation’s economy; they are your fellow students here at Carnegie Mellon University. However, often the music, food, and entertainment extinguish the rich historical significance of Hispanics in America.
Spaniard Juan Ponce de León led the first confirmed landing in the continental United States in 1513 on a shore he called La Florida, later the state of Florida. 
The Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon, and the Great Plains.
Today, national organizations like LULAC, the League of United Latin American Communities, champion efforts for civil rights for Latinos in the United States. 
While the historical significance of Hispanics ranges from César Chávez and Dolores Huerta organizing migrant workers to the 1960s Chicano Movement, the importance shifts toward the 21st century, a period in which Carnegie Mellon takes a role in offering Hispanics the opportunity to become future industry leaders.
The State of Diversity at Carnegie Mellon University annual report states that Hispanic students comprise 5 percent of the campus community. 
“Because of the small Hispanic population on campus, the Latino community really doesn’t thrive here at CMU,” said Christian Aponte, a first-year aspiring Hispanic studies major. 
“Hispanic Heritage Month provides that distinct time of the year where Hispanics at Carnegie Mellon are free to express their culture and share it with others who have not had the opportunity to learn what we are about.”

The Tartan Rewards Program is a new spirit initiative that will track student attendance at select intercollegiate events throughout the year and reward participants. The idea behind the Tartans Rewards Program spawned from last year’s football program. “We realized how many students enjoyed the many giveaways that came out of Jared and Pooja’s football fever initiative last year, but we decided to go in a slightly different direction,” said Rotimi Abimbola, a senior social and decision sciences major and Student Body President.
Some of the benefits of participation in the Tartan Rewards Program are giveaways and prizes, a chance to earn points for your team toward the Tartan Olympics, and a $500 grand prize. Winners could also earn tickets for the end-of-the-year raffle and attend the SuperFan Banquet at the end of the year. The Student Athlete Advisory Council will supervise a check-in table at each of the Rewards Games. Students must bring a student ID card to receive credit for attendance at the games.
The development of the program came from looking at the programs at similar schools. “We found out that schools like Emory have very similar programs that reward students for high attendance at athletic events,” said Abimbola. “We have tailored our Rewards Program to the Carnegie Mellon community and we are continually making efforts to enhance the new program.”
Abimbola and Student Body Vice President Adam Klein understand the desires of Tartan athletes. “As athletes at Carnegie Mellon, Adam and I saw a need to rally the student body around the impressive sport teams that we have at Carnegie Mellon,” said Abimbola.
Cheerleading team captains Amanda Wilczynski and Carolyn Johnson commented on their job as cheerleaders and the importance of fans. 
“Fans’ being present at games helps to boost school spirit and pride,” said Wilczynski, a senior professional writing and English double major said.
“A cheerleader’s job is to motivate and inspire the crowd. But if no one is there, we serve no purpose. CMU is a community, and when a sports team is performing, fellow students should go out and support them,” said Johnson, a junior civil engineering and Spanish double major.
Fans like Joe Frick understand their importance and are very supportive of the Tartans.
“You want to contribute to the game in any way possible, whether it’s screaming, cheering, whatever. It allows you to show your Tartan pride,” said Frick, a first-year computational finance major. 
Because of fans like Frick, the Tartan Rewards Program’s top fans will be rewarded for their attendance.
“When the game isn’t going in our favor and we have to tell each other to keep our heads up, seeing and hearing fans reminds us that we’re playing for more than ourselves,” said Evan Moss, a first-year mechanical engineering major and football player.
Abimbola says that student government worked closely with the Career and Professional Development Center, the Athletic Department, the Student Athlete Advisory Council, and Carnegie Clan. 
“We are [also] in the process of reaching out to major corporate sponsors to supply prizes for students that come to several athletic events,” said Abimbola.
The attendees of last Saturday’s football game against Ohio Wesleyan got free T-shirts offered in a variety of colors. The next two Rewards games will be on Friday, Sept. 18 — the volleyball crossover tournament — and on Saturday, Oct. 3 when the men’s and women’s soccer team play Chicago. Rita’s Italian Ice will be given away at both events.
Check out www.cmu.edu/athletics/rewards/index.htmlfor more information and the dates and locations of Rewards games.

House Wars have returned to Carnegie Mellon. Except this time, all dorms are in the mix and are competing to be the most carbon-efficient residence hall on campus. StepGreen, a new computer program led by Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute, separates each dorm and tracks every student’s daily actions while judging them based on the level of carbon emissions. Dorms are competing to have the lowest daily carbon score.
The competition has already begun, and as of Saturday morning, Morewood E Tower is leading the way. Morewood Gardens, Margaret Morrison Apartments, and Stever House follow, respectively.
“I think the element of competition will encourage some people to at least evaluate their level of emissions, if not reduce them,” said Lizzy Madden, a senior public policy and management major.
Once registered with StepGreen, a student is asked to input his or her daily actions. The program not only immediately calculates the carbon emitted and adds points to their dorm, but additionally provides the student with feedback for recommended alternatives and the money and carbon that would be saved.
“It is a grassroots effort to bring change at an individual level — motivating people to live green,” said Pratibha Singh, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon and part of the HCI initiative. “All our actions create some kind of waste. Over-consumption of natural resources in an unsustainable manner without even being aware of the damage we are causing is a problem today.”
Carnegie Mellon already leads the way in green dormitories, but Singh suggests that green living goes beyond green buildings, such as Stever House, that are LEED certified.
“I remember one student mentioned that Stever House would easily beat every other dorm in the green dorm competition we are holding,” she said. 
“A green building is different from green living. You may have a green building, but if your day-to-day habits are overly consumptive, it causes carbon dioxide emissions that could have been avoided.”
The site provides detailed feedback in carbon emissions and alternative savings. Setting a computer to automatically hibernate, for example, saves almost $50, as well as about 617 pounds of carbon emitted, per year. Recycling newspapers and magazines saves almost 30,000 and 8000 pounds of carbon emitted, respectively. The site is full of these types of actions, and their resulting carbon footprints.
Students interested in signing up can go to cmu.stepgreen.org. Questions can be directed to stepgreen@cs.cmu.edu.

There is no Cuba after Castro… at least for now. The 83-year-old comandante has been subject to jokes about his immortality for some time now, with good reason. After Queen Elizabeth II, he is the one leader who has maintained the position of head of government for the longest period of time. 
It is common knowledge that stability has never truly found a permanent place on Cuban soil, and Fidel Castro certainly did not fall from the sky straight into power. Unfortunately for Cuba, Castro has been pretty fortunate. His rise to power was carried out without any major mishaps, and fortunately for him, Castro is a smart guy and has, throughout the years, perfected the strategy that keeps him in control.
Cuba was definitely doing better before the establishment of Castro’s totalitarian regime in 1959; however, this is not to say that the country was exactly doing well. Fulgencio Batista had already taken power by force long before that, and it would take precisely someone like Castro to get him off the throne.
Like most leaders of totalitarian tendencies, Batista, also known as “the Man,” began his political career being regarded as a hero. A young sergeant in 1933, he led a rebellion with labor leaders and students against dictator Gerardo Machado. Not too long after, he conspired with United States ambassador Sumner Welles to get provisional president Ramon Grau San Martin off his seat.
In 1944, however, respecting the electorate’s choice, Batista returned the presidency. Not long after, in 1952, he seized power again through a coup d’etat. From then on, it was on between him and Castro, who belonged to the party that had been running against Batista’s when he took power by force in 1952.
When Batista’s army could not take on Fidel’s, Batista fled to Spain with a fortune of around $300 million that he had managed to amass. Ironically enough, he died after living peacefully and comfortably in Marbella, Spain on Aug. 6, 1973 — two days before a group of assassins appointed by Castro reached him. Perhaps it was the same bug of paranoia that prompted Batista to flee Cuba that sent Fidel after him. That is, after all, what a dictator’s influence feeds on: paranoia and brute force. 
Cuba is a nation that, before it became frozen in time by the reversing power of a totalitarian regime, had existed for nearly five centuries, and as a republic for 57 years. Cuba’s favorable agricultural industry — primarily sugar and tobacco — along with the collaboration throughout the years between the island’s different sectors and the hard work of its society in general had set fertile ground for progress in the country.
But in Cuba, despotism has been a persistent enemy of progress. The centralization of power is so ingrained into the way Cuban society perceives everything that it becomes hard for an individual to come up with an idea of change without the substance to even construct the thought. 
Power has now been transferred to Raul Castro, but change will still not show its face. The Cuban population is still not allowed to collaborate for causes or organize in any way. Even if Fidel is no longer physically active, the idea of him still hangs on all of the political proceedings and foundations of the Cuban government. President of the Union of Cuban Exiles in Puerto Rico Mariluz Suarez is not optimistic about Raul’s potential to direct Cuba in the right direction. 
She states, “The personal history of Raul, who is not a charismatic leader, of ruthlessness and greed, does not herald a bright future for the Cuban people. If anything, the changes that Raul has claimed worldwide, such as the right to own and use a cell phone, are nothing more than cosmetic. Who can buy and pay for the use of cell phone in a place where the average salary is equivalent to twenty dollars?”
In other words, Raul is perhaps just a puppet of this system. He operates under the same ideology, the only ideology that will keep the system alive: careful and coldly premeditated manipulation of the masses.
The Obama administration has certainly begun taking steps toward mending relationships with Cuba. For example, shortly after taking office, Obama lifted restrictions on the possibility of individuals visiting relatives in Cuba, as well as sending them remittances.
This represents an important shift in a U.S. policy that had remained mostly unchanged for as long as half a century. However, while we like to look optimistically upon such “advancements,” we are forced to remain hesitant, since the system has proven stubborn throughout history — it drives us to believe that no real change will come until it springs from the Cuban government itself.
UCE President Suarez seems to agree. “There is a worldwide expectation that with the ‘disappearance’ of Fidel from public view, the system that has strangled the economy, the liberties, the hopes for a better life in Cuba will somehow change positively. The system is firmly established in the island, just as it was established in Russia for various decades. In the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, after the deaths of Lenin, Stalin, Breznev, Kruschev, etc. — the iron fist of Communism was not abated. So will it not be in Cuba, where nothing will change for the better, since the system is entrenched in all the aspects of everyday life, and there is no liberty of expression, reunion, or political views.”
In short, we must view this regime for what it is if we wish to do away with it. The key is definitely Cuban society itself. Communism will die when Cuba and its people are ready to let it disintegrate, when they realize there is another way, a chance for a better life.
As younger generations come of age, communication with the outside world will continue increasing and will subsequently feed the dreams of the Cubans.
The regime controlling these people’s minds and lives will be done away with as soon as circumstance allows them the social capacity to shatter the habit of fear and blind obedience that is keeping them subordinated.
Mariluz Orbay-Cerrato (morbayce@) is a junior English major.

This is written in response to an article that appeared in the Aug. 24 issue expressing concern for the conversion of the UC Art Gallery into a conference room. I serve as a coordinator in the Office of Student Activities, and I previously was responsible for managing the UC Gallery. I am also an alumnus of the university, having graduated as a studio art major in the College of Fine Arts in 2006.
The decision to convert the space was a difficult one, but weighing the need for this space by our office, the conclusion was reached that we needed to expand in order to support our work. Our administrative office works to support the 250+ student organizations on campus, and the expansion of our office space will now serve as a meeting location, a storage space for the materials that we use for annual events that we coordinate on behalf of students, and office space for graduate students and undergraduate office assistants that we employ.
What made the proposal for altering the space compelling is that in tracking participation for exhibitors and spectators, the UC Art Gallery space was under-utilized. I believe that there were only four students who chose to display in the space for the entire 2008–2009 year and I was in contact with the School of Art and members of student organizations to try and bolster the schedule. Even with some of the most compelling and beautiful shows, it appeared that few people would enter the space. The remaining biweekly shows were substantiated by the Division of Student Affairs and campus partners in support of thematic events tied to heritage months or in tandem with annual conferences.
As one used to getting down and dirty as an art major, I can say with a degree of certainty the UC Gallery is not an ideal space to display artwork. Artists could not nail into the walls, could not alter the structure of the space, and could not leave the space dirty. All wall-hanging works needed to be suspended from a track system, which made it difficult to display pieces at a uniform height, and materials utilized for suspending works in the space was a consistent point of frustration. Video artwork and installations were difficult to manage and maintain, as closing for the gallery would be managed by various individuals from the UC staff.
I believe that, given the parameters, those displaying in the space found it difficult to “make it their own,” something which is afforded by other spaces on campus. One such gallery is The Frame, run by students on campus with support from our office. Artists looking to display on campus are welcome to visit our office to explore other potential locations. The Student Activities staff is committed to meeting the needs of our students and supporting the wide breadth of interests that each of our students has.
Taylor Grabowsky, Office of Student Activities

Drunk college students in the city of Pittsburgh, take note: Before this week, it hasn’t been against the law to urinate in public.
The city council tentatively approved a proposed ordinance last week that would stop people from urinating or defecating in public places or on private property without permission. This ordinance grew out of both Pittsburgh council members’ and citizens’ distaste with people using the bar-filled South Side neighborhoods as public restrooms.
With no law in place, police have been forced to resort to state laws to cite offenders, which in some cases would result in a state charge of lewdness, placing citizens on the list of registered sex offenders.
Council members will meet Tuesday where a final vote on the pending legislation could make the new law permanent. If the legislature goes through, the penalty for each violation will be $500.
We at The Tartan are surprised that a law against public urination and defecation did not already exist. It’s rather amusing to think that prior to this week, residents were technically allowed to urinate wherever they so desired.
That being said, we are all for making the city cleaner and more livable for the city’s residents, and eliminating public streets and buildings as bathrooms is definitely a step in the right direction.
We all know how badly Porta-Johns smell, and it would be great if the city was kept from smelling like that as well, especially with our already polluted rivers. The law seems to be the ideal way to keep the city stench free, and also would fill in a legal gap that seems to just be a manifestation of one of the rules we all learned in kindergarten. 
We are glad that the city council is trying to keep public places clean, and we applaud Carnegie Mellon students and staff for making use of the restroom facilities on campus instead of taking the liberty of relieving themselves on the Cut or by the Fence.

Sometimes, going to a school like Carnegie Mellon, which I believe is at least fairly diverse, I forget that racism and discrimination exist and are practiced elsewhere. Especially in times like those we’re living in now, where we have an African-American President, it continues to surprise me when I read about cases that I believe are blatantly discriminatory.
Such is the case of Brandon Carl Huntley, a South African citizen who was recently granted refugee status in Canada after claiming persecution in his home state.
Huntley claimed that whites are targeted by blacks in South Africa, and that he himself had been targeted seven times in cases of attempted robberies and muggings. He also claimed that the government does nothing to protect their white citizens. After hearing his arguments, the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board, which is a tribunal independent of the Canadian government, issued their decision to grant Huntley the refugee status that he asked for.
I find the board’s decision disgraceful and appalling on a number of levels. I admit to having very little knowledge of international politics, but even I know that the racial situation in South Africa is one that was already volatile before this decision was made.
And by granting Huntley refugee status, the board is reinforcing the dichotomy that already exists between whites and blacks in that country, and also reinforcing Huntley’s claim that the South African government is not doing what is necessary to protect its citizens. I can see no positive outcomes that will result from the board’s decision.
In addition, I feel that the board has put too much weight on Huntley’s claims, and has not done enough research into the reality of the situation. Maybe if they, like me, had watched the Disney Channel’s classic movie The Color of Friendship, they would have a different verdict on the matter. While I know I probably sound slightly ridiculous basing my interpretation of reality on a Disney Channel movie, it actually did a good job painting a fairly accurate picture of the political happenings of South Africa, which I did learn more about later from more reputable sources.
But even from the movie alone, I learned of the injustices that existed for blacks in South Africa: that while they may have technically been the racial majority in the country, they certainly were not treated as such. To imply that Huntley, as a white man in South Africa, would be targeted in a discriminatory manner is ridiculous. The movie may have been obviously preachy, but it did well in delivering its message in a way that kids watching the movie would understand, and it was a message that has since stuck with me. 
I am also doubtful of the board’s basing their decision on Huntley’s claims that he was targeted for attempted muggings and robberies. As we have lately been reminded, muggings can happen even in places that we believe to be secure, whether it’s an intersection that is seconds away from campus or a suburban neighborhood. And while I am certain that South Africa does have secure neighborhoods, I am sure they have less secure ones as well. And muggings and robberies will occur, no matter your race, political party, or what country you live in or hail from. I do not believe that being the victim of a mugging is cause to be granted refugee status in another country.
And Huntley’s claim that the government is not doing all that it can to protect him and its other citizens is one that strikes me as doubtful, as well. I feel certain that the South African government is doing its best to cut down on crime in their country against all of its citizens. But I think it’s safe to assume that blacks and whites alike are experiencing criminal acts, and if Huntley’s claim is to be used as evidence, it should be a claim that the government is not protecting all of its citizens from crime, not just one racial group.
I am certainly saddened that Huntley does not feel comfortable or safe enough to live in his own country, and that he must instead plead to live in another, and that he believes that his government is not doing all that it possibly can to protect him, one of its own citizens, as a government clearly should.
But I am even more saddened by what I believe will come of the board’s decision. When making the ruling, the panel chair of the tribunal stated that it was clear that Huntley would stand out like a “sore thumb” in any part of South Africa due to his race, a comment that I find racist and unfitting to be made by the man who holds the position of panel chair.
I can only hope that the repercussions of the board’s decisions do not serve to reinforce the already existing racism in South Africa, although I fear that they will.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is Forum editor and would gladly watch The Color of Friendship with the board to help them re-think their decision.

“I don’t know how I came upon this. I hope I didn’t buy it.” Those were my thoughts when I was browsing Tchaikovsky symphonies and happened upon a quaint little album entitled “Erotic Sex Classical Music.” My instant reflex was to navigate away from that page quicker than a szforzando. My next thought after that was, “what the hell?”
The quote was not mine, but came from the sole reviewer of the 2001 album, whose cover features an outstretched, unclothed back interposed with a violin. Brave Sole Reviewer and potential owner of the album gave it one out of five stars, lamenting that “the music is fine, but the effects just sound too contrived.” For “Pachelbel’s Canon,” the third track on the album, I can see how that’s the case. For overall effect, I was pretty intrigued. Aforementioned reviewer continued: “Sex, I like. Classical music, I like.” Well, there you go. Shocking as it may seem, the two aren’t that far apart.
Classical music has long held an elitist image. With record sales dwindling and concert audiences diminishing, classical music can no longer pride itself solely on virtuosity and genius in this generation, especially when this generation has the attention span of a 140-character Tweet, or when this generation produces Miley Cyrus. Either way, the common consumer finds classical music too abstruse, too stuffy, too “above-the-average-Joe.” A theory is that perhaps classical music has so few patrons because it only caters to an audience of “elitists.” The logical step for the survival of classical music was to distribute the art form to the masses, and in doing so, appeal to the most basic instinct of human nature: sex.
Using sex to sell music is hardly a new idea. Wikipedia tells me that Italian opera composers such as Verdi and Donizetti scored their works for the allowance of exotic, probably very bare dancers. I also learned from the classic tome Classical Music for Dummies that the ladies would swoon when the handsome pianist Franz Liszt strode onstage. The Harvard Dictionary of Music or the NPR Curious Listener’s Guide won’t tell you that the guy that wrote those ballads your  sister pounds out at home was a total pimp. Maybe that’s the problem — that’s what pushed people over the edge to try to start making “Pachelbel’s Canon” erotic.
I did a little more research into the apparently not mutually exclusive arenas of classical music and sex, and by research I mean more than your standard American Pie band camp joke. When I investigated further into using sex to sell classical music, I found the strapless gown fashions of German violinist Anne Sophie Mutter (look it up), the deliciously tight jeans of violinist Joshua Bell (really, look this one up), and the wet T-shirts of British violinist Vanessa Mae (now you’re really intrigued to look these up).
Throwing you off a bit? Shocking that not all classical musicians are unattractive drones? You mean you didn’t find your high school band concerts a prime location for spotting hotties?
“Just think of those orchestral musicians perspiring in their tight funeral black,” joked Ivan Hewett in the UK Telegraph.
So what about the great debate of producing music accessible to the masses versus preserving its artistic integrity? Is there a way for classical music to remain true to its highly-educated culture and appeal to the average Joe? On the one hand, you could build up your CD collection with the snootiest, highest-quality Deutsche Grammophon or Sony Classical records (with fully tuxedo-ed maestros on the cover, mind you). Or you could not be too aware of where you click on the “related searches” button and end up on the sketchiest Amazon.com product page I have ever seen. Classical music can throw you a curveball like that.

The maps are posted. The signs are up. The little cigarette butt receptacles are in plain sight. But is the smoking policy being enforced? 
Of course not.
A common complaint among non-smokers is the walk to class behind a smoker — it’s quite irritating to breathe in someone else’s poison with no way to avoid it. In addition to providing a clean air environment for all, another goal of the smoking policy was to help eliminate litter — namely the cigarette butts that are often haphazardly tossed to the ground — from all over campus.
The changes to the smoking policy underwent a great deal of debate in the past year. Committees that were composed of a diverse group of students and staff were formed to debate the changes to the policy that were being considered, as well as to decide upon the new areas where smoking would be allowed. After a preliminary period of time where students were warned when they were not obeying the new policy but not fined, the changes went into effect permanently.
Previously, we strongly speculated that once the school year began and the “new” smoking policy were fully enforced, very few would actually obey the new regulations willingly. We also predicted the lack of repercussions that would ensue for breaking the smoking policy.
It is true that University Police has been a little preoccupied with handling a different threat to our campus’s health, though with the swine flu subsiding (hopefully), we wonder if the university will now turn its focus to this smoking issue on campus and continue with its campaign for a healthy campus in 2010.
And if the university is going to focus on the newly enforced policy, more needs to be done than posting signs in a few locations around campus. An effort needs to be made to ensure that the campus community is well educated on the policy and all that it entails, and the fines that are mentioned on the signs dotting the campus need to be actually enforced.
We hope that the university’s attention will be turned toward enforcing the policy and setting a precedent for the future, and we look forward to experiencing a clean air campus and keeping our lungs healthy in the future.

President Obama’s address to schoolchildren last Tuesday has been the reason for a large amount of uproar recently. Days before the speech was given, it was met with opposition from Republicans and parents. While the White House maintained that the speech was meant solely to encourage students to work hard in school, many parents were concerned about the speech imparting a political agenda on their children’s minds.
In order to emphasize the fact the speech was not intended to have any political influence on the children, certain controversial lines in the speech were rephrased before it was aired. As stated on ABCnews.com, the speech originally asked the children to “write letters to themselves about what they can do to help the President,” but this line was later changed to “write letters to themselves about how they can achieve their short-term and long-term education goals.” In spite of this, many parents across the nation requested that their children be allowed to engage in different activities during the time of the speech and not be forced to hear it.
Wanting to make an impact on the nation’s youth and encourage them to do well in school is not a crime. We believe that Obama was justified in wanting to spread some general advice to the children on their first day of school. That being said, parents do have the right to control what their children see and hear at a young age. Not knowing what the contents of the speech were, parents were rightly concerned about the speech influencing their children in the wrong way. Their concern does not mean that they were completely opposed to the idea of the President talking to their children. Many parents felt that they should have been able to watch the speech in advance so that they would know what their children would be hearing. 
We understand the justifications of both the parents of the children and Obama in this case. Both were justified in their causes and ultimately wanted the best for the children of this nation. We also hope that in the future, the President can take advantage of the usage of different forms of media and technology, and post his video to YouTube for parents’ approval before it’s shown to children.

In just a few short days, leaders of the most prominent countries of the world will be gathering in Pittsburgh for the G20 Summit. With so much at stake on an international scale, Carnegie Mellon students should keep themselves updated about the discussions and debates that will occur not far from the heart of our campus. As Student Body Vice President and President, Adam and I will do all that we can to provide information to the student body, both from the administration and through various student groups and organizations in regard to specific issues discussed by G20 world leaders.
Our primary event for promoting awareness for the summit will take place this Friday, Sept. 18 from 4–8 p.m. at the Fence/CFA Lawn, with the rain location in the UC Kirr and Wean Commons. Dubbed “The G-20 Awareness Fair,” this event will be co-sponsored by Student Government and AB Special Events. We are working with various multicultural, political, and service Student Organizations to put together a really awesome event that will provide information about what the G20 is and will allow for interactive sessions where students wishing to take a more active role within the Awareness Fair may voice opinions and promote specific concerns with many student leaders and organizations. It is also an opportunity for you to come and learn more about what will be happening in Pittsburgh around the G20 and how you can get to these events. As an additional perk for all those who attend, food will be provided!
It is unlikely that such an amazing opportunity for Carnegie Mellon students to gain a greater understanding of international current events will occur again during the rest of our time here at Carnegie Mellon. We ask that each student take at least a few minutes out of their Friday evening to come to the G-20 Awareness Fair to collaborate with the many student organizations that will be there and learn about various issues in our international society. These issues are the problems and discussions that we will have to encounter and solve within our lifetimes, and it is important to acquire as much information as possible so we may make a difference when the time comes. As Carnegie Mellon students and pioneers in education, we can do no less.
As always, feel free to contact me at rabimbol@ or Adam at agklein@ if you have any questions or concerns. Check out the student government website at stugov.andrew.cmu.edu for updates on our initiatives, and meet us at our weekly office hours every Friday at noon, either at the UC black chairs or by the Fence.
