Sophomore mechanical engineering major Christian Heaney-Secord, who is well over six feet tall, is known to the Carnegie Mellon tennis team as Big Chris.
However, Heaney-Secord didn’t enter Carnegie Mellon the year after he graduated high school. Instead, he took a year off to follow his 14-year-long passion for tennis and trained at home in Westwood, Mass.
During his gap year, Heaney-Secord also took two calculus courses to stay on top of his academics.
But being on a team again allowed him to develop a dynamic with his Tartan teammates. “It’s one of the exciting parts about playing college sports, competing with teams against other schools,” Heaney-Secord said. “It’s a way that I can express my passion for the game in a competitive environment.”
So far, Heaney-Secord’s proudest moment came from his match against No. 5 in the country, North Carolina Wesleyan College. “The match was tied at 4–4, and I won my match in three sets to clinch the victory for the Tartans,” he said.
Heaney-Secord’s passion for tennis has not gone unnoticed by his teammates either. “Big Chris always strives to do the right thing by putting in the hours of practice, holding himself to a high standard, and offering to help someone in need, whether it be a stranger or a friend. Anyone would be frickin’ stoked to have Chris as a teammate,” sophomore Bryce Beisswanger said.
Specifically, Heaney-Secord is looking to the team’s first-years to be key contributors. “I think the freshmen are an amazing group of people; each different personality adds something to our team dynamic,” he said.
Heaney-Secord was too humble to set personal goals for this season, but he set the team’s overall goal high. “I want to win a D-III National Championship as a team,” he said.
Assistant tennis coach Mike Belmonte, however, has set some specific goals for him. “Christian came back for his sophomore season looking very sharp. He spent a lot of time over the summer improving certain areas of his game, and I can already see that he is much improved from last year. He has continued to work hard so far this season, bringing a great attitude and good energy to every practice. We expect big things from him this year, and I am confident that he is up for the challenge,” Belmonte said.
Senior Jooho Yu agreed, saying, “I have a ton of respect for Big Chris as a player, teammate, and person. It’s clear that he worked very hard on his game over the summer and the entire team is expecting huge things from him this year.”
Off the court, Heaney-Secord works hard on his academics. “My favorite class was my engineering class where we made submarines out of plastic and a bridge that our teacher walked across out of cardboard,” he said.
After graduating, he hopes to get an engineering job in Hawaii so he can live near one of his teammates, first-year Paul Okuda.

The women’s tennis team made its yearly trip to Fredericksburg, Va., where they played in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Southeast Regional Championships, hosted by the University of Mary Washington. The Tartans were competing for spots in the ITA Small College Championships, hosted in Mobile, Ala.; however, the team did not have any women qualify this year. Nevertheless, the ITA Regional welcomed the team with warm, sunny weather for play.
The tournament was based solely on individual performances, and gave the first-year team members a taste of the broad range of talent in Division-III tennis.
First-year Elizabeth Martin played confidently throughout the tournament. Martin seeded ninth and battled her way through the draw, defeating the fourth-seeded Elaine Baik of John Hopkins University in a marathon three-set match 6–1, 4–6, 7–6 (2) in the quarterfinals. 
Martin saw some relief with a quick 6–1, 6–3 victory over Shannon Herndon of John Hopkins University in the semifinals.
In the finals, Martin was topped by Washington and Lee University’s Meghan Buell 7–6 (2), 6–4. Prior to the finals, Buell defeated Carnegie Mellon junior Katie Cecil in the semifinals and first-year Abbey Hamstra three rounds before.
Martin was not only Carnegie Mellon’s top finisher in singles, but also in doubles. She paired up with sophomore Bryn Raschke, and the duo made a push all the way to the semifinals. They went into the tournament as the fifth seeds and finished within the top four. In the semifinals, Martin and Raschke faced Buell and Washington and Lee University’s Claire Cahill, losing the pro-set 8–6.
“I had some real tests physically and mentally during ITAs, but I felt all the training and coaching I’ve had in the past few weeks helped. It was really exciting being able to represent Carnegie Mellon in competition,” Martin said.
Senior Alex Tapak and sophomore Angela Pratt defeated every team they played in the Blue Draw for doubles — which was not part of regular tournament play — and brought two trophies back to Carnegie Mellon.
“We lost some great seniors last year, but this tournament showed that we’re still going to be solid and competing with the top teams this year,” Raschke said.
The women’s tennis team will wrap up their fall season at home with a match on Friday against Oberlin College at 4:30 p.m.
Editor’s Note: Alex Tapak is Sports Co-Editor for The Tartan.

The Tartan football team tried to keep its undefeated streak alive Saturday when playing the No. 17-ranked Wabash College Little Giants in Crawfordsville, Ind. After a tremendous first quarter, in which the Tartans jumped out to a 21–7 lead, the Little Giants played big and took the game from Carnegie Mellon, 54–28.
Junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein had a good day throwing the ball, completing 17 of his 24 passes, but only found the end zone once in a pass to senior running back Patrick Blanks.
Blanks also scored another time running the ball, and junior fullback Zachary Erra-Hernandez scored in the rushing game.
The offense, as a whole, played solid football. However, it was a complete lapse on the defensive side of the ball, evident by the 54 points Wabash put up.
The number of fumbles in the game was also overwhelming, as the Tartan offense fumbled the ball three times, twice with Wabash recovering.
The Little Giants racked up 556 yards of total offense and averaged a monstrous 8.1 yards per play. Carnegie Mellon had trouble corralling the Wabash speed, losing in number of tackles to the Little Giants, 80–59.
Missed tackles is a problem that needs to be addressed as the team heads into this week’s game against the Denison University Big Red.
However, the highlight of the game came on a Wabash punt fielded by senior cornerback Sam Thompson at the 8-yard line. Thompson returned the kick 92 yards for the touchdown in the first quarter.
That play should have given the Tartans more motivation and drive, but the touchdown seemed to light a fire under the Little Giants instead.
Senior quarterback Chase Belton had a great all-around performance for Wabash College. His 13 for 23 passing for 183 yards is modest, but he did complete four passing touchdowns and ran in three touchdowns himself. Belton rushed 20 times for 193 yards on the day.
On Saturday, the Tartans play Denison University at home. Kickoff is at 1 p.m.

Forty-five years ago, the Boston Red Sox were in the midst of a tight pennant race with the Detroit Tigers and the Minnesota Twins to win the American League Championship Series. With the help of their left fielder Carl Yastrzemski and his .513 batting average, five home runs and 16 runs batted in (RBIs) over the last two weeks, the Red Sox claimed the American League pennant.
While they eventually ended up losing the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, Yastrzemski’s final two weeks propelled him to win the Batting Triple Crown and to be voted as the Most Valuable Player (MVP).
Yastrzemski was the last player to lead his league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs at the end of the season. Now, in the midst of another tight pennant race, Tigers third baseman Miguel Cabrera has a chance at the Triple Crown. The difference is that most of baseball doesn’t really seem to care.
Baseball is a sport steeped in tradition. Zealous baseball historians have been fighting instant replay for years because it would take away the human element and add a technological one. When Commissioner Bud Selig instituted interleague play in 1997, old-time players and fans nearly revolted. 
But baseball has finally entered the modern age with its expanded instant replay, its constant interleague play starting with Opening Day in 2013, and now its acceptance of new and improved statistics.
Many of baseball’s old statistics didn’t show a player’s true contributions: Batting average does not account for the added benefit of walks and sacrifices; RBIs are more related to one’s position in the batting order and the ability of the players before they get on base than to one’s ability to hit.
In the 45 years since Yastrzemski won the Triple Crown, all three parts have become less revered and relevant — the steroid era has made the home run lose much of its former luster. Cabrera is currently just one home run behind the Texas Rangers outfielder Josh Hamilton, and is leading in both batting average and RBIs.
However, he is still a second thought in the MVP conversation behind the Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout, a rookie who was in the minor leagues for the first month of the season.
Cabrera still has a chance at MVP, especially if the Angels miss the playoffs and the Tigers can hold off the Chicago White Sox to win the American League Central. The fact remains, however, that he will by no means be the unanimous choice. This is a sure sign of the times: Trout is an example of the new baseball player, while Cabrera exemplifies the old-school hitter.
Trout is the leader of the new wave of five-tool players like Washington Nationals rookie Bryce Harper who excel at the plate, on the base paths, and in the field. Cabrera is a better hitter than Trout, but Trout is a far better base runner and a Gold Glove-caliber fielder. In recent years the MVP award has rewarded the best all-around player rather than the best hitter, and this is where Cabrera is at a stark disadvantage.
Had he played 45 years ago, Cabrera would be celebrated and guaranteed MVP recognition. But today, with fans, journalists, and teams focused on the all-around contribution, he is viewed as a one-trick pony. Cabrera is arguably the league’s greatest hitter, but the game now focuses on all aspects, not just the glamorous ones.
The Triple Crown has become a relic of a former era of baseball, before “moneyball” and sabermetrics. While there will always be places in the league for players like Cabrera, he and the Triple Crown will not be viewed with the same admiration as they were back when Yastrzemski won. Instead, they will be stuck in the shadow of the 21-year-old rookie leadoff hitter who has more stolen bases than home runs and more runs than RBIs.

Carnegie Mellon’s volleyball team hosted the Waynesburg University Yellow Jackets last Wednesday.
The Tartans lost a close first game (25–22), so the team knew it needed to make some improvements.
“The game against Waynesburg started off slow,” first-year setter Emily Lawlis said. “But after the first match, we came together and agreed to focus on our side of the court. We picked up our energy level and cut down our errors.”
After the first game, the Tartans bounced back to end the match with a 3–1 (25–22, 25–16, 25–16, 25–10) victory.
Before the Tartans took the last three games, junior outside hitter Senna Parsa noticed some things that needed to change.
“It took us a while to get our hitting on point, and we as hitters weren’t being smart with our ball placement,” Parsa said. “Once we got comfortable with the holes they were leaving in the blocks and in the middle of the court, we mixed the offense up with some tips to the middle and some short kills through the seam of the block.”
Sophomore right side hitter Ali Celentano led the team with 14 kills against the Yellow Jackets. Parsa had 12 kills and 15 digs. Junior middle blocker Olivia Mora proved to be a presence at the net with nine kills and five blocks. Sophomore libero Ali Nichols tallied 27 digs. Lawlis collected a season-best 24 assists.
Although Lawlis is only a first-year, she loves the support from her older teammates.
“The upperclassmen are all helpful and encouraging to everyone,” Lawlis said. “They do their best to include the freshmen in everything, on and off the court. I couldn’t ask for better teammates.”
Last weekend, the Tartans traveled to the University of Chicago to play in the University Athletic Association Round Robin No. 1.
Their first match was against host University of Chicago, and then they played sixth-ranked Emory University.
The following day, the Tartans matched up against New York University.
In order to come home with victories, Lawlis believes enjoyment is a big part of the game.
“We need to have fun,” Lawlis said. “When everyone plays their best and has fun while doing so, we win.”
Parsa thinks that positive thinking can benefit overall performance.
“As a team we need to remember that there’s nothing we can do about that point that we just gave to the other team,” Parsa said. “We just have to shake it off and focus on what we can do to get the next point. Right here right now.”
The Tartans will then host the University Athletic Association Round Robin No. 2 in Skibo Gymnasium.

Since the year 2000, 85 graduate students from American universities have been invited to join the prestigious Siebel Scholars community, which represents the year’s best in the fields of business, bioengineering, and computer science. The last U.S. News and World Report rankings put Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science at No. 7 nationally and No. 9 globally for computer science.
Given that, it may come as little surprise that five Carnegie Mellon computer science graduate students are this year’s newly named Siebel Scholars: Ruta Desai, Sanjiban Choudhury, Martina Rau, Min Kyung Lee, and Zeyu Zheng. They will each receive a $35,000 scholarship to go toward their final year of study. However, this award does not stop at the check. At an annual conference, Siebel Scholars meet with leaders from their fields, discuss major issues, and give their input for the Siebel Foundation’s research.
“The benefits of becoming a Siebel Scholar are more than financial: They become part of a worldwide community of scholars, engaged in initiatives of societal importance, under the direction of Tom Siebel,” Randy Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science, explained.
“I really want to know what impact I can create as a Siebel Scholar and that I really don’t know yet,” said Desai, a master’s student in robotics whose research focuses on legged robots. “We are going to a conference, and there I can learn what exactly I will be able to do when I meet other amazing people with whom I can collaborate.” Desai described how grateful she was to her advisers for their support after she came to the U.S. to study. With this award, she is excited for the opportunity to give back to them.
Choudhury is a graduate student researching engineering problems in autonomous helicopters.
“For me at least, it would be just to have a wider perspective of things,” Choudhury explained as his goal as a scholar. “It’s to be responsible, because we are at a stage where it’s not enough to think about our own fields but to really apply and expand your thinking into all issues.”
“Being recognized as someone who’s good in research motivates me to do more good research and to fulfill that expectation,” said Rau, a Ph.D. student in human-computer interaction whose research focuses on intelligent tutoring systems.
Not only is being a scholar a chance to improve the world;  as Rau suggested, it is also a chance to improve oneself.
Lee, another Ph.D. student in human-computer interaction, whose research works to optimize human-robot interactions, agreed. She said she finds inspiration looking at the other recipients. She recalled how she looked at other scholars’ online profiles, and realized that they apply their research toward making products that help people.
“This is something that I want to try to do,” Lee said.
Zheng, a graduate student in the Language Technologies Institute researching social domain adaptation, also expressed gratitude for being named a scholar. “I think that I just feel very honored to get this,” Zheng said. “It’s very influential and you have many opportunities here. I think it’s just a wonderful experience.”
“Every year, the School of Computer Science gets to select five graduate students to become Siebel Scholars. Given that we have over 600 students in our M.S. and Ph.D. programs, it’s highly competitive,” Bryant said. “We are pleased that our students are able to participate in this program.”

World hunger and malnutrition: issues that many want to solve, but have yet to do so. However, Philip LeDuc, a professor in mechanical engineering, and Mary Beth Wilson, a Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering, are applying engineering to food in a way that could create a long-term, sustainable solution to malnutrition in Africa.
LeDuc claims that the best ideas come “when you just open your mind sometimes.” That’s what happened in his case: When a ketchup company contacted LeDuc for his expertise in mechanics, he decided to see where it would go, despite laughing at the idea that mechanical engineering had anything to do with ketchup. He soon realized that the way tomatoes are mashed and how they are transported through pipes for packaging affect the taste of ketchup.
“It’s like how my mother used to make mashed potatoes by mashing them herself — it was delicious,” LeDuc said. “Then she bought a blender and used the same exact ingredients as before ... but when she pressed 10 and puréed them, it turned into this soupy mess that my brothers and I refused to eat.”
Everybody loves good ketchup, but LeDuc thought the concept of using mechanical engineering to make food more palatable could be used in a more meaningful way. That’s when he turned to Wilson, his graduate student, whom he remembered had a penchant for cooking.
“I started looking into molecular gastronomy,” Wilson said. “What if you could use scraps of food, like peels, and turn it into something good?”
A few months later, LeDuc received an email from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation about its Grand Challenge Exploration Grant, a $1 million award for a research idea that explores nutrition for infants and children.
“What if you could take a nutrient-rich plant that already existed inside a third-world country, but people just wouldn't eat it?” LeDuc explained. “And what if you could use mechanics to change that taste, to make it from something they don’t like to something they do like?”
Wilson did some research and found that there is a weed called amaranth that is high in vitamin A and other nutrients, but is not eaten because of its bitter taste.
“What made amaranth attractive was the widespread nature of its growth and the fact that there are many varieties throughout the world,” Wilson said. “Also, since it is a weed, it can pretty much be grown anywhere, so we figured it could be grown in Pittsburgh.”
In a mere 10 days, LeDuc and Wilson went from being intrigued by the concept of how mechanics could affect food palatability to writing a proposal for the Grand Challenge Exploration Grant. His project would use mechanical engineering to study how different methods of preparing amaranth could change its taste, as well as increase its nutritional value by altering the plant's cellular structure to optimize the release of its nutrients during digestion.
Several months later, their hard work and creative thinking paid off: They received the grant.
For the past year, LeDuc and Wilson have been exploring the effects that different ways of preparing amaranth will have on its nutritional value. For example, chopped carrots retain most of their vitamins while steamed carrots lose their water-soluble vitamins.
“We are taking the plant and we’re cutting it up in different ways and at different speeds,” LeDuc said. “For example, how does making it very fine versus chopping it into bigger chunks change the nutritional value?”
Along the way, they have had help from the Phipps Conservatory, where the amaranth is grown. And, as it turns out, the president of the Amaranth Institute, which is devoted to studying how the plant can be better utilized, is a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who has been eager to help out the researchers.
“It’s in its early stage, but it has high end potential,” LeDuc said. The project explores a new field of science and tackles a tremendous goal: ending world hunger. “But that’s what we’re about at Carnegie Mellon,” LeDuc said. “High risk and high rewards.”

A 2005 survey conducted by Research!America found that only 18 percent of Americans said they personally know a scientist. Many hypothesize that this is due to a lack of dialogue between scientists and the general public. To help change this, a new program starting this fall aims to encourage researchers to open up to the public and speak a language everyone can understand.
“We feel very strongly that communication with the public is an important part of what we do as researchers,” Jesse Dunietz, a Ph.D. student in computer science, said to a room full of researchers at the first session of Public Communication for Researchers (PCR).
Dunietz serves as president of PCR, a program he co-created with graduate researchers Ardon Shorr, a Ph.D. student in biology and mechanical engineering, and Adona Iosif, a Ph.D. student in machine learning.
“By learning the skills that we need and feeling more comfortable with this sort of thing, we’ll be able to make a difference,” Dunietz said.
One of Shorr’s motivations for the program is to unlock the “beauty” of the ideas that motivate scientists to do the work they do, such as using a pipette to tediously move millions of drops of liquid from one place to another.
“It’s not for the money, and it’s definitely not because we like pipetting tiny drops of liquid,” Shorr said. “It’s because we’re working on some of the most complex ideas that we’ve come up with as a species, and it’s a shame when that story doesn’t get out.”
Dunietz came up with the idea to start the program last June, when he attended a lecture at the Carnegie Science Center titled “Is there a war on science in the U.S.?” After the talk, which touched on the existing disconnect between scientists and the public, an audience member asked the lecturer, the Center’s director of Science and Education John Radzilowicz, why researchers didn’t receive the training to reach out to the public.
The idea came to fruition after three months of careful planning, with Radzilowicz teaching researchers some basics in discussing their work with the public and the media during the first PCR session, held Sept. 20.
“I believe that public outreach is really part of the scientific enterprise now,” Radzilowicz said to those in attendance at the first PCR session. “It used to be something that some people could do and some people wanted to do, and I’ll argue as we go along that it’s now something we must do.”
After discussing some of the basics of effective science communication, Radzilowicz had those in attendance practice by explaining their research to those around them in as few words as possible. As a test, those who received the explanation were asked to describe their peers’ research to the audience.
Melissa Day, a chemical engineering Ph.D. student who researches potential impacts of climate change on air quality, attended the first session and was pleased.
“It was especially haunting and motivating to hear two specific points he raised: that many people don’t know practicing scientists, and if you don’t convince a kid that science is cool and a viable career by age 11, odds are you’ve lost them,” Day said.
Amy Nagengast, a Ph.D. student in both civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy, said she hopes to improve how the interest in science is perceived.
“To put it bluntly, I would like to break the stereotype for young people that geeks are not cool,” she said.
The next PCR session, which will teach attendants how to more effectively tell science stories, will be held Oct. 11.

At last year’s Meeting of the Minds undergraduate research symposium, skeletons of characters gracefully walked around the screen of first-year computer science major Hank Zwally’s laptop in a high-quality, 3-D environment. His independent study research, which aimed to create a video game, would eventually lead to the start of his own company.
Fast-forward through finals and summer vacation, and Zwally and his team are applying their research on a fully developed version of the technology presented last spring. Since Meeting of the Minds, their company — Mojo Game Studios, LCC — has begun its work on its premiere product, a game scheduled for release in early 2014. In the fictional land of Annora, players will be able to choose a character from five unique character classes, each with six distinct weapons. The decision on the game’s official title is still pending.
Zwally, now a sophomore, is president and executive producer of Mojo Game Studios. He described the game as a “first-person adventure fantasy RPG with goals to combine immersive, emotionally tantalizing, and provoking scenes and environments with exceptional and revolutionary first-person combat.” Mojo Game Studios’ goal is to produce a game as skill-based and fluid as Halo while as aesthetically pleasing as Crysis 2, all applied to a medieval melee combat environment.
The team aims to redefine the experience of playing a traditional character class. For instance, the “Ranger” class fights as an archetypal marksman at long ranges, and as the distance between the character and its target decreases, the motions and attacks increasingly transition into that of a unique marksman/ninja class.
The company, consisting primarily of full-time students, believes it is on track to completing its goal of making a superior first-person role-playing game. They are employing CryENGINE®3, considered by game reviewer IGN to be among the best game engines on the market, and are coding primarily in C++ and C#. Their team of 10 students from last semester has expanded to 30 globally distributed members from Carnegie Mellon and abroad.
Zwally’s company is made up solely of volunteers. One of the key factors to the volunteer-based enterprise’s success is its contributors’ enthusiasm for the project and their self-driven natures.
“We are using one of the best game engines in the industry, and this foundation will help our own work be even better,” said Ben Chung, Mojo Game Studios’ technical director and a sophomore computer science major. “I am excited about all of the potential, and hope that our technical work will allow our game to really shine.”
Josh Eiten, a sophomore Bachelors of Humanities and Arts student, feels the same way. Eiten — who is the company’s creative director and lead concept artist — and Chung are two of the core members alongside Zwally.
“I’m both living my dream and tackling exceptional problems that arise in globally distributed software development,” Zwally said regarding starting up and running such a project. “I think the biggest problem we have so far is working with a team that has varying levels of commitment and involvement and [that] these people are also globally distributed.”

Everyone knows that sleep is important, but many of us tend to let sleep take a backseat to all the other activities that fill our busy lives. Many combat a lack of sleep by taking naps in class or by indulging in a dose — or multiple doses — of caffeine. This may help us get through a day, but that lack of sleep can add up, and the consequences of consistently not receiving enough sleep can be detrimental.
Without sleep, many aspects of our body — such as muscle repair, memory consolidation, and the release of hormones — fall out of rhythm.
There are multiple stages of sleep, each of which individually contributes to rejuvenating the body. In the first stage, the body slowly becomes disengaged from its surroundings as the body temperature drops. As the body enters a deeper sleep, the brain remains active as the involuntary nervous system maintains breathing and a slower heart rate and relaxes the muscles. The most important aspect of this stage is the release of various hormones that travel through the body’s circulatory system. These hormones are essential for growth and development.
About 25 percent of human sleep is characterized as Rapid Eye Movement (REM), sleep that occurs at 90-minute intervals from when we fall asleep. During these intervals,our body releases high amounts of melatonin, activating pathways that play important roles in providing energy to the brain and body.
People typically experience most of their dreams during REM sleep. During dreams, areas of the brain associated with learning and memory are stimulated, and limb muscles become temporarily paralyzed so dreams are not physically acted out by the body. A single night’s sleep may produce many dreams, but people typically only remember the dream from the most recent REM phase. Currently, there is no consensus among the scientific community as to why people dream and what purpose dreams serve.
A survey by the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) found that 87 percent of people watch TV or use a computer within an hour before going to bed. 
These bright lights can suppress the body’s output of melatonin, a chemical that controls sleep and wake biological clocks. Many students study late into the night on their laptops, which stimulates the mind instead of relaxing it, making it harder for the body to get the rest it needs.
Professionals at the NSF suggest that people should sleep in a place different from where they work so that the body recognizes a specific place, such as their beds, for sleep. 
The amount of sleep necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle drops slightly as a person ages, but doctors advise that teenagers and young adults should get 8–9 hours of sleep per night. HelpGuide.org states that trying to function the day after losing four hours of sleep can be equated to driving with a blood alcohol level of over 0.1 percent, which is over the legal limit.
In addition to the immediate effects of losing sleep, such as decreased productivity, the lack of sleep can lead to health problems in the future. Hormones released during sleep play important roles in preventing weight gain and lowering blood pressure. Without this regulation, one faces a higher risk of obesity, heart problems, and early-onset diabetes.

Study shows bias persists for women in science
A new study by Yale University researchers revealed that science professors prefer male applicants to their female counterparts. The study gave biology, chemistry, and physics professors at six major research universities one of two résumés and asked them to rate the applicant’s competence on a scale of 1–7.
The two résumés were identical, except one had the applicant named “John” and the other “Jennifer.” John had an average score of 4, while Jennifer only registered a 3.3. The bias was equally prevalent across all scientific disciplines, and among both male and female professors.

Scientists find area  in brain used for gluttony
Scientists from The University of Michigan may have found a region of the brain that contributes to obesity. The researchers studied the activity of a particular region of the brain, known as the neostriatum, while their lab mice were eating M&M’s; they observed a spike in a particular neurotransmitter called enkephalin.
The rats began to gorge themselves after their neostriatum was injected with enkephalin, eating as much as 5 percent of their body weight in chocolate and having to be forcibly removed from the treat. The researchers believe this may help scientists understand the neurochemistry behind obesity.

Elusive element 113 created at last, scientists say
Japanese researchers believe they may have created a new element with 113 protons — dubbed element 113. The element is synthetic and not found in nature, and if its existence is confirmed, it fills a current hole in the period table.
The team has been working for years to create the element, which they synthesized by combining one zinc nuclei (which has 30 protons) into a layer of bismuth (which has 83 protons). The scientists hope that creating larger elements will help them to understand how atoms work in the natural world.
If confirmed, this would mark the first time that Japan has created a new element.

Breast and cervical cancer genes show similarities
Researchers have delved into the genetic markers of breast cancer, publishing their data in the journal Nature. The research will help doctors understand the genetic causes of tumors in different cancers.
The study was based on which genes are overactive and lead to tumor growth. The scientists discovered that one type — the aggressive basal-like tumor — has cells similar to those found in cervical cancer. Researchers believe chemotherapy that targets cervical cancer may also be beneficial for basal-like tumors. The influx of genetic information may help pave a path toward better drug development.

Social bullying prevalent in children’s television
A recent study published in the Journal of Communication revealed that 92 percent of children’s television shows involve some form of social aggression.
The study analyzed the top 50 children’s programs and looked for examples of social bullying — such as gossiping — and observed whether the bullying was punished, rewarded, or justified. The researchers found that most of the bullying was verbal aggression, and hope the research sheds light on the causes and dangers of social bullying.
“Parents should not assume that a program is okay for their child to watch simply because it does not contain physical violence,” said lead researcher Nicole Martin.

Eroded rocks show hints that Mars had water
Recent images from NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity show that the planet had a stream of water at some point in its history. The images are of an eroded rock with pits of smooth pebbles and gravel, an indicator for a stream of water “ankle deep,” according to Jim Bell, a planetary scientist working on the mission.
Peter Doran of the University of Illinois, Chicago, claims that the rounded grains in the rock are too large to have been smoothed by the wind.
The new information shows stronger evidence for water than ever before, giving more information to determine if sustained life was ever possible on the red planet.

Swarms of yinzers, hipsters, families, and students converged on Pittsburgh’s Cultural District on Friday to experience this season’s Gallery Crawl, an event that showcases Downtown. Visitors are allowed free admission to over 30 art and entertainment venues around Liberty and Penn Avenues.
The Wood Street Galleries, located at 601 Wood St., displayed work by a number of authors who focus on experimental poetry, fiction, history, and geography. The exhibition — titled The City & The City: Artwork by London Writers — explored new ways of combining art and writing in examination of the modern city. Guests were welcomed inside with the deep hum of vibrating tribal music.
A set of velvet curtains were pushed aside to reveal a room covered in four separate projections of slow city scenes. “Flying Down to Rio” by artists Chris Petit, Emma Matthews, and Iain Sinclair presented a vague and uneasy view of city streets. Viewers’ dark shadows were forced into the projections, propelling them into the imaginary, time-warped space.
“Sight Unseen” by artist Rachel Lichtenstein displayed precious Old World jewelry, bottles, and treasures in dimly lit display cases. Viewers had to wait in a small line to get a closer look at the delicate items. Lichtenstein’s display corresponds with the launch of her new nonfiction book Diamond Street: The Hidden World of Hatton Garden. Hatton Garden is London’s secretive diamond and jewelry quarter, home to a private community of craftsmen.
Their experiences and memories piece together the fragments of “Sight Unseen.” Lichtenstein commented that she wanted “a slightly Victorian era feeling to it, and an out of time, mystical sense to it.”
Down the street in the SPACE Gallery at 812 Liberty Ave., crawlers were greeted with a more modern, interactive take on art in an exhibit titled Circles of Commotion and Moving Pauses. A huge, seemingly paint-covered boat — beautiful, blue, and mysterious — stood in front of viewers. A strange maze of video projections and almost translucent mirrors confused onlookers as they struggled to make sense of the path and the artwork.
“It’s actually a really cool experience,” said sophomore Chris Skaggs, a double major in decision science and philosophy, as he made his way through. “But I imagine this is what it’s like to trip acid and have it not go well.”
A DJ set up by the front windows of SPACE added loud, pounding sounds. The noise, which at first contributed to the strange, futuristic nature of the show eventually became an annoyance that drove people out of the room. Stepping back outside into the night air was a sensory relief.
Perhaps the most welcoming portion of the Gallery Crawl was found in the small food and art booths set up in cozy nooks between buildings. Smoke from the small BRGR stand wafted into the night sky, illuminated by strings of lights. Crowds of people meandered around in the cool night air, surrounded by the Downtown skyline.
Further down Liberty Avenue, smaller galleries welcomed visitors. Recent Carnegie Mellon alum Martin Swift (BFA ’12) displayed work at Currency, 937 Liberty Ave., with a group of other young artists. His three paintings — titled “Oscar,” “Luca,” and “Tyler” — towered over visitors. The scene at Currency was more lighthearted and less crowded than the more professional scene at Wood Street Galleries.
Other notable artworks displayed were a series of metallic, textured panels and an axe sticking out of the wall slowly burning incense. “This might be my favorite gallery,” said Nicole Anderson, a sophomore Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student. “It feels familiar, like CMU. I could see this in the Miller Gallery.”
A perfect end to the night for crawlers was finding the Cell Phone Disco, a huge screen in an alleyway that visualized the electromagnetic field of a cell phone. The installation art piece featured thousands of small ligwhts illuminated when someone near it made or received a phone call.
Pittsburgh welcomed new and old visitors to the rich arts and culture scene in Downtown. The Gallery Crawl only happens four times a year, so mark your calendar for the next time it comes around.

Hot dogs: The food of choice for baseball games, backyard barbecues, and drunk college meals across America. One bite into a tasty hot dog recalls memories of home and comfort away from angry professors and annoying obligations. Such comforts are not readily available through on-campus dining — and even when they are, they leave one feeling empty in both wallet and stomach. Here we lay out a number of locally available hot dogs from the fancy to the plain, from costly to cheap.
BRGR
BRGR’s approach to burgers involves fresh, local ingredients and inventive, gourmet condiment combinations, so it shouldn’t be a surprise to hear that its approach to hot dogs is the same. BRGR, located in East Liberty at 5997 Penn Circle South, has two hot dogs to choose from on its menu: the Triple Delight Dog ($8) and Smith’s Local Hot Dog ($5). The former takes an Asian fusion approach to the hot dog, with Asian slaw, pickled cucumbers, jalapeños, toasted sesame seeds, wasabi aioli, and furikake (a Japanese condiment containing dried fish and seaweed) piled on top of a beef hot dog. The Smith’s Local Hot Dog doesn’t come with such toppings, but for $2 more, we added guacamole, hot mayo, and bits of bacon.
The hot dogs were surprisingly large — they were nearly twice the diameter of all the other hot dogs we tested — and, as one might expect from a quality-driven restaurant, delicious.
On first bite, the Triple Delight was overwhelmingly spicy, with a lasting, distinctive flavor. While it was an interesting take on a hot dog, the toppings tend to overwhelm, rather than complement, the hot dog’s flavor. On the other hand, the Smith’s Local Hot Dog blended well with the guacamole and bacon. The buttery smoothness of the guacamole served as a nice juxtaposition to the crunch and saltiness of the bacon.
The Original Hot Dog Shop (the ‘O’)
For a place that claims to be the original hot dog shop, the ‘O’ is certainly lacking in quality dogs. The hot dog ($4.50 with cheese) was extremely bland, with a thick casing thanks to the hours it likely spent sitting idle on the grill. The ‘O’ probably tastes delicious at 1 a.m. when you’re drunk and you’ve walked all the way from campus, but otherwise, go for a six pack instead.
Five Guys
At Five Guys, we purchased a bacon cheese hot dog at $5.19. While simple, it had all the necessary traits of a delicious hot dog. At first bite, one can easily notice the grilled flavor and feel the calorically-rich goodness as the various condiments blend together with the hot dog’s natural greasiness. Five Guys offers a number of choices for hot dogs, providing variety as well as quality.
Smallman Street Deli
Smallman Street Deli offers its jumbo hot dog ($3.99 with toppings) grilled and with a number of condiments — we chose relish, onions, and mustard. Despite its moniker, the hot dog was about the same size as the rest of the dogs we tried elsewhere. However, it was nicely grilled, adding extra flavor.
Joe’s Hot Dog Stand
If you’re looking for a quick, cheap lunch, this hot dog stand located outside Posner Hall is the place to go. All-beef hot dogs are available for $2.75; you can add relish, ketchup, mustard, and onion for free, and more toppings like tomato and lettuce are available for an extra charge. Although the hot dog tasted under-grilled, the quality of the meat was surprisingly good, especially considering the low price.
Our top choice
BRGR had the tastiest dog, but when it comes to value, nothing beats the stand outside Posner. It’s inexpensive, good quality, and conveniently right on campus, and when you get a craving for comfort food, those characteristics tend to trump all else.

While it has become common practice for books to be adapted into films, fans of the books are rarely happy about some aspect of the resulting movie, whether it’s a casting decision, a change in the plot, or an omitted scene. However, fans of Stephen Chbosky’s book, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, will find little to complain about in the film adaptation.
The book, originally published in 1999 by MTV, consists of letters that high school student Charlie (played by Logan Lerman) writes to an anonymous stranger relaying details of his first year of high school. He begins the year friendless, as his best friend Michael committed suicide several months earlier, but soon befriends a group of seniors that take him under their wing. Throughout the year, he experiments with drugs and falls for his beautiful friend Sam (Emma Watson), all the while struggling with traumas from his past.
In many ways, the coming-of-age novel feels like a modern-day version of The Catcher in the Rye: beautifully written, but often with heavy-handed amounts of teenage angst. It’s the sort of book that speaks profoundly to you at age 13, but feels far less relevant post-pubescence.
While the movie still has plenty of high school drama, it is more relatable than cringe-worthy, due in large part to the quality of the acting. Although Charlie is a quiet kid who could have easily come across as a flat character, Lerman brings out the nuances of his personality. Watson shines as the boisterous but caring Sam, proving that she is capable of branching out beyond the Harry Potter franchise. Ezra Miller is similarly compelling as Sam’s gay stepbrother Patrick, whose sass and sarcastic pep hide his vulnerability.
The movie’s cinematography helps to capture the dreamy, poetic feel of the novel. While by no means boundary-breaking or Oscar-worthy, the film contains some interesting camera angles and filming decisions, especially whenever Charlie is on drugs. The cinematographic choices for the climactic scene near the end of the film give the audience insight into Charlie’s mental state at the time and help to heighten the drama.
For Pittsburgh residents, the film’s location is an added bonus. Chbosky is a Pittsburgh native and set Perks in his hometown suburb, so it was only natural that, as the writer and director of the film adaptation, he would have filmed it in Pittsburgh. The stunning scene in which Sam stands on the back of a truck while riding through a tunnel will win over audience members anywhere, but it will strike a particular chord with Pittsburghers as they recognize the Fort Pitt Tunnel and the shots of Downtown.
Perks may be a movie about high school, but not only high schoolers will appreciate it. It captures all the feelings and horrors and joys of being 16, but does it in such a way that will invite older audiences in, rather than drive them away. As Charlie says at the end of the film, “There are people who forget what it’s like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday... But right now these moments are not stories.” The Perks of Being a Wallflower brings those stories back to life.
The Perks of Being a Wallflower is currently playing at the Manor Theatre in Squirrel Hill and the AMC Loews at the Waterfront.

Pittsburgh’s newest music magazine, Breakdown Music Press, released its first issue last month. Its co-founders — Sandra Chen and Natalie Campbell, sophomore computer science and design majors, respectively — have high hopes about the future of Breakdown and believe that their unique approach will separate it from the sea of blogs, websites, and other magazines that cover music.
The magazine doesn’t cover a specific genre of music, although Chen noted that they want to feature local music and focus on the “modest side of the music industry.” But Breakdown does more than just review local music. It contains a multitude of interviews with upcoming artists, accompanied by vivid photos. Elaborate album reviews and photographs from different music festivals include more popular, mainstream music.
Chen first approached Campbell with the hope of making something out of the numerous concert photographs she had been taking since she was a first-year. “I started taking photos for myself and didn’t really know what to do with them,” Chen said. “I really enjoyed going to concerts and was fascinated by the artists’ energy. I wanted to share that with people.”
Chen and Campbell have been working with other students from Carnegie Mellon as well as friends from around the country: Their current staff consists of eight people. Although working independently from Carnegie Mellon has made their job harder, Chen and Campbell enjoy that they can “do more of the work and be more in control.”
Looking at the first cover of Breakdown, you can tell that this magazine is out to accomplish more than good music reviews. Chen, who is also head of photography for the magazine, catches a piercing look in Tyler Joseph’s eye, lead singer of Twenty One Pilots, while bandmate Josh Dun thoughtfully stares toward a distant point. The photo captures the kind of connection that Breakdown is out to create between its artists and readers. The two students “want to focus on a more human aspect of artists, not just commercial,” as Chen said. “We want the magazine to be intimate.”
The magazine is both accessible and intimate as readers flip through its pages. One can feel Chen and Campbell’s passion and energy in their heartfelt letters to the readers — which describe the guys of Twenty One Pilots as “the most talented, hardworking and genuine boys I know” — and in the sharp, sweaty, and very real photos of artists like Of Mice and Men and Blood on the Dance Floor, taken at last summer’s Vans Warped Tour.
One of the most distinguishing aspects of Breakdown lies not in what it can give its readers, but rather in what it lets its readers give in return. Chen’s Warped Tour photos are sprinkled with words not from artists, but from the audience. Written across one photo of rock band The Used, “Amber from Pittsburgh” says, “Watching my friend Tonya almost have a heart attack when we were up front for The Used.” While the audience’s words might not be relevant to the booming music industry of the 21st century, they touch the reader and provide a different perspective than other magazines offer.
“Dreams — if you work enough you can reach them,” Chen said. “This is something I want our readers to know.”
Maybe dreams are what will make Breakdown stand out from other music magazines, acting as a medium for readers to access dreams of their own and letting the music industry seem closer than before.

“I wish this didn’t have to end.”
This is the overwhelming response from people who’ve played Thirty Flights of Loving, the latest video game from indie developer Blendo Games, released over the summer. The game is a narrative-driven, first-person shooter inhabited by blocky, stylized paper-craft humans. It’s one of the most important games released this year, expressing more in 15 minutes than most games do in 40 hours of play.
This is a short story in playable form, displaying a keen awareness of the idiosyncrasies of games as a storytelling medium. It’s the story of a heist gone wrong and the events that led up to it, all told without the use of dialogue. Half the game takes place in an airport you’re trying to escape, while the other half is spent simply hanging out with your bootlegger friends.
What’s most remarkable about the game’s story is its use of jump cuts. The characters will often be ejected from whatever they’re doing — like walking down a hallway — as the game suddenly cuts to a scene of them getting out of bed. A testament to Blendo’s mastery, these cuts don’t feel intrusive. Instead, they are entirely welcomed, a breath of fresh air in a world of hyper-linear structure.
Do not be fooled by the style of the art; the game’s world is an extremely expressive one. People and objects are bright and colorful, visually distinctive when necessary and indiscernible when not. The music — composed by indie game composer and writer Chris Remo — is sparse and varied, borrowing elements from spy movies and Westerns. The soundtrack features a scratchiness that makes it sound like the soundtrack to a 1960s drama recorded on vinyl.
In essence, it’s a condensed movie soundtrack; some snippets only play for moments and then are never heard again. Silence is used often, letting players make their own interpretations of the emotions in certain scenes. Text is scattered throughout the game, giving players brief insights into the absurd world from which they’re trying to escape. All of this combines to give the game an inimitable feel and a sense of weight and confidence in its own style.
Thirty Flights is in many ways meant to serve as the ideal of the player-centric game. The player is respected, never condescended to, never forced to listen to some nonplayable character drone on about irrelevant information. The game doesn’t concern itself with the tangential details, as they are ultimately only a distraction from the true meat of the story. There’s a kind of cognizance in the way the game is presented — the way it knows exactly how much it needs to tell players, yet keeps enough ambiguity for players to draw their own conclusions.
Each player walks away from Thirty Flights with a different understanding of the underlying narrative because the game so brilliantly condenses the story down to its most basic elements. Cut away the fluff found in other games — the pointless dialogue and the time-wasting game systems that do nothing for the player’s enjoyment — and you’re left with the essence of a story.
In the current world of game narrative, it seems like there’s this headlong rush to have the greatest impact on players by making them the center of the universe. Every game seems to tout that players will have this epic presence in the world, that their choices will reverberate throughout the game’s universe. These are almost always empty promises, and end up as a hollow power fantasy masquerading as something more important.
Thirty Flights is the opposite: a small, intimate game that has something to say and isn’t afraid to do what needs to be done — even at the risk of alienating players. This kind of game only comes along once every few years, and is one of the few that might one day be spoken of in the same reverent tone as Half-Life 2.

Sporting a pair of suspenders, colorful dance moves, and his signature “chin butt,” as Sue Sylvester calls it, Glee’s Matthew Morrison took the stage of Heinz Hall on Saturday with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra as part of the PNC Pops series.
This was the first Pops concert of the season, as well as the first without the late Principal Pops Conductor Marvin Hamlisch. The memory of Hamlisch sobered the otherwise gaiety-filled concert, but conductor Lucas Richman handled the somber moments well, keeping them poignant but brief: He conducted a beautiful piece “Marvin style,” and kept a spotlight on an empty podium.
Before Morrison took the stage, the orchestra presented a lively, charming first half, plunging into Broadway with the overture from Pretty Girl. Perky and fun, the piece soared and swelled, engaging even the audience members who hadn’t seen the movie.
The second piece, a compilation of romantic cinema songs called Romancing the Cinema: Great Love Songs from the Movies, was put together by Richman. As the highlight of the concert, the compilation featured “My Heart Will Go On” from Titanic and “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” from The Lion King, among others. The orchestra outdid itself with this piece, with personal touches from a percussion section that could only be called perfection on drums and a strings section that set souls alight.
Morrison was accompanied by composer Brad Ellis, playing the piano just as he does as the silent accompanist in Glee. Morrison whirled through Broadway favorites and quintessential classics from the jazz songbook, ranging from “Lady is a Tramp” from Babes in Arms to a medley from Bernstein and Sondheim’s West Side Story to the adaptation of the famous Mexican mambo, “Sway.”
Morrison’s theatricality was a key part of his performance, both while he was singing and vamping between pieces. He showed off his signature dance moves, at one point dropping down and breakdancing — yes, breakdancing in Heinz Hall — and descending from the stage to make a young girl’s day by sweeping her into a short dance in the aisle.
The small talk he presented for filler between songs was cheesy at best, especially the clearly scripted exchanges with the pianist. That said, the man is a singer, not a stand-up comic, and the older audience ate it up. He appeared to be in character the entire performance. Although his voice was lovely — as always — and his feet were hypnotizing, his performance felt forced and canned.
The accompaniment was perfect down to the last note, providing exactly the kind of support that every singer should get. The music seamlessly blended with Morrison’s voice and provided a wonderful backdrop for a tour through musical theater history. Richman and the orchestra outdid themselves with this performance, especially in the first half.
Morrison was a charismatic, if unoriginal, performer with an incredible amount of vocal power. Invigorating and interesting, the concert left nothing to be desired from the incredible orchestra and conductor, and satisfied the Broadway cravings of a fall afternoon.

Mumford & Sons’ brillant second album, Babel, was released last week. The album doesn’t go anywhere adventurous or new — it stays in the same alternative rock/folk genre as Sigh No More, the band’s first album; still has “Country” Winston Marshall rocking the banjo; and still has Marcus Mumford growling and shouting out the group’s ballad-like lyrics.
The real difference between the two albums is the maturity of the music. Babel has more complex and layered instrumentals, and uses group vocals more effectively than Sigh No More. While both albums are fantastic, the band’s newest release shows off a cleaner, more organized sound.
Babel was written by young men, and although it can be enjoyed by people of all ages, it is an album about the issues in young people’s lives. Mumford & Sons sing about uncertainty and regret, love and longing. It’s the perfect album for young adults struggling to find their place in the world — in short, it’s written for college kids.
In the album’s first song, the title track “Babel,” Mumford sings, “ ’Cause I know my weakness, know my voice / And I’ll believe in grace and choice.” The song sets the tone and theme of the album: It’s all about understanding your own weaknesses and learning your voice. These ideas are essential during college and in the early stages of life, and, as the album acknowledges, there are no certainties in that journey.
Throughout the track, Mumford sings about the process of changing your core beliefs in young adulthood — a process that can strip us of our illusions and disguises. While this process can be unpleasant, Mumford reminds us that at least we’ll come out more honest on the other side.
“Babel” is not the only song with such complexity. True to Mumford & Sons form, each song is richly textured with emotion and meaning, along with some impressive banjo playing. “Ghosts That We Knew” toys with togetherness in the face of sadness, while “Lovers’ Eyes” describes the poignant regret of relationships after the love dries up. “Broken Crown” also focuses on regret, but of a much angrier nature — regret mixed with rage over past mistakes.
A trademark technique of Mumford & Sons is the juxtaposition of poignant, or perhaps nostalgic, lyrics and high-energy instrumentals. This technique appears in many of Babel’s songs. The contrast is jarring, but in a good way: It generates toe-tapping, catchy music with a subtler meaning underneath.
Touching on a wide range of emotions, from joy and triumph to sorrow, rage, and heartbreak, Babel is a phenomenal album. It proves not only that Mumford & Sons are still going strong, but also that the band is getting better all the time.

Until the Quiet Comes, Steve Ellison’s (a.k.a Flying Lotus) latest masterpiece, brings to a head everything he’s been working toward since creating the Brainfeeder music label in 2008. From his synthesis of Los Angeles’ electronic music, he has crafted his own voice — and it is boundless, ageless, and undeniably beautiful.
His previous LP, Cosmogramma — the new album’s more capricious older brother — was my first taste of Flying Lotus. And like most of my favorite artists, Flying Lotus was introduced to me by Max “Tamahawk” Tamahori, an aspiring DJ and one of my closest friends from back home in Los Angeles.
“Flylo is unlike anything you’ve ever heard before, man,” he told me in 2010, the night after he had seen the electronic artist do a set alongside two of Brainfeeder’s main men, Daedalus and The Gaslamp Killer. “Really, all of Brainfeeder’s DJs are like the modern Beats of Los Angeles — and Flylo’s their Kerouac.”
That statement has never been truer than with Until the Quiet Comes. While in the anti-album style of Cosmogramma — in the sense that the tracks aren’t individual but part of a collective — it’s more introspective and intimate than Flylo’s previous releases.
The album also has an absurdly huge color palette, blending sounds expertly and seamlessly between tracks. One minute you’re flying high on a smooth jazz session in “Only If You Wanna,” and the next you’re on a drug relapse during the compact drones and desperate crooning of Flylo’s frequent collaborator Thom Yorke in “Electric Candyman” — which should definitely be Yorke’s new nickname.
Radiohead mastermind aside, Flylo collaborates with more artists on Until the Quiet Comes than ever before. Along with previous accomplices Yorke and Thundercat — another member of Brainfeeder — this album has the unknown Niki Randa stepping into the spotlight in “Getting There” and “Hunger,” as well as big-name Erykah Badu on “See Thru To U.” And Laura Darlington, Daedalus’ wife, drops in to sing on “Phantasm,” which might be tied with “The Nightcaller” for best track on the album.
Until the Quiet Comes is also a standout for its focus on composition — and complex composition, at that. The album is an electronic tone poem, with Flylo’s prowess as the base text and certain combinations of instrumentation and melodies recurring as motifs. There’s a theme in “Only If You Wanna” — one that briefly shows up earlier in “Tiny Tortures” — that even harkens back to Cosmogramma’s hit track “Mmmhmm.”
Even with the album’s complexities and artistry, Flylo never neglects humor. “Sultan’s Request,” for example, is a deconstruction of what most consider dubstep — a slow, dense bass line without any beat, coming off as comical and slightly disconcerting. And the listener can’t help but laugh at the brief, punctuated “whoop” in the last second of “Heave(n).”
With Until the Quiet Comes, Flylo has not only created one of the best electronic albums in recent history, but has also made his own sound more accessible by smoothing out its edges. I know I’ll be spending my brief moments of relaxation listening to this album on repeat for the next month or two. Anyone with the slightest interest in exploring the boundaries of electronic music should take an hour to kick back, relax, and listen to the soundtrack of Los Angeles.
Until the Quiet Comes is currently streaming on npr.org and comes out tomorrow.

With an atmosphere permeated by the scent of incense and a recording of children laughing to set the scene, the new Carnegie Museum of Art exhibit White Cube, Green Maze: New Art Landscapes kicks off with an engaging vibe. The exhibition, which opened Sept. 21 in the Heinz Gallery, takes museum-goers on a trip around the globe to investigate six cases of art fusing with the environment to create something new. White Cube, Green Maze: New Art Landscapes explores a new-age spin on the often traditional Carnegie Museum of Art.
The exhibit is designed around the photographs of Iwan Baan, a Dutch architecture photographer. Baan traveled to the Instituto Inhotim in Brazil, the Benesse Art Site Naoshima in Japan, the Stiftung Insel Hombroich in Germany, the Jardín Botánico de Culiacán in Mexico, the Grand Traiano Art Complex in Italy, and the Olympic Sculpture Garden in the U.S. to create his pieces.
All of the locations feature innovative methods of melding contemporary art with landscapes — be it with a mountain range, garden, or city — and all are fascinating to explore. The positively breathtaking photographs are bursting with vibrant color that brings true life to the exhibit, and the scale models that accompany the building plans of the various structures allow viewers to feel completely immersed in the art.
The addition of humans into the photos is a poetic touch. Humans are subtly incorporated into the landscapes and art spaces to suggest a hopeful future and the possibility of a peaceful, beautiful coexistence of humanity, art, and the environment. Eye-opening and thought-provoking, the photographs present a unique, visually pleasing aspect of contemporary art that is often lost in the shuffle.
Although the simplistic beauty of the photographed locations is generally overshadowed in the exhibition, this aspect is brought out most in photos of Stiftung Insel Hombrioch in Germany. The location includes a former rocket base that has been transformed into a home for contemporary art. The repurposing of this location is a metaphor for the survival and continuation of art in harmony with science and technology.
Unfortunately, the complicated nature of the building plans and the vast amount of information that covers every wall makes this exhibit almost too overwhelming to take in. The theme of contemporary art in international landscapes is clear throughout the gallery, but the details are lost in the flood of technical drawings and wordy captions. The exhibit displays too much information and not enough thematic material.
Despite this, the exhibit would be of interest to any student majoring in architecture, design, or environmental engineering. And for everybody else, the pictures and bright colors are reason enough for a visit — after all, admission is free for Carnegie Mellon students.

Dear Patrick,
I went to the Cricket Lounge last week, and I fell in love with a stripper. Her name is Chastity and she seems really into me. She stopped talking to me once I ran out of money, but she’s on the job, right? Do you know how I can convert this business relationship into a more romantic one?
Thanks,
Seriously Tempted Reclusive Individual, Powerfully Tempted Endlessly, And Seeking Exotic Dancer
Dear STRIPTEASED,
Repeat thrice, after me: “I do not love a stripper.” Okay, if that didn’t do the trick, I guess I’ll have to explain this to you. In general, anyone who works for tips is just pretending to like you. Waitresses, hostesses, and especially strippers. I know, you’re really charming, but nine times out of 10, they’re just acting.
If you’re still set on chasing Chastity, then I guess I’m obliged to give you advice. First thing’s first: Get a hepatitis shot. Types A and B. Next, you need to demonstrate your value to her. Break out the $100 bills at the club. Keep on throwing down the money until you get a reputation with her. Then take a good long hard look at yourself and realize you’re trying to pick up a stripper.
At least your kids will have a great story about how you met their mother,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’ve gone out almost every day the past few weeks, and now I’m totally exhausted. But my friends want to keep going out and I don’t have the heart to turn them down. I can’t afford to keep this up. How can I break the news to them? Can’t I just stay home and sleep?
Thanks,
Beverage Obtainment Oftentimes Zeroes Earnings, Sleep Necessary Or Obviously Zoned out Entirely
Dear BOOZE SNOOZE,
Let me guess, you’re a senior. Bar exhaustion is a common problem among those graduating soon. Eventually, the drinking and spending catches up with you and you just want to stay in and play board games. We’ve all been there, but you must resist. Down the path of board games lies only destruction! Stay strong; keep drinking!
Take a night or two off, but that’s it. Once you start staying in, it’s easy to get stuck in a rut. And then you’ll waste your senior year. You just turned 21, and you’re at the one time in your life you can go out five nights a week and not be judged for it. Get on a first-name basis with the Wednesday night bartender at PHI (it’s Deirdre) and manage your money so you can keep it up.
Take a nap and go out,
Patrick Hoskins

If you haven’t left campus recently and aren’t Facebook friends with any of the coolest people in Pittsburgh, you might not be aware that VIA is happening this week.
“VIA? What the hell is that?” you may ask. Allow me to explain. Back in 2010, a couple of Pittsburgh friends decided that it was time for the city to have its own cutting-edge music and new media arts festival. Since then, VIA has presented collaborative performances, installations, mobile projects, lectures, and workshops through a yearly festival, as well as sporadic events throughout the year.
While you may be familiar with Electric Zoo, Movement, Mutek, Coachella, or some other big-name music festival, VIA is a little more unique. According to the VIA website, this event focuses on enabling Pittsburgh as a “nexus for young artists working at the borders of music, art, and technology.” This year’s festival brings a variety of artists you may not have heard of, such as Moodymann, Tiger & Woods, Nadastrom, Girl Unit, Julia Holter, and Andy Stott, to name a few. Even your esteemed author isn’t familiar with every band in attendance.
What I can tell you is this: If you’re truly interested in the intersection of sight and sound and like to get your groove on, VIA is the place to be. VIA has already gained all sorts of international acclaim and press for its festivals in the past, and has secured the top spot for a U.S. festival on Resident Advisor’s Top October Festivals list.
This is not an advertisement for VIA; rather, it is an unsolicited endorsement from your campus radio station. Like any festival, there are mistakes as a result of too much experimentation or poor foresight, but it looks like VIA has learned a lot from its two first years and has planned a wide variety of music. Get ready for some deep house, bedroom pop, cold wave, Moombahton, dub techno, UK Bass, nu disco, and so much more.
To see the full festival lineup, visit via-pgh.com.

Over 500 people attend the Carnegie Tech away football game against Washington & Jefferson University over the weekend. At half-time, fans storm the field and form a giant “C” while cheering for the team. Today, we can’t even get 500 people to a home game offering free food.

Students express concern and disappointment about the options for dining plans on campus. First-years wish there was an “all DineX” option, so lost meal blocks and overeating would no longer be issues. Sadly, these same problems with the meal plan exist today, which may explain why few upperclassmen utilize the meal plan.

As if Carnegie Mellon statistics surrounding sexual activity weren’t already depressing enough, a recent study suggests there actually is a correlation between IQ and sexual activity — the higher one is, the lower the other. Looks like the slogan “Sex Kills: Come to CMU and live forever” is as accurate as we all wished it wasn’t.

The associate dean of Dietrich College responds to an article critiquing the disjointedness of the programs in the college, arguing that the broad range of programs makes the college more interdisciplinary and supports collaboration among students.

Advertised around campus as “(Chi)politics,” last Wednesday’s town hall meeting set the tone for what Student Body President Will Weiner and Vice President Meela Dudley hope to accomplish while in office.
Weiner, a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major, and Dudley, a senior creative writing and professional writing double major, emphasized throughout the meeting that transparency and a strong public presence on campus are integral to their roles.
Held in the Connan Room, the forum attracted about 70 people, a number Weiner mentioned was significantly higher than in the past. Weiner and Dudley built up hype by offering free Chipotle burritos to the first 100 attendees, advertised in posters and on the student body president Facebook page.
Weiner and Dudley plan to theme each of their ensuing town halls. “The Chipotle wasn’t the cheapest thing ever, but I’m happy because it made a big impact,” Weiner said. “Even a lot of people who couldn’t make it still knew, and were excited and jazzed.... [We’re] figuring out ways that are still fun and gimmicky, but cost effective.”
This particular town hall began with an overview of the functions of the branches of student government, from the executive committee to cabinet liaisons. This transitioned into Weiner and Dudley’s projects for their time in office. The pair discussed what they’ve completed thus far, such as launching a social media platform, as well as their ongoing initiatives, such as improving communication between student groups.
One initiative, in particular, included the possibility of raising the student activity fee.
According to Weiner, there have been complaints in the past about student groups being underfunded. He said that student government had been compiling data on increasing the fee, and would host info sessions and more town halls specifically for this initiative.
Jon Mark, the student body vice president for finance and a senior lighting design major, echoed Weiner’s sentiments: “We’re going to be doing focus groups on this.”
Once Weiner and Dudley moved through the projects they have already slated, they asked attendees for feedback on a series of preplanned questions.
The questions primarily addressed which campus services students felt were difficult to communicate with; what the ideal community event would be; what issues could be brought to the Pittsburgh Student Government Council (PSGC), a larger city-wide coalition of students; and how campus could be improved.
Student suggestions included stream-lining the reimbursement process for student activities, expanding off-campus eateries that accept DineX, and hosting a campus-wide trick-or-treating event during Halloween.
“I thought that there were a lot of great comments that were made and that Will and Meela were really receptive to everything,” Lindsay MacGillivray, a junior biopsychology major, said of the discussion session. “They got a good dialogue going, as opposed to just pointing out ideas.”
Discussion then moved into a free-form format, and focused on the bigger picture of what students wanted from their student body president and vice president. “The things we have to do are not particularly well defined,” Weiner said.
At this point in the meeting, many suggestions from the audience were not necessarily within either Weiner or Dudley’s capacity as president and vice president. One student asked if there was any way they could have a break during 90-minute classes, while another asked if Health Services could “suck less.”
At one point, an audience member even joked if Weiner and Dudley could control Pittsburgh’s chaotic weather patterns.
Despite the few hiccups in serious dialogue, Weiner and Dudley were happy with how the town hall turned out.
“I was really pleased with the amount of questions,” Dudley said. “And specifically, I feel like this is setting the trend for the kind of feedback we want to receive for the rest of the year. Personally, we’ve made a really big push for having office hours, Board of Directors meetings, [executive committee] meetings, and things of this nature — town halls — on a more regular basis.”
Weiner, mirroring Dudley’s thoughts, said, “People seemed engaged about what we’re doing. So I’m excited about the fact that this was a pilot to make sure that we can keep doing these and I think, even without these incentives, we can still get ... enough people, especially if it’s issue-based.”

Tackling the highly controversial topic of liberal Zionism in terms of Palestinian justice, Max Blumenthal, Jewish-American journalist and bestselling author, presented his lecture to an audience of around 100 University of Pittsburgh students and faculty last Wednesday.
Blumenthal’s lecture focused on debunking several myths about liberal Zionism, a political trend in Israel that advocates for a two-state solution in order to support the Jewish state.
Blumenthal said that he wanted to challenge the myths of liberal Zionism because he believes that these misconceptions are responsible for worsening the current Israeli-Palestinian crisis. He centered the crux of his argument on his belief that a two-state solution will not bring about peace.
“I think liberal Zionism has lost much of its political influence in Israel, but it remains very culturally influential and has an enormous currency in the United States among liberal Americans, especially American Jews, in perpetuating and preserving the fallacy that the two-state solution will deliver peace or a viable Palestinian state,” he said.
Blumenthal addressed the perception that liberal Zionists are pro-peace. According to him, the liberal Zionist idea of peace differs from the Western liberal definition. “[The liberal Zionist peace] is not defined by an opposition to war or militarism; it’s an embrace of militarism,” he said.
Blumenthal also confronted the belief that liberal Zionists are politically liberal. “This is the biggest deception: One of the key things about liberal Zionists and what distinguishes them from liberals in the United States is that unlike American liberals who believe in civil rights, [they] are committed to the engineering of an ethnic democratic majority, which puts them as the most right-wing figures we can think of in American society,” he said.
According to Blumenthal, discrimination against Palestinians is evident today through Israeli attitude. Citing a personal experience, Blumenthal spoke of an incident during which he watched drunken Israeli youths stab a Palestinian, an issue that was left unacknowledged by officials.
Some students disagreed with Blumenthal’s take on the act. Eliana Weiner, a junior psychology and architecture double major said, “You don’t necessarily know what happened before and leading up to [those acts] and what they could be a result of. To take things out of context is really misleading and it’s an easy way to show a bias. There are a lot of misconceptions and falsehoods [from the Palestinian side] that try to be stated as truths.”
Arguing that Israel’s current ideologies are fundamentally apartheid, Blumenthal proposed that the ideal solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be a compromise allowing Israeli Jews to stay within their communities, while simultaneously devoting increasing energy toward reconciliation.
“Reconciliation means that settler colonialist leaders need to admit what they have done, and concede power,” he said. Blumenthal believes we should prepare the groundwork for a single state instead of prolonging what he sees as the slow process of ethnic cleansing.
“If you look at polls of Israeli attitude, Israeli youth are increasingly racist and eliminationist toward Arabs and other non-Jews, and it’s a reflection of an indoctrination process that begins at [a young] age,” Blumenthal said.
Weiner said, “In Israel, it’s a very different culture than in America in terms of Israeli defense force. It’s something teenagers go into at the age of 18, and its just a part of their culture, and it’s not to be violent but rather to protect their people. There are some cultural normalities about Israel that can be muddled when taken out of context.”
Arguing for a movement toward a narrative of equal rights, Blumenthal said that making the idea of apartheid mainstream in Israel will bring to light the struggle of the Palestinians.
“It’s a one-state reality,” Blumenthal said. “The question is whether it will be a single apartheid state or some version of a single state like a confederation with equal rights for everyone.”
Blumenthal was brought to Pitt’s campus by an organization called Pitt Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP).
Ryan Branagan, the president of SJP, said that Blumenthal’s talk offered a unique perspective that opponents of SJP could relate to, because it was given in a personable manner.
Branagan said that a previous incident had an indirect influence on SJP’s decision to bring Blumenthal to campus. Last year, controversy arose surrounding a local high school student, Jesse Lieberfield, who won Carnegie Mellon’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day essay contest with his anti-Israel essay. www“I think that the young teenager who wrote the essay should be lauded and not criticized like he was. [The growth] of this new group of Jewish-Americans that are ready to break the silence and move forward — it’s a great solidarity movement,” Branagan said.
Some Pitt students who identified themselves as pro-Israel declined to comment on Blumenthal’s lecture. Students who were torn on the issue attended the lecture as a means of lending insight to shape their views.
Tian Qiu, a senior microbiology major at Pitt, said, “The power balance is in Israel’s favor, so they have more responsibility to be the first people to act toward a solution. Palestinians don’t have any real power, which is why they are acting out violently. It’s like a toddler trying to rail against their parents.”
Danielle Schlesinger, sophomore biology and biomedical engineering major, believes that Blumenthal disregarded the other side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where Israelis often become victims of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks from Arabs. “I’m not saying that there shouldn’t be any fighting between them, but you need to look at both sides of the issue,” she said.
Mahmoud Yacoub, a junior philosophy major at Pitt and vice president of SJP, said, “I hope that people will think about what [Blumenthal] said, and then go out and find this information themselves so they can get a little more informed on the issue and help the cause in that way.”

On Thursday, after 22 years of service, Rick McCullough left his position as Carnegie Mellon’s vice president of research to become Harvard University’s vice provost of research, starting Oct. 15.
McCullough came to Carnegie Mellon in 1990 as an assistant professor of chemistry and quickly rose through the ranks. By 1998, he had become a full professor and the head of the chemistry department.
“During my first few years, I focused mostly on my research, so I got involved in the administration very early on in my career,” McCullough reflected, as he packed up his office. “I became professor and department head on the same day.”
In 2002, McCullough was appointed dean of the Mellon College of Science.
“As MCS Dean, Rick McCullough greatly expanded the research portfolio of the College and its funding from alumni, foundations, and state and federal agencies,” current MCS Dean Fred Gilman said in an email. “I have benefitted greatly by getting his advice when difficult problems arose, something that I hope I will still be able to seek in the future.”
After he became vice president of research in 2007, McCullough became a champion of entrepreneurship and commercialization of technology — pioneering the Greenlighting Startups initiative to encourage start-up companies that use university-developed technology.
“[Rick] led CMU’s efforts in many technology commercialization activities … meaning when students or faculty try to start up a company,” University Provost Mark Kamlet said. “[As a result] we have the most start-up companies per research dollar spent.”
McCullough was also the founder of several start-up companies of his own over the course of his tenure at Carnegie Mellon. 
One of McCullough’s companies, Plextronics, has been remarkably successful and, in 2008, was named one of the region’s 100 fastest-growing companies. 
“In some sense, I’m an expert at starting companies,” McCullough said. “I can easily teach those skills ... and I have been a mentor to a number of our small companies and faculty.”
“He had a special ability to take research to the next level and make it commercially viable,” Gilman said in an email.
However, McCullough is ready to move on. “It was a very difficult decision for me. I love Carnegie Mellon. I’ve been here for 22 years, and my heart is in work,” McCullough said. “But once I went there and saw that I would be a part of building the new Allston innovation campus at Harvard ... to have all the interdisciplinary research centers reporting to me was a very large opportunity for me.”
“It was an awfully appealing offer,” Kamlet said. “The kind of things Harvard wanted him to do were right up his alley, and it was really good opportunity for him, sadly for us.”

Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and Square, spoke to Carnegie Mellon students on Wednesday about entrepreneurship and his vision when founding Square.
Dorsey co-founded Square, a mobile payments company, in 2009 with artist James McKelvey. Square offers consumers free credit card readers that allow them to accept payments with their smart phones or tablets. Last year, the company was valued at more than $1 billion by venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers.
Dorsey’s visit to Carnegie Mellon is one of several trips he is making to colleges and universities this week to recruit new talent for Square, including visits to Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Square has also posted job openings on TartanTrak and sent recruiters to this year’s Technical Opportunities Conference.
“Everyone is really clamoring for engineers, so the recruiting is getting more aggressive,” said senior computer science major Amy Quispe, who was in the audience for Dorsey’s speech. “I think that sending Jack was the right thing to do. His name is so strongly associated with the Square brand.”
“I never wanted to be an entrepreneur,” Dorsey said. Instead, Dorsey said that he had ideas and a willingness to take risks to see his ideas through. He emphasized that though founding Square was one of those risks, “you don’t have to start a company to be an entrepreneur. You can have an entrepreneurial attitude.”
“I was thoroughly inspired by his view on this matter, because it comes to show that everyone has this potential,” said sophomore computer science major Isaac Lim after the event. “The only ones that work out in the end are by the people who have the determination and drive to see their ideas through.”
Dorsey peppered his speech with inspirational quotes and imagery. Toward the end of his speech, he likened Square to the Golden Gate Bridge. “Not only is it this beautiful end product, but the way it was built was also amazing.... Everyone who worked on this bridge is proud of it. Their children are proud of it and their grandchildren are proud it,” Dorsey said. “We also want to build a company that not only has a great end product, but that we are proud of the work that went into it.”
“He really had the reality distortion field down. It was everything I was promised,” Quispe said. “His talk focused on selling us on the grand vision of Square, and that really put the audience in awe.”
Having sold many students on his vision of entrepreneurship, Dorsey went on to explain how Square supports this vision. “Founders can happen anywhere, and ideas that can change the course of a company can come from anywhere. This is basic principle that we use to run Square,” Dorsey said. “We’ve built a foundation for our folks to move really fast on a very, very large canvas.”

Former Pennsylvanian Republican Governor Tom Ridge spoke in Carnegie Mellon’s Kresge Theatre on Thursday about the issues in this year’s presidential campaign. According to the event’s program, the lecture was meant to “survey the political landscape and explore the primary issues of this campaign season and of America’s future.”
Associate professor in social and decision sciences Kiron Skinner is the head of the Center for International Relations and Politics, which hosted the event. Skinner said that the Center’s scope is not limited to international issues, and includes domestic ones as well. “Some of our speakers, like Governor Ridge, have held significant positions on the domestic side, as governor, as congressman, but also ones that have more international implications, like his time at Homeland Security,” she said.
The program for Ridge’s lecture gave a summary of his long career in U.S. government. After graduating from Harvard University in 1967, Ridge was drafted into the army as an infantry staff sergeant in Vietnam while earning a degree at Penn State University’s Dickinson School of Law.
Ridge’s political career began in the House of Representatives, where he served six terms. Next, Ridge was governor of Pennsylvania for two terms and later, following the events of 9/11, became the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Currently, Ridge is CEO of Ridge Global, a security and risk management firm based in Washington, D.C.
Ridge divided his talk into four main parts, dedicated to what he called the “four different areas where I do believe, regardless of the outcome of the election, the president has to make significant changes.” Ridge focused on global engagement — specifically addressing military strength, diplomacy, and foreign aid — the budget deficit, energy policy, and immigration policy.
Regarding a strong military, Ridge said that it is an “absolute imperative that we maintain one.” Along with the need for a military leadership, Ridge emphasized the need for a generous foreign aid policy. “I would rather see preemptive aid than preemptive military.” 
Ridge’s lecture also addressed some of the country’s most pressing issues at the moment, such as the national debt. “We have got to get more serious about the deficit, folks,” Ridge said. Included in Ridge’s proposed plan were cuts to government welfare programs like Medicare, as well as an insistence on a return to manufacturing and “making things” as an attempt to “reinvest in America.”
Energy policy reform, too, was an important point of contention for Ridge; he specifically addressed the U.S.’s over-reliance on fossil fuels.
“We need presidential leadership on energy policy ... the world has to wean itself off this addiction [to fossil fuels] — there are multiple sources of fuel out there,” Ridge said.
While Ridge acknowledged the U.S.’s natural wealth of coal-based resources, he sees a more sustainable future in newer types of energy, such as nuclear power.
Another issue on which Ridge gave an opinion was the U.S.’s immigration policy. Talking not only about immigration from the southern border, Ridge had a globally-oriented view: “We need an immigration policy that recognizes the diversity of the world.”
The speech ended with a reference to what Ridge calls the “American brand,” and the global reputation of the U.S. “If America is a product, our values, I think, are our brand.”
In a Q & A session after the speech, Ridge opened the floor to students and faculty members. The questions asked addressed a broad range of contemporary sources of political contention, including terrorism, immigration policy, and the U.S. diplomatic stance regarding Israel.
Ridge was very willing to engage his audience, and said while taking refreshments after the talk, “I appreciate the audiences who are willing to listen, hopefully learn, to be provocative in a very respectful question and answer session. So for me, it’s not so much what I get a chance to say, for me it’s even more fun to get a chance to interact based on what I’ve said.”
Jenna Asperslag, a first-year international relations and politics major who attended the speech, embraced the opportunity to hear a fresh opinion on American politics. “It was ... interesting to hear his perspective on what the politicians need to focus on,” she said.
Ridge is familiar with Carnegie Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh: He is a native of the city, and his daughter, Lesley Ridge, is an alumnus of the university. 
Ridge said after the talk, “Interaction with college students has been, generally, part of both my public and professional life that I have enjoyed the most ... I thought it was a really good session.”

Students from several local universities congregated in Wiegand Gymnasium on Saturday afternoon to participate in Carnegie Mellon’s Program for Deliberative Democracy’s (PDD) campus conversation, titled “Climate Change and the Campus.”
Carnegie Mellon philosophy professor and PDD Director Robert Cavalier opened the event with enthusiasm.
“There is a general consensus in the scientific community that climate change is an issue that is occurring at the present moment, and a subject that can be approached rigorously, which made it a topic considered as good practice for deliberative democracy among students,” he said. “This stands in contrast with a typical town hall meeting, which is neither interactive nor deliberative. It provides students with the opportunity to be actively involved in the discussion and to become informed about the topic while participating in a structured conversation.”
The opinions of such informed individuals, he said, are valuable to policymakers trying to make relevant and constructive changes.
Deliberative democracy through campus conversation — defined by the PDD’s website as “the nation’s first systematic use of deliberative polling techniques at the college and university level” — enables students to formulate opinions after they are more educated about a particular subject.
Another thing that made this campus conversation unique, Cavalier said, is that “Climate Change and the Campus” was a collaborative, city-wide event that included 10 schools in the city of Pittsburgh. Cavalier said that such round-table conferences are able to offer students insight from those who are of different disciplines and thus spur them to be more engaged in doing their part for the environment.
Students were randomly assigned to tables with moderators to keep the ball rolling as they discussed climate change. Many of the participants claimed to know very little about climate change, and attended because it was required for a class.
However, for some, such as first-year computer science major Steven Ong, global warming has always been a subject of interest. 
“I would like to hear what others have to say and get a firm ground on whether climate change is a problem, and how we as students can tackle it,” he said.
While participants did not consider themselves well-versed with climate change, the round-table deliberations showed that many are concerned about global warming and its toll on the environment. 
Junior global studies major Christian Manoli, who remarked on the importance of reducing energy usage, said, “We have really smart people — like geniuses — on this campus. I’m sure they could invent something.”
The second half of the event welcomed a panel comprised of Brinda Thomas, who works with the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon; Lisa Coeffe, a Pittsburgh City Forester; Stan Kabala, associate director for the Center for Environmental Research and Education at Duquesne University; Erika Ninos, environmental program coordinator for the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at Carnegie Mellon; and Debra Killmeyer, the program director of Renewable Energy Initiatives.
These panel members were more educators than debaters; their primary job was to answer students’ questions.
Students were curious about the initiatives the Pittsburgh community is taking to combat global warming, and the steps that they could take to do so. They wanted to know what a “green” career is, and how to advocate a “green” economy. Coming from different backgrounds, the panelists provided a broad range of perspectives on the issues.
Kabala said, “You got to remember that not all the fossils are in the fuel,” illustrating that everyone has a part to play in the matter of climate change.

Carnegie Mellon welcomed one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, Andrew Lo, for a series of talks on his adaptive markets hypothesis as well as on ways to tackle problems with financial engineering.
Lo, who currently serves as director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT, gave two open lectures last week, and appeared as a guest speaker in the Introduction to Game Theory course for the Quantitative Social Science program.
Lo is known for his multidisciplinary approach to economics. He calls upon fields of psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology to better understand and explain the ways markets and people interact. 
Before undertaking a career in teaching, Lo worked at a consulting firm where he noticed that financial strategies, while based on current economic wisdom, often gave less-than-expected results.
“I was frustrated that some of the economics and behavioral papers I read did not match with what I was seeing in practice,” Lo said. “That’s when I really began thinking about exploring economics from different angles.”
This eventually led him to his adaptive market hypothesis, a potential paradigm-changing explanation on how markets work. In his talks, Lo explained how the participants in a market — the investors, firms, and market makers — can be categorized as “species” that evolve and adapt to their economic environments, which results in the adaptation of the entire market.
According to Lo, a highly competitive market will adapt into a market that is efficient. His study of adaptive markets made him a sought-after adviser after the 2008 financial crisis.
“With such polarized political parties, it will be difficult to get out of the financial crisis,” Lo said. “However, I see hope in that there is a certain number of extremely dedicated and hard-working people working on the problem.”
While the U.S.’s economic woes may need to be fixed in Congress, Lo said that finding a cure for cancer can be reached through strategic funding from the private sector. In one of his talks, titled “How Financial Engineering Can Cure Cancer,” Lo said that even though funding research into cancer treatments can be an extremely risky investment, the potential rewards are just as huge.
But due to the high risk and yet-to-be-seen reward, funding for cancer research has declined significantly. Lo explained, however, that these risks can be minimized by creating a $30 billion fund, comprised of money from private firms, investors, and American citizens. Instead of investing in just one cancer treatment method, they could invest in a large quantity of different treatments.
Lo said the success of just one or two of these methods would be more than enough to cover the costs of the failures. Citing recent medical breakthroughs, Lo said, “The technology and methods of fighting cancer are improving at a rapid rate ... now would be an optimal time to invest in cancer research.”
Lo’s description of how cancer and other large-scale problems can be tackled with financial engineering excited many in the audience. “It’s a very ingenious idea,” said Sojin Kim, a first-year economics major. “It’s pretty cool how the risk is hedged. I never thought of doing it that way before.”
Those in the Game Theory class were equally receptive to Lo’s ideas. “He explained complex theories in a very understandable way.... I came away with a better idea of how people make economic decisions,” said Tennley Noble, a first-year decision science major.

Lab shares data to advance global autism research
Carnegie Mellon’s Cognitive Neuroscience Lab is participating in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) program, which facilitates the release of over 1,100 autism and control datasets from a group of 16 international research labs. ABIDE is a collaboration of the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative, the Child Mind Institute, the Child Study Center at New York University, and the Kennedy Krieger Institute.
The shared datasets include samples from 539 individuals with autism between the ages of seven and 64, and 573 matched controls from individuals between the ages of six and 56. 
Marlene Behrmann, professor of psychology and director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, said in a university press release, “This is a phenomenal collaboration that will allow researchers unprecedented access to a massive dataset, collected under careful conditions from a very large sample of individuals with autism, all of whom have been carefully characterized in term of their behavioral profile. We can now get a sense of the heterogeneity of the disorder and, for the first time, can begin to discern major trends in the group as a whole.”
Adriana Di Martino, co-founder of ABIDE and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Child Study Center, said in the press release, “This collaboration fills an unmet need among the autism research community. By providing access to an unprecedented large-scale dataset, ABIDE has the potential to move autism research forward and thus advance our understanding of a complex disorder.”
Robotics researcher given grant to make robot pills
Metin Sitti, mechanical engineering professor and head of Carnegie Mellon’s Nanorobotics Lab, was recently awarded a total of $787,000 over three years as part of a research grant from the National Institutes of Health. 
Carnegie Mellon also provided a matching grant for his research.
In a university press release, Sitti described his research as “developing miniature robot pills that will help doctors diagnose and treat disease and be able to respond quickly to a variety of changing environments.”
He continued, “This technology will be designed to help physicians better track disease and make remedies more accessible and affordable for a variety of maladies.” 
Sitti plans to design new robotic, pill-sized soft capsules that may be controlled remotely to perform important diagnostic functions within the gastrointestinal tract.
“Robots that can readily adapt to new situations are critical for helping support activities that consumers do daily,” said Vijayakumar Bhagavatula, interim dean for the College of Engineering, in the press release.
Sitti also won the 2011 Nanoengineering Award from the International Society for Optics and Photonics for his research on devices that can manipulate objects on a molecular level. 
“Our work will ultimately translate into more successful surgeries and better and faster diagnoses and recovery for patients,” Sitti said in the press release.

I don’t have an irrational fear of technology, and I’m not forecasting the impending robot revolution. My reasons for opting out of the smartphone lifestyle — I think the intense attachment that people have for their smartphones justifies calling it such — are varied.
When smartphones first emerged on the market, my decision not to buy one was based primarily on financial factors. To put that plainly: My parents said I would have to pay for the data plan, and I didn’t have a job. The decision pretty much made itself.
As smartphones gained popularity, my parents noticed all my friends sporting sleek new iPhones and again inquired if I would like one; this time, the data plan would be on them. However, by this point, I didn’t want one regardless of who was picking up the bill.
I have watched as the cellphone population of my friend group swung mainly to smartphones, and two things have stood out to me. First, a person who owns a smartphone is never without it, or is panicking about accidentally leaving it at home. 
The phone is either in his or her hand or it’s about to be, often in response to someone asking a question that Google can answer.
The second thing I’ve noticed is the smartphone culture that has sprung up. 
People will swap Temple Run high scores on their Android phones, agree to follow each other on Instagram, or just spend a pleasant moment together staring at their BlackBerry screens. 
I’ve termed this behavior as “smartphone bonding,” due to the rapid connection smartphone culture often forms.
While I can see that there are many useful features of a smartphone, I don’t want to let a significant portion of my life be defined by my phone. The obsessive feeling that people have toward their smartphones is a type of materialism and dependence that I find uncomfortable. I like not having to worry about my phone like it’s my baby. I can survive a day without it with no panic attacks. My phone has no hold on me — it’s a tool that I use when I feel like it, not a constant extension of my hand.
Additionally, I don’t want my phone to become a social crutch. Conversation stalling? Just pull out your smartphone and hit up Angry Birds. Every second where something isn’t immediately happening is often occupied by the many entertainments smartphones offer.
So yes, my phone only calls and sends texts, and maybe I get lost a little more than the average smartphone user. 
However, I console myself with the thought that at least I won’t forget how to keep a conversation going and that I can survive independent of my technology. And, of course, it gives me the slight hope that I’ll survive the eventual robot uprising just a little bit longer.

Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter to customers, apologizing for the new Maps application in iOS 6 — and rightfully so. The “upgrade” to iOS 6 came with redeeming applications like Passbook, which organizes tickets, gift cards, and other payment options, as well as the new features like the photo sharing ability for iCloud. However, the release of this new operating system is marred by the Maps application that launched with it.
Current problems with Maps include misplaced, misnamed, and oversized locations, such as a nature park in Portland that appears to cover most of the city’s east side; lack of named infrastructure landmarks, including many bridges; and, worst of all for this country’s youth, the removed ability to search for public transit routes. Americans took 10.2 billion trips on public transportation in 2011, according to publictransportation.org, and public transportation usage is steadily increasing. 
Apple left out a resource in its Maps application that is vitally important to the population. In Pittsburgh especially, the bus system can be capricious, and it’s comforting to have a method for easily checking bus routes at one’s fingertips. 
Ideally, Apple would have kept its old standard of using Google Maps as its default maps app. But since Apple has been weaning itself off Google’s support over the past few years, the company clearly wanted to create an application independent of any third party that could meet or exceed the quality of its past, Google-affiliated Maps application.
Apple’s intermediate fix for this comes in the form of recommendations for third-party public transportation apps, such as Embark and Transit, and established web-based services like MapQuest.
For the biggest name in consumer electronics, which prides itself in innovation and staying ahead of the curve, this is dramatically out of character. If Apple had taken just a bit longer to troubleshoot Maps before making it public, it could have saved itself a lot of consumer headache. Hopefully the company will receive enough complaints that it will prioritize fixing the glaring errors with its app — or perhaps we’d be better off with Google Maps remaining the dominant navigation application.

Usually, when I think of movie star Samuel L. Jackson, I don’t think of his political activism. But recently, Jackson appeared in an advertisement targeted at those who voted for President Barack Obama in the 2008 election but have since grown apathetic. I worry about the kind of reaction it will elicit.
There are numerous sections of the video that may make people cringe. Worst of all is a little girl spouting off the theme of the video to her family to “Wake the f*ck up!”
Now, I’m no prude — I enjoy Jackson’s films, and such language is used frequently in them. However, they’re using a child to push a political agenda, and on top of that, they made her last line so vulgar. No doubt it will add fuel to the fire of social conservatives across the country; it fits quite well into their preconceived narrative of Hollywood and liberalism as corruptors of the youth.
It seems to me that the makers of this video, including scriptwriter Adam Mansbach — the author of parody children’s book Go the F*ck to Sleep, the audio version of which Jackson narrated — didn’t consider its potential negative effects.
Clearly the intended purpose of the video was to energize the liberal base, because unless there is a very large cross-section of undecided voters and fans of Jackson, it’s very easy to predict the reactions to this video. To complicate matters further, there is a record of Jackson saying, in an interview with Ebony magazine, that he “voted for Barack because he was black.”
To state so plainly a sole motivation for choosing a particular candidate, then suddenly having plenty of reasons not to vote for the other guy, comes off as dubious and disingenuous. 
If Jackson had expressed his dissatisfaction with John McCain back in 2008, it would be perfectly reasonable to assume he prefers the policies of the current president to the Republican candidate, whomever that may be.
Now, however, it is all too easy for conservatives to accuse Jackson of not supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney because he’s white. This advertisement is dangerous if only for the fact that it further erodes the level of discussion acceptable in politics.
It comes as no surprise to me that a super PAC funded this video and it was thus technically created without the approval of any candidate, because I sincerely doubt Obama would have thought this was a prudent choice. Jackson’s attempt to be a part of the solution is really only making matters worse.
Sure it was pretty funny, in a bizarre sort of way, but at what cost? The minimal laughter comes at a heavy price, another nail in the coffin of civil political discourse. That’s where we really need the wake-up call.

Student Body President Will Weiner and Vice President Meela Dudley hosted a town hall meeting, titled “Campus (Chi)Politics,” last Wednesday evening in the University Center. Posters for the event advertised that free Chipotle burritos would be given to first 100 people who attended the meeting.
Despite a lack of date, time, and location for the meeting on the promotional posters, it was well-attended, and gave students the opportunity to connect with their student government leaders. 
Although Weiner and Dudley didn’t offer up concrete solutions to some of the issues raised, such as difficulties communicating with campus services and the addition of parking meters on Margaret Morrison Street, they did take notes on students’ comments and promised to follow up.
Most importantly, the town hall meeting represented a part of Weiner and Dudley’s continued engagement with the campus community. 
They co-hosted a welcome-back barbecue at the beginning of the semester, have held weekly office hours, planned a U.S. Presidential Debate Watch Party for this Wednesday, and their Facebook page, “Carnegie Mellon Student Body President and Vice President,” is frequently updated with pictures and messages about events happening on campus.
Although they have yet to create a blog to keep the student body up to date on the work they do, as they had promised, Weiner and Dudley have already been a much greater presence on campus than their predecessors. 
We hope to see their efforts extend beyond mere engagement and into action as the year progresses, but in the meantime, we commend their (delicious) efforts to communicate with the student body.

There are just over five weeks before the election, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has not been doing well. A recent Washington Post poll shows that he is six points behind President Barack Obama among registered voters. Prediction market website Intrade.com puts Romney’s chances at around 22 percent to Obama’s 77 percent. Furthermore, a new Quinnpiac University poll shows Obama in the lead in Florida and Ohio, two key battleground states.
How did Romney end up so behind? 
After all, just a few months ago, things were not looking too good for Obama. His campaign was struggling to create a coherent narrative of why Americans should renew hope and change — the economy had not recovered as it should have, most of Obama’s campaign promises had gone unfulfilled, and the debt situation was worse than ever.
However, the Obama campaign staff has gotten its act together over the past few months.
They have a clear message: Despite the immense difficulties of the last four years, Obama has accomplished a lot. Vote for him and he’ll continue the good fight.
That message is a huge contrast to Romney’s, whose campaign is still flustered in self-contradictions and vague policy proposals.
Rather than presenting a concise, guiding vision, Romney’s campaign has merely tried to avoid conflicts with any particular group, as exemplified in his economic policy. Not only does he promise to reduce the budget deficit to appease the deficit hawks, but he also plans to do it without raising taxes.
Of course, there will have to be cuts in spending and deductions, but Romney has yet to specify which programs he will cut and how much. Overall, the plan is unworkable, opaque, and politically shifty.
The same goes for Romney’s other positions; where they haven’t changed completely, they are terribly vague. He disapproves of Obamacare, but is proud of the Massachusetts plan it was based upon, the very plan he signed into law. On 60 Minutes, he chastised Obama for having cut $716 billion to Medicare, despite the fact that he chose a running mate whose budget plan included those same cuts. The most cohesive part of Romney’s message is, “I don’t like Obama.” Unfortunately, Romney cannot rely on voters’ dislike of Obama alone; he needs to convince the public that he is actually a better alternative.
Americans will be reluctant to trade in their old car if the alternative is just another car of the same quality, but entirely unfamiliar. Technically speaking, Romney should have an advantage: The election is still operating under an anti-incumbent environment. According to Gallup, 54 percent of Americans believe that the economy is getting worse, and RealClearPolitics, a polling aggregator, shows that 56 percent believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction.
With less than 40 days before the election, however, and a recent string of gaffes that have made members of his own party cringe, the window of time has diminished significantly for Romney and his campaign. One thing is certain, however. These last few weeks before the election will be crucial for both campaigns.

The Federal Reserve recently announced its third round of quantitative easing, otherwise known as QE3. Quantitative easing is defined by The Washington Post as “an unconventional monetary tool used by central banks to stimulate the economy ... [the Federal Reserve] can buy up assets like long-term Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities from commercial banks and other institutions.”
QE3 amounts to printing finite and predetermined amounts of money. The first round was worth $1.4 trillion and the second round worth $600 billion. What makes the third round so scary is that the whole “predetermined quantity” aspect now goes out the window. With QE3, the Federal Reserve has committed to buying $40 billion in mortgage backed securities per month for an indefinite amount of time, causing it to be dubbed “QEternity” by publications such as Barron's.
Printing money in methods like QE3 is often the last refuge of failed republics. This choice indicates that we are certainly not in a good economic spot, and things will probably worsen. The most surprising thing about QE3, however, is that several officials within the Federal Reserve don’t think it is going to make anything better at all.
According to Reuters, chairman of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Mark Plosser has said he “believes that increasing monetary policy accommodation is neither appropriate nor likely to be effective in the current environment.” Similarly, when the massive QE1 and QE2 programs as well as the Operation Twist (which was basically cover for more asset buying) have managed to fail this whole time, it’s likely that QE3 will not be the magical exception. 
Short-term inflation can often create the illusion of demand. Bolstering one failing sector in the short term will, at the very least, prevent things from getting worse between now and November. 
Maybe Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, like most Americans, just wants to keep his job. 
Unfortunately, it’s plausible that Bernanke realizes that if Republican candidate Mitt Romney wins, he’ll probably be replaced. Therefore, he may be trying to make conditions optimal for President Barack Obama to win. These conditions include a robust and recovering economy, especially in the housing market, particularly the secondary mortgage market whose failure caused the recession.
Described by Forbes columnist James Dorn as "financial morphine", QE3 seems to be a failure from the beginning as its predecessors were. The Federal Reserve will need to sell the trillions of dollars on its balance sheet in assets. 
That’s when we’ll really see the negative effects of the QE series. As of right now, there don’t seem to be many positive aspects of the initiative.

Intel announced that it would no longer be sponsoring the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) last week, costing the BSA its largest corporate donor and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Intel’s move to drop support for the BSA was inspired in large part by Eagle Scout Zach Wahls’ actions against his own organization.
Why is an Eagle Scout attempting to undermine the funding for an organization in which he clearly has invested much time and energy? Raised by two women, Wahls is a noted advocate for gay rights and just one of many to denounce the BSA’s anti-gay policies in recent years.
The single most important partner organization for the BSA, however, remains the the Mormon Church, since it enrolls its male youth and pays their dues. As a result, the BSA often adopts stances that put it in line with the wishes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other major religious organizations.
While receiving financial support from the federal government and simultaneously barring atheists and promoting religion is a major point of contention, the BSA’s stance on gay rights is on even flimsier ground. The BSA’s has corrupted its mission statement “to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.”
The current claim that homosexuality somehow breaks this clause is nothing short of medieval. Many Eagle Scouts have renounced their ranks and returned their medals in a concerted campaign after the BSA decided to uphold its ban on homosexual scouts and leaders, and some troops have openly declared nonobservance of the policy.
While Freedom of Association gives the BSA the legal right to ban gay scouts, I believe that this should be superseded by a moral imperative.
Having attended a magnet elementary school, transitioning to middle school was similar to moving to a new town. I knew almost nobody, and this made being 13 years old even less fun. The bright spot of every week through those years was my weekly troop meeting. There, in addition to the fun activities involving knives, fire, and dirt, I met the people who would become my closest friends, and a few people I was forced to learn how to tolerate.
The BSA played a huge part in defining who I am, but it was also one of the main reasons I never had to deal with truly severe depression beyond the typical teen angst.
Columbia University researchers released a report in the journal Pediatrics last year that gay teenagers are up to four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers. To restrict scouting from a group of teens who would benefit so much from community and acceptance is both callous and malicious.
The BSA stands alone amongst American scouting organizations on this issue. The Girl Scouts of America accepts LGBT members and leaders, as do the official scouting organizations of most every other nation in the Western world. The BSA frequently asserts its independence in upholding these antiquated and harmful policies, when in reality it is just affirming its entanglement to policies out of step with the rest of the country.

This semester, we’ve noticed a striking increase in corporations’ on-campus marketing tactics.
Large companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Sony have already been using student ambassadors on campus. Now Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy, and other energy drink companies have entered the fray and hired student representatives to promote their products.
While these marketing tactics seem a bit underhanded, products from companies like Microsoft and Google have real merit; new programs and devices can help students complete homework faster, prepare for jobs, and learn skills applicable in the real world. Energy drinks, however, have no merit other than the supposed energy boost followed by a debilitating crash at the end of the day.
It’s a sad truth that Carnegie Mellon students keep ridiculously late hours and suffer from sleep deprivation on a regular basis. Professors aren’t going to assign less homework, and students aren’t going to drop every extracurricular or stop having social lives. Naturally, Carnegie Mellon’s extreme work ethic drives students to drink coffee, tea, Red Bull, and other forms of liquid energy.
But actively encouraging students to imbibe even more of these energy drinks when getting the required amount of sleep is so much healthier seems a bit masochistic. Even more than that, the fact that energy drink corporations are targeting Carnegie Mellon means that our community’s weakness and drive to overachieve is being exploited for monetary gain.
If your body says “rest,” then rest. The energy gained from large amounts of caffeine and energy drinks can cause insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, upset stomach, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors, according to the Mayo Clinic. In contrast, a 15 to 20 minute nap will increase alertness and decision making skills for a longer period than most energy drinks.
Better that we give our bodies the rest they need and make sure our campus culture of work-till-you-drop doesn’t get out of hand.

The current riots in the Middle East supposedly arose because of a film trailer called Innocence of Muslims. The film itself did serve as the trigger, but to assume that this general dislike of America arose solely from one shoddy YouTube video is naive at best.
Most of the protesters haven't even seen the video, and many in the Muslim world lack the internet access to view it. To prevent future expression of mass rioting, U.S. foreign policy makers must look at their governmental actions throughout the Muslim world, rather than simply pin the blame on what finally triggered this catastrophe.
One of the main foreign policies that has built up anger throughout the region is the use of drones. Drone strikes have been useful in killing militants and terrorists, but they also cause collateral damage, and the sound of a drone strikes fear and anger into those who simply want to live their life peacefully below. 
The U.S. used to have a dual-key system — where the U.S. would seek the country's permission before launching the drone — but over the past four years, the U.S. launched strikes without seeking the expressed permission of the nations where drone attacks were planned. These actions by the U.S. government are not surprising, considering President Barack Obama's previous actions concerning the expansions of the Patriot Act and of the Transportation Security Administration in power and scope, and signing of the National Defense Authorization Act into law.
This infringement on the sovereignty of Arabs, Pakistanis, and North Africans is the driving force behind the anti-American rioting in the Middle East. The YouTube film merely served as a trigger, and is not a causal factor. To improve the relationship between Middle East and West, the U.S. must respect the sovereignty of foreign nations and respect people's right to self-rule. Moreover, it must also recognize the deaths of civilians from the use of drone strikes. 
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates hundreds of civilian deaths from drone strikes, including 176 children. 
Denying these unnecessary deaths does little to improve the image of the U.S., and the advertisements the Obama administration is broadcasting in the Middle East that condemn Innocence of Muslims will do nothing to quell the situation. It's time for the administration to stop shifting responsibility from their foreign anti-terrorism policies to a tasteless low-quality film.

You are very judgmental, and that is no bueno. Even if you mean well, your attitude toward others may be pushing them away.
Be who you are. Yes, you have flaws and you’re nowhere near perfect, but you are exactly who you’re meant to be at this current moment in time.
In the end, everything will turn out fine.
One day things will work themselves out. You’re hard-working, and your hard work will be rewarded.
If things are not going your way, maybe you’re just trying too hard. Simplify your thoughts and actions, and then things will be better.
People haven’t been understanding you lately, and it’s probably because you are doing a poor job of providing context for the things you talk about. Be clear, and people will be more receptive.
You need to move forward. You’re never going to get anywhere unless you start moving forward.
If there is something in your life that you don’t like, then change it. It is as simple as doing something different from what you are doing now.
Don’t rush life. Events, people, and success will all come.
You have so many conflicting pieces of advice being thrown at you that you are starting to feel lost. It is hard trying to find your way, but stay focused and don’t blindly follow what others suggest. 
Grammar Nazis are your friends. Really, they are. They only want what is best for you.
Don’t compare yourself to others. You never know the details of other people’s lives, so don’t envy what you don’t truly understand.
