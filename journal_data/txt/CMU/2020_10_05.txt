The NBA playoffs are winding down, but the most exciting series is yet to come. Following the conclusion of the semi-finals last week, the teams in the NBA Finals are now set: the Miami Heat vs. the LA Lakers.
In the more predictable of the two semi-final matchups, the Lakers topped a previously scary Denver Nuggets team in five games. However, it is clear that the Lakers are surviving purely on their two studs, Anthony Davis and LeBron James. James is fueled with the fury of his MVP runner-up award. His passive aggressive tweet and incredible series once again prove that even at 35 years old, this is still his league.
It was Davis who shined in the first game, however. With 37 points and 10 rebounds, Davis outplayed Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, who sat after getting in foul trouble. Fellow Laker big man and veteran Dwight Howard also came through for the team, which left little room for LeBron to contribute: the team didn’t exactly need him in their 23 point win.
Game 2 was much closer, ending with a 105-103 score, but the Lakers still found themselves on top. However, the entire Nuggets roster shouldn’t catch the flak because it came down to one player’s monumental mistake. As a response to the size of the Lakers, which beat Denver in the first game, the team put in forward/center Mason Plumlee in the final minutes. Miscommunication about a defensive play caused Plumlee to lose Davis who took a wide open and game winning three pointer. Other than this, though, the Denver defense looked much better prepared for the Lakers offense, giving up just 45 points in the second half. Jokic also seemed to get back on his feet with 30 points, topping Lebron’s 26. 
Denver looked even more composed in their Game 3 win to prevent the Lakers from taking a devastating 3-0 lead. The win really came down to the bench. Denver’s bench, like forward Jerami Grant who dropped 20 points, provided help for Murray and Jokic, while the Lakers’, specifically forward Kyle Kuzma, did not show. Murray and Jokic themselves finished with 28 points and 22 points, respectively, and the bench help was enough to put them over the Lakers despite a late game tightening. There was certainly no reason to count out a Denver team that had just come back from back-to-back 3-1 series deficits.
The help vanished again in Game 4 for Jokic and Murray, who appeared tired, and you can’t blame them. Murray dismissed these concerns, assuring that “I’m 23 years old, I’m healthy, got a lot of gas left in the tank,” but realistically anyone in the same position as the Denver “Big Two” would be gassed. Well, except for LeBron and Davis, who continue to put the Lakers on their backs. LA was on top of the ball, with 25 second-chance points and 12 offensive rebounds, which was a result of their dominant height. The three biggest guys on the team — Lebron, Davis, and Howard — all led the game in each of the three major stats (points, rebounds, and assists). Murray did have a decent game too, but Jokic didn’t show up. It wasn’t enough, so the Nuggets found themselves in the 3-1 position once again. 
The Nuggets looked much more balanced in Game 5, with Murray, Jokic, and Grant scoring about 20 each. The Lakers were a one man show, but it was enough. LeBron did LeBron things, putting up a triple double: 38 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. His drive to make it to his 10th finals appearance and claim unanimous GOAT status was clear, summed up by a quote from Davis: “In the fourth quarter, he told us it was his time. He just took over. Everybody kind of got out of the way and let him be him.” When the game ended with a 117-107, LeBron was spotted sitting on the court emotionless, conveying a clear message: the work isn’t done.
In the East, the Miami Heat overpowered the Celtics in six games to continue their amazing run this playoffs. Incredibly, the Celtics led in the series for longer than the Heat, which is another way of saying that the Celtics couldn’t close out a game. It was a repeating pattern of the Celtics staying in the lead, or in contention, until the Heat went on a late run to pull away. It happened in Game 1 where the Celtics led by as much as 14 until the last minutes when they found themselves at a tie game at the end of regulation. The teams went back and forth in OT, but two big plays sealed it for the Heat: a clutch and-1 from Jimmy Butler and a superhuman block by Bam Adebayo. The game finished at 117-111, with Jayson Tatum of the Celtics putting up 30 and veteran Goran Dragic putting up 29 for the Heat. 
In Game 2, it was a similar story, but instead it was the third quarter when the Heat made their run, outscoring the Celtics 37-17. The Celtics controlled the first half, leading by as much as 17 behind 14 points from point guard Kemba Walker and 58.1 percent shooting as a team. After halftime, however, the Heat shot 12 threes (five made), and they only let the Celtics shoot 12 shots total in the quarter, stumped by Miami’s zone defense. In the fourth, the Celtics actually crawled back to a five point lead, but it was Dragic who twisted the knife at the end, scoring 7 points in the last 3 minutes. After the game, Marcus Smart, seemingly the only player who was trying at the end, was overheard screaming at the team in the locker room.
Smart’s pep talk must have woken the team up, because in Game 3, they quickly built a 20 point lead. This time they were able to withstand the Heat’s late-game 21-7 run. It was also helpful, of course, for the Celtics to have Gordon Hayward, out with an ankle sprain, back in action. While not posting huge numbers, coach Brad Stevens called Hayward “a stabilizing force for our team” which was certainly evident in Game 3, allowing Tatum and Brown to score well over 20 points each. On the Miami side, Bam Adebayo continued to be great, posting 27 points and 16 rebounds. The Celtics finished out the game strong for a 117-106 win.
Game 4 brought yet another Heat blaze, but this time it was sparked by a single player: 20 year old rookie Tyler Herro, who has cemented himself as a promising and possibly generational talent in this series. Herro carried the team in the first three quarters with 20 points, but it was in the fourth quarter that he erupted, putting in another 17 points and toying with the Celtic’s defense. He looked like a player with experience far beyond his. Despite this, the Celtics were able to keep it competitive. Jayson Tatum nearly achieved a triple double (despite no points in the first half), and the team lost by only three points in the 112-109 final score.
The Celtics weren’t going down easy, which they proved in Game 5. They didn’t exactly come out swinging, though. Down 17-5 early, they were trailing the Heat in all metrics immediately, and they were still down 58-51 at the half. At half, point guard Kemba Walker decided to deliver a motivational speech to his team, telling them, “we just need to settle down a little bit,” according to Jaylen Brown. After the half, the team was newly rejuvenated, looking much sharper on defense, making critical plays that changed the momentum, and holding the Heat to just one field goal for much of the first half. Tatum also flourished on offense, putting up 17 in the third quarter, and the team went on a 20-3 run that won them the game. 
In Game 6, the Heat squashed the Celtic’s hopes of continuing this momentum, with the young center Bam Adebayo coming up big, dropping 32 points and 14 rebounds. The Celtics trailed early, but once Tatum, who came up empty handed in the first, got hot the Celtics were back in the game. They tied the game in the fourth and even went on a small run built by a string of impactful defensive plays, but the Heat responded with a 16-4 run of their own led by Adebayo and Butler, who finished with 26 points. Tatum and Brown finished with 24 and 26 points, respectively. 
The Finals should be an exciting series, with LeBron looking to end the argument about who is the greatest to ever play the game. On the other side, Jimmy Butler and the underdog Heat look to recall the franchise’s glory days and bring another ring to the city of Miami after multiple mediocre years.

The ketogenic diet, also known as keto, has been maintaining its popularity, but research on its health benefits is still lacking. However, that doesn’t stop popular figures such as Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow from touting anecdotal evidence of what the diet has to offer.
Keto initially displayed promising results. Earlier this year, The Tartan reported a study conducted by Yale researchers that found that mice on the keto diet saw health benefits. The results suggested that the diet had the potential to lower the risk of diabetes and inflammation. After transitioning to a keto diet, the mice exhibited lower sugar levels and inflammation. However, the benefits seemed to cut off after the one-week mark, as the excessive fat consumption led to a higher chance of the mice developing diabetes and obesity.
Researchers at the National Jewish Health recently put out a press release that examined claims regarding the keto diet. Their study confirmed the earlier Yale study that suggested initial weight loss, but they also found evidence indicating that the keto diet “may lead to stiffening of the arteries,” and potentially, a higher risk of death.
Additionally, these controlled lab studies in animals may not translate into real-life execution in people who adopt the diet. The diet restricts carbohydrate intake, encouraging people to compensate those calories with fats. Keto-friendly foods can include high levels of saturated fats, which may lead to a rise in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. LDL, the so-called “bad” cholesterol, is associated with health problems such as artery diseases, heart disease, and stroke — some of the very ailments that the diet claims to prevent.
“Diets recommended by health experts, such as plant-based and Mediterranean diets, have been extensively studied for safety and efficacy, and demonstrated conclusively to improve cardiovascular health,” says Andrew Freeman, MD, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health and co-author of the study. There may be instances in which keto may be beneficial, such as for those whose epilepsy is resistant to medication. But as far as the general public is concerned, the verdict is still out on the keto diet.

Internet advertisements have presented new challenges for civic discourse. Most notably, machine learning-based messaging optimization and micro-targeting force highly optimized and targeted political messages on viewers, often including false or misleading claims. Big Tech has long been under pressure to address the ubiquity of unchecked, misleading information, spawning policies like Twitter’s blanket worldwide ban on all political advertising and Google’s restriction of ads so they can only target general categories, such as gender, age, and approximate location.
In early September, Facebook announced that new political ads will not be accepted for the week leading up to Election Day since there may not be enough time to contest misleading or false claims. Political ads aiming to spread misinformation about the outcome of the election, such as premature declarations of victory on November 4, will also be rejected. The company also won't allow the content of existing ads to be edited, and they will add an informational label to content that questions the legitimacy of the election, which will provide facts about the integrity of the election and voting methods. In addition, posts containing misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and voting will be removed. Facebook will limit forwarding capabilities on their Messenger service, which has already begun on WhatsApp, the company’s messaging platform that sees mostly international usage. These contrast Facebook’s long-standing support of unfettered speech and prior decisions to not ban political adverts with false or deliberately misleading content.
In a similar vein, Google informed its advertisers on September 25 that given the unprecedented amount of votes to be counted after Election Day this year, ads referencing candidates, the election, or its outcome will not be run after polls close on November 3rd. Google’s decision is in line with its broader strategy to prevent confusion around sensitive events, which has also led to Google’s temporary ban on ads with coronavirus-related terms back in March and early April in an effort to minimize confusion regarding fake goods and price-gouging. The ban now applies to explicitly election-related ads, any ads that reference federal or state elections, and ads that run based on election-related search queries (e.g. searches of candidates or officeholders). Advertisers have been told to expect the ban to last at least a week. Google will review the situation on a weekly basis, considering factors including whether all ballots have been counted and whether there are major protests breaking out across the U.S.

NOVID, an anonymous COVID-19 exposure network application released by Carnegie Mellon mathematics professor Po Shen Loh in April, is now being used on the Carnegie Mellon campus. The application has also been used in the reopening efforts of Georgia Tech.
Loh had been working on another project of his, a mathematics learning platform called Expii, when he received a call to action from the Hertz Foundation community to help out in the effort to fight against COVID-19. Po Shen Loh is a Hertz Foundation Fellow, a position only awarded to 10 Ph.D candidates per year. In becoming a fellow, he also made the moral commitment to help out if there was ever a national emergency.
"This [commitment] was modeled after wartime," Loh told The Tartan in an interview. "In World War II, the Manhattan Project was involved in ending [the war], and in order to make that work there had to be people who were not only physicists, not only chemists, not only mathematicians, not only engineers, but who could do lots of things."
Loh received the call to action on March 14, "which is Pi day," Loh noted. "On March 14, this group got activated. I got a message from the community, the Foundation community, saying this is not only a national emergency, but it is an international emergency."
Loh was reading a student's paper on network theory when he realized that he could apply those network theory concepts to track the spread of the coronavirus. By creating an anonymous network, he could use an algorithm to analyze the spread of the virus while also allowing the program to deal with less details. "It wouldn't matter who everyone was, you could just send the word, the messages to people farther out," Loh said. "The whole thought was, if I have this network, we can use this to help prevent the spread of the virus."
After doing some quick online research, he found that he could utilize the built-in ultrasound communication functions of smartphones to calculate the distance between one smartphone and another without using GPS coordinates. 
While many current exposure notification applications use Bluetooth, Bluetooth is not ideal for calculating distances between devices, as it best operates in a vacuum and is easily absorbed by walls. "I could see that you can't make a Bluetooth app without diverting the laws of physics," Loh said. "And as far as I'm concerned, the laws of physics are kind of hard to get around."
Loh contacted an engineer on Expii to help him, initially thinking the two of them would be able to complete it in a week. Later realizing that he could use some more hands, he reached out on Facebook to ask if anyone was able to help. Many of the current team members were first introduced to NOVID through this Facebook post.
"It's really inspiring to see people work so hard during the day and they work on NOVID all night. They just loved it," said Stephanie Ananth, an iOS developer for NOVID. "I mean, it was also a little intimidating for sure. But it's really cool to work with people who are so passionate and so talented and really hard-working and just good people. It's also really cool seeing that software that I wrote is helping people in the real world."
As NOVID developed, organizations started contacting them to see if it was possible for them to collaborate. Georgia Tech had been interested in developing their own exposure notification app to supplement their manual contact tracing when they heard about NOVID.
"[Developing the app] was originally an open source effort at Georgia Tech," said Alexa Harter, who was one of the people taking the lead in integrating NOVID into the campus. "But there were some limitations with Apple and Google API in terms of what was available. We ended up selecting NOVID because there was a strong alignment in what we wanted and what it would do. We had discussions with different groups on campus, and a huge priority was to have an anonymous application."
Both Carnegie Mellon and Georgia Tech have made NOVID an option, but not mandatory, for students to use on campus.
"Our current efforts are centered around community awareness to garner more users," Jason Maderer told The Tartan in an email. "The greater the network of users downloading the app, the greater its usefulness for everyone."
The NOVID team hopes that NOVID can be spread not only to other parts of the community or the county, but also internationally as a way to fight viruses and infectious diseases.
"An analogy I would like to use [is] if you didn't have headlights and you didn't have streetlights and you're driving around in the night, you'd just crash," Loh said. "That's essentially what it's like with COVID. So if we give everyone headlights, we can prevent these crashes."

September has been a colorful month in the tech industry, with exciting product launches from multiple companies, along with some questionable product sales.
First off, the launches. The Apple tradition of September events is still on, with a fully-virtual event on September 15. Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 6 during the event, which includes features that help users improve their health and fitness. Apple also announced a cheaper watch, called the Apple Watch SE, which aims to expand the market for smartwatches. Through the launch of this cheaper Apple Watch, Apple hopes to continue the success of their iPhone SE, which launched earlier in 2020. New iPads were also launched, with the new iPad Air looking more like an iPad Pro and a refreshed iPad which features new processors. Notably, new iPhones are absent from this event, which misses the Apple tradition of launching new smartphones in September. 2020 is still not it.
Another exciting launch came from NVIDIA, following their purchase of ARM late last month. NVIDIA launched the RTX 30 series graphics cards on September 1. With an underwhelming RTX 20 series which was their last major graphics card launch, NVIDIA hopes their RTX 30 series can capture an even larger share of the consumer GPU market. The RTX 30 series delivered on that promise, with some 40-50% performance increase between the RTX 3080 compared to the RTX 2080, as well as a new “BFGPU” called the RTX 3090, which is something of its own class, promising gameplay at 8K resolution which is something that nothing before it could achieve. The -90 name in NVIDIA’s GPU lineup has not been used since the GTX 690, which was launched in 2012.
With that big of an increase in performance, PC gamers have prepared their cash, and they are ready to get the new graphics cards. However, the launch was anything but peaceful. When the RTX 3080 went on sale on September 17, stock from all retailers evaporated in a very short time. What made the situation worse was that excessive use of bots from scalpers led to even less stock available for gamers who did not wish to resell and just wanted to play. 
PC gamers began trolling these scalpers on eBay, who listed graphics cards with ridiculously high prices. The RTX 3080, which has an MSRP of $799, has been “sold” on eBay for ridiculous 5-digit prices, but there’s a catch: eBay bidders don’t have to pay the final price, which means that these cards are likely unpaid and unsold in the end, meaning scalpers cannot get their money back from these cards.
The launch for the RTX 3090, which was on September 24, was no less disastrous than the RTX 3080 launch. NVIDIA is trying to prevent their RTX 3070 launch to go awry like 3080 and 3090, so they pushed the launch date of the 3070 by 2 weeks, from October 15 to October 29, to make more stock available on launch day.
Disastrous product launches don’t stop there, however. The PlayStation 5 launch was scheduled on September 17, but some retailers got the message wrong and launched pre-orders on September 16. Several websites that are set to carry the PS5 have had their websites crash or load everything painfully slow. Some customers who placed pre-orders may not even get their consoles on time, as demand outstripped supply. So, in short, it was a bad time.
Disastrous launches combined with great products made September a very interesting month for tech enthusiasts, indeed.

My doctor has told me that I need to avoid things that increase my blood pressure so that my heart doesn’t give out at the age of 30. Of course, I don’t listen to her at all. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here telling you all about Love on a Leash, a 2011 movie about a woman who falls in love with a stray dog, but the dog secretly turns into a man at night. I figured in quarantine time, it was finally time to watch this. 
So before going into this, I think everyone should know why this exists. I didn’t find out about this until recently, but the voice actor for the dog, Stephen Kramer Glickman, was interviewed about what happened. In the late 2000s, the writer and director of the film, Fen Tian, had convinced a Chinese church that her movie would be about the spirit of Jesus helping people find love. Of course, when the church’s priest found that it wasn’t, they pulled the funding for the movie. 
Glickman was literally paid in cantaloupes to voice act the dog, only to be asked to re-record all his lines later as he was being tapped to play Shrek on Broadway. He also hadn’t met anyone else in the cast, and the editor of the movie asked Glickman not to mention his name in the interview. 
I don’t know where to start with this movie, so we’ll start at the beginning. There’s no music over the opening credit montage of this really cute labrador running around. Then the labrador comments on the hotness of the women at the park, stares at extras awkwardly kissing each other, and notes how much he wants to find a girl. Then he talks to Water Pond — yes, the character is named Water Pond and is quite literally a pond with some random bubbling sounds and sparkle effects added in post — who says that he can turn back into a man if he finds a girl. 
From there, we’re introduced to the other main character, Lisa, who, by the way, is always wearing green clothing. She lives in a green house, has a green car, and everything she owns is green. Glickman had asked the director about this, and her response to him was something about the color green representing horniness in China? I tried to look this up after, and the only things I found were some pretty NSFW results. 
Lisa also has a friend named Paula. She has this running bit throughout the whole movie where she views men as nothing but objects for pleasure and they’re good for “a little something something.” She’s also a Black woman with a lot of questionable dialogue and direction as if the director told her to play a caricature of a Black woman. Then in some bizarre sequence of events that still makes no sense, the dog convinces Lisa to drive him to her home. The dog sings in her car, Lisa gives him a shower in a Benny Hill-type sped up montage, and then he just leaves and sings about how he’s leaving? We are only 5 minutes into this. Good lord. 
At this point, I should say something really quickly about the audio quality of this movie. You know how we’ve all done that one project in iMovie for a class and the audio sounds like it was recorded with a potato? That’s the audio in this movie, except it just randomly cuts in and out, it clips a lot, and there is no music the entire time. So the movie will go from complete silence to audio clipping the next second, and I kept getting jump scared by it. Plus there is some really bad dubbing and even worse audio editing. A shot will end and cut to the next scene, but the dialogue from the previous scene will still be playing over this next shot too. 
In the next 25 minutes, this is what happens in order. Lisa deals with a farting “Karen” at a department store, and then, she gets asked out by a fellow employee named Kyle. The dog fakes an injury to convince Lisa to let him bunk with her. She goes on a date with Kyle, gets convinced by her friend to go get new clothes, and goes shopping with the dog, whose real name, according to him, is Alvin Flang. The dog gets kicked by the store owner but impresses everyone when he manages to pick out clothes and gains the eye of a talent agent. 
Now we see that Lisa’s boss is into her, but he’s harassing her. She’s also being stalked by a weird dude named Frank. It turns out Lisa’s nosy neighbor (?), Rita is trying to set her up with Frank, and Lisa goes on a date with Frank after Paula and Lisa’s mom convince her it’s ok to see multiple guys at once. So she goes on a date with Frank, but Frank’s psychotic, nutritionist mother spends the whole time talking about weight and dieting. Then she calls Kyle over to her house, and he asks her to marry him. But there’s a twist! He says to her it would be a marriage in name only because Kyle is actually gay, and he only wants the marriage for the tax benefits or something.
Now Lisa’s boss breaks into her house and tries to assault her, but the dog saves her. The boss angrily fires her on the spot. Lisa has a huge mental breakdown during which the dog is singing how he is the “king of the castle who’s also a dog and lives in a house that is green.” He tries to make a move, she pushes him away, and then, she tries to overdose on pills. So the dog goes outside to lure a stranger to call 911 by playing dead in the street. He saves her, but the dog is back out on the street singing about how that hurts his feet and makes him sad. 
Lisa goes after the dog to try to find him, who she named Prince way earlier, and she tracks him down at the park. She confesses her love, and how she wants to be with him forever. Then, Prince transforms into a man played by a totally different actor. The man form of Prince explains how he was punished to live as a dog for being a cheating playboy in his past life, which honestly doesn’t sound that bad. There’s a really awkward sex scene, and then in the morning, he turns back into a dog. Water Pond tells him he can only be a man at night. 
In 30 minutes, there have been three subplots resolved, three others established, and the main plot only developed 30 minutes in after the subplots. These are also not happening concurrently, but one at a time, as if someone with short-term memory loss made the movie. To the poor soul reading this [*editor’s note: I can’t believe I’ve been forced to read this*], I have seen some confusing things in my life, and this is far and away the most confusing thing I’ve ever seen. The rest of the movie is even more confusing. 
The audio isn’t the only thing in this movie that’s potato quality. The cinematography is, too. It’s not just that it looks bad, but also the fact that some of the shots just don’t make sense. There are dutch angles everywhere, the actors are constantly out of frame, and there are some really terrifying closeups with the actors lit like they’re in a horror movie. One shot in particular that stuck out was when Lisa’s mom called her to tell her to date four or five guys at a time, and she’s shrouded in silhouette like it’s a Hitchcock movie. 
The actors for the dog are not just different people, but they each play them differently. When the dog is in dog form, he’s absolutely horrible. At one point Lisa is changing her clothes, and she asks the dog “what are you looking at?” He responds “not much.” But the dog in man form is super sweet, just a caring guy who just wants to look after her. It also doesn’t help that they’re all reading dialogue that sounds like it was Google translated from a different language, which according to Glickman, was how the script was actually written. 
The rest of this movie gets a bit dragged out despite having so many subplots, so I’ll breeze through the rest. Lisa and Alvin Flang fall in love and live happily, and Alvin Flang tries to provide for them by going to meet the talent agent from earlier. He films a commercial and makes a lot of money. Paula comes to visit one night, and Lisa tries to hide Alvin. She finds him and scares Paula who feels betrayed, and the two friends fall out even though Paula has been trying to get Lisa to lose her virginity the whole time so far.
Anyway, Water Pond tells Alvin Flang that he has not shown real, true love yet. So he meets Lisa’s mom and her nosy neighbor Rita, which goes well. Of course, the limitation of being a man at night is that by day he is a dog, so Lisa’s mom has a panic attack when she thinks that Alvin Flang ditched her, believing she will die alone as a virgin. Then nosy Rita goes snooping, chases Alvin around in broad daylight, and tries to get him to leave her. Finally, Lisa puts her foot down and shows some backbone for once in this stupid movie. 
Some other stuff happens. They disagree about having a kid. They go to an art museum. They change the rules, so he can only turn into a dog if it’s sunny. There’s a cloudy day, and Lisa takes Alvin to meet the boss of her job to get a promotion. Of course, it gets sunny. Alvin turns back into a dog, and Lisa almost drowns in a pool when she freaks out about it. The dog saves her while calling her a “pizza faced cinder block.” 
They realize this relationship isn’t working, so Alvin leaves her. Then, he talks to Water Pond who imparts some lesson about patience and working problems out or some other bogus lesson that makes no sense. Alvin realizes he loves her and tries to run back to her, but he gets hit by a car in dog form. Lisa holds Alvin, in dog form, in her arms as he dies and confesses his love with his dying breath. I’m not sure if making the dog “act” in this movie counts as animal abuse. 
Years pass. Paula randomly comes back with her grandkids to reconcile with Lisa, and they reminisce about good old times. Alvin Flang is resurrected somehow, which I guess is the Jesus portion of the film Fen Tian told the church that funded this. He’s young, but he touches her hands and turns old. Then, they get married and turn young again, and it ends. 
I don’t know what this is or why I watched it, but I am glad I did. This is a gem. Every line of dialogue in this movie could and should become a meme if this becomes a famous enough cult movie. So I’m doing my part in expanding the Love on a Leash cult by telling you all to watch it. It’s on YouTube right now for free in its full glory, and I really can’t think of a better use of 85 minutes of your time.

A total of 25 COVID-19 cases among students, faculty, and staff present on campus have been reported by Carnegie Mellon since the university began testing in March, with an additional 51 testing positive off-campus. The university has attempted to keep case numbers low by testing random samples of students in the Pittsburgh area, asking students to follow CDC guidelines, and monitoring students’ symptoms with the Daily Self-Assessment survey.
One of the criteria for students attending Carnegie Mellon this semester is the completion of the daily self assessment. Students must comply with mandatory testing protocols, respond to contact tracing, and obtain a seasonal flu vaccine. It is a requirement that students contribute to the prevention and monitoring of COVID-19 in and around the Tartan community, as stated in A Tartan’s Responsibility.
For students, the daily-self assessment is a brief survey of three questions asking whether one has recently had close contact with someone with COVID-19, with two of those asking about one’s current symptoms and temperature. The faculty and staff daily assessment survey adds one question, asking if one plans to be on campus that day. Students are expected to take the survey before starting their day, and the university has written that it is a student’s responsibility to do so. To ensure that students complete the survey, students receive a text message and an email each morning at 7 a.m. with a hyperlink to the daily self-assessment. 
So far, Carnegie Mellon University has seen a steady rise in the number of students who have completed the survey. According to a statement provided to The Tartan by university spokesperson Julie Mattera, around three-quarters of all students reply to the survey, but not necessarily on a regular basis. Because of this, the university has begun sending reminders to students who have not been regularly completing the survey, expecting an increase in day-to-day compliance. “Failure to complete the survey is a violation of A Tartan’s Responsibility,” Mattera wrote. If a student continually fails to adhere to the COVID-19 rules set by the university, they are “subject to university action, which may include revocation of on-campus privileges and action regarding student misconduct.” 
“The Daily Self-Assessment is an important element in CMU’s COVID-19 mitigation strategy. The survey is recommended by public health experts and is meant to help members of the community remember to regularly monitor for physical symptoms, isolate if they are feeling ill, and contact healthcare providers proactively,” Mattera stated.
“Data from the survey is used in a few ways,” Mattera wrote, “compliance data is reviewed by leadership as one indicator in the University's effort to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.” She added that “aggregated data showing increases in reported symptoms or close contact experiences help university staff identify early signs of the potential spread of the virus in the community.”
The data obtained from these surveys is collected and stored by the university and accessed by University Health Services (UHS). The university is tracking log-ins to the survey to “to determine whether students have completed the form,” according to Mattera. However, the answers to the survey’s questions remain anonymous. Therefore, it is the duty of students who answer "yes" to any of the questions of the daily self-assessment to contact UHS so that the university can take proper action to prevent the spread of the virus.   
The measures taken by Carnegie Mellon are an attempt to take effective steps toward countering the spread of the virus and keeping the number of cases low. According to the university, “Adhering to these responsibilities is critical to maintaining a healthy living, learning, and working environment during the COVID-19 pandemic”.

On Oct. 2, the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) hosted a discussion with Stuart Milk, the nephew of Harvey Milk and president of the Harvey Milk Foundation, and former Ambassador Richard Grenell, Senior Fellow at the Institute for Politics and Strategy, concerning the work both speakers are doing for the decriminalization of homosexuality worldwide. The event marked Grenell’s first public campus appearance following an appointment clouded in controversy.
Milk and Grenell's opening remarks focused on the work each had done for the issue, with Grenell focusing on decriminalization and Milk focusing on legalization and social acceptance, as well as high praise for each other for their respective efforts. Upon encouragement from Kiron Skinner, who stated she had “promised students a debate”, the discussion then shifted from their joint effort on the issues towards a debate about the 2020 election and the presidential candidates' approaches to LGBT rights.
Milk expressed his strong support for Joe Biden in the upcoming election, stating that besides Grenell’s work, the Trump administration has been “overall, antithetical to human rights.” He stressed his political views were separate from his foundation, which has 501(c)(3) status, but he made light of the Obama administration’s role in furthering LGBT rights. 
Grenell countered Milk’s claims by stating that Biden opposed same-sex marriage during Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, that Trump is the “first president in history to come into office supporting gay marriage,” and that the Republican party has changed their stance on the issues. Both Biden and Obama are on the record prior to the 2012 election supporting gay marriage. Trump is on the record in early 2016 discussing the appointment of a judge to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court case legalizing same-sex marriage. The Republican platform in 2016 condemns same-sex marriage, and there have not been any platform changes announced for the 2020 election. Grenell also briefly worked as a spokesman for Mitt Romney in the 2012 election, who was against same-sex marriage and civil unions at the time. Despite their political differences, Milk and Grenell made consistent efforts to respect each other’s views and highlight their shared passion for LGBT rights. 
Following the debate, questions were opened to the audience. The first question asked for clarification on the difference between decriminalization and legalization and whether the work focuses on transgender rights. Grenell stated he “[fights] for gay and lesbian rights” and is “not a trans activist”, though he is “a full supporter of trans rights”, and added that decriminalization is “the first step” when it comes to LGBT rights. 
Milk stated that, in his view, trans rights are not separate and that “any type of criminalization against any element of the LGBT community is a criminalization of us all.” He also discussed that he views legalization not just from a legal standpoint, but a civil one too, and he believes societal acceptance and legal acceptance of LGBT rights should go hand in hand. 
Grenell was also asked about his decision to defy the State Department’s decision to not allow the pride flag to fly on embassy flagpoles. He encouraged the audience to read more and “not listen to the media so much,” adding that the order was that only the American flag was meant to fly on the main flagpole, but he was allowed to fly the flag on any secondary flag poles, which the Berlin embassy had. 
Comments from State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus in June 2019 indicate that the order didn’t make an exception for secondary flagpoles. Accordingly, only the American flag was meant to fly on any embassy flagpole. 
Grenell also discussed his efforts to make LGBT rights a bipartisan issue. He has “articulated over the years that I am a consistent conservative” by following the conservative philosophy of “personal responsibility” and “[minding] your own business.” He also stresses that the Republican party is no longer a party that it was “six years ago, or eight years ago” with an “anti-gay” agenda, and anyone who expresses those views will be “run out of the party.”
Milk countered Grenell’s comments by citing the Trump administration’s rollback of transgender rights, particularly in military service. In addition, the Republican platform endorses religious liberty legislation, which would allow for businesses, schools, and other entities to discriminate against LGBT people. Vice President Pence also spoke at a conference for the Family Research Council, a group designated as an “anti-LGBT hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2018. 
Significant time was devoted to answering a question concerning the rise of right wing movements in Europe and the threat they pose to LGBT rights. Grenell argued that it is “not a black and white issue,” adding that both Angela Merkel and the far-left German party were “not good on gay rights.” Angela Merkel, the German chancellor associated with the conservative-leaning Christian Democratic Union (CDU), opposed same-sex marriage in 2017, but she called a vote to legalize after pressure from the left-wing opposition coalition, as well as a shift in support of the issue among her own base. 
Grenell also emphasized a “difficult thing” for him was the fact that he had met with the far-left German party, who he reiterated were bad on LGBT issues, but he didn’t meet with an openly lesbian leader from Alternative for Deutschland (AfD), the far-right German party, as it was “an embassy policy that I would not meet [with AfD]." The leader, Alice Weidel, rallies AfD members around the single issue of immigration, and the AfD opposes LGBT rights.
Milk was quick to disagree with Grenell’s politicking about the lack of danger in the rise of the far-right in Europe, saying “it is something that should be on everyone’s table.” He gave an explicit example of the rollback of LGBT rights in Hungary under Viktor Orban’s regime, even giving the personal story of an LGBT activist he had worked with for years being killed in Hungary. 
Under the leadership of Viktor Orban, Hungary has moved toward authoritarianism, and Orban’s government has fostered a hostile environment for the LGBT community. Grenell was paid for work he did with the Magyar Foundation, a non-profit mostly funded by the Hungarian government under Orban.
When asked about his statements empowering the European conservative movement, Grenell denied it, calling the question “silly,” and he said that he wanted to “empower people like me, which meant gays, and gay conservatives.” In an interview with Brietbart, he explicitly states he “absolutely [wants] to empower other conservatives throughout Europe”, further adding how it’s “an exciting time” for him while serving as ambassador to Germany. During that time, Grenell supported Sebastian Kurz, the far-right chancellor of Austria, and he implied that Germans were looking for leaders like him, even organizing a lunch for Kurz who he called a “rockstar.” 
To close out the talk, both Grenell and Milk agreed that the next step in the future strategy of decriminalization is pushing the private sector to do more to engage in the decriminalization issue. Grenell says while he does not want companies to “stop doing business in all 69 countries that criminalize homosexuality”, he does think there is a way “to use your leverage and to use your power to try and make change.”
Milk goes further in his final comment: “it’s in the bottom line, self interest of those companies to support the decriminalization movement, to support the visibility movement, and to support LGBTQ rights.”
Emily Half, deputy director of IPS, announced at the beginning of the event that it was to be off the record, and that questions would be moderated by entry into the chat function on Zoom due to the event’s high attendance. An IPS spokesperson told The Tartan that they stated the event was off the record to allow the speakers to be “candid” and give the “best information possible.” However, the event was open to anyone affiliated with Carnegie Mellon with no written agreement to keep the details of the talk off the record.

In 2016, a devout Christian man drove from North Carolina to a little pizzeria in Washington D.C. named Comet Ping Pong. Armed with an AR-15 assault rifle, he arrived for the sole purpose of stopping a sex trafficking ring run by the Clintons. The infamous Pizzagate became an endless source of memes for those not part of the fringe-right, but I don’t think anyone could have truly comprehended the degree to which Pizzagate would be a turning point for far-right radicalization.
Later on in 2017, an anonymous 4Chan user going by the name of “Q” posted in the /pol/ forum claiming that he was someone with a high security clearance who had evidence that Trump is fighting a secret war against the “deep state”. The conspiracy hinges around Trump’s own rhetoric: everyone is out for him and he is the one who is right about the way things truly are.
Since then, QAnon has evolved into a decentralized, far-right, white supremacist network whose conspiracies and rhetoric have been co-opted by many far-right “news” organizations, militias and extremists, not to mention many Republican politicians and congressional candidates. Even Pittsburgh’s Mayor, Bill Peduto, has retweeted a QAnon conspiracy theory. To add to this, about half of Americans are at least aware of QAnon, and believers are able to maintain a strong presence, despite social media platforms like Twitter continuously trying to ban QAnon content and accounts.
One of the latest QAnon conspiracy theories, #SaveTheChildren, focuses on an alleged sex-trafficking cabal run by elite Democrats, while hijacking the legitimate efforts of the nonprofit Save The Children. The theory is absurd and baseless, but it has found a significant and sizable audience of people you wouldn’t expect. Suburban housewives and some parenting influencers, who once posted Minion memes and “1 like = 1 prayer” posts, have transitioned to posting QAnon content. These same people are also reposting the bogus “5G causes coronavirus” conspiracy theory, as well as the conspiracy that Bill Gates and other liberal elites planned the pandemic.
It’s easy to laugh in disbelief at insane fringe conspiracy theories and at the “Karens” and “boomers” who believe them. But this level of detachment from reality combined with a self-destructive, narcissistic view of the world can very easily lead to violence. It has already done so, to the point that the FBI believes QAnon is a source of domestic terrorism.
Since it is such a decentralized network, QAnon’s disinformation and supporters move between other right-wing networks easily. For example, incels, a group of frustrated men who blame their personality issues on women, LGBT+ people, and minorities, have a huge overlap with QAnon and other far-right and white supremacist networks.
The rise of these far-right movements and fascism isn’t new. There’s a correlation between financial crises and the rise of far-right populism, as political figures take advantage of the institutional distrust and disaffection toward the elite to present simple solutions to systemic issues at the expense of minorities and immigrants. Once accepted into the mainstream, the ideology spreads like wildfire.
The 2008 financial crisis was a boon for the far-right Tea Party movement in 2010, and the Republicans quickly accepted them. With a Democrat president in power who had just bailed out the banks without punishing anyone involved, combined with the anti-globalization sentiment that had been festering, it was too easy for the Tea Party to gain momentum. Similar movements also took place across Europe, as well as in India and Latin America later on in the decade.
The Tea Party movement was normalized through palatable buzzwords and imagery, and figures like Sarah Palin were capable of embodying the movement. We’re seeing that now with the rise of fascism under the Trump administration.
The Democratic Party is mildly complicit in this process, as they had ample opportunity to provide strong opposition and failed to do so. Instead, they forwarded establishment politics and passed increases in the military budget, created ICE detention centers, and passed corporatist economic policies. Combine all of the above with social media echo chambers accelerating the spread of disinformation, and we’ve reached an environment where QAnon is a movement with legitimate mainstream support. The current attempts at opposition from Democrats, while welcome, have come too little, too late.
However, QAnon is just the tip of the iceberg. There are much more dangerous far-right networks that still have yet to be designated as terrorism. Major attacks, such as in El Paso, Charleston, Pittsburgh, and recently in Kenosha, are not labeled as acts of terrorism, but all of the attackers have connections to the diffuse network of white supremacy.
This all sounds terrifying, but we should not be scared by the far-right. That’s giving in to what they want. We should also not try to reason with them because they’re too far gone from reality, and white supremacy and fascism are not “opposing views.” We should not provide platforms for them to amplify their ideology as that fuels their self-victimization narrative. This should be obvious, but I continue to hear rhetoric that we should let them talk so that we can understand them and expose them, which is not doable. A simple glance at any far-right forum will prove that point.
I imagine, in a world where CEOs get punished for robbing the country and our politicians are invested in the working class instead of the One Percent, things may be different today. But the current reality is that the Trump administration has normalized far-right, white supremacist movements. After all, the president endorsed eugenics in a Minnesota rally, all while ICE is performing hysterectomies on migrant women in concentration camps on the border and right-wing terrorism is on the rise. It’s our obligation to cut through the noise and stand up strong against the fascists and the far-right. I hate to say it, but the future of the country is at stake.

The COVID pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives, from the ways we communicate and interact to an upheaval in higher education. During March of this year, thousands of college students were abruptly sent home and transferred to Zoom University in the middle of their Spring semester. At Carnegie Mellon, there was a temporary change in grading policy, allowing students to elect for classes to be pass/fail solely for the Spring semester, which was commonplace across universities. All classes could be converted to pass/fail, and if a student was not sure, they could wait up to seven days after their final grade was released to convert it. Students had autonomy and agency over how they wanted their academics to be presented on their transcripts. This grading change, put forth by the Provost’s Office and Senior Leadership, recognized that there were additional and intense stressors due to the pandemic that took priority over static grading policies. Surviving and staying safe was the paramount concern for everyone, not the perennial obsession of worrying about grades. The fear of contracting the virus and the overall uncertainty in the world jolted Carnegie Mellon into making a humanistic and gracious change to its grading policy. With students and staff adapting to an online modality and many students scattered across the globe, the change was a welcome relief at an incredibly difficult time. The changes in the policy were exclusive to the Spring semester. Most people did not expect the pandemic to last more than a few weeks. This Fall semester, the university has returned to a less flexible policy concerning pass/fail conversions. The pragmatic, understanding beneficence extended in the spring has not been fully replicated, but it needs to be.
What has changed since Spring 2020? Yes, the number of COVID cases has flattened after a summer spike, and the world is starting to shift back into a reflection of normalcy. However, the majority of classes are still online, and most students are still learning remotely. The stress of the virus, coupled with online classes, is still with us. It may be comforting to think and believe that the worst part of the pandemic is over, but it is not and may not be for some time. Flare-ups and rising cases across the United States are occurring, and some are due to the reopening of colleges. A number of colleges have reopened, just to send their students back home again. The same possibility exists for Carnegie Mellon. Thousands of students and faculty may have to pack up their things once again and shift back to a fully remote modality. The potential for things to pivot and change in a matter of days is an unstated worry. While the number of cases is relatively low, the changing seasons and potential relaxing of protocol can still obliterate this false sense of security. In light of a potential second wave of the virus, the Spring semester has been pushed back until February 1st, 2021; but will there be a modified pass/fail election period for Spring 2021? Carnegie Mellon has not commented thus far. If the university is willing to amend the calendar for the rest of the year, why should the grading policy remain frozen for the rest of 2020 and 2021? 
As the Fall semester is going into its midterm week, aren’t the same stressors present in spring still present in students’ lives, and won’t they remain? Online zoom classes are far from ideal, and trying home situations for remote students must be taken into consideration. The emotional well-being and health of students, besides setting aside one day of presentations and Zooms for “mental health,” for the Virtual Tartan Community Day doesn’t assuage many fears and anxieties over this academic year. Going on Zoom for another full day to discuss mindfulness and meditation is admirable in spirit, but allowing students to have agency over their academics during this extremely stressful and ‘unprecedented time’ is needed again for the Fall semester. 
For in-person students, the stress of being in close proximity to other students, and being potentially exposed and quarantined must be taken into consideration. Constant testing, caution, and isolation make the hybrid students’ experience a different experience from that of remote students. With these considerations, for both remote and hybrid students, does it make sense to leave the pass/fail in the spring and return things to normal in the fall in terms of grading? No: staying safe and alive is still the presumptive priority and should be treated as such in all policies, not just the obvious ones about social distancing and following CDC guidelines.  
There is a polarization in university grading policies across the United States for Fall 2020 compared to the previous spring. While many universities are adopting their ‘normal’ grading policies and suspending the flexible grading policies implemented in the Spring semester of 2020, there are some nonconformists. For example, MIT has spoken about its innovative “safety nets” for the Fall semester. No students will fail any class. If a student receives lower than a D letter grade, then the class simply won’t show up on their transcript. A student can also decide to keep the D on the transcript, or they can elect to remove it. There will still be letter grades but no failing grades. Other colleges, such as Bowdoin College, also have similar safeguards for the semester. While some students would rather receive letter grades for their prospective resumes and graduate school applications, the changes Carnegie Mellon made in the spring would at least allow students to choose what is best for them and their situation. 
It is difficult to imagine that remote learning is something students feel comfortable paying $28,780 for a semester. Hybrid learning is still not the full realization of a college education. The synthesizing of remote learning into all of the colleges across the world was not a democratic choice, but one of necessity. Remote learning was reactionary and still is, even if it is advertised as something proactive. It was enforced as a response to an emergency and is not something that included students’ views or voices. Instead of shifting academic policies to what they were before the virus and not engaging in any dialogue with the students and their families, Carnegie Mellon should look to MIT and other institutions that are recognizing students’ hardships, which are not defined by the spring of this year, but by the duration of the Coronavirus and its effects. More dialogue and conversations with all constituencies are readily needed to address this concern.

As the West Coast continues to burn, we are reminded that despite the new challenges 2020 has thrown our way, climate change continues to press upon the health and well-being of our environment in mortally pressing ways. From savage wildfires to rising sea levels, it is impossible to dispute the reality of climate change or its devastating consequences, both present and generational.
In response to the problem of climate change, the city of Pittsburgh has taken some steps in the right direction, such as reducing fossil fuel usage, setting a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% within the next 10 years, and passing an ordinance in 2016 requiring all building owners with 50,000 square feet or more of property to report energy and water usage. This last initiative is particularly noteworthy, as it intends to use the gathered data to incentivize property managers to lower energy consumption by giving prospective tenants the ability to compare energy costs between different locations, hopefully sparking competition to lower energy usage and energy bills. Data for 2017 and 2018 have already been released, and data for 2019 is being prepared for release.
As a Pittsburgh institution, Carnegie Mellon was included in this analysis. Compared to other universities like Duquesne University and University of PIttsburgh, our campus is by far the most energy inefficient, even after a 70% reduction in energy use since 2005. In 2018 alone, Carnegie Mellon emitted 30,000 more tons of greenhouse gases than the University of Pittsburgh. 
A troubling statistic on its own, the energy inefficiency of Carnegie Mellon’s campus goes right to the heart of the university’s contradictory messaging on climate change and other controversial issues. It is clear that Carnegie Mellon goes to great lengths to make it seem like they care about the environment, with multiple research and educational initiatives centered around creating technologies to combat climate change. And when the campus expands, the environmental impact of such an expansion is taken into account, such as when the Tepper Quad was designed in such a way that it was deemed energy efficient enough for a LEED Gold Certification. The message of environmental conservatism is not lost on Carnegie Mellon, and the administration does its best to project a favorable image in this respect.
Yet, for all the good the university seemingly does, it is undeniable that Carnegie Mellon participates in dealings that are counterproductive to combating climate change, and recent reporting from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gives yet another example of this hypocritical behavior. In collaboration with city economic development officials, Carnegie Mellon tried to impress ExxonMobil executives, hoping to convince them to invest in another petrochemical plant in Western Pennsylvania similar to the Shell cracker plant in Beaver County. 
It does not take a climate scientist to see that another petrochemical plant is the last thing we need right now, but the university is signaling an intent to push the region away from sustainable energy sources. Any organization opting, even in part, to accelerate the trends of climate change experienced locally and across the United States is culpable for the destruction of our future. 
What’s particularly frustrating about this is that Carnegie Mellon is not some powerless entity being strong-armed into these negotiations by special interests or powerful corporations. For better or worse, Carnegie Mellon is a prestigious university with significant resources, and with that comes the ability to affect real change. And yet, acting of its own volition, the university is choosing to help secure further investments in petrochemicals, which cause significant harm to the surrounding environment with the potential for lasting impacts across the world.
It is not even the case that Carnegie Mellon has never worked with renewable energy companies before. According to Steve Guenther, the assistant vice president for Facilities Management and Campus Services, Carnegie Mellon currently buys a significant portion of its energy from a wind farm based in Illinois. Enough energy, in fact, that it would have reduced the reported greenhouse gas emissions by half had it been included in the city’s data analysis. Still, energy credits do not stop Carnegie Mellon from burning natural gas to power the whole campus. 
So it is clear that Carnegie Mellon recognizes the feasibility of renewable energy and takes strides towards incorporating it into its own internal workings, but they are unwilling to stray from the beaten path, all in the name of economic interests and money. As usual, it is money above ethics, and it is this same attitude we see reflected in decisions such as increasing tuition year over year, refusing to lower tuition fees for students during the pandemic, refusing to switch to all virtual classes, and pandering to military collaborations for big dollars from the U.S. government. With every misguided decision, we are reminded again that at its core, Carnegie Mellon functions more like a corporation than a place of higher education, funded in large part by students.
That is not to say that Carnegie Mellon is incapable of doing good things. We have world-class research facilities and talented students and faculty who truly care about climate change and who leverage the resources of the university towards solving problems that will bring us another step closer to a more sustainable future. Rather than continuing this two-faced attitude, Carnegie Mellon should invest in local renewable energy companies, not ExxonMobil, and they should make campus more energy efficient in every way possible. 
Now is not the time for grand, empty gestures or “voluntary university reviews” that say little about concrete climate action, and it is beyond time for an unequivocal denial of petrochemicals and unsustainable energy sources by the administration. It is never easy to break from the mainstream, but for an institution that prides itself on innovation, discovery, and the courage to foray into the unknown, it is long overdue.

Similar to the leaking of President Trump’s derogatory statements and his downplaying of COVID-19, The New York Times’ release of his tax information should serve to remind us how invincible he is to scandal among his supporters. 
According to the Times’ breakdown, President Trump paid a grand total of $750 in federal income taxes in 2017. There are two ways of interpreting this figure, neither of which paint the President in a good way. However, it doesn’t matter how his contributions are looked at, since it’s unlikely that his supporters will be swayed much in either direction.
President Trump’s low 2017 tax figure points to some seriously eyebrow-raising losses. The Times reports that the President’s net income was nearly negative $13 million and that he used millions in general business credits to hop over his alternative minimum tax obligation. The President has heavily advertised himself as a successful businessman and banked on this characteristic during the 2016 primaries. Given his losses, however, it should be hard for anyone to give him any sort of credit as a businessman or as a successful leader.
Sure, the President has been losing millions in recent years, but still, $750? For a man who spends tens of thousands on his hair alone, does $750 sound right or even remotely fair? Of all of the people I’ve met who’ve paid more in a single year of taxes, none of them can afford to hire a hairstylist for the salary of an average college graduate. 
For his net worth, he’s never been much of a philanthropist, which, paired with his low taxes, make his tax-funded travel and activities seem all the more outrageous. After the President’s Inauguration, The First Lady opted to remain in New York to not inconvenience Barron Trump’s education. This poor choice ended up taking a high economic toll on the Secret Service and streetside businesses near Trump Tower.
Despite any of this, The New York Times’s revelation will be sickeningly inconsequential. You might tell yourself there’s no way President Trump could possibly win with such a scandal on his hands. In reality, I told myself the same thing in 2016, after hearing him say “grab ’em by the p****.” Trump supporters already distrust The New York Times, and they have shown themselves to be unmoved by previous scandals. It’s equally unlikely that a fence-sitter will hop to Biden, given they have been undecided over the long history of Trump’s problems.
The President’s shiny, well-kept locks of hair act as a mask over his loose, greasy scalp. Similarly, his taxes should remind us that he is a deceptive failure hiding underneath gold and glamor. If you haven’t already, stop what you’re doing: register to vote.
