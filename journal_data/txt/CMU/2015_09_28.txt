The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took the field on Tuesday night looking to defend their undefeated record against the Baldwin Wallace Yellow Jackets. While the Tartan women may have been tired for their third game in five days, they certainly didn’t show it as they handily defeated Baldwin Wallace 4–1.
The Tartans came out with an early aggressive push that paid dividends in the eighth minute when senior midfielder Louisa Pendergast made a smooth goal into the lower right corner off a great pass through the defense from sophomore midfielder Haili Adams. The game lulled for a bit after the initial score as Baldwin Wallace put up a strong fight against the Tartan’s pressure. But as the game went on, the Tartans took control of the field until the Yellow Jackets seemed unable to force the ball to the Carnegie Mellon side. In the 29th minute, the pressure proved to be too much for the Yellow Jackets as Tartan sophomore forward Sienna Stritter was fouled making a move in the box. This set the Tartans up for a penalty kick, and Pendergast rose to the occasion once again, sending the ball past the Yellow Jacket goalkeeper to put Carnegie Mellon up 2–0. The Tartans rode this momentum through the rest of the game, and in the 38th minute, the Tartans seeimngly began to show off when first-year midfielder Tessa Allen leapt over the defense and headed a ball into the goal off of a corner kick from junior midfielder Delaney Lam. The Tartan’s final score of the game came three minutes later, when Stritter found sophomore midfielder Morgan Kontor for a wide–open touch into the goal, leaving the score at the half 4–0.
The game moved slowly through the second half, although the Tartans did appear to have a firm grip on their lead. They kept the ball on the Baldwin Wallace side of the field, maintaining pressure even though they there were no Tartan goals in the second half.
While the Tartans did not manage to score, they did manage to hold the Yellow Jackets to only one goal. This came in the 77th minute when Tartan keeper Sarah Mahler couldn’t keep her hands on a header delivered from Yellow Jacket Kelly Gough. With the exception of this late goal, the Tartans played sound defense, as junior midfielder Anna Vonderhaar kept the ball on the Yellow Jacket’s side to allow her team to play aggressively.
Ultimately, the Tartans showed that they deserve their undefeated record with a dominating performance. They will look to put their record to the test with real stakes in their conference games later in the season.
The Tartan women played again Friday night against the John Carroll Blue Streaks, and they displayed another dominating performance to continue their undefeated record. The Tartans emerged victorious with a 5–1 scoreline with goals from Haili Adams, Sienna Stritter, Nicole Winegardner, Louisa Pendergast, and Tessa Allen. They managed to outdo John Carroll in shots on goal by a margin of 21–3 showing just how dominant they can be. 
On Sunday the Tartans beat Capital University 3–2. Kontor tied the game in the 90th minute, and sophomore forward Grant Wilmer scored the winning goal in overtime.
The Tartans look to continue running the table as they move into October.

He may have broken the school record for rushing yards in a single game, but sophomore running back Sam Benger remains focused on the next game for the Tartans. The business administration major from Hingham, Mass who has received many personal accolades recently such as being named the Carnegie Mellon Student-Athlete of the Week and Corvias Eastern Conference Athletic Conference (ECAC) South Region Player of the Week. Despite all the hubbub, he is devoted to doing whatever he can to ensure the Tartans win as many games as possible this season.
Benger has always been about the team atmosphere in football.
“The camaraderie and team atmosphere, really prevalent in football, have always been something really important to me,” Benger said.
“I got started in football as soon as I could. My dad was always into football, and so was I.”
Though the team atmosphere that he loves has always been present, Benger acknowledges some differences in the way the game flows as his career progresses. “The level of commitment and competition changes as you get into varsity or into college.” Still, Benger has approached the sport in the spirit of fun and sportsmanship, working hard to win but always remembering to enjoy himself. “If you’re in the sport for anything besides fun or trying to win, you’re doing something wrong,” he said.
Benger has done well for himself and his teams. In his junior year of high school, his team made it into the playoffs and managed to do well. Senior year had a season of adversity: the starting quarterback, a close friend of Benger, sustained a leg injury early on. “We ended up finishing the year at .500, but we ended on a high note in the Thanksgiving game against our rival.”
As a member of the Tartans, Benger has become one of the most dynamic running backs in collegiate football. He currently leads Division III in all-purpose yards with 244.3 yards per game. Many outlets noted his 303 yard rushing performance against Washington and Jefferson, but Benger himself was quick to credit the offensive line for stellar run blocking.
“I need to take those guys out to dinner sometime,” he said. Despite the attention on him for his performance, Benger remains devoted to the team. “I don’t think personal accolades are that important. To have the respect and friendship of your teammates is more important to me.”
Outside of football, Benger has continued to keep up with the extensive Carnegie Mellon coursework. “Academics have always been very important to me. Our coach says it all the time: You come to CMU because you love the challenges and you love the environment that pushes you academically.” In addition, Benger is a member of Greek life.
“I’m joining a fraternity: Alpha Sigma Phi. Because it just started, there’s an opportunity to play a part in determining its direction.”
His involvement in sports has also helped him improve his time management skills: “Try to utilize any downtime in between classes. It can really be used to make progress as far as studying and homework go.”
For Benger, the future remains wide open. “I knew CMU was a great school, but I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I thought business would help open as many doors as possible.”
Rather than getting bogged down by uncertainty, Benger instead eagerly explores the large variety of avenues he can take.
“One thing I’m toying with is investment analysis and investment banking. There’s a lot of knowledgeable guys on the team that can help me out.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team came back to campus on Friday and Saturday to showcase its success in front of the home crowd at the Carnegie Mellon DoubleTree Invitational. The Tartans finished 3–1 in the round robin with wins against Stevenson, Pomona-Pitzer, and Mount Union. The lone loss—the Tartans’ second of the season—was to John Carroll in a competitive match Friday night.
Strong play and positive energy through the two days of double headers displayed the Tartans’ grit as they fought back from lost sets and cheered each other on, even when playing from behind. After the team fell behind 19–11 in their third set against Stevenson, junior captain and setter Emily Newton could be heard calling out “C’mon Tartans!” to rally her teammates.
Play at the line also proved to be a strong point for the home team, with junior middle blocker Jackie Gibbons and sophomore middle blocker Eliza Donahue making key blocks and kills. The tournament is one of only a few held at home, Newton noted, “It was really great to have [the] tournament at home because [the team] could have all our fans here and [they] could really show campus … who [they] are as a team."
Reflecting on the tournament play, Newton expressed pride in her teams’ effort. Twice, the Tartans came back from losing consecutive sets to dominate in the fifth set. She said, “We have our goals, and one of our goals is to always play to win, so we had to refocus on our goal and we decided that this is our game and we’re taking it from them. So it’s all our focus and energy.”
The team opened up play against Stevenson Friday evening with a strong showing, holding off a late Stevenson rally to win in five sets. The Tartans got ahead early, controlling the first two sets with wins of 25–12 and 25–20. However, Stevenson clawed their way back, leading the way throughout the third set, winning 25–19.
The Tartans came back swinging in the fourth set, with an unassisted kill by Gibbons and a kill by Donahue assisted by Newton leading to a 12–7 lead. The Stevenson women rallied and surprised the Tartans, sending the game to a third set, but the Carnegie Mellon women came prepared to finish. First-year outside hitter Lauren Mueller opened the set with a kill off a Newton assist, and the Tartan women pressed to a 9–1 lead. From there, the team comfortably closed out the 5th set with a 15–11 win.
In their only loss of the weekend, the Tartans fought to compete against John Carroll in a match coming immediately on the heels of their five-set battle with Stevenson. After splitting the first two sets, the women fell behind early in the third, with Newton getting shaken up three points in. The team fought back from a 1–6 hole to tie the game at 17. The Tartans battled back and forth with John Carroll in the 4th set. Up 23–22, Gibbons drove back the John Carroll defense with a strike, and Newton quickly set up the return for a key down the line strike by first-year outside hitter Sarah Jurgens. Although John Carroll prevailed in the last set, the Tartans put up a good showing coming into the match with little rest.
On Saturday, the Tartans began play against Pomona-Spitzer. Coming off a loss, the team rebounded well, taking the game in straight sets. After holding off a rally in the second set, the Tartans dominated the third, going up 8–1 and leading to the finish. They closed out the game in dominant fashion, with a kill smashed down the middle of the court by Gibbons off a Newton assist.
The final test for the team came from Mount Union, who the Tartans again took to five sets before claiming victory. The team came out strong early with kills by Gibbons and Mueller to take the lead, and continued with the momentum to win the first two sets. In a fierce battle, the Tartans struggled to establish a lead in the third set, with the teams tied at 25. This required an extended set to determine a winner. The team looked to have the win after a Jurgens kill gave them the lead 30–29, but Mount Union fought back and claimed the tie-break. After another tight loss in the second set, the Tartans came out firing in the fifth set again, reminiscent of Fridays fifth set dominance against Stevenson. Gibbons opened the set with a kill off a Newton assist, and the Tartans rallied to a 10–2 lead, capped off by a cross-court, arcing kill by Mueller, after a great save by junior libero Molly Higgins. Another Newton assisted Mueller kill got Carnegie the win.
The Tartans, now 18–2, will continue their season Saturday at the 1st UAA Round Robin at New York University.

As soon as the official theme song for this year’s WWE “Night of Champions” kicked off, I knew I was in for a wild ride. The show’s champions and challengers were introduced in a rapid-fire montage as a chorus of—you guessed it—CFO$’s “Night of Gold” blared in the background. On top of that were voice-overs, proclaiming that what I was about to watch was a “night of opportunity,” “promise,” and “change.” Such a melodramatic high bar would be hard to reach, or so I thought.
But the intro wasn’t lying on two crucial points. First, since this was my first time ever watching professional wrestling, I would in fact “see what a wrestler looks like” — in all his (and, in one case, her) exciting, theatrical glory. I would also “learn that respect is earned, not given,” because the totally absurd world of wrestling was about to earn my begrudging respect.
The premise of the “Night of Champions” was that everyone’s big, shiny championship belt was on the line. The greats had to defend their titles or go home dethroned and empty-handed. This was an alluring gimmick, though I’ll admit that I had no way of telling how “great” these contenders actually were. I’d heard of Sting, because he’s older than my father and looks like he belongs in an 80’s glam metal band. I’d heard of John Cena because he’s a meme. The others, well, most of them were large men in tights who were really good at tackling other large men in tights.
The first match in the lineup was for the Intercontinental Championship. Ryback was the incumbent, a large man in a leotard with the catch phrase (“Feed me more!”) who matched up exactly with every pro-wrestler stereotype ever. His opponent was rising star Kevin Owens, who looked more like some guy you’d see at the gym. Owens was, incidentally, one of the few men not in package-hugging outerwear. It was an interesting twist on the “every man” shtick to have Owens also play the arrogant, entitled jerk. Owens slammed Ryback in the shoulder early on, then pinpointed his attacks on that “injury” until he won the belt and got to be smug about it.
Next up was an episode in what I understood to be a long-standing feud between playboy Dolph Ziggler and Bulgarian romantic Rusev. Everyone knows wrestling is fake, but I’d never have guessed until this point how bad some of the acting would be. This fight was classic soap opera. Ziggler showed up with Rusev’s ex-girlfriend ironed onto his crotch. Rusev stormed in, ready to avenge his stolen love and armed with an anti-American rant for the audience to boo at. He was trailed by new girlfriend Summer Rae — for moral support, I guessed, until she ended up deciding the match. At a pivotal moment, Summer passionately (read: melodramatically) flung herself into the ring. After being kicked out, she tossed her high heeled shoe at the referee. It missed, hit her beloved Rusev, and Ziggler was able to pin him. As she sat, shoeless, on the sidelines, gaping like a red-lipsticked fish, I could only laugh.
The next match — the Tag Team Championship — was not as exciting, but just as bizarre. The Dudley Boyz were the codependent hunter cousins you never had and never wanted. The New Day reminded me of that one guy in Greenwich Village who really wants to give you his EP. They came complete with a hashtag (#SaveTheTables), namedropping (Bill Nye signed some petition of theirs?), and an actual trumpet; the latter was tooted in rhythm to blows landed on one of the “Boyz.” New Day retained their title by disqualification, though I’m unsure where that disqualification came from. All I know is that the Dudleys had the last word and threw one of the Days through a table. Apparently, that’s their thing.
I perked up a bit for the Divas Championship. The single women’s match of the night was for a pink butterfly belt that would’ve been perfect for Wrestler Barbie. It pinned Charlotte, a legacy to her wrestler daddy, Ric Flair, and his throne, against Nikki Bella, bad b-word about to break the record for longest-reigning Diva champion ever. I was naturally put off, and unsurprised, by the women’s loose hair, perfect makeup, and nearly identical crop-top/booty-short combos. The men did seem to have more choice in the tight clothes department. This match may have been my favorite of the night. These girls are undoubtedly real athletes, using all the same fancy moves as the dudes (though with a bit more gratuitous bodily contortion). Charlotte injured her knee at the start, and Nikki took such heavy advantage of this that I was actually buying that Charlotte was in pain. But Charlotte persevered, besting Nikki in a power flip that shocked even me. Charlotte’s proud father joined her in the ring, both in happy tears, and again I believed it. It was honestly a nice moment.
By now I was getting tired of the whole spectacle, so I won’t go much into the pre-finale fight between the Wyatt Family and Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Chris Jericho. I couldn’t tell you who was who, or what happened, just that several of them had pseudo-horror opening sequences with soundbites such as “It’s okay to be afraid — I am your destruction.”
Finally, it was time for the finale: wrestling’s latest big-shot Seth Rollins (relatively normal-sized, resembles Tarzan) forced to defend both of his titles. However, Rollins needed to be knocked down a few pegs. First, he and John Cena (think “state college football player with a heart of gold”) went head-to-head in a rematch for the United States Championship. They threw each other around and laid on the ground breathing heavily a lot. It went on for a while, but John Cena eventually won, which I felt was appropriate to his meme-ness.
Rollins was pretty beat up, and was generally having a bad night, so he tried to walk off with his remaining belt. But “Good Guy” John Cena intercepted. Enter Sting, the wrestling legend who really seems like he should be a member of Kiss. Stone-faced, Sting said not a word as he tossed rag-doll Rollins around the ring for so long that it started to get boring. But lo and behold, Rollins staged his comeback, throwing Sting full-force through the announcers’ table (possibly actually injuring him, I hear). Sting rallied, but Rollins was soon victorious. You go, Tarzan, I thought. Live your moment.
And then a punk leprechaun and some dude in a Hannibal mask stormed the ring with a golden briefcase and I got really lost.
The “Night of Champions” hasn’t converted me into a wrestling fan. Still, anyone who watches this carefully plotted, violent, ridiculous spectacle of a thing cannot deny that it’s art and sport. It’s also something else on its own. Something that I cannot, for the life of me, name.

To the uninformed observer (read: me), football is a lot to process. I didn’t understand the concept of a “down” until the third or fourth time someone explained it to me, let alone all the other terminology like grounding, holding, sack, false start, etc. But then I started watching [ITAL]The League[ITAL] and convinced myself that I have what it takes to start a fantasy football team with a group of strangers I found in an online public league. I didn’t really understand football as a sport in the first place, so this has been quite the learning experience. My entire draft strategy came from the internet.
I ended up with a pretty solid roster, mostly by chance. I prepared for draft day by picking out my top four or eight picks per position, which I chose either based on ranking or by who had the funniest name, which is how I got Nick Toon and two suspended players (LeGarrette Blount). I did, however, manage to avoid getting players with overlapping bye weeks, which was the happiest accident I could have made. I then established the order of positions to draft, prioritizing running backs and quarterbacks and leaving kickers and defense/special teams (D/ST) for the end. I planned to pick up four running backs, four wide receivers, two tight ends, two quarterbacks, two kickers, and two D/ST, because that’s what the internet told me to do. Then I learned that, per week, I can start two running backs, two wide receivers, one tight end, one quarterback, one kicker, one D/ST, and one “flex” who can be either a running back, wide receiver, or tight end.
Each week I would decide on who is to start and who is to sit out based off of projected scores because I’m an amateur, but so far it’s worked out alright. It took me until after week two to look into what those scores actually mean. Leagues have the option to customize these, but thankfully mine didn’t take too many liberties. For passing, one point is earned per 25 yards, four points per touchdown pass, two points per passing conversion, and negative two points for throwing an interception. For rushing and receiving, players get one point per ten yards, six points per touchdown pass, and two points per conversion.
The defense earns six points every time the opposing offense screws up and they return it for a touchdown, interceptions and fumble recoveries get two points, and then it gets tricky. The defense starts with 10 points, meaning they’ve allowed zero points. But allowing points in the game means losing points in fantasy, which can go down to negative five for more than 46 points allowed. My league also assigns points for rushing yards, which works the same way as points scored. Week one, when my D/ST was showing 10 points, I thought something wonderful had happened, but as assistant sports editor Ian Tanaya pointed out, that’s a default.
So far my team has been consistent, putting up 77 points in week one against Team Eatdagroceries, who only managed a mere 30 points against me. Then, in week two, my roster scored 76 points, but War Eagle just had a better team, scoring 105 points.
In week one I had to play two terrible running backs while Blount and Bell served suspensions, earning me zero and two points, respectively. Luckily my starting quarterback, Russell Wilson threw for 251 yards and put up 15 points, and wide receiver Nate Washington received a total of 105 yards amounting to 10 points. But my two stars were really the Jets D/ST and kicker Brian McManus. The Jets earned me 16 points, catching two interceptions, recovering four fumbles, and sacking the Bears’ quarterback three times. McManus made two field goals from over 50 yards, plus two other long-range field goals, and one extra point.
During week two, I got Blount back in the game which I thought would bring up my score, but he didn’t put up a single point, and neither did my other running back. The Jets D/ST and McManus helped me keep my head above the water with 13 and 18 points, respectively. Russell Wilson really came through for me though. My opponent started Carson Palmer who was expected to score big, but Wilson and Palmer each scored 21 points. Thanks to Wilson my deficit was better than it could have been.
This week I’m hoping that I’ve reached the end of my running back purgatory, and I’ll finally stop with the goose eggs. Bell is finally back, and my fingers are crossed that Blount will actually start scoring some points.
If Wilson and my other consistent players continue to play to their ability, and I start to get the hang of trades and the waiver wire, I feel like I could have a playoff caliber team.

Last Friday, the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) hosted a seminar by Carey Morewedge. From 2007 until 2013, Morewedge was an assistant and associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences as well as the Marketing group at the Tepper School of Business, and is now an associate professor of marketing at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. He spoke about the research that he has conducted, along with a team of researchers, on “debiasing” decisions. Their paper, which will be published in Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences on October 1, discusses the effectiveness of a single training intervention on reducing bias.
Morewedge began by explaining the importance of studying bias, which can be defined as the deviation from an objective standard. Morewedge noted that bias affects nearly every aspect of daily life, including fields such as business, policy, medicine, and law. The large presence of bias demonstrates the need for debiasing strategies.
The most challenging part of debiasing is that people often make biased decisions unintentionally. Humans often assume that everything they do is based on knowledge and experience, and can fail to pay attention to statistical and logical evidence. Prior attempts to use training to reduce decision biases have been largely unsuccessful, which pushed scientists and policy makers to focus on the use of incentives and choice architecture, which uses a well-designed series of choices to guide people to make less biased decisions. These approaches, however, are often ineffective and expensive, and can even backfire when used improperly. Instead of looking at these options, Morewedge and his team chose to look further into the possible benefits of debiasing training.
Morewedge’s experiments began with the development of bias testing methods. The team spent over a year tailoring their training video game, which was eventually used in testing. In the final study, each participant was initially given a bias pre-test, which determined the amount of bias present in their decisions before the training. Participants were then given proper training through the use of an educational game or video. After the training, they were given several post-tests to check their bias levels again. These tests were administered immediately after the training and again after an extended period of time.
The research team conducted several styles of intervention to test various types of bias. 
In the first experiment, the intervention training targeted three kinds of biases: bias blind spot, confirmation bias, and fundamental attribution error. Bias blind spot refers to people’s tendency to perceive themselves to be less biased than their peers. Confirmation bias occurs when people seek out information and evidence that supports their own beliefs, while neglecting information that contradicts their beliefs. Fundamental attribution error occurs when people explain a situation by relying heavily on personality, rather than facts. For example, you may attribute a student’s silence in class during the semester to his shy and introverted personality, when in reality, the person may simply find the course boring.
The second type of intervention training tested three other kinds of bias including anchoring, representativeness, and social projection. Anchoring looks at whether or not people are influenced by information that other people give. For example, if participants are asked to estimate the average time people spend on Facebook, and someone states that he uses Facebook 12 hours a week, people might be more likely to answer with a number close to 12. This experiment also looked at representativeness, which causes problems when people overestimate a single example’s ability to represent a whole. The final type of bias, social projection, estimates how people assume others’ emotions, thoughts, and values are similar to one’s own.
After analysis of the experiments, the researchers observed a large difference between the pre-test and the post-test. Both kinds of interventions showed debiasing immediately after training, with the bias of participants who played games decreasing 31.94 percent and the bias of participants who watched videos decreasing 18.60 percent. This debiasing effect also lasted over time. Two months later, the bias of those that had played games was still 23.57 percent lower than the pre-test, and the bias of those that had played games had gone down even more, to 19.20 percent. These results showed that training interventions appear to be an effective means to improve decision making ability over both the short-term and long-term.
Another interesting conclusion gained from these results was that training games appeared to outperform video training. These results suggest that active forms of training, such as games, appear to be more effective than passive forms of training, such as videos, because of the personalized feedback they provide. Still, both are effective.
Overall, the team’s results suggested that game and video training methods could be used effectively alongside other debiasing methods to achieve improved societal decision making. These results could impact a variety of fields, and in general, could improve the way we make decisions as a society.

TechBridgeWorld, a Carnegie Mellon research group, recently announced the creation of open-source software that assists educators of children with hearing and speaking disabilities create sign language video dictionaries and voice-activated games, titled Sign Book and Speak Up! respectively. The software was produced in collaboration with the Mathru Educational Trust for the Blind in Bangalore, India.
TechBridgeWorld is “spearheading the innovation and implementation of technological solutions relevant and accessible to developing communities,” according to the group’s website www.techbridgeworld.org. The website explains that by increasing the accessibility of technology in developing countries, they hope to “enhance not only the development process, but also the creativity and diversity of technological innovations accessible to all.”
Over the summer, TechBridgeWorld offered internships in their Innovative Student Technology ExPerience (iSTEP) program, which allowed students to participate in the development of the new software by conducting technology research abroad in Bangalore. The team of students included Erik Pintar, a fifth-year senior in human-computer interaction and electrical and computer engineering; Amal Nanavati, a sophomore computer science major; Maya Lassiter, a junior electrical and computer engineering major; and Minnar Xie, a fifth-year senior in humanities and arts and human-computer interaction.
The team helped launch the Sign Book project because teachers at Mathru’s School for the Deaf lacked proper sign language dictionaries in local languages. Although there are many references to teach American Sign Language, there are over 300 sign languages with unique grammar and signs, and Sign Book helps teachers create a video sign language dictionary with custom signs of the local language.
In a similar fashion, Speak Up! was developed to help educators teach hearing-impaired students, especially those who are unable to work with a speech therapist, to vocalize.
The team constructed a series of games to motivate students and give them feedback as to the type of sounds they were making. Games include causing birds to fly at different altitudes or fish to swim up and down depending on the pitch the student makes at a certain volume. There are ten games in total, and the package is designed for teachers to easily set up and adapt to their curriculum and local culture.
“Sign Book and Speak Up! were developed in such a way to empower teachers and enhance their teaching experience,” M. Bernardine Dias, associate research professor of robotics and TechBridgeWorld founder and director, said in a press release. “By providing teachers with the tools to create their own signs and come up with their own games, these solutions have the potential to be relevant for different communities and their unique needs. By releasing the software open source, our hope is that other educators will find our tools useful and that the open source community will build on the work we started.”
Both Sign Book and Speak Up! are available for download under the MIT Open Source license, keeping with TechBridgeWorld’s vision of a future in which technology is used to build bridges across communities instead of exacerbate divides.

This week at Pugwash, the science, ethics and society discussion club, we discussed the “food” Soylent, a drink that may drastically change how people consume food.
Soylent is a drink that claims to contain all the vitamins and nutrients one needs to survive. According to its creators, this beverage, soon to be solid block, can replace all of one’s meals, thereby significantly boosting the consumer’s efficiency by eliminating all unnecessary food preparation and spending. Furthermore, Soylent may be the ultimate vegan food since it can be produced without involving animals in any way. In a sense, Soylent’s dream is to replace farms with the potentially ethically superior and efficient factories.
Soylent certainly sounds good, but how does it taste? This was the question on Pugwash members’ tongues as we prepared to collectively try some Soylent at the meeting. After downing a small paper cup each, in addition to the usual pre-topic pizza, the conclusions regarding the taste ranged from the lukewarm response of “kinda like pancake batter” to the ominous “it tastes like prison food.”
While Pugwash does occasionally market itself as a free-food club, we try to incorporate discussions too. Our first topic was whether or not going full Soylent was a healthy choice. Major points of dispute included our ignorance about what constitutes a healthy meal. We know as a species that eating natural food works, but do we really know enough to fully engineer the food ourselves? There may be many nuances surrounding our natural meals that may be missed by eating cherry-picked chemicals. As one member pointed out, Soylent contains “everything that food contains except the food.”
In response to this, some members explained how switching to Soylent needn’t be an all-encompassing decision. Soylent can be a highly effective supplement if we use it to replace only our already artificial meals. The natural foods we already eat do not have to go. Furthermore, large swathes of society eat substances that we fully understand are destructive to the body, such as McDonald’s. Couldn’t a cheap substitute like Soylent act as a major boost to the health of these consumers? It is quite possible that, via mass production, Soylent could compete with even the cheapest meals.
Next, we explored the philosophical consequences of Soylent. What would it mean for society if we abandoned the feast? Do we want to live in the society where most people forgo solid food? Some members pointed out that food is a major part of many people’s identities and lives. One member explained how Europeans already believe Americans are processing the culture out of food by treating meals as fuel rather than as something that adds greater value to their lives. This member then pointed out that a European could potentially see Soylent as “processing the food out of food.”
Another ethical issue arose when we considered the possibility of parents raising their children on pure Soylent diets. Parents are free to raise their children vegan, so why not raise them on Soylent? On the other hand, raising one’s child on a new, unstudied substance is sure to raise concern.
Although everyone agreed that we should not force people to eat Soylent, the opinions on Soylent were far from unanimous. While some members championed the opportunity for a high-nutrient and vegan diet, others felt unease at our uncertainty regarding nutrition and the cold world of maximum progress that seemed far too present in Soylent’s bland, yet efficient, taste.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science, technology, and medicine on society. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on Soylent, a processed drink containing all the vitamins and nutrients humans need to survive.

You constantly see loudspeakers, commonly referred to as ‘speakers,’ at parties and concerts. They’re in every sports stadium, music studio, and movie theater. They are even found in every fire truck. They are an integral part of the world around us, but what exactly are they, and how do they work? Despite their multitude of drastically different usages, all loudspeakers are fundamentally the same: they use mechanical energy to propagate surrounding air molecules in waves that the ear detects as sound. Generally, this process is always the same, yet a single loudspeaker is capable of producing a plethora of different sounds at different frequencies and decibels. The ability of a speaker to produce all forms of sound, including tones that range from EDM to classical music, stems from its unique structure.
Speakers are composed of several distinct parts that work together to produce sound. To start, a loudspeaker contains at its center a voice coil, which is essentially just a coil of wire. Surrounding the voice coil is a ring-shaped magnet. When an electric current is transmitted through the speaker, such as when it is connected to an iPod, the current runs through the voice coil and induces a magnetic field around the coil. This magnetic field then interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, causing the coil to oscillate back and forth. Attached to this voice coil is a cone called the diaphragm, which oscillates in synchrony with the voice coil. The movement of the diaphragm is what propagates molecules in the air and produces the sound we hear. 
To make sure that the voice coil and diaphragm are properly aligned, a small ring of flexible material called a spider is placed between the diaphragm and the voice coil. The spider also works with the suspension, an outer ring of material that surrounds the diaphragm, to ensure the cone and coil are aligned properly. A dust cap is placed at the center of the diaphragm to protect the coil from the outside environment. In summary, speakers transmit sound when current flows through the coil, the coil oscillates with the diaphragm, and the diaphragm moves air molecules to create sound.
This process sounds relatively straightforward, but if all speakers work this way, why does a guitar sound different from a violin on a speaker? How is a loudspeaker able to clearly deliver a unique pitch that distinguishes one instrument from another, one artist’s voice from the next? The answer has to do with the nature of sound, and how sound waves are produced. When a sound wave is created, it contains two important features: a frequency and an amplitude. The frequency of a sound wave determines how high or low the pitch will register to our ears; the amplitude measures how loud the sound will be. 
Theoretically, a pitch with the same frequency and amplitude should sound the same, regardless of the instrument or device producing the sound. Because sound is a propagation of air molecules, however, frequencies and amplitudes are never perfect. Instead, they contain small unintentional hiccups and movements that give each sound its unique tone. This is why a piano and a violin sound different, even when playing the same exact note. Each instrument creates movement of air molecules in a unique way, which gives each instrument — and more generally, each and every sound — its defining quality. These distinct notes are then transmitted through speakers, which are able to distinguish between these slightly varied tones by mimicking the imperfect frequencies and amplitudes of the sound. 
As noted earlier, a speaker requires a connection to an electric current from an external source such as an iPod. The current from this external source is called an audio signal, which is simply a representation of sound in an electric current. Just as sound waves can have frequencies, so can electric currents, which is what allows the electric current to transmit the frequency of the sound wave to the coil. When the audio signal is transmitted through the coil, the coil oscillates with the frequencies that will produce the sound represented in the electric current. This is what allows the speaker to transmit sound.
Through this unique structure, loudspeakers are able to produce the sounds that we are surrounded by every day. So the next time you’re on the bus and you plug your earphones in, make sure you think about everything that has to happen in the earbud that allows you to hear your favorite band.

Kidney found in an Egyptian mummy for the first time
In Portugal, researchers including Carlos Prates, a radiologist at Imagens Médicas Integradas in Lisbon, Portugal, have discovered a kidney within an Egyptian mummy for the first time. Through X-ray analysis, the researchers noticed a bean-shaped structure at the left lumbar region, which is believed to be a putty kidney, or a kidney with a calcified outlining. The calcifications are thought to be a result of renal tuberculosis, which is a disease that calcifies tissues and causes the gradual emergence of fibrous lesions. If the diagnosis is accurate, the mummy could be the oldest recorded victim of the disease.
Named Irtieru, the male mummy is estimated to have existed for about 2,800 years. Researchers believe Irtieru may have had connections with an elite family, and that he died when he was between 35 and 45 years of age. The mummy has been kept at the National Archaeology Museum in Libson. The findings were published in The International Journal of Paleopathology.

Scammers claim to have Facebook dislike button
In early September, Facebook announced that it is working on a new button that will allow people to express their empathy when responding to a post. In response to this announcement, posts from scammers have emerged on users’ newsfeeds, with the claim that they can “get [the] newly introduced Facebook dislike button on your profile.” Through colors and logos, the posts were designed to look like they were branded by Facebook.
Researchers from Sophos, a software security company, have found that clicking on those posts led to two different scam sites, which then prompted users to disclose their personal information. In addition, interacting with these posts could lead to the download of malware onto users’ machines. The posts also require the user to share the link with their network of friends. Despite the prevalence of the term “dislike,” Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has made it clear that the company is avoiding the term in reference to their button.

Researchers store solar and wind energy in batteries
Scientists and engineers at Harvard University have found a way to store electrical energy from intermittent sources, including solar and wind energy, as rechargeable batteries. Known as flow batteries, these batteries utilize water-dissolved compounds, such as carbon and oxygen, which are nonflammable and abundant in nature. These compounds are used to pick up and release electrons during the battery’s operation. The research for the batteries was an expansion upon previous work, where the batteries had formally incorporated a toxic compound.
Another benefit of these batteries is that large amounts of energy for the batteries can be stored in liquids inside external tanks. Because of this, the flow batteries have been shown to be safer and more cost-effective option than other battery systems. Last Thursday, a paper about the new batteries was published in the journal Science. The researchers expect that in the near future, the flow batteries will become commercially available.

Study contributes to argument that viruses are alive
In a new update, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses has defined seven orders of virus based on the categories of shape, size, genetic structure and reproductive ability. Since the evolutionary relationships behind most of the viral families remain unclear, researchers in the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois and Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology decided to analyze the protein structures or “folds” that can be identified from the genome of all viruses and cells. 
The folds allowed the researchers to see the rapid changes in the genomes of the viruses, while maintaining the same three-dimensional shape of the protein. Through computational methods, the researchers discovered many common protein folds between cells and viruses, as well as folds that are unique to viruses. Not only do these data suggest that viruses originated and coexisted with ancestors of modern cells, but they also suggests that viruses gained the ability to infect other cells. Ultimately, the findings challenge the notion that viruses are nonliving.

Lawsuit claims that a macaque holds rights to selfie
Back in 2011, a macaque monkey named Naruto took a viral photo of himself after taking possession of an unattended camera. In San Francisco, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has recently filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court Northern District of California, claiming that Naruto holds rights to the photograph. The lawsuit is part of an effort to give nonhuman animals ownership of property, as well as rights beyond the basic necessities of life, with the belief that animals should be recognized for their capacity for personality and intelligence. 
Defendants in the case are David John Slater and his company Wildlife Personalities Ltd., who PETA says claim copyright over the image. Blurb Inc. is also named as a defendant since they published a collection of photographs including the selfie in question. According to a lawyer from PETA, U.S. Copyright laws state that the being who took the photograph, rather than the owner of the camera, has rights to the original work, regardless of the species of the author.

Top science book prize won by woman for the first time
For the first time in its 28-year existence, the Royal Society Winton prize for Science was awarded to a solo female writer. The Royal Society Winton prize for Science is Britain’s most prestigious science book award. Former recipients include prominent names such as Stephen Hawking, James Gleick, and Bill Bryson. This year’s recipient was Gaia Vince, an English journalist and broadcaster. She won the £25,000 prize during a ceremony in London last Thursday.
A former editor at the journal Nature, Vince has spent over two years journeying around the world, visiting places that have been severely impacted by humanity’s heavy usage of Earth’s resources. Her travels led to the publication of her book Adventures in the Anthropocene: A Journey to the Heart of the Planet We Made. Her work was praised for its exploration of an under-reported area of science, as well as for contributing to the field of popular science books, which are said to be essential in reaching out to the public.

Hey, Josh!
Long story short, I am not getting enough sleep. I’m tired. Like really tired. Like sleepwalking 24/7 tired. Like so tired that I pass out standing in line for lunch. It got pretty bad yesterday when I fell asleep standing in line at Resnik and crashed onto a short guy, and I may or may not have broken his arm in the process. It’s not my fault — I’m a sturdy lad. Anyway, it’s been a month since the semester started, and I still haven’t adjusted to the schedule. Over the summer, I would wake up at 6 a.m., go for a run, make myself breakfast and have a really leisure-filled day, but nowadays, my sleep schedule is all messed up. 
The worst part is that I don’t even feel like I’m being productive. I want to sleep, but I need to stay up and get things done. I want to stay up until 4 a.m. to have more time in the day. I’ve tried coffee and energy drinks, and I’ve even started sitting criss-cross applesauce so that my legs fall asleep. My legs are so well-rested, and the rest of my body is jealous. Help, please.
Blandly, 
Tipsy, Irate, Red-Eyed Dude
Dear TIRED,
Slow down. Take a breath. I think that you need to get your priorities in order; you need to sleep, but you want to stay up and get things done. I strongly believe in the health benefits of sleep. I engage in sleep several times a week, maybe even every night if I’m feeling frisky. If you’re finding that there are not enough hours in the day, you should plan your days better, drop some commitments that are sucking up your time, and work smarter, not harder. You should never put your health on the backburner— especially if doing so causes you to crush shorter men. That’s just not cool.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

On Sunday, September 20, Drake and Future released their highly anticipated mixtape entitled What A Time to Be Alive. The mixtape consists of 11 songs, nine performed by both Drake and Future together and two performed by each rapper individually.
Drake is both a rapper and a singer. Drake, the rapper, as presented in his songs “The Motto”, “All Me”, and “Started From the Bottom”, tends to be like any typical rapper that raps about money, women, and haters. Contrarily, Drake, the singer, as heard in his song “Hold On We’re Going Home,” “Marvin’s Room,” and “Shot for Me”, is the Drake everyone likes to make fun of for being “soft” and “in his feels” about his exes. If you’re expecting to hear Drake singing in this mixtape, don’t hold your breath. Maybe it is because he is sharing the mic with another rapper or trying to maintain a certain post-Meek Mill diss track image, the singing Drake hardly makes an appearance mixtape. Future also sticks to rapping as opposed to his raspy, and very throaty vocals.
The mixtape begins with “Digital Dash” which refers to an expensive car with a digital dashboard. This song sets the tone for the entire mixtape and lets all listeners know that Drake and Future are not here to play around. If you think Drake and Future have been everywhere you look this past year, you would be correct. Between the two of them, seven mixtapes have been released in the past year and this song shows listeners that they don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. Future begins the song with Drake only coming in for one verse at the end. This is definitely the song to blast when haters from high school are still trying to be relevant in your life, but you’re too busy preparing for the internship you’re going to score at the TOC.
Following this song is another very hype song that features a part of Drake the rapper that I like to call Screaming Drake. “Big Rings” is an anthem for anyone whose friend group has squad goals. Drake begins the song by rapping —screaming — about how he has a big team and they need some big rings and nice things. Both rappers also highlight how this is a great time to be alive if you’re a part of their crew. Drake begins the song very full of energy, but once the baton is handed off to Future, most of the energy is lost. Future’s raspy voice and slightly slurred words make it seem like he just woke up as opposed to Drake who sounds like he’s had a full night’s sleep and a Redbull.
Arguably one of the best songs on the mixtape is “Diamonds Dancing.” This refers to not only a rapper wearing a lot of chains, but also being surrounded by female dancers. Future sets the tone for the song with a message about living the celebrity lifestyle of reckless spending. This song probably has the most infectious hook ever with the line “Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing.” Drake comes in following the hook and seemingly did not get the memo that Future left as he launches into a verse about wanting to spend time with a girl he cares about. If you’re a big fan of singing Drake like I am, this is the closest you’ll get to him on this mixtape. Future again comes in with a verse about money and jewelry trying to remind Drake what this song is supposed to be about. Drake then spends the rest of the song singing about how hurt he is by one of his exes giving us a little glimpse that the old Drake is still in there somewhere. Even though Drake and Future showed up to record two completely different songs, the contrasting ideas still work together to make a pretty good song.
While singing Drake is still slightly present for “Changing Locations,” he seems to have remembered why he’s here and returns to singing about how he and his friends have money to spend. Future stays true to the message of the whole mixtape by rapping about money, drugs, and women. By this point in the mixtape it starts to sound like all of the songs are the same because they are mostly rapping about the same things over and over. However something about the chorus of “Changing Locations” still makes it enjoyable to listen to. Following this song is “Jumpman” in which they rap about speculated collaboration between them. This song also references the Air Jordan logo by saying that they are as recognizable as the “Jumpman.”
The mixtape ends with “Jersey” and “30 for 30 Freestyle,” solo tracks by Future and Drake respectively. If you can still stand Future’s voice long enough to listen to an entire song of his by this point, I applaud you. Future’s song is primarily focused on him promoting his crew and it isn’t the worst Future song, but I just wish it would’ve been sooner in the mixtape so I would’ve enjoyed listening to it instead of waiting for it to be over. Drake chooses to allude to several different events in his life recently throughout his song. It is almost like he uses this song to get out all the random Drake thoughts that didn’t fit anywhere else in the mixtape.
What A Time to Be Alive shows just how excited Drake and Future are to be on top of the game together. Whether they are the best rappers out right now is definitely up for debate, but it is undeniable that they have had a large presence in the hip-hop community since they came on the scene. Overall the mixtape does have some really good moments. Is this mixtape fire? Definitely not, but it is a nice sweater to keep you warm while you’re waiting for Views From the 6 or a J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar joint album.

If you like concerts, then you know that October is hands down the best month of the entire academic year. Artists’ fall tours are in full swing, and most major fall tours usually hit Pittsburgh sometime between late September and early November. Just about every week of this sweet and scary month is packed with a couple of great shows, from rock and indie to electronic and hip-hop. Here’s a few in the next two weeks that will surely provide some great experiences to remember with your college buddies when you’re old and gray and going to the bathroom more than once a night.
Yo La Tengo – Mr. Smalls Theater – Tuesday, 9/29/15
Hailing from Hoboken, New Jersey, this band celebrated its 30th anniversary last year and shows little sign of slowing down. Their fifteenth album, Stuff Like That There, was released in August and the band is currently on a world tour. Billed as “An Acoustic Evening,” it stretches into December. This is a great chance to catch an intimate performance at one of Pittsburgh’s most celebrated and iconic venues. Tickets are $22 and available through ticketweb.com.
TAUK – Rex Theater – Friday, 10/2/15
This four-piece prog-jam rock band delivers some funky tunes and tight musicianship. Fans of other jam or blues rock bands will definitely find a lot to get down to here. However, this is a 21+ show. Bummer. Sweet Earth is opening and tickets are $12 through showclix.com.
Flux Pavillion – Stage AE –Saturday, 10/3/15
For fans of heavy dubstep coupled with loud and bright performances, Flux Pavillion’s Tesla Tour stop at AE is going to be the highlight of your semester. This is a bit of a disappointment, considering October is usually packed with bass (Last October, Skrillex, Bassnectar, the Glitch Mob, just to name a few, hit the Burgh). Still, Flux is sure to be a high-energy show with more anthemic drops than you could shake a Rick and Morty themed totem at. Wilkinson and Diskord are opening, and tickets are $34.10 through ticketmaster.com.
Norma Jean – Rex Theater – Saturday, 10/3/15
Marilyn Monroe, live and in the (zombified) flesh, at the Rex! No, it’s actually the Atlanta-based metalcore band named after the actress’s birth name. They are currently touring behind the 10th anniversary of their sophomore album, O God, the Aftermath, playing the album in its entirety during each stop. Get ready for a moshpit spanning many generational gaps. Tickets are $18 through ticketfly.com.
Michal Menert – Club Café – Sunday, 10/4/15
Any fan of purple haze-tinged electro-soul acts such as Pretty Lights, GRiZ, and Gramatik will find a lot to love for Michal Menert. The soulful producer is known for his energetic performances that often contain some freestyle poetic rapping. He is currently touring with a six-piece live band. Marcelo Moxy and Wildabeast are opening, and tickets are $15 through ticketweb.com.
Built to Spill - Mr. Smalls Theatre - Sunday, 10/4/15
Built to Spill has been playing live for a long time, and the experience certainly shows. The lead singer and guitarist Doug Martsch takes turns between shredding some winding solos and delivering introspective lyrics in his distinctive vocal style. Great for anyone interested in Pabst Blue Ribbon and vinyl parties. Helvetia and Clarke and the Himselfs are opening, and tickets are $22 through ticketweb.com.
Beats Antique – Mr. Smalls Theatre – Tuesday, 10/6/15
If you’re a fan of crazy, out-there, trippy weird stuff, then California-based Beats Antique is the band for you. This electronic act creates sounds straight out of a middle-eastern gypsy dub and hip-hop nightmare. Member Zoe Jakes bellydances throughout much of the performance, abstract masks are worn, and blow-up kitty cyclops are unleashed, creating a distinct vibe that you’ll be hard-pressed to easily find at other shows. I’ve seen these guys once before, and I’m so excited another opportunity is on its way. Moon Hooch (another fantastic act you won’t want to miss) and Pinky D’Ambrosia are opening, and tickets are $22 through ticketweb.com.
Adventure Club – Altar Bar – Thursday, 10/8/15
The Montreal-based duo Adventure Club make some of the most melodic house-infused dubstep out there, and their live performances have begun to earn them top slots at summer festivals, so this show is definitely a Thirsty Thursday option to keep on the calendar. This is also a case where it’s just as worth going to see the opener as is it is the headliner. Snails, known for his incredibly unique brand of bass music dubbed “vomitstep,” has been exploding in popularity and will surely drop a couple of his high-profile collaborations with the likes of Diplo and Skrillex in a thrashing performance. KAYZO also opens, and tickets are $30 through ticketfly.com.

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust knows how to throw a good party, and their formula is simple: free food, free wine, and art with a purpose. In the Cultural District last Friday, artists and art-lovers communed over local and international creative works from the Cultural Trust’s Gallery Crawl and India in Focus showcase.
The Crawl was hosted by various galleries and nonprofits primarily residing on the parallel streets of Liberty and Penn Ave. Participants included bars and restaurants such as Olive or Twist, on Penn Ave, who displayed the work of Art Institute students in their second floor while serving drinks on the ground floor. Additionally, much of the Market Square businesses such as Gaby et Jules, the French bakery, remained open late into the night, serving specialties for hungry and thirsty “crawlers.”
The Crawl also served to kick off the India in Focus showcase, in which for six weeks, dozens of arts experiences paying homage to Indian traditions and culture will be displayed throughout the Cultural District. The kick off was held primarily at the outdoor stage where shows of music and dancing such as Bhangra were held continuously throughout the evening. Wood Street Gallery and SPACE gallery also participated in the kick off by opening new exhibits curated specifically for the showcase.
Wood Street Gallery served as a pseudo-entrance to the Crawl due to its prominent location on the Wood/6th St. triangular block. Perched above the Wood Street subway station were two floors of warmly lit, white-washed walls where the works of artists Nandini Valli Muthiah and Hetain Patel were displayed.
The second floor is home to the photographic series, “Eva,” as well as three standalone video works by artist Hetain Patel. The series is broken up into diptychs and triptychs, each of a different moment. Hetain’s wife is the subject of these photos. She is photographed from the back, showing only her head and torso. There is a drawing on her otherwise naked back in each of the moments. In one series, a man joins her in a silent conversation through the writings on both of their backs. Each moment is composed of two or three images which create a disjointed, schizophrenic feeling for the viewer and is particularly consistent with the stream of consciousness text displayed on the skin of the subject. The videos convey Hetain’s compulsion for exactitude as he reconstructs scenes from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and from footage of his father giving a tour of his factory.
Nandini Valli Muthiah’s photographic prints from her series “Definitive Incarnate” cover most of the third floor space. The work is supernatural in subject and cinematic in method. There is a certain canniness to her images ­— you may even feel as though you have seen the image before. But although the lighting, background and positioning of extras feels reminiscent of the way many modern films are shot, the subject is new. An Indian god named Krishna is presented plainly, at the focal point of the image, creating a new reality that is both familiar and unusual.
The contemporary gallery, SPACE, presented another exhibit called “PLUS ONE” as part of India in Focus, which included various mediums including installation, sound works, prints, and video. Separated only by temporary walls, the works of artists Shilpa Gupta, Sumakshi Singh, Surabhi Saraf, and Avinash Veeraraghavan manage to live in the space harmoniously. Each work contributes to the common theme of invoking the tradition of repetition and pattern-making in Indian visual culture. It is beautiful to see all the different ways in which this motif could be expressed. Saraf’s video of deconstructed dance and the rhythmic clapping of Gupta’s flap board piece “24:00:01” both served as interesting compliments to the music and dancing seen on the stage just several yards from the gallery doors. Saraf’s ”FOLD,” a large video installation, stitches together a mosaic of videos where a woman folds clothing, from shirts to saris, in a methodical and mesmerizing fashion. Singh’s projected stop-motion animation on silk with embroidery called “Light Threads” shows the birth of a pattern from nothing.
The Crawl had even more to offer than the experiential art exhibitions. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Arts Education Center presented a design exhibition where Young Architects and 2015 Design Competition entries displayed their visions for the future of architectural design in a lively and collaborative space. This location also invited guests to draw what design means to them amidst the inspiring and innovative work of the competitive entries.
Overall, the Cultural Trust’s Gallery Crawl was an upbeat scene where locals and visitors could commune over local and international artwork and experience the Cultural District at its very best.

As the Syrian Civil War rages on, Syrian refugees are looking anywhere to escape the violence. 
One Syrian refugee family fled from Aleppo to Iraq, where, without adequate humanitarian aid, they lacked access to education, work, and even food and shelter. The family of fourteen was forced to live in an abandoned construction lot beside a major highway.
Senior Advocate for the Middle East at the D.C. nonprofit Refugees International Daryl Grisgraber encounters refugee families similar to the one described. 
On Wednesday, Grisgraber met an eager 130 members of the Carnegie Mellon community at Baker Hall’s Steinberg Auditorium for her discussion “Refugees from the Syrian Crisis: Reflections on the Changing Needs and the International Response.” 
The event was hosted by the student organization Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth and Empowerment (FORGE), and the Center for International Relations and Politics (CIRP).
Senior decision science and public policy major, and co-president of FORGE Rosii Floreak explained the purpose of the event. “We really just wanted to get more awareness on campus,” Floreak said. “We wanted to give people the opportunity to learn more about the Syrian and Iraq crises.”
Since the Syrian Civil War began five years ago, 4 million people have fled the country, 7.5 million are internally displaced, and 12 million still inside Syria rely on humanitarian aid. 
According to Grisgraber, only 1 percent of the millions of refugees throughout the world are resettled by the United Nations (UN) each year. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees determines who is a refugee and who can be resettled, yet official refugee status is still no guarantee of safety. 
Usually, being approved for resettlement as a refugee requires a critical medical condition, an unaccompanied minor, or a case of torture. The process can be long — Grisgraber described cases where client refugees died while waiting to complete the resettlement process.
The enormous number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees has overwhelmed neighboring host countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. 
Syrians who fled their country several years ago, as well as those who are fleeing Syria now, are becoming increasingly desperate. 
In Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, many refugees cannot obtain work permits or enroll their children in school. As a result, more refugees are homeless. Grisgraber said that development assistance to host countries would help alleviate the burden on those countries’ infrastructures and resources. 
“For Syrians in particular, the desire to go home — and the fear that it won’t happen for a very long time — are at the front of everyone’s minds,” Grisgraber said in an email to The Tartan. There is also a distinct fear of not being safe even in a country of asylum, and many Syrians have expressed concern about the Syrian regime finding out where they are and targeting them even outside of Syria. 
As the crisis becomes more and more protracted, the ability to earn a living and provide for their own basic needs is clear: “Perhaps that particular fear could be called the fear of becoming dependent upon aid to survive” Grisbrager said via email Grisgraber added that internally displaced people inside Syria and Iraq can have an even more difficult time receiving primary aid. Refugees face insurmountable security issues that hinder humanitarian groups, which makes it impossible for them to enter Syria and parts of Iraq. 
International aid agencies’ funding is spread thin with several other recent conflicts, such as those in South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Myanmar. 
This strains the money and resources available for the Syrian refugees, and puts severe limits on methods to alleviate the crisis.
Grisgraber outlined the underlying problem of the refugee crisis: humanitarian aid does not develop with the ever-changing needs of refugees. 
Many refugees enter neighboring countries and receive some basic necessities, but sustainable, long-term aid is difficult to provide. 70 percent of Syrian refugee children do not attend school. 
When lack of basic resources is paired with the inability to find stable work, refugees find themselves considering returning to war-torn Syria with the hopes of finding better opportunities at home. Helping refugees become self-sufficient is an issue yet to be solved.
In the lecture, Grisgraber emphasized that the United States has the greatest ability of any country to provide aid, and therefore has an obligation to lead the effort of refugee support. 
Through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the United States recently announced that it will increase the amount of refugees accepted into the country to 100,000 people by the year 2017.
Still, more problems remain with resettlement. Grisgraber explained that the United States’ national security concerns often take precedence over the humanitarian responsibility to ease the crisis. Fear of extremism has resulted in many people being denied resettlement due to obscure relations to any sort of extremist activity. 
Grisgraber cited one account of a woman who was not allowed to resettle in the U.S. because she had “aided terrorists” after being forced at gunpoint to provide water to a Syrian rebel. “What happens in Syria and to Syrians affects all of us, albeit in different ways,” Grisgraber explained. “The relatively recent migrant crisis in Europe, and the EU’s ability to help people, is a perfect example of this. 
As Syria became old news and as the focus on providing aid drifted away, Syrians started moving again looking for help, and now we have an additional humanitarian situation to address.” 
Several Carnegie Mellon students weighed in on how to help address the crisis both in Pittsburgh and around the world.
Morgan Reed, a first-year studying civil engineering, took a hands-on approach. “I joined FORGE with sort of just the thought in mind of helping refugees after I heard that there were refugees in Pittsburgh,” Reed said. “Just doing little things, and getting involved in organizations that are trying to reach out in these situations.”
Floreak has volunteered with the same Nepali refugee family from Bhutan for three years as part of FORGE’s effort to pair students with refugee families to help them resettle in the Pittsburgh community.
“I think that FORGE is a really great way because you meet with resettled refugees on the weekends, you get to build a relationship with someone who’s really gone through something terrible, and you get to help them settle in the United States,” Floreak said.
“I think a really easy way is to be informed,” first-year international relations and politics major Philip DeCicco said. “The more aware you are, the more steps you can take toward changing those things.

U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Rahul Verma visited Carnegie Mellon University’s campus last Wednesday. 
The ambassador spoke about his personal connection to Pittsburgh and its Indian community, the growing relationship between America and India, and how India will grow and thrive in the future. It was, in essence — “Why India Matters.” The Indian population in America has been steadily increasing in recent years. 
There are more than three million Indian Americans in the U.S. alone, and, according to University President Subra Suresh, “This is the group with the highest family income in the US.”
The same increase in the Indian-American population reflected at Carnegie Mellon. Founded by Andrew Carnegie, a native of Scotland, Carnegie Mellon values the importance of diverse international contributions.
Verma traces his roots just up north; the ambassador was born in Edmonton, Canada. His father taught English at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in Indian Literature. 
Verma knows the Pittsburgh area well and calls himself a lifelong Steelers fan. When reflecting on his times in western Pennsylvania, Ambassador Verma described his family first arriving here broke in a station wagon, but still feeling welcomed with open arms. “I really do think there is something special about this area, and what immigrants in particular have done in this area,” Verma said.
Verma stressed that education is a vital part to the immigrant story. For many immigrants, education is their motivation behind leaving their homelands and undergoing the arduous task of starting over in a new country. Because of this, many immigrant children value education from an early age.
Ambassador Verma reflected on his time growing up with his parents and grandmother, who were teachers. He invited the audience to picture just how strongly the importance of education was imposed on him at a young age.
“You can imagine growing up in a house with two Indian teachers as your parents,” Verma said.
He then recounted a particular memory of him coming home in ninth grade with his report card. It reported five A’s and one A−. For the next three days he was plagued with questions of concern from his parents over the dreaded A−.
“ 'What could have happened? Was there a problem with the teacher? Did you not study?’ ” they asked.
“No matter where you come from, access to education can be the ladder that helps you climb from one social class to another and is the ultimate key to achieving the American dream,” Verma said, citing values already familiar to many Carnegie Mellon students.
Verma also talked about the importance of personal connections — it is not only what you know, but who you know. India and America have formed a close bond that has flourished for many years. Ambassador Verma talked about how the “shared values, the bonds between our [Indian and American] people, our cultures … the shared commitment to learning, innovation, and our democratic ideals” are what made the connection between the two countries a strong one with much potential and a sturdy grounding for sustainability. The strong bilateral relationship between Carnegie Mellon and India has had a noticeable impact on the university community. One such example of this is Carnegie Mellon University’s agreement with the Indian government. 
The agreement provides $2.4 million in fellowships so students from India can pursue more advanced studies in math, science, and engineering at Carnegie Mellon. 
Another example is the donation the university recently received from Tata Consultancy Services, which gave $35 million to build a state-of-the-art 40,000 square foot research facility. Relationships like these make a Carnegie Mellon education more accessible. India has seen its share of hardships; currently India has 300 million people without access to electricity, 650 million people that still live in villages, and 500 million people without flushable toilets. However, India has experienced rapid urbanization and shown many other signs of progress. 
Ambassador Verma discussed the growth that he expects India to have in the coming years; he expects India to have the most young people, the highest number of college graduates, and the most millionaires of any country in the world.

One question prevails throughout the hectic day of the average college student: “What should I eat?”
Once a year, Carnegie Mellon Dining Services attempts to answer this question.
Taste of the Tartans, an annual event that showcases the dining options at Carnegie Mellon, occured on Tuesday,  September 22. Vendors filled Rangos Ballroom in the University Center, prepared to offer students and staff a taste of what they’re all about.
Head of University Dining Services Pascal Petter described to The Tartan what the event means to him: “It’s truly an opportunity to give the community the chance to try our services, and for us to showcase the diversity of the dining program.”
Indeed, the event was diverse. The 35 vendors in 14 different buildings at Carnegie Mellon include every type of cuisine from Japanese to Mediterranean, with options for every possible dietary restriction. Petter stressed that the event is not just for students, but also for the larger community of faculty and staff, many of whom eat the majority of their meals on campus.
The university’s dining system is drastically different than that of other schools. Instead of the typical dining hall filled with soft-serve yogurt, pizza, and other tempting treats, the Carnegie Mellon system makes it easy for students to keep up a healthy lifestyle if they so choose.
In addition to the food attractions, Carnegie Mellon’s Peer Health Advocates made an appearance at the event. Representatives from the organization manned a trivia table where students could spin a wheel to answer questions about nutrition, learn important facts, and receive prizes.
The advocates, also Carnegie Mellon students, were there to emphasize maintaining a diet that supports the many activities in which students participate. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, for each meal, half of the plate should be fruits and vegetables, a quarter of the plate should be whole grains, and the final quarter should be sources of high protein.
Students and staff alike enjoyed the event. “I’m absolutely enjoying it and I do every year. I’m here [on-campus] all the time, and it can be difficult to get away from my regular routine and try something new,” Bonnie Lack said, who works in the Financial Aid Department.
Vendors offered samples of some of their most popular items from La Prima cappuccinos to The Pomegranate’s falafel sandwiches to El Gallo de Oro’s burrito bowls.
When asked about the event, Psychology Department research assistant Mary MacWhinney said, “I think that they’ve outdone themselves, it’s so generous. I particularly like the mashed potatoes and meatloaf.”
Chris Bovard from the Carnegie Mellon PNC office told The Tartan, “I wish this was everyday. Everything I’ve tried is great.” While students were eager to try the free samples, some expressed their concern with the dining system as a whole.
“I’m a sophomore and both times I’ve gone the samples have been better than the food we actually get for meals,” said sophomore biology major Sandra Ho.
The food offered at Taste of the Tartans was the best of what the vendors have to offer, which is not always available to students every day. However, not all students are disappointed in the eating accommodations on-campus. Sophomore chemical engineering major Sarah Winget noted that she “loves going to Resnik, because they have so many different options.”
“I just stumbled upon this event and there is so much food and variety, and it really showcases what we have on campus,” first-year undeclared Dietrich student Julia Adams said.
Regardless of the reality of the CMU dining system, Taste of the Tartans expressed the University’s interest in student welfare.

The word "bystander" is defined as a person who is standing near but not taking part in what is happening. Synonyms include onlooker, spectator, observer, etc.  
This is a word that I came across many times growing up. Every anti-bullying presentation that came to my school would tell us that if we saw someone being bullied, being a bystander was just as bad as being the bully. By simply observing and staying silent, a bystander is not only unhelpful to the victim, but also supportive of the bully. A bystander supports the victim’s suffering by not speaking up against it. 
Therefore, it is shocking to hear that the United States military is turning a blind eye towards the rampant sexual abuse of young boys in Afghanistan. Despite accounts of Afghan men lying on the floors of military bases with children between them, and the knowledge that sexual abuse of young boys is common practice among powerful local leaders, American military leaders have decided not to intervene. They have preferred to stay on good terms with the Afghan police and militia and focus their combined efforts towards fighting the Taliban. In other words, they have chosen to allow children to suffer in the name of “good political relations.”
The United States military claims that it is trying to help Afghan citizens fight the Taliban in the name of establishing freedoms for said citizens. However, acting as bystanders to obvious violations of human rights — which America claims to champion — is counterproductive, hypocritical, and immoral. 
Many local Afghan military commanders take part in a traditional practice known as “bacha bazi,” translated into English as “boy play,” according to PBS. Young teenage boys, usually from poor backgrounds, are bought from their families to be trained to dance and sing for private parties of wealthy Afghan men. But the practice can go far beyond this; the boys are often emotionally, physically, and sexually abused. Many local Afghan commanders even own a boy of their own as a symbol of power. If the boys try to escape, they are tracked down and killed.
Granted, the United States has been put in a tricky situation. In order to keep the Taliban from rising to power in Afghanistan again, the military must work with the local governments and militias. Stepping in to take a direct stand against bacha bazi could alienate those commanders who see the practice as a display of their power. 
In order to appease both sides, Pentagon spokesman and Navy Captain Jeff Davis has said that the United States military finds the practice “abhorrent,” according to Reuters. He claimed that “a military member could make reports of human rights violations to their chain of command,” where the report would eventually end up in the Afghan government. Since the offending commanders fall under local Afghan jurisdiction, the thought is that by sending reports of human rights violations to local governments, the American military is taking care of the issue while washing their hands of any actual responsibility.
Officially, bacha bazi is outlawed. In fact, the Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan in the 90's was fueled in part by outrage over bacha bazi. Under Taliban rule, men suspected of partaking in the practice were executed. After the Taliban fell from power in 2001, bacha bazi remained banned. 
Despite the law, however, it is practiced regularly as a widely recognized societal taboo. Many of the local Afghan prosecutors, who have said that there will be consequences for those who partake in bacha bazi, have been seen attending bacha bazi parties as guests. 
Accordingly, it is unreasonable to assume that reporting the violations to the Afghan government will do anything to protect these boys. Unfortunately, this abuse is part of Afghan culture, and without outside pressure, those in power will not give up this practice. 
It is up to the United States military, then, to take a stand on behalf of those who are unable to do so. Continuing to do nothing, to merely report and observe as innocent children are abused, makes them as guilty as those who see these young lives as objects and property. If the United States is truly trying to enable Afghani citizens to establish a government more humane and stable than the Taliban, then the American military cannot enable human rights violations as serious as those committed by the Taliban. 
The United States needs to commit to enforcing laws against bacha bazi. It needs to put pressure on local Afghani governments, make sure that those who partake in bacha bazi face consequences, and appropriately punish those commanders with whom the United States is allied. In doing so, they will be creating a safer Afghanistan for children who have no say in the way that their country — or their lives — is run.
It is time for the United States military to stop being a bystander. It is time to stop enabling obvious violations of what are supposed to be universal human rights.

There seems to be less space for religion in modern life. It is hard for a culture that keeps growing and developing to succumb to the rigidness that is often associated with religion. 
Christianity, for example, teaches certain principles that may have been the status quo when the Bible was composed, but in this politically correct era we exist in, there is little room for those teachings in everyday life. Topics such as abortion and same­-sex marriage have been taboo and highly frowned upon by many Christians, but Pope Francis is doing what he can to change the way they perceive these topics, as well as the way the secular world perceives Christianity.
Overall, Pope Francis has been using his tenure to promote peace between various cultures and beliefs and to work for the welfare of those in need. For instance, he has discussed how the egocentric behavior of international leaders has placed the world in a state of sluggishness and disarray. 
He also has opened his arms to the LGBTQIA community and welcomed them to embrace Christianity as who they are, rather than changing their beliefs to accommodate Christianity. Pope Francis has even stated that you do not have to believe in God to get into heaven. This is a highly controversial claim in the sense that it opens up to the possibility that non-Christians can be considered moral people.
Pope Francis' teachings have really resonated with millennials, such as myself, who feel as if their liberal social beliefs bar them from the possibility of being a Christian or otherwise exploring their faith. With religion slowly becoming more flexible, it allows our generation the possibility of religious growth and the chance for a more balanced life. People can also strive for successful careers in science while maintaining their belief in a greater purpose.
In a weird way, it feels as if religion itself, especially Christianity, is becoming more secular. Recent statements by religious leaders, such as Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama, have led me to consider that religion is moving into a more secular era. This progression is necessary, because if religion were to remain stagnant, it might be left completely behind.
Pope Francis has done much in his time in the Vatican to improve the general public image of Christianity and bring it into the modern age. Whether you believe that this is a good or a bad thing, I feel that this is the best time to be alive and am really excited to see where our society can move from here.

Assimilation has been a critical concept since the beginning of our history because the United States is a country of immigrants. 
One result of this is that there are a vast number of households that speak a language apart from English. Bilingual families will typically speak their native language at home and English outside of their home, since English is the most widely used language in the United States. 
However, regular exposure to other languages remains the norm in America. At Carnegie Mellon, students are exposed to many languages through diverse groups of friends and classmates. For most students, it has hardly been a concern that non-native English speakers are seeking to impose their languages on American society. 
In many areas, however, many people do actually believe this and other negative things about that the newest generation of immigrants. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report last week that it claimed “should allay fears that recent immigrants committed crimes more frequently than Americans, that they were generally in poor health and [a] burden [on the] public health care system, or that they were failing to learn English.”
The report contributes to topical debates around immigration in part by saying that, contrary to the disconcertingly popular belief, immigrants' desire to learn English is very high. It assures that Americans do not need to worry about immigrants trying to impose their languages upon our English-based society. It also claims that each new generation of immigrants has been progressively more likely to pursue higher education. 
This is all great news, but assimilation is often forced upon immigrant families. A majority of immigrants come to the United States for better opportunities, especially for their families. Knowing this, generational progress is inevitable and should be further encouraged by the American government and its native citizens. 
While the Obama administration was trying to pass an immigration reform bill last year, we heard countless stories of immigrant families struggling and fearing separation by deportation. But it has been proven that immigrants work hard and encourage younger generations to do the same.  
This report had good intentions, but it's problematic in the fact that it more or less exclusively addresses the xenophobic concerns that immigrants will impose their languages on society or otherwise become a burden. It demonstrates the common misconceptions around immigrants, rather than working toward changing those perceptions.

It has been almost a week since Nepal passed its first federal constitution, and tensions continue to escalate. As of Friday morning, 45 people — half of them police officers — have died in anti-constitution protests. Nepal’s southern neighbor India looms large over the conflict. While the crisis itself is worth of attention, it also points to bigger questions about the role of regional leaders. 
The new constitution, which was enacted on Sept. 20, has been in the works for seven years. Nepal has been functioning under an interim constitution since its monarchy was abolished in 2007. In less than a decade, Nepal has gone from being a theocratic Hindu Kingdom to a secular federal republic. These rapid changes have inflamed ethnic tensions.
Nepal is made up of several ethnic groups, and these minority groups experienced years of marginalization under the former monarchy. The two largest of these groups, the Madhesis and the Tharus, comprise 40 percent of Nepal’s population, and they live mostly in the southern plains region along the Indian border. In the last week, the south has erupted with protests against what many Madhesis view as their underrepresentation under the new constitution. 
Most recently, Madhesis protestors have barricaded the two main borders between India and Nepal, shutting down vital imports and applying pressure to the government in Kathmandu. The new constitution divides the country into seven provinces and distributes representatives based on both geography and population. 
Each of the 75 districts in the nation will receive a seat on the Legislative-Parliament, while the rest of the regionally elected seats will be distributed based on population. This is helpful for the rural, mountainous regions of Nepal, where population is sparse, but it also leads to an under-representation of the south, which is much more densely populated. 
India, as the regional leader of Southeast Asia, has had much to say about the week’s unrest in Nepal. After the constitution was ratified by the Constitutional Assembly, Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar rushed to Nepal to request a delay in its implementation. When that failed, the Indian government in New Delhi recommended seven amendments to the Nepalese constitution. These amendments sided heavily with the southern protesters and pushed for more population-based representation. 
India certainly has a vested interest in keeping Nepal stable. The two countries share an open border, and instability in Nepal would increase smuggling and terrorist traffic across it. Also, the Indian government fears that violence in Nepal’s south will spill over into the already unstable Indian state of Bihar. 
While these concerns are legitimate, India is overstepping its bounds. A constitution is meant to reflect the voice of a nation’s people, not that of its allies or neighbors. While support and advice during the writing process can be constructive, proposing amendments and trying to delay a constitution that was ratified by a democratically elected Constitutional Assembly is patronizing. Nepal is a sovereign nation, and its government deserves to be respected. 
The violence in Nepal is certainly troubling, and the 45 deaths are a tragic loss. However, when viewing this crisis, it is important to remember that state-building is rarely a peaceful or linear process. 
Although everyone wishes there was a peaceful path to representational democracy, we have yet to find one. By aggressively enforcing its will, India is stifling Nepal’s progress towards democracy and turning it into a puppet state. 
Rajeshwar Acharya, Nepal’s former ambassador to China, summed it up best when he said: "Domestic issues of any country are corrected by the political actors and authorities of the same country and there is no need for any other country to issue instructions. It doesn't mean that Nepal can't work independently just because it is a small nation. All of our friendly nations are requested not to interfere into our domestic affairs," according to Republica. 
The entire political system of democracy rests on faith. A nation’s people need to have faith that their vote matters. When more powerful nations step in, they undermine that trust — no matter how good their intentions.

We’ve had a busy week here at Carnegie Mellon. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan visited last Friday, the Indian Ambassador to the United States Arun Singh arrived on Saturday, and his counterpart, the United States Ambassador to India Richard Verma, showed up on Wednesday. All of their talks had one thing in common: none mentioned the real problems of the issues they brought up.
This is a huge problem in policy, where high-level policy makers seem to be having different conversations than the grassroots activists and the people on the ground. At Carnegie Mellon, this culminated in a week of policy makers talking about absolutely none of the problems we actually have, and waxing poetic about the solutions they’ve found to problems we don’t have.
Duncan was on a panel along with other education professionals in Pittsburgh, including Carnegie Mellon faculty and the superintendent of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. One thing they kept coming back to in their discussions was education technology, or "ed-tech" — the idea of creating apps and programs to help students or teachers. 
Though ed-tech obviously has much potential, people are so busy building these apps that no one is testing whether they are actually doing what they’re supposed to be doing: helping students learn. But Duncan and the other panelists kept talking about how wonderful it was that Carnegie Mellon was partnering with different organizations in order to continue producing ed-tech, instead of actually researching how ed-tech should be used most effectively.
A similar thing happened with both of the ambassadors that visited this week. University President Subra Suresh started off his opening remarks for the Indian Ambassador with flowery language about how wonderful Carnegie Mellon is and how many doors we could open for Indian-Americans and Indian-born students. Suresh made this speech on the same day that the The New York Times released its "Top colleges doing the most for low-income students" list. We were ranked 154th, which we should frankly be ashamed of. 
I asked both ambassadors about an issue that I’ve discussed in the Tartan before: the worrying rise of Islamophobia and Hindu supremacy in India, specifically after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appointment to office. Both ambassadors waved me off and gave me very well-thought-out non-answers, which, to be fair, I expected.
What I didn’t expect was the outright arrogant nature of Indian Ambassador Arun Singh. He prefaced his answer by saying that normally, he prefers to speak only about India-U.S. relations, despite having just answered a question about centralization of government in India. Singh proceeded to tell me about India’s relationship with various religions, mentioning Islam exactly zero times. 
Meanwhile, the United States Ambassador Richard Verma simply told me that if I looked at Modi’s speeches, I would see that he was actually an asset to combating Islamophobia in India. Neither of the ambassadors even touched on the issue that’s been dividing the country recently: the massive protests against the use of quotas for lower-caste people applying to educational institutions and government jobs.
I think this erasure of the real issues is especially hard to combat at a place like Carnegie Mellon, where most of the student body is highly apolitical. If the Secretary of Education tells students about how great ed-tech is, they’ll believe him. If the ambassador to India and his counterpart say that Modi is combating Islamophobia, students will believe them. 
I urge anyone curious about these problems to do their own research, form their own opinions, and come up with their own solutions. Because, sometimes, politicians and policy makers simply don’t know or talk about the actual issues.

Republican presidential candidate and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson announced last Sunday that he does not believe a Muslim should be President. He announced that he "would absolutely not agree with that."
This comes on the coattails of other anti-Islam and anti-Muslim sentiments by Donald Trump, and it is partly responsible for inciting and continuing — with renewed fervor — the national conversation about racism, church and state, and foreign policy in the Middle East. 
In August, Carson was asked whether the Bible or the Constitution had a greater place in government. He responded that it was "not a simple question" and that it depended on which section of the Bible or of the Constitution. Both comments — regarding biblical versus constitutional importance and Muslim presidential candidates — caused Carson's polling numbers to soar. 
As he seeks the highest office in the country, it is important to be aware of the way Carson views religion and public life. Carson has simultaneously disavowed a Muslim individual's ability to serve a democratic nation, and diminished the value of the Constitution as supreme ruling doctrine of the United States. He is quickly altering the way a president should influence and serve the people. 
Over the course of American history, many have come to this country for the freedom it offers: freedom of the press, free speech, and most pertinently, freedom of religion. Restricting who can serve America, and arguing that a certain religious text has more value — or even the same value — as texts protecting and nurturing citizens' freedom, is contrary to the foundational principles of the nation.
Carson has introduced a radical and irrational transformation of government, and his questioning of Muslims' rights and abilities to run a just society exemplifies the Islamophobia that runs rampant in this country. Citizens must acknowledge and call out politicians who make a point of dismantling the freedom and unity that the country represents. The fact that Carson's remarks have had an unfortunately positive impact on his campaign should not be taken lightly. Citizens should take it upon themselves to prevent ignorance and hatred from holding such a prominent place in public life.

Early last Sunday morning, wind turbines in Texas were producing so much energy with such little demand that electricity prices became negative for several hours, reaching negative $8.52 per megawatt hour. There are a few factors that make Texas's energy infrastructure unique, but we still need to acknowledge this event as further proof of the effectiveness of renewable energy sources.
This is not the first instance of electricity prices going negative, either; nuclear, solar, and hydroelectric power have been known to do so as well. While this presents a problem for the energy companies who may pay buyers to take electricity, it shows us that — with further research into storage techniques and restructuring of power grid — these renewable resources could be our future.
With renewable sources that work, we must seriously begin to reduce our dependency on energy sources that are finite and damaging to the environment, such as natural gas, coal, and oil. Not only does the process of mining these resources harm the local environment, their use is harmful to the atmosphere by creating greenhouse gases and pollutants that infect the air we breathe. Despite massive drawbacks, these "unclean" energy sources still receive massive governmental subsidies annually.
Renewable energy sources do not come with the same warning labels. Once a wind turbine is installed, it has extremely low operational costs and does not pollute the environment around it. The only pollution and price tag associated with hydroelectric dams is in the initial construction, after which they require little maintenance and are very flexible sources of energy. Though nuclear energy is not technically renewable, the world has enough uranium to last 80 years. Solar energy is equally promising. 
Proper funding into the research and implementation of renewable energy sources could overcome the current barrier of a high entry price and consequently sustain our future and our planet. Texas has disproved conservative arguments that renewables will blow up energy prices. Renewable energy does not create nearly the same environmental impact as fossil fuels do, and it undoubtedly works.

The Senate rejected a move by congressional Republicans to defund reproductive, maternal, and child healthcare non-profit Planned Parenthood on Thursday Sept. 24. The move comes on the heels of a series of videos that seemed to show Planned Parenthood employees talking about selling organs of aborted fetuses for profit.
By now we have all heard the arguments for and against Planned Parenthood. Pro-life activists have claimed that Planned Parenthood was acting illegally in selling organs. Pro-choice activists responded that the videos were heavily edited, that no federal funding goes to Planned Parenthood's abortion services, and that pro-life advocates are simply trying to defund women’s healthcare.
Some Planned Parenthood opponents have stated that government money should be funneled into other women’s health organizations that do not sell stem cells or perform abortions. But since federal funding does not actually go toward Planned Parenthood’s abortion services, the organization would continue to provide abortions with little change in service. However, the availability of other healthcare services — such as birth control, STD testing, and cancer screenings — would change drastically due to the funding cuts.
These changes are where the problem with defunding Planned Parenthood arises. The organization is designed to provide accessible reproductive healthcare. Pulling government funding would force Planned Parenthood either to charge more for their services or to accept fewer clients. Decreasing the available services means that not everyone who needs care would have access. Increasing the price is another barrier to access that restricts who can receive health care. 2.7 million women, adolescents, and men visited Planned Parenthood's over 700 centers across the country last year. Many of these visitors were low-income. The slogan of Planned Parenthood is “Care. No matter what.” Increased prices mean care unless you can’t afford it.
Another key facet of accessibility is public knowledge. Everyone knows what Planned Parenthood is. Switching funding to “other family planning organizations” strips the public of that knowledge and makes researching affordable health care even more difficult. This excludes women who may need care but aren't aware of the specifics of government funding. They would then be forced to sort through more expensive and inconvenient options.
Defunding Planned Parenthood would strip access to vital reproductive healthcare from millions of women in America. No matter how hard “compassionate” conservatives try to please the base and provide "solutions," such as funding other organizations, they are still joining a fight against women’s access to health care.
