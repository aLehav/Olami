The NHL’s All-Star Weekend is a fun little break in the regular hockey season where each team’s best and brightest players get together to team up and fight for their division. The weekend includes a Skills Competition with many fun battles, but the main event is a three-game single elimination showdown to find out if the Metropolitan, Atlantic, Pacific, or Central division is truly superior. This year’s All-Star Weekend was extra special for the fans, because we got to help decide a large portion of the lineups. While the first eight players were picked by the league, hockey enthusiasts were able to vote for the last three players (two skaters and a goalie) for each division’s team, whereas only one player was determined via voting in previous years. 
All afternoon Friday, hockey fans gathered in southern Florida to see the many events of the highly beloved Skills Competition. While the competition includes events you might expect, such as Hardest Shot and Fastest Skater, there are also some more wild events thrown in, such as the Tendy Tandem and the Pitch and Puck. Andrei Svechnikov of the Carolina Hurricanes pulled ahead of the pack as Fastest Skater, Brock Nelson of the New York Islanders blew his opponents away with the best Accuracy Shooting, and Elias Pettersson of the Vancouver Canucks took home the coveted title of Hardest Shot. Nick Suzuki of the Montreal Canadiens finished a shot ahead of the rest of the pack in Pitch ‘n’ Puck, a “Happy Gilmore” inspired golf-hockey hybrid challenge. Mikko Rantanen and Cale Makar, both of the Colorado Avalanche, dunked on the competition in Splash Shot, in which players had to race to knock down four targets, plus one final target to dunk their opponent’s partner. Juuse Saros of the Nashville Predators and Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets came out on top of all other skater-goalie combos in the Tendy Tandem, in which teams consisting of the two goalies from each division, one skating and one goaltending, faced off in a half-shootout, half-breakaway style competition. In the end, I think the most memorable (and certainly most adorable) moment of the Skills Competition was the Breakaway Challenge. Although Rasmus Dahlin put up a good effort with a stylish behind-the-back shot, he simply couldn’t compete with the winning participants. In an unexpected team-up, rivals Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin, captains of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals respectively, teamed up with special guest star Sergei Ovechkin, Alex’s son. In an irresistibly cute moment, Ovechkin and Crosby both assisted Ovi Jr. in scoring on celebrity guest goalie Roberto Luongo. This absolute power play, along with Ovi Jr.’s iconic celly, earned a perfect 40 from the judges, and won them the Breakaway Challenge. 
The main event of the 2023 All-Star Weekend came on Saturday, when the four teams finally faced off against each other in FLA Live Arena, home of the Florida Panthers. To determine the true top division, the teams participated in three total games over the course of one evening. Each game was played 3-on-3, with two ten-minute periods.  The semifinals saw the Atlantic go up against the Metropolitan team, with the Pacific facing the Coastal. Although the Metropolitan team put up a good fight, they were down 3-4 at the half and couldn’t come back, especially against double hat tricks for the Atlantic from Johnny Gaudreau and Matt Tkachuk, which contributed to the final score of 6-10. This advanced the Atlantic team to the finals. In the Pacific-Central match, the teams traded goals throughout the first half, with Central heading into the second half one point ahead of the Pacific. The Central team took that lead and ran with it to end the game with a win at 4-6. The final 20-minute showdown between the Atlantic and Central teams started off with the Atlantic team pulling ahead right out of the gate with a goal in the 37th second of play, and continuing to grow their lead to end the half at 3-0. Although the Central team was able to score four times in the second half, the Atlantic team scored three more times (with Dylan Larkin completing a hat trick). In the end, the Atlantic division won the whole shebang 7-3, and Matt Tkachuck’s four goals and three assists earned him the title of MVP.
As a native Floridian, I can’t help but be a little bitter that All-Star Weekend happened in Florida while I wasn’t there. However, I was still able to appreciate a lot of exceptional players having a great time in the beautiful Florida weather, as well as bonding with some new teammates in a much less serious environment than the one we expect throughout the regular season. Tune in around the same time next year to see the 2024 All-Star Weekend, set to take place in Toronto, home of the Maple Leafs.

College basketball student groups can be the most entertaining part of the sport. And the Illinois Orange Krush are no exception, painted from head to toe in orange. It’s less like watching a crowd of students and more like a giant mass of writhing carrots. They cheer, they scream, they make themselves heard.
And they made themselves very well heard this week, when they were notified that the University of Iowa had canceled their tickets to the Illinois-Iowa game. This was a huge financial hit to the organization, with massive cancellation fees for the buses. It was crippling to the Orange Krush’s yearly budget, and represented nearly 20 percent of their overall budget. It was a nightmare scenario for the Illinois superfans, and they made their displeasure heard. Sure, the Krush were fanatics, but that was the nature of the sport. If you can’t paint yourself bright orange and scream yourself hoarse watching people play basketball, what’s the point in living anymore? What Iowa had done was kneecap one of their rival’s traveling fanbases, out of what most people assumed was fear. They seemed afraid of the fandoms they played, and were willing to lose money to keep them away. And the Orange Krush wasn’t okay with that.  
So they took to Twitter, putting Iowa athletics on blast, trying to get some attention and maybe get that decision reversed. The Orange Krush wanted justice, and they wanted to get the mob riled up.
If this was any other column, you’d hear about how the Orange Krush got justice. They got their money back, or they got to watch the game. They brought their energy to the game and screamed Illinois to a victory. But this is Foul Play, and this story had a little something kept out of view.
See, when the Krush published that statement, they got a crowd riled up. And for almost thirty minutes, people were on the Orange Krush’s side.
All that attention meant Iowa had to respond, and they knew something the Krush hadn’t published in their statement. The orange menace attempted to purchase those 200 tickets for their members under the name of the Boys and Girls Club of Illinois. Now, to be fair, while the Krush is a club that arguably does have both boys and girls, it’s not really a charity aimed at giving underprivileged kids opportunities. So Iowa did some investigating, and they discovered that it wasn’t actually a charity ordering those tickets so those tickets were promptly canceled.
Of course, the Krush could have just let this go, and they wouldn’t have dealt with the fallout of this new situation. But in that statement they’d been ferocious, calling the athletic director cowardly, and the school as a whole afraid. Iowa didn’t take this well, and that cowardly athletic department released a statement pointing out that pretending to be a charity is incredibly stupid. A few hours later, Iowa announced that they’d donate the tickets to a real Boys and Girls club, one that specialized less in body paint and more in real public service. The Krush tried to break the system, and they got hit with the bill. Topping it all off, Illinois lost to Iowa in that game, watched by a bunch of Iowa kids who were excited to be there.

Gangly. Weak. Too slow. Unanimous Super Bowl MVP. The greatest of all time. It’s the story of one Tom Brady, a man who retired, for the second time, this past week. In all honesty, he requires no introduction. He’s one of the most recognizable and iconic athletes in the US. Even if you don’t know football, you know Tom Brady. And yet, he began his career overlooked and forgotten. For the greatest player in football, Brady might have been the most undervalued.
But to talk about all that, we have to start at the beginning. Tom Brady was recruited by the University of Michigan in 1995 and didn’t see significant playing until his fourth and fifth years, spending most of his first three buried in the depth chart. His big seasons in 1998 and 1999 left him with a 20-5 record and two big wins in the Citrus and Orange bowls. He was, by all accounts, an excellent quarterback.
Except, he wasn’t. Not by the so-called "measurables," a physical examination given by the NFL prior to draft day. Brady, on all reports, was considered a late or ignored draft pick: too slow to make good passes, and too scrawny to take hits. He’d get shredded by the big defenders of the NFL, and few teams considered him to be a good pick.
And on draft day, Tom Brady dropped to the sixth round, being picked 199th overall. 199th. The man was never supposed to succeed. He was picked by the New England Patriots, a team that had little success historically, and sat down behind number one overall pick Drew Bledsoe. Brady was just an afterthought, in the off chance Bledsoe couldn’t play.
As luck would have it, Bledsoe went down in 2001 in an injury, leaving the door open. And with that crack, Brady turned it into dominance. That gangly quarterback won the Super Bowl over the Greatest Show on Turf, the St. Louis Rams. 
Two years later, he would do it again, and then, he’d go back to back. In four years, Tom Brady won the Super Bowl three times and cemented his legacy as an amazing player. If he’d retired then, he’d have gone to the Hall of Fame.
But he didn’t. He kept playing, and for the next ten years, he put on some masterful performances. In 2007, Brady went 16-0, with the first perfect regular season record of the 16-game era. In 2010, he won a unanimous MVP, the first to ever do so. He was great. He was in the conversations of the greatest of all time.
Except, in those 10 years the Patriots made it to the Super Bowl twice, losing each time to the New York Giants. That perfect regular season in 2007 ended with a heartbreak loss, and that 2010 MVP didn’t even see him sniff the Super Bowl. And a few people started wondering, what if Tom Brady was cooked? Maybe it was his coach, Bill Belichick. What if it was the defense, really, and not Brady himself? Maybe he was a system QB, someone who could play really well under a set of rules a coach came up with, but not in any given situation.
And then, the Patriots won another Super Bowl, taking down one of the greatest NFL defenses in history. Two years later, they did it again, in a game so infamous it still haunts their opponents, the Atlanta Falcons. With less than half the game remaining, the Falcons were up 28-3. A 25-point lead, a blowout, by all definitions. 
But Tom Brady brought the Patriots back, scoring 19 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. And in overtime, the NFL’s Comeback Kid won his fifth Super Bowl Ring, cementing the biggest comeback in the big game. It was perhaps his best argument for his position as the greatest of all time. With five rings, he had more than any QB in history, and tied for the most for any player. He had done the impossible. 
Then, two years later, he did the impossible again, winning a sixth ring. He’d brought the Patriots six Super Bowl wins, and, in 20 years, turned them from a perennial NFL bottom dweller to one of the greatest franchises in the league. He hung up his hat a year later, quitting the Patriots after two decades of success.
And then he won another Super Bowl. He took his talents to Tampa Bay, a new team, a new coach, a new environment, and within his first year, brought them to success they hadn’t seen in 20 years. It was without any of the resources that people attributed his success to. There was no Belichick. There was no system that he had been slotted into. The system was the sport itself. Tom Brady had won at football. 
The greatest football player in history retired this week. He left a legacy defined by records broken, standards set, and excellent production. He’s the new benchmark, the QB every QB will be compared to. He left New England fans with 20 years of great memories. He left Tampa Bay fans a few seasons of exhilarating victory. He left us all with a record of amazing, incredible games. An era of football is over. The specter of Brady has left the NFL. And for the first time since those autumn days of 2001, the NFL is on a new path.

Men’s Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team traveled to Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, Feb. 4 for the 14th Annual "Battle for the Obelisk" against the Spartans.
Junior Thomas Rich topped the school record in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.44, topping the previous record of 8.49 that was set in 2012. Junior Andrew McGovern took first for the Tartans in the 800-meter run, finishing with a time of 1:53.12. In the 200-meter dash, senior Alex Halkias also took first, crossing the line in 22.70. In the mile run, sophomore Colin McLaughlin won with a time of 4:20.89.

In the high jump, Rich tied with sophomores Sebastian Sanso and Ethan Higgs for first place, all three clearing a height of 1.90 meters. Rich also took first for the Tartans in the long jump, where he won with a distance of 6.85 meters. In the triple jump, sophomore Luke Blackwell took first with a mark of 13.43 meters. Sophomore Cody Breidenbach claimed first in the weight throw with a distance of 18.75 meters while senior Bailey O’Malley took first in shot put with a throw of 15.48 meters.
These victories helped the Tartans to claim victory over the Spartans 95-41. The team will next be competing at the Roanoke Invitational Challenge on Saturday, Feb. 11. 
Women’s Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team headed to Case Western Reserve University this past Saturday, Feb. 4, to compete in the 14th Annual Battle for the Obelisk against the Spartans.
Senior Samantha Giodani took first in the 60-meter and 200-meter dashes with times of 7.75 and 35.70, respectively. Her 60-meter dash broke her previous school record of 7.77, which she set last weekend. Senior Liz Barre claimed first in the 60-meter hurdles, crossing the line in 9.06. In the 400-meter run, junior Isabella Rhee crossed the line first with a time of 1:01.34. In the 800-meter run, senior Kavya Tummalapalli took first, finishing in 2:23.28. In the longer distance events, first-year Margaret Ann Healy claimed first in the mile with a time of 5:33.17, graduate student Kristen Seballos took first in the 3,000-meter run with a time of 10:56.18, and sophomore Alyssa Hoffman took first in 5,000-meter run with a time of 18:28.56.
Barre also took first in two other events: the long jump, with a mark of 5.37 meters and the high jump, where she cleared the bar at 1.65 meters. In the shot put, sophomore Katie Monahan took first with a mark of 12.16 meters. 
These victories gave the team an 81-55 victory. Combined with the men’s team, the Tartans triumphed 176-96 over the Spartans, marking their sixth straight Obelisk title. Overall, the Tartans lead the series 10-4. The women’s track and field team will next be competing on Saturday, Feb. 11 at the Roanoke Invitational Challenge. 
Men’s Basketball
To start off their weekend, the Tartans hosted the New York University Violets in Wiegand Gymnasium on Friday, Feb. 3 for their seventh home game of the season.
After opening with a back-and-forth during the first half, the Tartans managed to take a somewhat sizable lead, 25-16, with 7:20 left in the first half. However, back-to-back triples from the Violets quickly closed this gap and gave them the lead, 28-27, with just over four minutes left in the first half. The Tartans didn’t give up and were able to retake the lead before the end of the half, 34-30. 
Despite their four-point lead coming into the second half, the Tartans once again fell behind after the Violets claimed eight of the next 10 points. Despite this, the Tartans retook the lead not long after, thanks to a three-pointer from senior Josh Berry. After a small back-and-forth with NYU, Carnegie Mellon took the lead and ran with it for the rest of the game. By the time the scoreboard hit zero, Tartans had a wide lead and won the game, 80-62. 
This victory helped the Tartans remain undefeated at home and advanced their overall record to 13-6 and conference record to 5-3.
On Sunday, Feb. 5, the Tartans hosted Brandeis University as they looked to extend their home win streak by another game. 
Early in the game, the Tartans took a commanding 17-5 with 13:30 still on the clock in the first half. However, the Judges would quickly make a run back, making in 19-15 still in favor of Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans ran it back, though, giving them a 38-25 lead at the half. During the first half, notably, the Tartans made 17 of 19 free throws, compared to two of eight for the Judges.
Though the Tartans scored two early in the second half, an 18-3 run by Brandeis tied it up at 43 with 15 minutes left in play. Not long after, Brandeis took the lead thanks to a three-pointer until the Tartans tied it up at 65 with 3:42 left in the game. Brandeis tried to pull ahead once again, but two more successful free throws tied it up once again. Despite the repeated tying, the Tartans were able to pull ahead during the last minute-and-a-half. This gave them a 78-73 win over Brandeis.
The men’s basketball team now sits at 14-6 overall and a conference record of 6-3. Their next game will be at home on Friday, Feb. 10 at 7:30 p.m. when they host current #20 Emory University. 
Women’s Basketball
Looking to recover from their previous defeat against New York University, the women’s basketball team hosted the seventh-ranked Violets on Friday, Feb. 3 in Wiegand Gymnasium. 
Despite the Tartans hitting three of their first four shots and taking an early 8-2 lead, the Violets also held their own and scored the next eight points. A majority of the quarter was spent going back and forth between the two teams until the Violets pulled out ahead at the end, leaving the scoreboard reading 23-16 as the clock hit zero. An early two points in the second quarter from sophomore Catherine Or cut NYU’s lead to five, but an 11-3 run extended that lead back to 34-21 with just over half the quarter left. The Tartans weren’t able to match NYU on the quarter, making the score 39-28 going into the half.
Unfortunately, the Tartans were not able to get going during the third quarter. The Violets extended their lead by scoring 28 to Carnegie Mellon’s five, making it 67-33 as the third quarter came to a close. The fourth quarter, however, marked the only quarter that the Tartans were able to outscore the Violets, 17-15. This wasn’t nearly enough. As the game came to a close, NYU claimed victory over Carnegie Mellon, 82-50. 
Looking to recover from this loss, the Tartans hosted the Brandeis Judges on Sunday, Feb. 5 at Wiegand Gymnasium. 
In the first quarter, the Tartans kept things close, trailing behind the Judges 20-17 when the clock hit zero for the first time. However, a strong second quarter put the Tartans ahead. Shooting 44.4 percent compared to their 27.3 percent in the first quarter, the Tartans were able to score 21 to the Judges’ ten in the second quarter. As both teams headed off the court, the board read 38-30 in favor of Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartans absolutely dominated in the third quarter. The Judges were only able to get the ball in the net three times compared to the Tartans’ 10, which put the Tartans ahead 63-38 at the end of the third quarter. The Tartans kept up their shooting in the fourth quarter, but were matched by Brandeis this time. The Tartans maintained a double-digit lead the entire quarter and were still far ahead at the end of the game, 85-61.
This loss and win have advanced the team to an overall record of 11-9, with a 2-7 conference record. The Tartans will remain at home this week, playing Emory University on Friday, Feb. 10 for a 5:30 p.m. tipoff.

Tuvalu is an island nation consisting of nine islands in the Pacific Ocean and it is set to be the world’s first “Digital Nation.” Currently, about 40 percent of Tuvalu’s capital district is regularly underwater during high tide, and it is predicted that the entire nation will be underwater by the end of this century. 
In November of 2022, Tuvalu announced its digital initiative to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27). Tuvalu is creating a digital reconstruction of each of its islands in the Metaverse. In addition to preserving the country’s geography, the project also aims to preserve Tuvalan culture itself by digitally recording historical documents, traditional songs, family albums, and cultural practices. In a video shown at COP27, Simon Kofe, the project lead and Tuvalan Minister of Justice, Communication, and Foreign Affairs explained: “Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious assets of our people and to keep them safe from harm […] we will move them to the cloud.” 
Tuvalu is especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Lying low on the sea level and extremely flat, Tuvalu is easily susceptible to flooding and cyclones. As Tuvalu loses land to rising sea levels, its people are increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change.
This digital island is not the first time Tuvalu has used the internet to try and save itself. You may know Tuvalu primarily from its country-code domain of .tv. Most notably used by Twitch, the .tv brings in about 1/12th of Tuvalu’s annual gross national income. This money is instrumental in Tuvalu’s fight to save itself against the rising tides. Some of the money goes to helping Tuvalu rebuild after structures are destroyed by cyclones. A large portion of it also goes to funding research on reversing the effects of climate change.
Unfortunately for Tuvalu, its efforts have not been enough, bringing us to the digital island. Though their first choice would be to save their islands, Tuvalu worries that a physical existence is not in their future. 
Progress on their digital nation can be found at Tuvalu.tv, where you can also find information on saving the real Tuvalu by demanding climate action from your nation’s leaders.

In an ever digitally-dependent world, data science — the process of using computer systems and algorithms to analyze big data — has become a burgeoning enterprise. Google’s machine learning program “Alpha Zero” has become a force in competitive chess, outperforming both humans and other non-artificial intelligence engines. In the healthcare sector, data analysis has seen increasing implementation, specifically to sort through complex statistics and better inform medical diagnoses. 
And in the financial investment space… well, suddenly there is a gap. Unlike many of its industry peers, investment management has been less committed to including digital data tools in its strategies and operations. Why this is the case is both complicated and sometimes misguided. However, incorporating data science in investment science can bring high-level decision-making to a job predicated on exactly that: decision-making. 
In the investment management space, even more so than most industries, data is most useful when used to predict future outcomes. After all, investment relies on the ability to forecast success based on prior success, and what better way to assess ongoing trends than through statistical models and algorithms that take care of the brunt work? Unfortunately, certain qualms have kept what possibilities do exist mostly out of practice. 
Consider cloud tech, a form of computing where digital data is stored and transmitted via the internet, rather than physical systems. While potentially more efficient for investment firms to work with, cloud tech has been primarily rejected on account of being a hassle to manage and insecure, two aspects that are actually enhanced by cloud logistics. One reason for this may not be fear but rather a lack of digital savvy by primarily financial institutions, a theory suggested in an investment management primer by William Fisher published in 2017. Its authors claim that large, tech-based firms like Google and Facebook are naturally inclined to collect data because it fits their business models. Conversely, asset management enterprises have both by tradition and nature pushed digital practices to the side, generally siding with well-established conventions. The danger? The Googles of the world enter the industry themselves, a strange but real possibility considering how much more efficient their implementation would presumably be.
Of course, it's one thing to forecast the uses of digital approaches in investment management and another to incorporate them in the working industry. However, there are numerous outlets for practical application to explore. Consider dissecting psychology, an area of study whose contrast to applied mathematics would dissuade most investment managers. However, one exciting application of machine learning has been analyzing human emotion, tendency, and rationale. For financial spaces, the ability to understand decision-making is one of the more crucial aspects of success — after all, most outcomes in the space are based on split second judgements, from stock trades to option sales. In other words, in asset management, it proves worthwhile to tap into the minds of clientele, especially since the client-manager relationship is so integral to sustained results. 
More STEM-relatedly, some experts see risk management as a particular sector that could especially be bolstered by a data focus. As any good investor knows, real-time developments can always shake up seemingly-stable asset classes, one of the reasons why risk management teams are highly valued at firms. However, automating steps in the process can uncover trends that most humans working by hand may overlook. It’s clear that asset management has a plethora of uses for even the most basic of cloud and data science technology to transform their enterprises.
This isn’t to say that instituting such changes will be easy or even welcomed. Most workers who have been entrenched in the industry will likely be inclined to keep the status quo, and the expenses that will be incurred may be infeasible for up and coming companies. Still, for those who have the assets to do so, a step in this direction is likely one worth taking. For a space that has always been reluctant to adapt digitally, the most important asset under management now is technology, and the unlimited possibilities attached to it.

The average consumer pays around 10 percent more than necessary on their energy bill because of inefficiencies in energy payment systems. One out of six households in the U.S. is behind on their utility bills. Synota, a Bitcoin technology startup run by CEO and co-founder Austin Mitchell has a solution. 
While the infrastructure and technology that brings electrons or molecules of gas to your house are very efficient, the financial aspect is not as streamlined. Money must move from the consumer to maybe five to 10 energy companies that supply energy, and each of those companies pay other firms. That convoluted flow of money creates a massive lag in the chain. 
Moreover, when someone pays an energy bill, they typically pay for energy used 60 days ago. Every transaction is done on credit, and credit isn’t free. The difference in time between paying an energy bill and consuming that energy makes the consumer a credit risk to energy suppliers. With the cost of credit and other overhead costs, the average consumer overpays by 10 percent on average, said Mitchell during his talk hosted by CMU Blockchain on Jan. 25. 
When paying, users are likely to use a payment processor — a third party that collects information, contacts banks and does general backend work. An ideal solution, instead, would be to pay companies directly and automatically. Synota replaces what is normally a financial transaction separate from physical consumption with one seamless transaction. The goal is to eliminate inefficiencies by consumers paying more frequently for their energy. Companies can offer a better price if customers are willing to pay more frequently because they would no longer be a credit risk. 
How it works
A user creates an account by giving Synota their email address and state, for tax purposes, where it is stored in a decentralized database. The energy supplier creates a contract with a bank account to send funds to while the consumer creates a contract with their source of funds. The consumer’s energy meter calculates the overall energy movement from supplier to consumer, and a payment flow is created using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. The supplier provides electricity to the consumer and the consumer pays for electricity automatically. Synota software automates a recurring payment on the lightning network based on outside price feeds and some pre-prescribed contractual terms. 
For example, at a time, say 4 p.m., the software reads the energy reading, generates an invoice and checks to see if the consumer’s data matches the invoice. If the consumer’s data matches the energy’s data, then a payment in Bitcoin comes back to the supplier. If the customer wants dollars, the software has a third-party integration that, within the same payment window, will deposit Bitcoin and withdraw U.S. dollars. 
What makes Synota different?
Being a blockchain company separates Synota from much of the competition. Mitchell was in the role of managing risk during his corporate days and handled personally identifiable information for four million current and past customers. He notes that the decentralization of data is a huge opportunity that the energy industry hasn't even considered. Data management is a pain because things are not where they should be, or they're out of compliance with regulatory requirements, Mitchell explained. 
Other companies can achieve Synota’s goal without using the blockchain, but their solution is analogous to a prepayment. Users pay for their electricity in advance, and their account is credited. Over the month, the money in a user’s account is moved to other accounts. Many solutions rely on banks, custodians, and intermediaries, which are all heavily regulated entities just to provide a simple service. Moreover, other services don’t address second order opportunities like paying multiple parties at the same time. 
Differentiating from other blockchain startups
Today, there are dozens of blockchain startups like Synota that want to break into the energy industry. Those companies have more sophisticated uses of blockchain technology, but energy companies don’t want to deal with unnecessarily complicated tech, Mitchell mentioned. That’s why Synota uses Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Mitchell envisions a network effect that will separate his company from the rest. As energy companies use Synota, especially suppliers to large consumers of energy such as data centers or Bitcoin miners, they will get a better cash flow from the reduced operating costs. Because the energy industry is very connected, other companies will say “Hey, you're getting better cash flow, can I get some of that too?” Mitchell explained. By reaching a large enough scale, other companies nearby will also want to participate. 
That’s why Synota uses Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners already use a lot of energy and they're already at a meaningful scale. Mitchell said if he can get 40 percent of Bitcoin miners to adopt his software, he has already exceeded all of the other blockchain startups in the energy space combined. Essentially, you can do enough damage with the Bitcoin Lightning Network without needing to get fancy with the technology. A company can then have that momentum carry it into other markets — nobody else has been able to reach that breakthrough velocity, Mitchell explained. 
The future of Synota
Mitchell doesn't think his work will be done for at least 20 years. He sees an immediate impact on the industrial use case because of high costs and scalability, but retail will take somewhere around five years to be fully implemented. Mitchell and his company Synota want to make their product work with current systems. No one should have to be into cryptocurrencies to use the software, Mitchell said. By making energy bills cheaper and still remaining accessible to the general population, it seems like Synota can pave the way for a more efficient future.

CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
Delivering nanoparticles to the pancreas
Type 1 diabetes can destroy a type of cell in the pancreas that produces insulin. But through Kathryn Whitehead's lab, other cells in the pancreas can be reprogrammed to produce insulin. In their paper in "Science Advances," they describe their creation of a nanoparticle that can be used to deliver mRNA, which could reprogram pancreatic alpha cells to produce insulin. Currently, most nanoparticles have been designed to go to the liver, spleen, or lungs, as those organs naturally tend to accumulate nanoparticles. However, by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle, researchers in Whitehead's lab were able to change the types of proteins that adhered to the nanoparticle's surface, guiding the nanoparticle to the pancreas instead of other body organs.
Analyzing brain imaging recordings
Researchers can monitor brain activity by using optical imaging. But after taking imaging recordings, researchers must decide how to analyze the recordings. One type of imaging, called two-photon calcium imaging recordings, is often analyzed using either deconvolution or dimensionality reduction. However, researchers in Carnegie Mellon's biomedical engineering department as well as Howard Hughes Medical Institute found that combining these two approaches can actually produce better results. In a paper published in "Nature Computational Science," they discuss their proposed method, called Calcium Imaging Linear Dynamical System, which runs deconvolution and dimensionality reduction simultaneously. Their method outperformed others on calcium imaging recordings from larval zebrafish and mice.
Upgrading particle detectors at CERN's Large Hadron Collider
At European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), scientists are studying the properties of the Higgs boson, looking for new particles not predicted by the standard model of particle physics. To do this, those at CERN's Large Hadron Collider hope to increase the number of proton collisions by a factor of 20. These collisions are monitored by Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detectors, which are essentially large 3D cameras that can record these collisions. However, this would create significant amounts of radiation, more than the current CMS detectors can handle. 
To remedy this, Carnegie Mellon will be assisting in constructing new detectors, called the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGC). The HGC will require 30,000 modules, cameras that are radiation-tolerant, built over the course of five years. Carnegie Mellon physics professors, engineers, and students will construct 5,000 of these modules in Wean Hall. Modules will be assembled by robots, then tested, then tiled onto wheels, and then sent to CERN in Switzerland. The program leaders hope that the experience will provide graduate and undergraduate students with valuable hands-on instrumentation experience.

Boy, it sure has been cold, huh? In honor of the frigid wasteland we call Pittsburgh, our theme this week is "clear reflection." You can learn a lot from how people react to the cold. Do they bundle up in fifteen layers, ready to brave the cold unknown? Do they stroll outside in shorts and a t-shirt because, of course, it "isn't even that cold"? Or do they stay inside, sipping on anything from hot cocoa to a cold Monster™?
This week, we continue showcasing our suite of high-falutin, world-class authors to deliver to you the finest content this side of the Mississippi. And don't forget our comics and games section, reminiscent of even the most real newspapers.
So have no fear, pillbox is here. Sit down, grab a snack, and dig in.

The meaning and impetus of Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 Gangster/Black Comedy "Pulp Fiction" is so unique that it is difficult to describe. The film has no fitting way for a synopsis as there is no structure, no overarching conflict, no main antagonists, and no stakes to the world around the characters which we come to love over the course of the picture. It is our love for the characters in "Pulp Fiction" that propels the film into being quite possibly the most dissected film ever made. At its release, it was more than just the “flavor of the month.” Tarantino managed to strike while the iron was hot, leaping from the success of his first film “Reservoir Dogs” (1992) to worldwide acclaim, creating both a New Wave Cinema ripple which we still see in independent films and generations of teenagers and adults who are keen on witty remarks, pop culture references, and love to exercise style over convention.
The difference between the dialogues in "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction" is that the latter has humor and also has it lead the plot, rather than just having these conversational pieces that exist just to exist. For example, you could completely remove the nine minute diner introduction scene of "Reservoir Dogs" and still have the film work out the same way it does while "Pulp Fiction" plays on its own diner introduction scene as it becomes the staging ground for the very end of the picture. In fact, the way the chronology is skewed into non-linearity gives the storyline of "Pulp Fiction" a message to the audience. Every major event’s characters: Ringo and Honey Bunny, Vincent and Jules, Butch and Marcellus, and Mia Wallace are all saved in some way or another, all within 48 hours, all due to some intervention that ties their stories together. When Vincent and Jules are unharmed by magic bullets, or when the chair Butch is tied to in Zed’s shop completely breaks to free him, there is a curiosity brewing within the audience and the characters of whether there is a higher power acting out some plan. Jules references this as God, while Butch keeps it to himself and both of them move out of the life of crime. Vincent is saved alongside Jules, but disregards the warning, only to die the very next morning. The film points to some higher plan that it will culminate to, but chooses to leave the audience without a definitive answer nor to many of its small curiosities, like what was the mesmerizing glowing item in the briefcase? It is this which fulfills the pulpy namesake of the film.
The film is sloppy in direction. Scenes go on far longer than is typical, just to let the characters talk to each other, racking up a seriously lengthy runtime of almost three hours. Yet the entire plot, edited to be linear and traditional, is possibly less than 100 minutes of worthy final product. That is not to say that it is a negative aspect of the picture. The sloppiness of the movie gives it its cult classic status. Dialogue is utterly useless in some sections of the picture, but this type of talk substitutes serious dialogue that would otherwise build up to the violent crime they are about commit. This gives every character their charm, and a lot of charm at that.
"Pulp Fiction" is not without its detractors. The film’s violence, foul language, and drug usage infamously brought to question whether or not it was safe for impressionable 17-year olds to view it, with some people lobbying for the film to be given an NC-17 rating. The violence of the film is not half as bad as the gratuitous exhibitionism of “Reservoir Dogs.” In that film, most violence happens off-screen. When it is on-screen, nothing is so disgraceful that it causes viewers to look away. Drug use was another major drawback to "Pulp Fiction" for some. We watch a detailed montage of Vincent shooting up horse before taking a crack addict on a date. Nothing regarding narcotics is cast in a negative light, with Lance the drug dealer being a dopy flimsy sleaze rather than a dangerous guy meaning business, and despite drugs coursing through everyone’s systems in the film, all characters seem to function as normally as ever. This is, like all things in the movie, intentional.
No normal films would choose such murderous, drug-addicted, terrible people, whom if we met on the street we would believe to have no moral compass, to be the main protagonists, but it is through their interwoven stories that we learn that redemption is possible. It shows that everyone has the potential to become a peacemaker, just as Jules becomes one at the very end of the movie. Humanity and meaning is present in "Pulp Fiction," if you look underneath the surface, and that is what gives the film its purpose, rather than the actual happenings of the film itself. That's why it doesn’t ever give us that straight answer: it’s suggesting that all of that doesn’t matter to its true significance.

Cecilia,
I have to believe there's a plan to all of this, it can't just be random chance. My whole social circle exists because I decided to go to Carnegie Cup during O-week last year instead of taking a nap. There must have been something guiding my thoughts that day to make the correct decision, right? 
But of course, my rational physics brain won't let me truly believe in fate. It's just entropy slowly bringing us to the most probable arrangement of particles, dictated by the ruthlessly efficient math of an indifferent universe. God is dead, and Santa Claus is fake. But still, I can't help but notice these tiny decisions cascading into things that define my entire life, and it's all just completely out of my control. Maybe it's best not to think about it too hard. 
Speaking of which, you remember that girl Toni, from last year? She was the other physics student who I was crushing on (even though we literally spoke four times the whole year). Well we happen to be in the same English mini this fall, so we started sitting together in class. And soon it just became convenient to do our physics homework together after class, and soon it became convenient to always have lunch with her before class, and soon enough I'm spending five hours a day with her. In a matter of weeks, an extra got elevated to a supporting role and all I had to do was sit next to her.
Last weekend I was hanging out with Sebastian and his housemates, and I got really drunk and told them all about me and Toni. To be honest there wasn't much to say, she's just a girl I see a lot. They hyped me up to ask her out, and believe it or not I actually did it the next day — I know, kind of unthinkable for me.
I asked her while we were getting lunch at ABP, but I guess I must have caught her off guard because her reaction was very odd. She just stared blankly for like, ten seconds before saying "nah it's not like that big dawg." One of the more surreal interactions I've ever had with a person. I'm trying not to let myself get too worked up over her, it's probably for the best anyways. I bet there's some kinda fate-related reason we aren't supposed to be together. Oh, and I still spend like half my day with her because she's really good at pretending nothing ever happened.
Other than that incident, things are going pretty well. Same old, same old, really. Despite all the turbulence, I'm still walking the same paths between the same buildings in the same shoes. Maybe I need a new pair of Vans.
I met some new people by accident last week. I was eating alone in Resnik, because I hadn't bothered to make dinner plans, and I ran into a class-friend — you know those people, right? Somebody you get along great with, but your relationship stays purely within the lecture hall? He and two other people were looking for a table, and they asked if they could sit with me. One of them, Clair, I recognized from orientation week, but she had no memory of me. I think I've run into her at least twice every day since then.   
Tell me more about NYU. What's it like to be a freshman again? I would imagine Creative Writing is quite a bit different from ChemE. How about that guy from your a capella group? I saw he commented on your last Instagram post, was that like an inside joke between you two? Please explain yourself. To be completely honest, it's a little weird that he doesn't have a profile pic, but you're a much better judge of character than I am. I can't even pretend that my advice would be worthwhile to you.
Sometimes this campus is powerfully nostalgic. Yesterday I walked down the wooden steps between Doherty and Purnell — that's how I used to get to Hunan before I learned that the Pausch bridge is much quicker. Those were the steps where me and Arthur had our first real conversation. All of a sudden, I remembered exactly how it felt to be a freshman, connecting for the first time with a college friend. It was just a year ago, but those memories already feel so remote. Maybe it's because you change so quickly in college. I think eras of your life get mapped onto places, and you can only access those memories by walking there again. The nostalgia is intoxicating sometimes, I'm afraid I'll get lost in it if I'm not careful. I should find some new music, that's the issue I bet. 
Anyways. I talk too much, tell me about your life now. 
Your friend always,
Andy

Everybody hears the stories of the Hat Man during O-Week, and many Carnegie Mellon freshmen are excited to have their first encounter. For the intrepid readers, I've compiled a list of the top 10 places you're most likely to find him!
1. The Steam Tunnels
This is the number one place you're likely to come across the Hat Man. There are many entrances to these tunnels. If you climb into them and root around for a while, you might notice a tall silhouette in the distance wearing a hat. To be certain it's him, turn off your flashlight and listen for the sound of a gentle scraping on the floor. Those are his long fingernails dragging against the floor! He is almost completely harmless in the steam tunnels, as that is his happy place. 
2. Construction sites at dark
We all know the Hat Man loves nothing more than concrete and steel. If you're brave, you can hop the fence of any construction site on campus where you might find him gnawing away at an I-beam, or perhaps gleefully licking at the exposed foundation of a new structure. If you head over to the Skibo construction site, scratch the beams ever so gently, and you just might get his attention! 
3. Wean Hall, first floor
Many people say that Wean was built to act a bomb shelter. This is not true! It was not designed to keep threats out, but rather to keep them in. Sometimes, the Hat Man misbehaves, and special members of the University staff are equipped to imprison him in the deepest basements of Wean during such episodes. But his time-outs never last! The Hat Man gets quite feisty when he can't see the moon for too many days, and the concrete can only withstand him for so long. He always gets free eventually. But hopefully, his prolonged period in the dark has taught him his lesson.
4. Behind the counter at the Exchange
He loves their sandwiches. Every so often, the employees of the Exchange will hurl a piece of deli ham at the floor to keep him sated. They keep him around because he eats the desiccated corpses of the mice from their mouse traps. Yummy!
5. Doherty basements
Ever wonder why the B, C and D levels of Doherty are so confusing? It's because this is where the Hat Man likes to sleep at night. So if you've ever been walking the basement, and you could swear that this hallway didn't go that way last time, just know that it might be because the Hat Man feels like being a tricky little boy. He loves to confuse the naïve freshmen who don't know their way around. Be careful though! If you spot a sign that points to the Doherty E level, WALK AWAY IMMEDIATELY. There is no E level to Doherty. If you see any such sign, you might spot a mysterious growth on the opposite wall. If this is the case, it is too late. You may try running, but it will likely not help. God save you. 
6. Behind the walls of any Gates bathroom
This is how he travels. He slinks through the walls of Gates like a serpent, ducking amongst the wires and plumbing as easily a rabbit navigates the warrens of his burrow. If you hear a funny little scritch-scratching behind the walls, it means he's right there! Break through the walls and meet him. Break through the walls. Punch the drywall until he is free. 
7. Walking To The Sky 
There are seven human figures on Walking to the Sky. On a clear night, when the moon is full, you might spot an eighth. That's him! He likes to stand at the top, basking in the silvery light of the heavens. But be careful! If you make too much noise, you might interrupt his meditation. If you do that, sideways will suddenly become down and you'll fall all topsy-turvy across the cut until you run smack dab into a building. The Hat Man needs his moonlight like a fire needs fuel, and he doesn't take kindly to disturbances. 
8. Jahanian Hall
What's that? You've never heard of Jahanian Hall? Of course you haven't, it doesn't exist yet! But the Hat Man isn't quite like the rest of us, so that doesn't stop him. Jahanian Hall is a Humanities building located approximately at the current site of Donner that will finish construction in 2037. If you're unlucky enough to live in Donner, you might notice some days that your hallway seems just a little too long, and you never quite reach your door. If this happens, you're about to enter Jahanian Hall! Don't fight it, just enjoy the ride. The walls of this yet-to-be structure will flicker in and out of existence, and if you try to speak, your mouth will fill with worms. So zip it, and listen for what the Hat Man has to tell you! 
9. The Tartan Offices
Every Monday at 5 p.m., the staff of The Tartan meets in UC 314, because that is when the Hat Man comes. We turn off all the lights, save a single lone candle, and recite an incantation in a language that never existed. When we do that, the Hat Man arrives and whispers — oh how he whispers ever so gently — to tell us what we need to write about. Sometimes, he tells us to write something strange, and what we write ends up becoming true! One must always have faith that the Hat Man knows best. You too can join us, but only if your ears are sharp enough to perceive his message. 
10. Your room! Right now!
He's there! Go check!!!!! Oh what, you don't see him? It must be because your eyes aren't allowing you to see him. Not everybody is ready to meet the Hat Man. But if you do, make sure to firmly shake his long, spindly hand and make direct eye contact with him. Any sign of cowardice will be catastrophic for you.

SZA needs help, everyone!! SOS!! She’s so ridiculously down-bad that she wrote 23 entire songs and released them all on one album. And almost every single one of them is sad. I’ve been talking about reviewing SZA’s groundbreaking new album “SOS” ever since it came out, and now I’m finally doing it. Instead of boring you with the tedium of all 23 (very good, may I add) tracks, I’m going to highlight my five favorites, in hopes of capturing the essence of “SOS.”
“Nobody Gets Me”
This song pulled me in from the very beginning. The intro is so incredibly ocean; it fits really well with the theme of the album. I’m baffled by the placement of the song in the 14th spot on the album — it’s way too good to be in such an inconspicuous place. This is the quintessential scream-and-cry-along song, with a sick twist of very SZA-esque eroticism in the first verse. She’s telling a really compelling story here, one of love and lust and loss all rolled into one. She uses concrete details, like the MGM hotel and the ballet. We feel her violent heartache like it’s our own. Like SZA, I also wonder how I’m supposed to tell you, I don’t wanna see you with anyone but me.
“Open Arms”
This is another track that just sounds like the album cover, with its undulating guitar and slow jam drums. There’s nothing particularly interesting about the lyrics, just the usual heart-melting, slightly sarcastic sadness that SZA bleeds out into the entire album. There’s something about that sarcasm, though, that’s especially emphasized in “Open Arms” and that I really love. She’s not embracing a lover as much as she is ridiculing herself for sticking around for someone who doesn’t care about her. It’s almost grating how self-cynical she is, but set against the pretty instrumentals, it doesn’t seem so bad.
“Kill Bill”
This is the cult favorite of the album, surely because of its almost absurd honesty. The murder of the ex-boyfriend is a difficult but common trope, and I think she tackles it perfectly. The feelings of untethered wanting that motivate the storyline are almost muted by the gory details: the texts, the therapist, the drugs. You can feel the crazy. It makes you feel better about being crazy yourself. And it's so catchy.
“Notice Me”
I liked this song mostly because, to be frank, it was a bop. It’s a lot more danceable than much of the rest of the album. It has this awesome line, “I don’t wanna be your girlfriend, I just wanna be your person,” that works so well with the main chorus. Has he even noticed her yet? This is a classically “girl” dilemma, and is very well captured by SZA in this bouncy track.    
“Snooze”
This is one of the few happy-in-love songs on “SOS.” It gives insight into the chaotic nature of relationships — the good, the bad, the murderous. Something great about this album is how it’s so completely about one man and this song proves it. SZA references “Kill Bill” while simultaneously providing context for it. “Snooze” has a really great vibe that could almost be wholesome if you ignored the rest of the album.
Honorable mentions: “Shirt,” “I Hate U,” “Blind,” “Seek and Destroy”
What I think everyone loves about SZA is how she’s so unafraid to say some of the more terrifyingly emotional things that we all sometimes think. She leans into her own femininity and impassioned sentimentality in such a beautiful and graceful way. The instrumentals on this album lend themselves very elegantly to this stylistic pattern. I think the general sounds of this album are demonstrated well by the album cover. There’s a lot of depth and an equal amount of intricacies, and SZA is stranded somewhere in the middle of it all.

Oh, to be a small woodland creature whose biggest worry is if I have enough mushrooms for the soup I’m making for dinner. Instead, I’m plagued by nonstop meetings and deadlines. But “Everdell,” one of my favorite board games, is a chance to enter the forest and manage your very own town of woodland creatures. 
The base game of “Everdell” can be played with one to four players, though I have yet to try the single-player version. With the “Bellefaire” expansion, you can play with up to six. The premise is simple: by placing workers around the board, players collect resources, which are then used to play buildings and critters to town. The game starts out slow, with each player only having two workers, but as the players proceed through the “seasons,” they gain more workers and can do more.
This is the ideal game style for me: new players start out wondering how they’re going to fill their 15 town spaces, only to be struggling to find space for another card at the end of the game. Players can also choose to keep to themselves, indirectly help other players, or hurt them. “Everdell” has the capability to suit all play styles, and I think that’s why I haven’t met a single person that dislikes playing it.
“Everdell” is also a great introduction to board games, or for people who don’t especially like playing them. With only three possible options per turn — deploy worker, play a card, or prepare for season — it’s fairly approachable. I find that first-time players are almost always quick to pick up the rules and give veteran players a run for their money. “Everdell” relies much more on strategy and patience than luck, which I find refreshing compared to other similar tableau building games. 
Additionally, there’s so much variety that it’s essentially impossible to play the same game twice. The game offers lots of customization — each game features different special events that require different cards played to your town to claim. There’s also a series of expansions that add new elements to the game. While the game recommends only playing with one expansion at a time, playing with all of them together makes for a long, entertaining, strategic game.
This isn’t even to mention how beautiful “Everdell” is. The art style is incredibly charming, and the base game features a giant three-dimensional tree that the cards sit under. All of the expansions play very well with each other, and the cards are fairly well-balanced. The game creators really knew what they were doing, and it culminates into a great player experience. 
So please, give “Everdell” a try. While not everyone is going to get the base game and all its expansions, it’s a great game for both family and friends. Next time you find yourself at the board game store, consider “Everdell.”

This past Friday, the Pittsburgh Opera performed the famous composer George Frideric Handel’s lesser-known opera, "Ariodante." I had the pleasure of interviewing two Carnegie Mellon students who worked on the production's costume and scenic design. Below are excerpts from our interview, as well as my own thoughts on the opera itself.
Alison Zheng: Tell me a bit about yourself!
Grace Kang: I’m a third-year pursuing an MFA in costume design in the School of Drama. I used to work at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. 
Ningning Yang: I’m a second-year MFA student studying scenic design. 
AZ: What first inspired you to pursue your chosen major?
GK: I wasn’t involved in costumes until my undergraduate years, which was when I started to go to school for theatre. I didn’t have a focus at the time, but I reached a point where I was working enough with costumes that I eventually gravitated toward it. It was like a language I understood and connected to very easily — it made sense to me. It was a way for me to express personal identity, storytelling, and it made the most sense to me out of all the areas of design. 
NY: Because I’ve always liked the visual arts but also enjoyed live performances, I decided to go with scenic design. I did fine arts in high school, as well as music and plays. I thought I should study scenic design as it was something that combined both. I first got into theatre because of musicals and plays, but then I started looking at operas. My favorite musical is currently "The Band’s Visit"!
AZ: How did you come across the opportunity to work with the Pittsburgh Opera?
GK + NY: The School of Drama has a relationship with the Opera, where they’ll pull students to do a production where they can come in and work. They haven’t had a costume designer for a long time either, so this was the perfect time to renew their relationship with the school. Every year students are given projects to design for a production. Our advisors reached out and asked if anyone was interested, which faculty then decided who would eventually design for the show.
AZ: What were your first impressions of "Ariodante"?
GK: My initial impression of the opera was that it was hard to understand and relate to, since the language is older and foreign. The director was great in terms of having meetings with the scenic and costume designers, going though themes and the theory behind how operas are written and produced. It helped to get a better appreciation of the show. Since "Ariodante" is an older opera, it also has a lot of dated themes, but the director tried to transform the themes into a slightly different narrative that was more modern and empowering. It was a great first opera experience, which I think scratched the surface of my beginning opera knowledge. 
NY: I knew of Handel but not the opera. The story and plot are very old-school drama, and it doesn’t shed that much of a good light on women within the play. Once we read the play and talked to the director, they said they needed to do something about it. The princess, Ariodante’s wife, gets crowned at the end of the production, although the original production has it so that Ariodante is crowned instead. The ending is slightly altered, which I thought was nice.
AZ: What was your favorite costume/set to work on in the production?
GK: The main protagonist, Ginevra, the princess engaged to Ariodante. Maybe it’s because I empathize with her a lot, since she’s put in a situation where she’s framed for having cheated on her betrothed. Her father wants to imprison her for being a dishonest woman. There’s empathy toward her for being in a situation which she has no control over. She wears on main dress the whole show which was fun to design — it has a lot of elements and was hand-painted by someone with lots of trim added. There’s lots of layers of details there that I really enjoyed. 
NY: The prison scene. The most bare-bone of the scenic design elements, there’s no extravagant lighting. It’s just basic.
AZ: Were there any difficulties or hurdles working as a full-time student during the production?
GK: Even though it’s a part of the curriculum, the demands of it can vary a lot. Students usually put as much as they can into it, which can be hard if you’re also taking classes. Since it isn’t through the school, you have to work with the opera’s schedule. Also, because the opera opened sooner than CMU, I had to a lose a part of my break. Tech week was the week that school started again, so it was challenging to be in the thick of something and jump between two projects. For the most part, you’re technically supposed to have time to do it all, but all designers put in much more hours than the units they’re usually assigned.
AZ: Do you have any advice for other students that may want to work in a similar field as you?
GK: The great thing about theatre is that you don’t need a strong background, but just an interest in it. Just a willingness to learn and get your hands dirty and make mistakes. I will say that to get into theatre, there’s a barrier of entry since theatre isn’t a well-paying field. In order to gain experience, most internships or apprenticeships are either not paying or not well-paid. The best place to get that experience is when you’re in high school and wanting to get involved in a school production. At CMU, there’s a lot of students outside the School of Drama that can get involved with productions. A lot of theatres in town offer student discounts. The other thing too is that if you’re interested in learning something, cold contacting people is a way to get your foot in the door for something. If they don’t get back to you, you don’t really lose anything. It’s relatively easy to get into theatre, it’s just economically, the barrier of entry.
NY: You have to really love it, because you don’t get paid that much. There are always skills that you require on the way, but if you’re passionate enough you can make a living and make yourself happy.
I’d like to thank Grace and Ningning once again for taking the time to interview with me! The partnership between Carnegie Mellon and the Pittsburgh Opera is one that goes far back, so it’s always interesting to see it from the perspective of the students working directly on the project.
"Ariodante" is a beautiful example of a Baroque Italian opera (think 1600s for this). The genre is certainly not one of my favorites, with other operas written by Handel feeling far more moving and steady-paced, but that is not to say that the actors of the Pittsburgh Opera didn’t do a wonderful job. In this production, we saw the comeback of "The Marriage of Figaro’s" Jazmine Olwalia as the titular Ariodante, and Evan Lazdowski (who I interviewed before! Go check it out) as Rè di Scozia, the King of Scotland. It’s always nice seeing a familiar face and hearing a familiar voice, so I was quite pleased with their performances. Being able to see the two actors’ versatility made the performance even more enjoyable. 
Although set and costume design seemed more sparse than usual productions in at the Benedum Center, for this one was staged at CAPA Theatre, I thought the actors handled the small-scale stage with their usual grace. Even through the Italian man next to me would sing the arias alongside the actors off-key, their voices still resonated with each subtle emotion the characters were meant to feel. I have a slight distaste for the leitmotif that "Ariodante" uses, but even then, it was made palatable by the singing. 
The standout performer of this production was definitely Chuanyuan Liu as Polinesso, the main antagonist. I’m quite biased toward good countertenors, so it made sense that Liu’s voice was something I automatically gravitated to. He pushed the emotions of Polinesso to the edge, which is also something that I’m always looking for in an opera. In a way though, I think antagonists are easier to portray, since visceral hate is a much more recognizable emotion than conflicted grief. It’s because of this fact that I think the other actors also did an amazing job at displaying that. 
While the production has since ended, the Pittsburgh Opera will be performing "Il Trovatore," "Denis & Katya," and "We Shall Not Be Moved" for the rest of their 2022-2023 season. Student tickets are usually at least half-price! Make sure to see "Il Trovatore" from late March to early April — you won’t regret it.

Each Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, groundhog Punxsutawney Phil forecasts six weeks of weather based on his shadow (or lack thereof). If he sees his shadow, there’s six more weeks of winter. If not, spring comes early and the cold weather should end.
So what’s the prediction for 2023? Well, good old Phil saw his shadow, so it looks like this recent bout of cold weather is here to stay. NPR explained that the official forecast (read by a handler from a scroll chosen by Phil himself) is: "I see a shadow on my stage, and so no matter how you measure, it's six more weeks of winter weather." This follows recent years' predictions, and CBS News noted that “Phil has predicted winter more than 100 times.”
Of course, basing a weather forecast off the shadow seen by a marmot seems to be an old farmer’s tale. However, it’s actually based in astronomy — According to the Farmer’s Almanac, Groundhog’s Day is halfway between the winter solstice and spring equinox, and that “the holiday stems from an ancient Celtic celebration called Imbolc.” NPR explained that Imbolc traditions of lighting candles hark back to the 10th century.
A later iteration of this holiday was called Candlemas, and groundhogs weren’t always used to predict the upcoming season change. France and England used bears, while in Germany badgers were more common. NPR added that Germans also used hedgehogs for this tradition. When they came to the U.S., German immigrants couldn’t find enough badgers or hedgehogs to use for their predictions, so they used groundhogs instead. Thus, Groundhog Day joined the many traditions Americans adopted from German immigrants, alongside Christmas trees and the Easter Bunny. 
Despite Phil’s nickname of “Punxsutawney Phil, Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Prognosticator of Prognosticators and Weather-Prophet Extraordinary,” his predictions could use some work. Farmer’s Almanac noted that this year, meteorologists predicted Phil would see his shadow based on the anticipated weather of the day, which did in fact occur. However when it comes to six-week predictions, Phil is only correct in his prediction around 40 percent of the time.
Phil isn’t the only prophetic animal out there. NPR explained that other notable weather predicting animals include New York’s groundhog “Staten Island Chuck,” Ontario’s groundhog “Wiarton Willie,” North Carolina’s white squirrel “Pisgah Pete,” Connecticut’s duck “Scramble,” and the Oregon Zoo’s beaver “‘Stumpton Fil.’”
Here at Carnegie Mellon, the drive to Punxsutawney, PA is just one and a half hours, making the round trip only three hours out of our busy days to visit the groundhog. To celebrate the holiday, the town hosts many events, including a Groundhog Ball and many photo-ops with Phil. If the drive is too long, the town also has a livestream of the Groundhog’s Day predictions.
However, for the best in-person groundhog experience, a drive to Punxsutawney isn’t necessary — simply go to the hill behind Tepper and see the wild groundhogs living there.

A new restaurant is opening its doors in the Tepper School of Business. What makes this one unique? It’s completely developed and operated by students. Not only that, it’s the first of its kind at any university in the country.
The ambitious student leading the project is David You, a senior studying Business Administration and Computer Science. Chartwells, the dining services company that has operated at Carnegie Mellon since 2021, has contracts on 300 college campuses in the nation, but this restaurant will be a brand-new initiative.
“This is the first time any higher education dining service is building out a fully run and fully operated student restaurant,” You said. Opening day for service to the Carnegie Mellon community is planned for this Saturday, February 11.
The student-created eating establishment, Capital Grains, will operate out of Rohr Commons, from 12-3 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, preparing food in the same kitchen Carnegie Mellon Dining uses during the week. The student chefs and service workers will have total access to equipment and infrastructure to cook as needed.
The name Capital Grains homages the Tepper School while acknowledging the nature of the project: an opportunity for students to develop their entrepreneurial talent. The program aims for hands-on management experience while serving the student body.
“The educational component matters the most,” You said, “But this is real life. This is as real as it gets.”
Capital Grain’s initial offerings will consist of grain bowls and salad bowls. Research conducted by the student developers showed that “a lot of students want alternative dining options, especially on the weekends, and wanted a healthier option that wasn't available,” You said. The team decided to “focus on a market where we could sell healthier, nutritious food to students.”
“We want to make it convenient. It’s a grab-and-go concept, where you order as you go along,” he said. The bowl menu will consist of a green base, either romaine or kale and spinach, or a grain base of brown rice and quinoa mix. Alongside numerous topping choices will be a protein choice — chicken or tofu — and house-made dressings.
“A main concern we were trying to target is, a lot of vegetarian students on the weekends don't have a protein option,” You said. This menu aims to address that deficiency. Payment options will operate like other campus dining locations.
Chartwells partners with programs on campus including the CMU Food Pantry and has utilized its funds to bring meals to students struggling with food insecurity. Joe Beaman, Director of Dining Services at Carnegie Mellon, and Mike Tokarek, Resident District Manager for Chartwells, brought up this new project together in an effort to further integrate Dining with the university’s education model. A major interest for Beaman in his time at Carnegie Mellon has been thinking about how the dining experience can “become more part of the education model,” he said. Getting students behind the wheel of the foodservice process presents a big opportunity for just that.
Beaman and Tokarek began to germinate the idea for a student-operated restaurant a couple years ago, both having joined the Carnegie Mellon community in 2021. To make it happen, they needed a student willing to work and lead this initiative. It was going to take was one with the right “attitude and energy” to make it possible, Beaman said. The question became, then, how to “engage with a student to build out” a student-run business model.
Many first-year students will know David You by his memorable 2022 orientation-week nickname: “Dining David.” You earned that familiar designation as a Head Orientation Counselor, tasked with organizing all the food for the First-Year experience with Dining Services.
“I worked with David through that process, and food was really important to him,” Beaman said.
Reflecting on his experience helping to plan the week’s catering, You said, “it was nice to be part of the conversation. Philosophically, I've always believed that food is an integral part to life in general, but also for an academic experience, especially orientation.”
Interest piqued by his work in foodservice, You kept up his connections with the dining team over the summer, Beaman said. “When you see that kind of work ethic, that kind of passion and drive, the person kind of finds you.” In You, Dining management had found the right student to take on the job of being CEO for the student restaurant initiative.
“David has really spearheaded this thing, taken it with a full head of steam,” said Vic Schmidt, Executive Chef at Carnegie Mellon. Alongside Beaman, You has been working with Schmidt and Tokarek on a daily basis.
“When we partnered with David and he started talking about the team that he was going to build, we realized that he really wanted to take the lead, that he wanted this to be something that he helped build from the ground up,” Beaman said.
There have been student service businesses on campuses before, in the realm of coffee shops and cafés, like Saxbys Experiential Learning Platform. Based in Philadelphia, they run a national program for students to work hands-on in food service. But, as Mike Tokarek points out, "there’s nothing with real menu development." This venture differs from those at other schools by giving students complete freedom to make what they will of the program. Without limiting the students’ potential for creativity and development experience with strict guidelines to follow, they instead had the support and financial backing to plan out themselves exactly how the restaurant should run.
“They’ve given me full authority and ownership over this project, in terms of what we're going to sell, how we're going to sell, hours of operation,” You said.
A key ingredient to getting this restaurant right came in surveying the student population to gauge their needs and interest, making sure the food being sold fit what students desired and “thought was absent from campus dining, especially on the weekends."
“We’re a data-driven organization,” Beaman said. “We might have anecdotes about what we think, but we send out to get the data, to find out what people are really wanting and what they’re missing. And I think [David] hit it on the head.”
Last fall, You began hiring students to realize the restaurant dream. He brought on three business students in managerial positions to serve as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Operating Officer, and eight more to assist on the service side. With this team assembled, progress began in earnest. As well as developing Capital Grains on the business side, You also serves as its executive chef, creating the recipes and menu items to be dished up, training the staff to take on all aspects of operation, from preparation to serving, customer service to cleaning.
Opening weekend on the rise, final preparations are in process to make sure the team is ready to go. The students have been working beside Schmidt, training in the serve-safe process, learning about food safety, knife skills, and all the vital aspects of running a successful restaurant.
“I anticipate he’s going to have a lot of support from the students,” Schmidt said.
Starting out as a weekend pilot concept, ambitions for the project are grand. With the right student interest, and some years of development, the concept may evolve into a seven-days-a-week, full-service restaurant.
“The goal is to have it be like a student concept. How it will look in 10 years, I'm not sure. But certainly, I think it's a great initiative because we as the students choose the food that we're selling,” You said. “In the future, if people's palates change and they want something new,” the students involved could make that change, he said.
Beyond the opportunity for management practice, “it’s also about getting scholastic credit and real-life experiential learning,” Beaman said. An independent study program is being developed for students to get class credit through Carnegie Mellon for their work on the project.
“I think there’s a sense that we’re all part of an entrepreneurial landscape” at Carnegie Mellon, Beaman said. “The students keep taking on more of the responsibility. Now we’re excited to take a back seat and watch the work that they do.”

As the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 approaches, the conflict shows little sign of stopping. 
Tanks for Ukraine
One of the latest updates in arms deals for Ukraine is the approval of tanks to be sent from Western countries. Pierre Meilhan of CNN explained that Western countries will deliver 321 tanks to Ukraine as of Jan. 27, including promises of 31 M1 Abrams tanks from the U.S., 14 Leopard 2 A6s from Germany, 14 Challenger 2 Tanks from the UK, and “some” Leopard 2s from Poland. This is followed by news Saturday that Portugal will join the arms support, with Reuters reporting that Portugal’s prime minister Antonio Costa promised to send an unknown number of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Meilhan notes that other countries like Spain, Norway, and the Netherlands are considering similar measures.
President Biden said the tanks will be useful in countering “Russia’s evolving tactics and strategy on the battlefield,” as Ukrainian troops need to increase the maneuverability and ability to “deter and defend against Russian aggression over the long term.” The tanks will be accompanied by training and repair equipment. According to the Department of Defense, the Abrams tanks are “the most capable tanks in the world.”
It is unknown when any of the tanks will arrive in Ukraine, making this a race against time. 
Cyberattacks Continue
A key forum of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has been in the cybersecurity realm. Russia has launched numerous cyberattacks on Ukrainian systems. According to Reuters, Ukrainian official Yuriy Schygol confirmed that “Ukraine had been hit by 2,194 cyberattacks in 2022, with 1,655 of those coming after Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion.” Schygol said Russia is to blame for most of the attacks, noting that often, Russian hackers don’t even bother to hide their affiliation and are either a part of the Russian military or funded by Russia’s Federal Security Service. 
Of note is a recent attack on Jan. 27. AJ Vicens of Cyberscoop wrote that the recent attack, dubbed “Sandworm,” is “‘a new data wiping malware’” with unique capabilities as it didn’t re-use code from previous attacks. He furthers that Sandworm was “‘focused on a specific target’ in the public sector,” but that there isn’t yet visibility on the impact of this latest attack.
Upgrades to Ukraine’s Anti-Aircraft Systems
Another recent move in arms sharing includes a new anti-aircraft system to upgrade Ukraine's current one. Xiaofei Xu of CNN explained that France and Italy’s defense ministers are planning on sending the SAMP/T-MAMBA air defense system to Ukraine in the spring, which is described as “the best long-range European anti-missile system.” It has the ability to “target drones, missiles, and fighter jets” and will be paired with the Thales GM200 system also recently purchased by Ukraine.
This system upgrade is essential given the importance of the air domain in the Russia-Ukraine war. Greg Myre of NPR explains that the countries have near daily fights in the air, but that the conflict is uniquely reliant on missiles and drones instead of piloted aircraft. He notes that this is due to the affordability and ease of drones, paired with the early losses Russia took when they relied on piloted aircraft earlier in the conflict. 
Problematically, Myre explained, the current Ukrainian air defense system has a limited number of defense missiles, meaning every drone shot down is a missile used from a dwindling supply. In the future, this could open things up for Russia to return to fighter jets in the air domain without a risk of being shot down, making these air defense systems from France and Italy essential for Ukraine.
Russia-Ukraine POW Exchange
Russia and Ukraine conducted the latest in a series of prisoner-of-war exchanges last Saturday. According to the Associated Press, officials from both countries reported that “dozens of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners of war have returned home following a prisoner swap.” They added that this included 116 Ukrainians who were captured in battles over Mariupol, the Kherson region, and Bakhmut, as well as 63 Russian troops including “‘special category’ prisoners whose release was secured following mediation by the United Arab Emirates.” 
This follows previous prisoner exchanges in December and January. This follows promises by Ukraine to return "all our people" and that this won’t be the last exchange between Russia and Ukraine to fulfill that goal. 
Russia troops buildup
Analysts warn that Russia is likely gearing up for another offensive around the time of the one-year anniversary of the conflict. Jonathan Yerushalmy of the Guardian reported that Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said “Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine on 24 February.” This is sooner than other analysts had previously predicted. Raf Sanchez of NBC News noted that Western analysts long predicted a spring offensive, “with the Kremlin eager to seize the initiative after a grinding winter that was preceded by months of battlefield setbacks and domestic criticism.” 
The accelerated timeline is due to new Russian troop buildup at the border, which Reznikov numbers at 500,000, around 200,000 more than the 300,000 soldiers conscripted in September 2022. Based on recent increases in struggles defending the front lines, he anticipates the attack would be in the east or south of the country, where there has been recent heavy fighting and rising offensive operations. Brady Knox of the Washington Examiner added that, based on infrastructural reorganization and expelling local residents in the region, the Institute for the Study of War predicts action around the Luhansk region with the intent of taking the Donbas region.

On Tuesday, Penguin Random House announced the resignation of chief executive Madeline McIntosh. McIntosh has led Penguin Random House U.S. since 2018 and is considered one of the most influential figures in American publishing. McIntosh is the third senior executive to leave the company following the failed merger with Simon & Schuster in October.
Penguin Random House is by far the largest American book publisher and their attempt to buy Simon & Schuster — another Big Five Publisher (a term which refers to the five largest publishing houses in U.S. trade publishing) — was blocked in an antitrust trial. U.S. District Judge Florence Y. Pan ruled that the merger would hinder competition “in the market for U.S. publishing rights to anticipated top-selling books.”
According to economist Nicholas Hill’s testimony, the consolidation of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster would command a 49 percent market share which is more than double that of the HarperCollins (the next largest among the Big Five). This ruling had major implications for the company including a $200 million termination fee on top of expensive legal costs.
McIntosh says that the collapsed merger did not influence her decision, but that after its end she was ready to move on. In an interview, McIntosh said that while five years may not seem like long, it was “an intense five years.” She further explained, “Having the trial behind us, having new leadership in place, it’s a good time for all of us to pivot our way forward.”
McIntosh started her journey in publishing as a temporary assistant to a HarperCollins editor, until finding a position at Norton. In 1994, she began at Bantam Doubleday Dell and was recruited to join Random House in 2009. In her memo to the company, McInstosh said that she would not leave immediately but work with Nihar Malaviya, the interim chief executive of Penguin Random House, to facilitate a smooth transition.
While McIntosh has not decided what to do next, “What I’m really itching to do is to try something new and different,” she said.

Last summer, the Department of Justice, by way of the FBI, raided former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-lago Florida estate, executing a search warrant for classified and unclassified documents belonging to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). According to the Washington Post, the FBI seized “103 government documents with classified markings, more than 11,100 government documents/photographs without classification markings, 48 empty folders with ‘CLASSIFIED’ banners,” and more. A few weeks later, President Biden spoke on the matter, calling Trump’s mishandling of documents “totally irresponsible.” 
On Jan. 12, according to CNBC, classified documents from Biden's vice presidency were found inside a garage in Bidens’ Wilmington, Delaware estate. According to Biden’s lawyers, the administration immediately contacted both the NARA and the DOJ to report the findings and began to search Biden’s residences to uncover any more documents. All of this occurred after ten classified documents were discovered last November in Biden's D.C. office.
The searches of Biden’s residences have found close to a dozen classified documents, all of which have been turned over, but call to question of whether this will lead to criminal charges connected to the Biden or anyone working in his administration. When reporters learned that Biden kept classified documents in a garage next to his Corvette, they pushed on the scandal. Peter Doocy, Fox News’ White House correspondent pressed the president, “Classified document next to your Corvette? What were you thinking?” Biden’s response: “...my Corvette’s in a locked garage, so it’s not like they're sitting out in the street, okay?” 
Ultimately, Attorney General Merrick Garland will decide whether criminal charges will be put upon Biden and Trump. While the intentions and handlings of the situations differ, they do not affect the legal statute on the misconduct committed by both parties, and as such, both presidents would face the same charges if pressed.
The House GOP is beginning to go on the offensive after months defending Trump, calling Biden hypocritical for the scandal. According to NBC News, on Jan. 13, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) requested the DOJ give complete transparency on the documents found at Biden’s estates. On Jan. 30, the DOJ denied the House Committee’s request for non-public information of the classified documents. As of Feb. 2, there have not been any public announcements as to what exactly the documents contained. 
More searches have been prompted by the White House rather than the DOJ, with at least six more classified items found within residences and office spaces Biden has used. These new documents, according to the President’s personal attorney, appear to be related to his position as Vice President and tenure as a member of the Senate, the latter of which means that Biden has held on to documents dated 2009 or earlier, notable because Biden had served as a Senator for the state of Delaware since 1973. 
House Democrats seem to have been caught between a rock and a hard place on the matter. Some defended Biden, comparing his handling of the return of documents to Trump's mishandling of his, while others did not comment. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Biden's stature is diminished for his inappropriate possession of items with “top secret” markings. Other Democrats stood fast with the president. 
Kyle Herrig, Executive Director of the Congressional Integrity Project, wrote "comparing Biden's cooperation to Trump's obstruction is like comparing apples and arsenic," with many other Democrats sharing the same sentiment, holding Biden’s cooperation as the primary vehicle to his defense, especially as the GOP is organizing and unleashing a wide net of oversight investigations on the current administration.

Netflix once tweeted that “Love is sharing a password.” If that’s the case, Netflix has had enough of love.
The multi-billion-dollar streaming service has been threatening to crack down on password-sharing for years, beginning in earnest recently. 
On Jan. 31, news site The Streamable spotted an update in the Netflix Help Center detailing how accounts may or may not be shared. This page seemingly announced some drastic changes to the Netflix status quo. While accounts could previously be shared with little to no geographic restrictions, the service seems to be shifting their guidelines to be based around individual households. 
With over 50 percent market penetration in North America, the company has had to get creative with its strategies to increase profit. The company estimates that 100 million users access the site with a shared password, meaning that they do not pay for the account. By shifting to a model where the account is strictly tethered to a single location, Netflix hopes that the excluded users will create their own accounts. 
The announcement sparked massive criticism, prompting Netflix to state that they did not mean to post it. The guidelines apply to a test launch in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru which, depending on its success, may expand to other markets. However, the company confirmed in a fourth-quarter 2022 earnings report that they will be implementing “enhanced efforts” to limit password sharing in the United States by the end of March 2023.
The now-removed Help Center update explained that instead of accounts simply being accessible to whoever has the right login credentials (as is currently the case), accounts must now be linked to one Wi-Fi network at a “primary location,” which each device on the account would have to connect to at least once every 31 days to remain a “trusted device.” A device will lose its “trusted” status and be blocked from accessing the service if the user fails to watch something on the correct network once a month. Once a device is blocked, even if it is blocked incorrectly, the user must contact Netflix to get it unblocked. 
On top of having to continuously sign in to the primary location’s Wi-Fi, users would no longer be allowed to sign in outside of that location, and the device may be blocked from the account regardless of how recently it was used in the primary location. The policy includes a small compromise for users going on vacation, allowing account holders to request a temporary sign-in code allowing access for seven consecutive days outside of the primary location. It is unclear how often a user is allowed to request a code. 
Netflix tracks account activity, location, and device usage with information including IP addresses and device IDs, allowing them to strictly enforce this new policy.
These changes would bring massive disruptions to many existing accounts. Netflix accounts are commonly shared among families, but this update is not compatible with many living situations. As critics have pointed out, this would exclude families with separated parents, children away at college, long-distance relationships, and military families with a deployed family member. Even for families who live together 100 percent of the time, this model is inaccessible if they happen to take a vacation longer than seven days. 
Unsurprisingly, the update sparked widespread backlash online. Netflix’s 2017 tweet reading “Love is sharing a password” has gone viral in response, with many pointing out the irony between the statement and their latest update. 
Netflix’s current anti-account-sharing measure is a limit on how many devices can watch simultaneously. Basic accounts allow only one, the next tier allows two, and the Premium plan allows four. The announcement upset many users who upgraded their account in order to share with family members, but will no longer be able to if the measures are implemented. 
There is currently a way around this in the Latin American test launch, allowing account holders to pay an extra $2.99 for every user outside of the primary location. 
While Netflix hopes that these stringent new rules push some of the 100 million password-sharers to get their own accounts, many feel that the update is a jump too far and that will cause existing account holders to cancel. Netflix gained popularity as a convenient way to watch movies and TV, so ease of access is still important to much of its user base. Between this announcement and a relative lack of compelling original content in recent years, this may just be the last straw in deciding that the up to $19.99 per month subscription fee is no longer worth it.

Author's note: to research for this article, I watched a lot of Andrew Tate videos at a coffee shop (but I shook my head the whole time so everybody knew I disagreed). I just want you, dear reader, to appreciate the lengths to which I go for this paper
This December, the funniest thing in the entire universe happened. Andrew Tate, the internet's biggest and strongest boy, got into an argument with Greta Thunberg for no particular reason. The following day, in a fully unrelated incident, he was arrested by Romanian authorities on charges of human trafficking. 
I won't waste time getting into the details of his crimes (or the untrue rumor that a pizza box is what got him arrested). Suffice it to say, he's guilty as hell and deserves every minute of jail time he gets. I want to talk instead about one, very specific rhetorical strategy of Tate, and what it reveals about ourselves.
During an interview with Barstool sports, he uses a fascinatingly effective tactic. He lists the things that he, as a man, is expected to do; pay on the first date, open the car door for his woman, and provide for/protect his woman. He then argues that since "we all agree" on those baseline assumptions, we can't oppose the natural conclusion — if he has some responsibility for his woman, he must also have some authority over her. He won't elaborate on what this authority entails, so he still avoids saying too much of the quiet part out loud. Tate completely dominates the conversation and the other people on the podcast have no real counterargument.
One of his most infamous quotes is his belief that women are the property of their husbands. When pressed on this claim during an interview with Piers Morgan, he equivocates with a flimsy argument about how his wording was irresponsible (without ever providing clearer wording of his beliefs, I'll add). Then, he employs a very similar argument as he does on Barstool. He lists the ways in which the institution of marriage frames women as inferior to their husbands — namely, that women take their husband's surname, and that women are walked down the aisle by their father. After peppering in some appeals to religious tradition, he then argues that we can't oppose the natural conclusion of these practices, which is that there is some inherent hierarchy to marriage (he won't explicitly say it entails ownership, but he also won't deny it).
What Tate won't consider, and what he uses verbal gymnastics to make sure others don't consider, is that the things he lists — the obligations men have to women — aren't actually necessary. He gets you to agree that the man should be the provider, the protector, and the emotional rock in a relationship (often by slipping in regressive gender roles amongst relatively harmless practices like paying on the first date). He treats these as needing no proof so he can argue that their logical conclusion is undebatable. But the practices he lists are all made up. Being strong, stoic, and caring are certainly virtues in a relationship, but there's no reason to act like they're uniquely masculine traits. This idea of masculinity is a construct, is my point.
Perhaps the only real way to stymy the appeal of this rhetoric is to make people understand that masculinity is a social construct. Even in its most diluted form, it does imply some degree of hierarchy between the sexes (I mean for God's sake he uses the practice of opening doors to justify male supremacy). As long as you cling to the idea that there are certain ways a man ought to behave, you leave open the door for someone to argue those ideas imply male supremacy. Because invariably, our ideas of what a man should be are rooted in patriarchy.
One of Tate's catchphrases is telling his audience to "break out of the Matrix" — in other words, you must reject the lie you've been told by society. I think this slogan resonates for two reasons. This first is that he speaks to the aggrieved entitlement of his audience. Aggrieved entitlement refers to a sense of resentment among white men, who (consciously or not) view the progress of socially marginalized groups as a threat to their position in society. It especially resonates among those who feel insecure about failing to sufficiently perform masculinity. Hearing a successful kickboxer who smokes cigars on private jets reassure you that it's not your fault (it's the damn feminists!), is extremely cathartic for his audience.
However, the second reason is that he occasionally touches on legitimate material issues faced by young men in the 21st century. This group (along with literally everybody else, I should add) feel disillusioned by living in a highly atomized, isolating, capitalist society that fails to live up to its promises. 
But he suggests that the solution to this is to embrace the regressive, patriarchal ideas that are linked to the power structures that cause this disillusionment in the first place. The actual way to break out of the "Matrix" is to embrace a healthier view of masculinity that doesn't emphasize aggression, emotional suppression, and bigotry. Also, the Matrix was directed by two trans women. 
Tate accurately shows that there is a straight line between our gendered practices and male dominance, and instead of interrogating those practices, he'll tell you that male dominance must be natural. And for much of his audience, that's exactly what they wanted to hear in the first place. Those who interview him rarely seem to challenge those practices either, because even when faced with their logical conclusion, it's often a step too far to ask people to divest from our idea of gender. Tate's success shouldn't really be that surprising. He exploits our unwillingness to challenge gender roles to argue for a regressive, patriarchal worldview — and such a worldview will always be popular among the group it stands to benefit. And since he supports his arguments with extremely prevalent practices and beliefs, he can make this ideology seem less radical. 
It's very rhetorically convenient that Tate happens to be a scumbag and a criminal. But I worry that somewhere out there is another buff, rich man who isn't a sex trafficker. It's not impossible to imagine someone arguing the same things, while also not embodying the worst elements of their own rhetoric. All he would need is an audience of young men who want to hear what they've been primed to believe, and their rhetoric might be just as devastatingly effective as Tate's.

Some things just taste delicious when you don’t have someone complaining in your ear that it tastes disgusting.
For some reason, Schatz Dining Hall has so many students holding to the verdict that it is quite possibly the worst place on campus, and that its food is indigestible, as if some canard is floating around about someone getting sick from eating there. It is, however, the only place on campus that you really cannot leave without a full stomach, as the wide variety of food that Schatz serves are never so terrible as to make you sick.
The fact that it's a buffet, an addition which students at Carnegie Mellon in the past have proposed the dining services to offer, should have quelled complaints but seems to have only exacerbated them. Going to Schatz, especially in the morning, one will find a constant and loyal customer base, and that is athletes. Naturally, athletes tend to be on the larger meal plans at Carnegie Mellon, and that added with the fact that it’s the only place you can quickly get to 1,000 calories before 10 a.m. on a single block makes Schatz the no-brainer. 
Ironically, Schatz shares that similar reputation and loyal customer base with another Carnegie Mellon staple: Donner House. Like how Donner is with dormitories, perhaps it’s the fact that Schatz is seen as a pittance compared to other university dining halls that people demean the establishment. I, however, find it unfair to bash Schatz for some of the alleged flaws that people hold to it after going to it more often, as what other possible way is there for something to grow on a person? The same can probably be said about Donner House and how many of its residents defend the dormitory.
There are definitely worse places on campus to go than Schatz and some places that may be better but take ages to order. There is never a line at Schatz; not because there aren’t people who want to eat there, but because it doesn’t require you to wait for an order to be ready. It’s pay and chow, unlike some other locations on campus which are not at all well-staffed, like Egg Shoppe, which can take up to 30 or 40 minutes to deliver a single order because there are two or three people working the entire location.
The most baffling thing to me is that people liking Schatz is a cardinal sin to many students here, when there is nothing in particular that stands out as extremely repulsive. It’s a fine establishment, especially if you wish to have breakfast with a large group of friends. It even throws occasional banquets of extremely nice cuisine. For example, last semester, there was an ice sculpture winter party that Schatz threw, and it was probably the nicest food that this campus has offered here in a while. 
Ultimately, the Schatz enjoyers are the only ones who win in the end.

New York City, home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the United States, recently approved a new mandate requiring all private schools to provide educational programming on par with that offered at public schools. How does this affect the Jewish community? 
There are many sects in Judaism, including the Hasidic sect, a form of Orthodox Judaism. Hasidic Jews practice a traditional form of Judaism, characterized by a deep separation from the secular world. Many followers live in Hasidic neighborhoods, most prominently Williamsburg in Brooklyn. These neighborhoods function as insular communities, operating in Yiddish. This separation also applies to education: children in these communities attend Hasidic Yeshivas, private schools with curriculums heavily focused on religious studies. Students often spend morning until nightfall studying the Torah, the religious book of Judaism, and the Talmud, a record of Jewish religious law and theology. Instruction in math, English, and science is also included, but to a much lesser degree. 
As of September, New York expects all private school students to perform at the same academic level as public school students. Private schools have three years to demonstrate compliance. This new expectation poses a problem for Hasidic Yeshivas, whose students have consistently failed state standardized tests to an alarming degree. Former teachers at said Hasidic Yeshivas have reported that some of their 12-year-old students in their last year of English instruction could not spell words like “cold,” or the neighborhood they lived in, “Williamsburg.” This benchmark failure raises even more questions when compared to public schools, primarily those whose students are low-income or non-native speakers of English, who perform in accordance with the state standard, as indicated by research conducted by the New York Times. Former students of Hasidic Yeshivas have professed their lack of preparation for life outside of school — and outside of their Hasidic neighborhoods, should they choose to venture out of them. 
Hasidic Yeshivas do not operate as a monolith. Each school is instead individually run by committees. However, these committees ultimately dance to the tune of the community’s rabbis, like Moishe Indig, who supports New York City mayor Eric Adams. The support from the Hasidic communities of N.Y.C., who often vote as a bloc, is often sought by politicians. Hasidic leaders advise the community to vote for candidates who honor the educational sovereignty of their Yeshivas. Up until the latest educational mandate, New York lawmakers and the Board of Regents for the Department of Education have largely adopted a hands-off approach to Hasidic Yeshivas. 
But now, with no such candidate able to preserve the inviolability of one of the most important tenets of the Hasidic community, rabbis are at a crossroads: face state sanction of their schools, or comply with the secular invasion of their educational philosophy, as they see it. One must wonder, now, why these rabbis concern themselves so strongly with the preservation of the current school system. Who does this school system benefit?
Supporters of this mandate assert that secular and non-secular education does not have to be mutually exclusive. Some supporters include parents of students who attend these Yeshivas, worried for the future of their children. On the other hand, critics claim the mandate is an infringement on one of the fundamental parts of Hasidic Judaism; should Hasidic Jews choose to center their education around the study of the Torah, then that is their prerogative. 
The secular public attitude towards this mandate seems positive overall, especially in regard to its effects on Hasidic Yeshivas. However, there are some viewpoints that raise questions on the underlying reasons for said public support. One commenter on the New York Times article wrote, “Religious fundamentalism of all stripes is a cancer upon society… which seeks only to ensure the sustained power and influence of its leadership.” Could support of this educational mandate be synonymous with anti-religion sentiments for some? Are people simply eager to intercede devout piousness in non-Western religions? Or does this distress stem from a place of compassion for Hasidic boys barred from a proper education due to the nature of their societies? In that case, either party will have a different definition of what a “proper education” constitutes. 
Other readers comment their dismay at the Times' incomplete coverage of this story: they lacked an explanation as to why multiple sects in Judaism venerate such intense study of the Torah and Talmud. Also missing was a further investigation on successful graduates of Hasidic Yeshivas and their roles in supporting their Hasidic communities. Was this exclusion purposeful? Would these stories have painted a different picture of not only Hasidic Yeshivas but fundamentalist Jews as well?
Presumably, if one peels back all the layers of this current dilemma, is this story not reminiscent of the age-old issue of separation of church and state? How will (sometimes) secular America handle non-secular minority groups? Does public funding of private schools give the government leverage in deciding educational benchmarks for these schools — religious institutions or not? If Hasidic Yeshivas receive a share of taxpayer money should the Department of Education not subject them to the same, or similar, schooling expectations as public schools? Or should students of Hasidic Yeshivas be held to different standards due to their non secular ways of life after graduation?
Politics, anti-religion sentiments, and Orthodox supporters aside, one truth remains firm: all children in America deserve equal access to education, including these Hasidic children. By inhibiting the study of secular subjects, Hasidic Yeshivas can potentially disable their students, limiting their prospects of success after graduation. Furthermore, this omission of secular material continues the cycle of insulation of the younger Hasidic generations from the outside world, thus increasing the risk of failures in any context outside that of their Hasidic communities. Schools should equip their students with the tools and knowledge to function as competent, responsible members of society, even if that means exposure to the secular world. Ideally, students at Hasidic Yeshivas should be allowed the option to truly learn important subjects other than religious studies without stigma or fear of ostracization.

On January 28, Utah governor Spencer Cox signed a bill that would prohibit transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming surgery and severely limit the ability for doctors to prescribe hormonal treatments, like puberty-blockers and hormone-replacement therapy. It is the first of such bills to be passed this year. The state legislature considered a draft of the bill a mere two days after the 2023 legislative session began, and Governor Cox signed it into law the day after it was sent to his desk. 
Interestingly, Cox vetoed a bill last year that would ban trans students from competing in sports that match their gender identity. His veto was overridden, which was subsequently struck down by a Utah court (barring the legislation from taking effect). However, it seems that Cox has changed his stance on the matter by approving an arguably much more harmful piece of legislation. Though Cox claimed his intent to protect trans youth, the bill has already had a demonstrably negative impact on trans adolescents in Utah. It is written without consideration for the very real impact this will have on trans youth and their families. 
This legislation is also entirely at odds with the consensus of the medical community. The American Psychiatric Association "opposes all legislative and other governmental attempts to limit access to these services for trans and gender diverse youth." The American Medical Association "urges governors to oppose state legislation that would prohibit medically necessary gender transition-related care for minor patients." The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes legislation which would "limit access to comprehensive evidence-based care which includes the provision of gender-affirming care."
Governor Cox argues that the bill is necessary "until more and better research can help determine the long-term consequences" of gender-affirming care. But it takes one look at the overwhelming amount of anti-trans legislation being pushed nationwide, to see that there will never be enough research to convince these ideologues. It's merely a flimsy argument to defend their bigotry.
In January, the New England Journal of Medicine published a longitudinal study that assessed the impact Gender-Affirming Hormone (GAH) treatments on 614 trans adolescents. Their conclusion: "In our U.S.-based cohort of transgender and nonbinary youth treated with GAH, we found decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms and increases in positive affect and life satisfaction as assessed through validated instruments."
In an accompanying op-ed, two other researchers addressed commonly raised concerns about gender-affirming healthcare. With regards to detransitioning, they pointed out that "few studies have provided data on the incidence of detransitioning, and available results are inconsistent." They also conceded the need for greater research on the adverse effects of hormonal interventions, such as the impact it may have on brain development and bone density. However, they emphasized the "effectiveness of the current care model that includes hormonal treatment for transgender adolescents."
The need for more long-term research is already well-recognized. However, medical experts agree that it is important, at least in the short-term, to provide gender-affirming care to trans youth. Republican politicians, on the other hand, point to the lack of research to make the exact opposite conclusion. This legislation is clearly driven by an ideological opposition to trans identities, and not any evidence-based analysis of gender-affirming care. 
It is imperative we all recognize that this unjust legislative attack on trans identities is part of a broader, anti-LGBTQ agenda from the Republican party. The ACLU has identified 262 bills in state legislatures that target LGBTQ people. In the 2023 legislative session alone, 124 new anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures. The hyper-fixation on healthcare for trans youth isn't a coincidence — it's genuinely an area where greater medical research is needed, and concern about the widespread adoption of these treatments can be argued in good faith. But this fact is exploited by legislators who want to place as many obstacles as possible between trans youth and gender-affirming care. Just because we aren't in Utah, and just because you may not be trans, doesn't mean that the bigoted ideology driving this legislation will not affect you. We must support and affirm trans individuals in our university community and defend their right to medical care.

Over the summer, I spent some time with a past teacher of mine who is a technician for Pittsburgh Regional Transit. We spoke, as we have in the past, about how far Pittsburgh lags behind other cities in terms of transportation, specifically with regard to bus scheduling and software. Who among us has not stared down at the Transit app, standing out in the cold on Forbes or Fifth, wondering when the bus will finally come? Tangentially, PRT did receive $100 million dollars and will likely not spend any of it on tech upgrades. 
What they will spend it on was teased to me in my conversation with my teacher. I don’t remember thinking much of the alterations he described. Even when things change here, nothing really changes. As much as Pittsburgh has gained from being a city that has changed immensely in the past 30 or more years, we also, on a very basic level, thrive on consistency. Holding on to the historical or traditional aspects of our culture has kept us grounded, I think, especially when it comes to attending to the lesser-loved neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.
In my very Pittsburgher opinion, Carnegie Mellon, though very historical in name, is a symbol of progression in our city. Through the arts, technology, and simply bringing in students from around the country and the world, Carnegie Mellon has revolutionized Pittsburgh so wholly that it has become entirely alien from it. 
The reason I delve so deeply into this dichotomy — besides the fact that it sort of consumes my brain all the time — is because it perfectly explains why the newly proposed Pittsburgh Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project is being sold by PRT as being mainly positive in effect and also why that could never entirely be true, regardless of what changes are actually made to the bus lines.
The biggest problem I see with the proposed changes (which is noted by pretty much anyone with eyes and the correct contextual background), is that PRT took a chainsaw and cut a clean line in the space between some of Pittsburgh’s most underserved neighborhoods and Downtown — right in Oakland. I will caveat that this is only true for some bus lines, and that PRT was careful to leave at least one bus in every neighborhood that runs straight Downtown with no transfer. For some, though, it will now require a transfer to get through Oakland, which for anyone who does not have a bus pass magically coded into their ID card can cost (maximally) $2.75. I’ll say it again: no student in Oakland is going to be paying for this change. Though PRT has made some pretty commendable decreases to the transfer fare rate for those paying with Connect Cards or “Stored Value” tickets, if you’re forced to pay with cash, this will impact you. This is not a coincidence. Transfers also cost a lot of time. Think about doubling the amount of time it takes to catch a single bus and now add that time to a morning commute Downtown. 
For us though, the main problem is that we can no longer take each 61 or 71 at face value because now, for example, the 61D will not go Downtown. That’s right out-of-towners: You now have to learn what all those pesky letters mean, or you’ll be headed right back to campus after you reach Carlow on Craft Avenue.
Another issue I find is the structural addition of bus-only lanes on Forbes and Fifth. I really do commend PRT for attempting to streamline traffic, because as every Pittsburgh driver knows, being stuck behind a bus is the worst (both because they stop often and because the drivers, while so completely competent, are terrifying). To be frank, though, our city’s infrastructure problem was not isolated by any means to the Fern Hollow Bridge. I’m no expert, but I really see no way for Forbes or Fifth to continue to support the traffic they see now with a decrease in lane space. I’m curious to see what will result, though. If it works, it will be better for people living in Oakland, no doubt.
They’re also apparently adding more of those nifty “station”-like structures like the one on Atwood, which should be pretty cool and helpful for those needing to buy tickets so as to avoid paying fare with cash. They’re also extending the Downtown bus lines essentially through to the Point, which is actually massively useful.
It took me a while to parse the map that PRT released detailing the route changes, but once I did, I understood exactly how this plan fit into the general socio-economic landscape of Pittsburgh. The negative impacts are essentially what I would have expected given Pittsburgh administration’s usual attitude towards neighborhoods like Wilkinsburg and Braddock and the nurturing care they pour upon Oakland and Squirrel Hill. 
I’m not saying that I think it’s okay that some people living in, say, Swissvale, will no longer be able to get home using the P3 while people living in Shadyside will see much smaller service changes. However, I do think it’s something similar to what Pittsburgh has withstood for years, and what it will continue to withstand. PRT opened a public forum and will be releasing a report based on the feedback they get, but I do not expect them to change their plans based on this report. They actually already released a report detailing how they’re screwing over the smaller, low-income, outskirt communities they’re meant to serve. People will settle for what they can get, and traffic in Oakland will probably be pretty bad for a little while. But it's unfortunate that improvement in our city's public transit infrastructure is accompanied by slashing service to communities that already exist on the margins.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
Recently, I’ve been on a bit of a reading kick. For some reason, all the books have been making me sad, to the point of shedding tears several times in the span of half a book. Interestingly, I’ve spent most of my life avoiding books, movies, and TV shows that were written to make you feel things, but now they’re finally catching up to me. And I have to say, I’m enjoying it. 
The first book that really made me appreciate and changed my perspective on sad books was “How High We Go in the Dark” by Sequoia Nagamatsu. This book has such a human feel to it that was missing from the books that were assigned to me in high school. It features a collection of short stories that illustrate the beauty of humanity when it is heading toward destruction thanks to a mysterious virus (sound familiar?). 
While I had some gripes with the book, I thought the first half was extremely well done and illustrated how writing has the power to make readers want to be there for their family, friends, and neighbors. I just wish someone had made me read this book when I was in high school — I would have been a better person for it, I’m positive. The only book I was required to read in high school that even comes close to “How High We Go in the Dark” was Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple.” While I think it was a good book with solid character development, it doesn’t scratch that same itch that I didn’t know I had.
What really got me in “How High We Go in the Dark” is how normal the characters felt compared to some of the other “sad” books I’ve read. For instance, the first section covers an archaeologist who had just lost his daughter and decided to finish the excavation she had started. This felt so normal and mundane compared to, say, “All the Bright Places” by Jennifer Niven. While I certainly was upset at the end of the book, the characters felt “special” — their flaws so exaggerated that the reader knew something bad was going to happen. Not that it’s bad to write a book or movie that way, but I feel like I was missing out on a whole different genre when I read “How High We Go in the Dark.”
One of other things that I was reminded of thanks to “How High We Go in the Dark” was how seemingly all the human-interest stories I see in headlines have some kind of “twist” to them. For instance, most stories that are like “Woman raises $30k on GoFundMe to pay for emergency surgery” are just devastating. At first glance, it’s sweet and my faith in humanity is restored, but then I question why she ever had to pay $30,000 in the first place. “How High We Go in the Dark” has the feel of neighbor helping neighbor because it’s the right thing to do, not because money drives everything. I guess I just wish for things to be more reasonable, but I don’t want a plague that kills millions to be the driving cause behind that change. 
Another noteworthy book I finished recently was Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Klara and the Sun.” I really don’t know what I expected when I started this book, but I think it was a reminder of how a great ending can really solidify a book and make the reader feel complete. I feel like I’ve read far too many books that were supposed to make me sad, but just fell a little flat due to a weak ending. I know I’ll get some hate for it, but Madeline Miller’s “Song of Achilles” felt this way to me. I loved the book as a whole, but I couldn’t help but hope for a little bit more from the ending. “Klara and the Sun” is a reminder that the ending is what sticks in the reader’s mind and determines the value of the book as a whole (at least, that’s the way it is for me.) I can excuse some subpar writing, but I can’t excuse a bad ending.
But really, I just wish that I was encouraged to branch out more when reading. I would always stick to the same authors and genres, and I don’t think that helped me as a reader or a person. Getting to know what is out there is just as important as sticking to what you like. So if you like to read, go pick out a random book from the library that you’d never read and give it a try. Maybe it’ll suck, maybe it’ll be your new favorite. That’s the joy of expanding your boundaries.
