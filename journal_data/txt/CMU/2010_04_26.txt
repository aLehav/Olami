For the first time in Carnegie Mellon’s history, the men’s tennis team has achieved a national ranking of number seven. The Tartans geared up last weekend to host the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships after topping the previous seventh-ranked team, Kenyon College, a few weeks ago. Entering the UAAs as the third seed, the Tartans blew past Case Western Reserve University’s Spartans 6–3 to earn a spot in the semifinals against Emory University’s number-three Eagles. The Eagles stopped the Tartans short of competing for the title the next day with a decisive 5–1 win, but the Tartans rallied back to defeat Brandeis University the next day for third place, 5–2. The Tartans improve to 18–5 after this tennis-packed weekend.
The Tartans were met with surprising resistance the first day and found themselves at a 2–1 deficit after doubles play. The Spartans came out swinging and surprised the Tartans at first and third doubles, but the duo of juniors Bobby MacTaggart and Alex Nemerov fought back to snatch a 8–5 win.
“We’ve played Case before, but they caught us off guard with some relentless doubles play,” Nemerov said. “I think everyone was motivated to play better in singles because of it.”
Adding a few easy points to the total were senior James Muliawan, who topped his opponent 6–2, 6–0 at third singles, and first-year Duke Miller, who finished just minutes later with a 6–2, 6–3 win at fourth singles. MacTaggart overpowered his opponent in three sets, 6–3, 6–7 (4), 6–3, to give the Tartans a 4–3 lead. Senior Jon Spero had a tough, grinding match against Case’s Sean Carr, but came out victorious in a third-set tiebreak, 6–3, 6–7 (2), 10–4. Rounding out the fifth win was sophomore Jeremy King ,making his singles debut, who easily won 6–1, 6–3.
Despite their win over the Spartans, the Tartans were anxious going into their match against rival and third-ranked Emory. Since matches are played to decision, the Tartans ended their run at a UAA title with a 5–1 loss. 
The lone win came from first doubles, with Muliawan and King winning three straight games after being down 6–7.
“We were hanging on after doubles, but the momentum just wasn’t there,” senior Niko Ljuboja said. “In singles, Emory was definitely sharper, but a couple of our guys could have pulled out wins if we played the matches out. We just need to maintain our focus for tomorrow if we want to do well.”
Spero added, “We really wanted to beat Emory but came up short. We played spectacular doubles, but they were a little too good at two and three. They have arguably the two best singles players in the whole country, so losses at the top two spots were understandable.  I thought we played a good match, and I think it goes to show how strong Emory is after they beat Wash. U. fairlycomfortably.”
The Tartans entered their third-place match with high expectations against Brandeis. Eager for redemption from Saturday’s loss, the Tartans quickly took the lead 2–1 after taking first and third doubles. Muliawan and King won 8–5, while Miller and Ljuboja slammed their opponents by the same score.
First off the courts was Muliawan, who breezed by his opponent 6–3, 6–1, followed by Nemerov, who pulled out a 7–5, 6–1 win over Brandeis’ number-one player, Nick White. 
Miller struggled a bit at fourth singles but gave the Tartans the needed fifth win, 6–2, 5–7, 7–5. Spero and King were also up a set when play concluded, a small demonstration of why the Tartans are now ranked seventh in the nation.
“We really enjoyed hosting and it was a treat for the seniors,” Spero remarked. “We are looking forward to a home match against W & L next weekend, and if we winthat, it’s looking very good for us to host an NCAA regional on graduation weekend. We didn’t play our best tennis of the season, but we played to our seed and got the job done in both of the matches we needed to win.”
The Tartans will host their final match of the season against Washington and Lee University next Saturday at 12 p.m.

As many of you know, the Stanley Cup playoffs are in progress, with the Pittsburgh Penguins battling to defend their title. With no basketball team and a disappointing baseball team, the city of Pittsburgh is looking to the Pens to give them reason to celebrate. Optimistic Pittsburgh fans may think that the Pens are the favorite to defend, but educated hockey fans will tell you that the Stanley Cup will not be parading through Pittsburgh anytime this year.
The main reason why the Pens won’t sniff the cup is one man: Sergei Gonchar. Yes, he is an above-average defender, but he isn’t even the best defender on the team, let alone one of the best in the league. Gonchar has become slow and unreliable in the Pens’ zone. He lacks the ability to play physical defense, and when the time comes, he also lacks the ability to start a breakout. Yes, he brings an offensive mind to the Pens’ formidable power play, but he needs to see less ice time because he hurts the team so much at full strength.
Overall, the Pens have too many defensemen who think about offense first, rather than shutting down the opponents. Just look at their current series with an extremely weak Senators team. The Senators scored three or more goals in four out of the six games of the series. Defensemen are getting burned, and Pens goalie Marc-Andre Fleury just isn’t good enough to stop the puck by himself. Just as the cliché states, defense wins championships, and the Pens don’t have enough of it.
Defense isn’t the only thing that the Pens have to shore up. To start with, Chris Kunitz and Alexei Ponikarovsky need to step up their games. When Kunitz is playing smart, he can affect the game in a way that no one else can. Lately, he’s been taking ridiculous penalties that just put the Pens on their heels and give other teams scoring opportunities. It may have worked against the Senators, but when they run into better teams like the Capitals, good power plays will tear them up when Kunitz takes an unnecessary penalty. 
As for Ponikarovsky, the Pens brought him in to play aside Malkin to make the line stronger. But he hasn’t performed and doesn’t seem to have the fire to play on this team, nor the desire to. One goal and one assist in six games of the playoffs isn’t going to cut it. Ponikarovsky also had just one shot on goal in Saturday’s overtime game. He scored 50 points in the regular season, but he’s having no impact in any of these games.
A lot of Pittsburghers have been complaining about Fleury’s goaltending recently. What they don’t understand is that half the time, it’s not Fleury’s fault. He’s not the best goaltender in the game and when the defense makes stupid mistakes, most goalies in the league are going to get burned. Most of the time he’s doing the right things, like giving up long rebounds and hoping his defense controls the puck. 
However, the Pens’ defense tends to be lackluster and lets oncoming offensive players maintain possession. Fleury loses focus sometimes and gets flustered when he gives up easy goals, which is his main flaw. He’s got to keep his head up and realize that he’s a good goaltender and mistakes happen. No one is perfect, especially not him.
Now, I’m not saying that the Pens don’t have a shot to win the cup. With Malkin and Crosby, anything can happen. They can propel any team to stardom. With two overtime wins, the Pens can say that they’ve been battle-tested, and they’ve given up only one goal in overtime. But they need to get their defense in the right mindset before they play the Caps, otherwise they’ll lose that series in less than six games.

Baseball has managed to make it through three weeks of the season with only one rainout, and it came on Friday. That’s a pretty impressive feat — not that anyone but Mother Nature really had a say in the matter — when you consider that April weather tends to wreak havoc on baseball. In 2007, Cleveland’s entire opening series with the Seattle Mariners was snowed out, and the Indians ended up having to host their “home opener” in Milwaukee.
So April has been relatively cooperative, at least weather-wise. But baseball is baseball, and nothing ever works out quite the way it’s supposed to; for every team that makes a remarkable comeback to win a game in the bottom of the ninth with clutch hitting, there’s its opponent losing a game on bad pitching. Only rarely does a team blow a game only to say, “They beat us despite our best efforts. We made our pitches and they hit them; we made our plays and they just beat us.”
The Pirates played their first two weeks like they were a real team, giving us that small glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, they’d finally put the right group of guys out on the field to mix the winning formula. After they swept the Reds on April 15–17, the Pirates sat in second place with a 7–5 record.
Then all hell broke loose. The Pirates played a gracious host to the Brewers last Tuesday through Thursday, throwing meatballs across the plate and not scoring any runs, as they fell rather disgracefully 8–1, 8–0 and 20–0. They then butchered any chance of climbing back over .500 for a third week in a row by dropping their first two games against Houston, 4–3 and 5–2.
On the bright side, those losses were the first time this season that the Pirates had lost by less than six runs.
There’s still hope, though — there’s always hope. Yogi Berra and the 1973 Mets were in last place as late as mid-August before rallying back to make it all the way to the World Series. “Ya Gotta Believe” was the slogan Tug McGraw coined that year, and you have to if you’re a real fan.
But believe it or not, there’s been more baseball this month outside of Pittsburgh. The Tampa Bay Rays and the New York Yankees are battling it out for first place in their division and quickly leaving the other teams behind, most notably the Boston Red Sox, who need to make a decision quickly on their former star of all stars, David “Big Papi” Ortiz. Now I’m not a Spanish major, nor do I play one on TV, but after watching the sadness and frustration in Ortiz’s eyes after he struck out for the umpteenth time and was eventually pinch-hit for, I’m certain that “Big Papi” is Spanish for “Bruce Banner.”
There’s also been a lot of outrage among fans and, more inappropriately, commenters on MLB.com about some controversial baseball over the past week. On Saturday, a 12-inning affair between the Minnesota Twins and the Kansas City Royals ended when Twins shortstop J.J. Hardy bobbled a grounder but recovered in time to throw to second base. Royals speedster Scott Podsednik was called out to end the game, which would have been fine — if he had actually been out. The naked eye, replays, radio and television announcers from both teams, and pretty much everyone but umpire Greg Gibson saw Podsednik slide in safely. Alas, Royals’ manager Trey Hillman’s argument was to no avail, and the game was over.
Earlier this week I wrote in my blog, “Jonas On Baseball,” about how it’s better when an umpire admits he’s wrong. It shows professionalism and it shows dedication to the game and its values. No game is ever considered a good one, no matter how close, if it hinges on a blown call. Anyone who watched A.J. Pierzynski run down to first base after he struck out in the 2005 ALCS knows that; anyone who watched Gibson call Podsednik out on Saturday knows it.
However, contrary to the belief of some “fans,” Gibson’s bad call was not because he is biased against the Royals. No umpire could ever do that and get away with it. No matter how unprofessional an umpire is or how bad of a call he makes, it will never have to do with bias or other such preference. He just made a bad call, or at the very most, he’s just a bad ump. 
Let it be known, though, that with the exception of some I cannot name (one rhymes with “Bad Bairchild”), most umps are good, professional umps.
The other controversy is over the Yankees’ Mark Teixeira, who barreled hard into Angels catcher Bobby Wilson on a play at the plate on Friday night. Wilson, who was in position to tag Teixeira out before the ball got away from him, suffered a concussion and a possible ankle injury when Teixeira slammed into him full-force, Teixiera’s shoulder appearing to make contact with Wilson’s face mask. While Wilson had to be helped off the field and taken to the hospital, Teixeira didn’t look back after touching home plate and getting into the Yankee’s dugout.
Was it unprofessional of him not to check on Wilson? No. It would have been very professional of him to go out there, but not doing so was probably a better choice given everyone’s sensitivity to intentional collisions nowadays. Teixeira’s best option to try to score was to barrel over Wilson, and he did it well. Nationwide, Teixiera is being ripped apart for knocking over Wilson, but people need to realize that although baseball is a gentleman’s game, hard-nosed baseball is good baseball. It’s not about courtesy and sunshine and flowers. It’s about winning and playing the game right.

Wrapping up an outstanding career with the track and field team, senior mechanical engineering major and thrower James Hulley was recently named a 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) Athlete of the Year. With this honor, Hulley became recognized as one of the top collegiate athletes in the country for hard work and success in strength training and conditioning. Hulley was also recently awarded Athlete of the Week honors by the University Athletic Association for his victories in the shot put and discus; he also set a school record in the shot put at the Tartans’ home meet on April 10. For all of the hard work that Hulley has been putting in to his training in the past few years, receiving these awards is very satisfying.
For a typical day of training, whether it is while he is in season or conditioning in the off-season, Hulley lifts in the mornings and participates in throwing practices in the afternoon. While he does not have concrete plans in line for next year, Hulley is definitely looking forward to giving his body a much-needed break from eight years of intense bouts of exercise. 
Hulley notes that nutrition and recovery have been crucial in supporting his tough training regime since a rigorous academic schedule has been the main focus of his time at Carnegie Mellon as well.
While he excels in all of the events that has competed in, Hulley cites the shot put as his favorite. This comes as no surprise, as Hulley will be competing in the national championships for the shot put again next month. Having the opportunity to hone his precise technique is something that Hulley looks forward to, giving him an increased chance for victory at the highest level.
For his undergraduate teammates, Hulley has some parting words that should serve as positive motivation for them to maintain a determined and dedicated attitude as a student athlete: “Don’t work too hard if you don’t enjoy it. If I didn’t love training and competing, I wouldn’t be able to train like I do. You’re only an NCAA athlete for four years, but you’re also only going to be an undergraduate for four years. Whether it is athletics or anything else, do what you love.”

The world of electronics is rapidly changing. Today, touchpads like those seen in the iPad are popular, replacing conventional keyboards with a screen. As handheld devices also become smaller and more compact than ever, innovative technology must be developed to navigate through different screens.
Minput, a device that hopes to solve the problem of space and visibility in small devices and screens, is being developed by Chris Harrison and Scott Hudson, who are both part of Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Harrison has already been featured in The Tartan for his work with Skinput, which turns the arm into a touchpad.
When sliding Minput over a surface, sensors on the bottom can register movement to control various software on the device. In this respect, Minput is a mouse with the computer screen attached, and it can be manipulated without having the user’s fingers block the screen.
Harrison has uploaded a video online describing various capabilities of Minput, which has already been developed as a proof-of-concept device. Minput is named because it is an input technique for miniature input devices. These devices are too small to have buttons or for touchscreen capability to be practical.
Minput allows mouse control and optical tracking to be applied to small mobile devices. Currently, the technology is being developed using a 1.5-inch LCD screen, according to a www.cnet.com article. The LCD screen was taken from a wristwatch that originally allowed users to watch television or movies. On the side opposite the screen, two optical sensors from a SlimG4 mouse were attached. The entire assembly was connected to a computer, which processes data from the optical sensors.
According to a demonstration in Harrison’s video, Minput could be operated anywhere a user could possibly use the device, including on a table, on the leg of one’s pants, and on a user’s palm. Because there are two sensors on the device, a variety of motion can be detected, including twisting the device on a table. According to www.chrisharrison.com, the optical devices use negligible tracking power. According to the video, Minput supports three “input modalities,” or ways the user can manipulate the device. Gestural input modality involves motions like flicks and twists and was demonstrated using photo-browsing software. Flicking the device in a certain direction changes the image, while twisting changes the number of images on the screen, like a zooming function. These inputs can be changed to perform many functions on different programs. The variety of motions allows programs on the devices to change certain settings without having to navigate complex menus. For example, turning the device like a knob can be used to adjust volume of music, while sliding the device left and right may change song tracks.
A second input modality makes Minput a virtual window — by sliding the device around, a high-resolution photograph can be examined. The picture seems to stay in the same place while the device moves, so it is as if the user is seeing the picture through a window. This can also be applied when viewing text documents or web pages. While not implemented yet, links may be clicked by tapping the device. The final input modality is cursor control, meaning Minput can act like a mouse, allowing the user to play a simple game. In the future, researchers hope this type of input modality will be applied to viewing web pages and other tasks that normally require a mouse on conventional screens.
While only in the development phase, Minput has the potential to change handheld devices. With a simple, intuitive design, it addresses issues concerning space and functionality of small devices.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), a popular tool for imaging, measuring, and manipulating matter at the nanoscale, was invented in 1986 and was commercialized in 1989. This type of microscopy gathers information by feeling the surface with mechanical probes. AFM is a type of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in which the image of a surface is obtained by moving a probe over a sample and recording the interactions between the probe and the surface of the sample.
AFM is used for a variety of biological applications, including imaging molecules, cells, tissues, and biomaterials. At Carnegie Mellon, AFM is being used to study peptides and lipoproteins. AFM, popularly used in nanotechnology research, has been used to image the surface of the ivy plant to understand how it climbs structures, as stated in an article on www.photonics.com.
According to www.veeco.com, AFM is on the cutting edge of science since it provides true three-dimensional surface images. AFM is used to image and manipulate atoms and structures on many different surfaces. Samples viewed by AFM do not need any special treatments. The technology provides higher resolution images than other methods such as the scanning electron microscope. It is also favorable since it has the ability to operate in liquids and work with sample sizes ranging from a few nanometers up to several micrometers.
An AFM consists of several important components: a scanner (which is mounted above the tip or below the sample), a detector, and feedback controls. A cantilever moves over the surface of a sample in a scan. The cantilever is usually composed of silicon or silicon nitride, and has a sharp tip on one side that interacts with surface of a sample. The type of tip used depends on the sample it will interact with. The scanner is made from a tube of piezoelectric elements, which are materials that change shape when a certain amount of voltage is applied to them. According to the optical level method for the detector, a laser beam is shot at the tip of the cantilever and is reflected onto a position-sensitive photo-detector.
According to the book Atomic Force Microscopy: Biomedical Methods and Applications, AFM can operate in several modes: force-distance, contact, and tapping mode. In the force-distance mode, the tip will start above the surface and is brought down. When the tip is close to the surface, it sticks to it and then retracts back to the starting point. In the contact mode, the tip contacts the surface, and the tip will deflect up and down based on the sample’s topography. The force feedback from the tip ensures that there is contact with the surface. Contact mode provides information about physical properties such as elasticity, adhesion, hardness, and friction. In tapping mode, the cantilever is oscillated and brought into contact with the surface. The contact with the sample is intermittent over a very short time. The changing amplitude of the oscillation provides information about the surface. Tapping mode is a better choice with soft samples since it is less damaging, while contact mode is most useful for hard surfaces.
The tip used in AFM is one of the important factors influencing the resolution obtained. The sharper the tip used, the greater the resolution. The tip can be affected by different parameters to alter the image. These are compression, interaction forces, and irregular curvatures. Compression affects studies with DNA, irregular curvatures cause broadening in the image, and interaction forces cause an increase in image contrast.
AFM is a great tool for visualization on the atomic scale. The images it provides of both conductive and nonconductive materials are valuable to researchers. AFM allows for a different way to visualize molecules in three dimensions.

Two years ago, an organ transplant in Spain caught the attention of the medical community across the world. As reported in a story on www.dailymail.co.uk, Claudia Castillo of Spain received a windpipe generated from her own stem cells.
Organ transplantation has been performed for years. However, in most conventional organ transplants, the patient’s immune system is likely to attack the transplanted organ, as it is foreign to the body. Therefore, patients undergoing organ transplants are given drugs that suppress their immune system. However, this suppression of the immune system makes the patient highly susceptible to a variety of infections. According to an article on eMedicine, 27 percent of patients who die after an organ transplant are killed by opportunistic infections or complications related to the infections. What made Castillo’s transplant remarkable was that an organ generated from her own cells was used. The body would not reject such an organ, and immunosuppression would not be needed in this case.
Castillo’s windpipe was generated using stem cells obtained from her bone marrow. Bone marrow stem cells have the potential to develop into a variety of different cells — in this case, they were used to develop cartilage cells. Castillo’s bone marrow stem cells were grown in a lab to produce nearly 6 million cartilage cells. The process of directing the stem cells to grow into a particular cell type is not that difficult. According to an article in the journal Materials Today, simply changing the media in which the cells are grown can cause them to form the desired cell type.
Once the cartilage cells were obtained, they needed to be grown on an appropriate support or scaffold to generate the entire organ. In Castillo’s case, a donor windpipe was used as the scaffold. The original windpipe was treated with a variety of chemicals in order to remove all of the original cells on the windpipe. What remained was a scaffold made up of a fibrous protein, collagen. Finally, the cartilage cells were allowed to grow on the scaffold in a special bioreactor. The resulting windpipe was transplanted into Castillo’s body. Castillo, whose original windpipe had become blocked and was causing her severe breathing problems, could breathe normally and resume a normal lifestyle after the transplant.
Although the procedure was successful and benefited Castillo, it was extremely expensive. Specifically, the use of the bioreactor to regenerate the entire organ increased the costs of the procedure by a large amount. However, as recently as last month, scientists have been able to replicate this procedure without the need of the expensive bioreactor.
Last month, doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London conducted a similar windpipe transplant in a 10-year-old boy. According to the report in the British publication The Times, the boy received a transplanted windpipe that was regenerated using his own stem cells. However, unlike Castillo’s transplant, the windpipe was not generated in a specialized bioreactor, but was regenerated within the boy’s body.
In this case, a donor windpipe was stripped of its original cells and was treated with the boy’s bone marrow stem cells. However, before the stem cells could completely grow on the scaffold, the windpipe was transplanted into the boy, making the boy’s body the “bioreactor” where the remaining growth could take place. A professor at the University College London was quoted in The Times article as saying that this procedure would now cost “tens of thousands of pounds rather than hundreds of thousands,” because the artificial bioreactor is no longer needed.
Although the procedure conducted on the British boy could help a number of patients worldwide in need of organ transplants, scientists worry that such a procedure could be extremely unpredictable. Laboratory generation of organs can be controlled to a much higher degree than organ generation within the human body. Hence, regeneration of organs within the body could lead to unexpected complications.

Facebook simplifies sharing
At Facebook’s annual conference last week, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder and CEO, announced the launch of “Open Graph” — an interactive social tool that will collect information about a person’s Facebook activities, such as the websites they visit and their favorite news stories or music, and share it with their Facebook friends.
According to Zuckerberg, this new social paradigm is “the most transformative thing” Facebook has created for the web.
Popular Facebook features such as “Like” buttons will now appear not just on Facebook.com, but also on several other sites, including blogs. With over 400 million members, Facebook hopes to enable its members to conveniently share their likes and dislikes without giving away any new information.

Water consumption assessed
To measure the impact of industrial decisions on water use, researchers at Carnegie Mellon studied water data from the United States Geological Survey conducted in 2000 and used an economic model to calculate direct and indirect water usage in over 400 industries.
Chris Hendrickson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering; Michael Blackhurst, a graduate student; and Jordi Sels i Vidal, a visiting researcher, concluded that most water is directly consumed by the power generation and agriculture industries.
They also found that most individual sectors use water indirectly, such as the refining process of cane sugar, which uses over 95 percent of its water indirectly to grow the cane, generate electricity for the mills, and ensure other industrial processes run smoothly.

Obama eyes Mars
By 2030, American astronauts should be able to set foot on Mars and return home safely, said Barack Obama during a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
As he laid out his new policy for the U.S. space agency, Obama announced that he plans to set “challenging goals” for NASA and provide the organization with the funding to deliver them. He will allocate an extra $6 billion to NASA over the next five years for the realization of this vision.
In addition, Obama asked for a “refocused” NASA that goes beyond Constellation — the current program to replace the space shuttle and the termination of which he announced in February.

Icelandic volcano subsides
Tucked under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in Iceland, the volcanic eruption that caused havoc among air travelers last week seems to have subsided, according to volcanologists.
While the volcano is still releasing small amounts of ash, it is doing so less explosively, they reported. As suggested by the scientists, a reduced flow of magma into the volcano chamber and the melting of most of the glacier closest to the volcano may be the main reasons.
Despite the positive signs, volcanologist Chris Waythomas of the U.S. Geological Survey warned that the situation may not be so stable, comparing it to volcanoes in Alaska. “Eruptions wax and wane, and sustained ash emissions don’t go on indefinitely,” he said. “You get explosive activity, it quiets down for a week or so, then it re-erupts again.”

With the semester nearing its end and summer on the horizon, students at Carnegie Mellon are racked with anticipation for their up-and-coming summer vacations. However, before our focus can switch from electrical circuits to sunblock and boogie boarding, students have one last hurdle to overcome: Final exams.
While for some, final exams are a chance to change that less-than-satisfactory mid-semester grade, for many others, finals are a stress-inducing burden intended only to compromise the hard work done thus far in the semester. Whether you will be regarding these exams as your saving grace or your ultimate inconvenience, use this guide to make sure you pass your exams with flying colors and make your transition into summer a pleasant one.
Study strategies
For many, the hardest thing about studying for a major exam is getting started. Will you take the long route and begin studying weeks in advance, dedicating an hour a day to your progress, or will you take the procrastination route and cram all your studying into the 48 hours before the exam? Whatever your intentions, make sure that you clearly map out your expected study schedule on some form of a calendar. Having all of your study plans clearly laid out before you will ensure that you don’t miss anything, and it will also make it more convenient for you to plan study parties, schedule group meetings, or scribble down all possible review sessions.
Sometimes, however, the issue isn’t a lack of planning, but rather a matter of location. With so many dedicated students at Carnegie Mellon, it can often be difficult to find a study location that truly is your own.
Firstly, be sure to avoid certain places. While your bedroom may seem like the obvious first choice for study sessions, keep in mind that unless you’re occupying a single, your roommate or roommates may be thinking the same thing. Furthermore, your dorm room is chock full of study distractions — how many times have you intended to study or complete an assignment in your room and instead been distracted by your room’s organization, the attractive “quick” nap, or your various forms of electronic entertainment? All in all, dorm rooms are a place for sleeping and hanging out with friends, and it is always dangerous to mix these pleasures with work.
While the floor lounge may seem like an attractive study option — it’s conveniently located, all of your friends are there, and the large space is comforting and non-threatening — think again. Depending on how many people also consider the lounge the perfect study option, this room can tend to get a little noisy. Also, friends are unfortunately the worst of the study distractions; while you may think that grouping together is a beneficial way to work through your exam outlines, you will realize just how often a friendly pair can get sidetracked. Moreover, most lounges, depending on your dorm, do not have desks or tables, and this can often inconvenience certain studiers.
While Hunt Library would seem like the most obvious place for studying to be done, this too may be a common exam misconception. Hunt offers students a plethora of study environments depending on which floor one may choose to occupy. While the first floor may seem like an attractive option with its Maggie Murph Café convenience and selection of tables, it is also the loudest of the library floors. Students who choose to study on the first floor often work in groups and talk loudly among themselves. Also, with all the hustle and bustle of the only 24-hour eating location on campus, you can bet that the busy atmosphere is incredibly distracting for some.
The basement of Hunt can actually be a good study option, but be aware that the chances of your reserving one of the private study rooms on this floor are slim to none during the weeks before finals. The basement, unfortunately, offers no natural light. While one may not immediately assume this to be a big deal, some students often lose track of time in windowless locations. The sun acts as nature’s alarm clock, letting you know with its movements when you have, in fact, spent way too much time on Facebook.
The third floor of Hunt offers an entirely different study atmosphere and is almost entirely silent, save for a few snores from exhausted studiers. While crouching in a cubicle in this muted area may be your cup of tea, for many students the third floor is actually just plain eerie.
The fourth floor of Hunt is another group study floor that has cubicles as well as a few tables. While there really isn’t anything significantly negative to say about this floor, let it be known that the space is extremely limited — if you’re planning on making this your study location, you had better find the optimal time for occupying a table or cubicle on this floor.
Looking for some unconventional study area choices? If you happen to be a first-year, the RAs in your dorm can surely suggest some lesser-known areas for studying. The RAs in Morewood E Tower hung a list of their favorite study areas for their residents: The list included the Cathedral of Learning, The University of Pittsburgh’s Hillman Library, Starbucks, Kiva Han, and the Panther Hollow Inn.
Wherever your study location choice, make sure your space has the study necessities: a table, a chair, a hole puncher, a printer, a stapler, and access to food, drink, and the occasional nap. While the warm weather may convince you to throw down a towel or soft comforter and camp out on the Cut or in Schenley Park, beware as these areas tend to be extremely busy and distracting.
Make sure that you maintain a regulated sleep schedule while studying for exams. Whether you are a fan of the short bursts of studying followed by the refreshing two-hour nap, or the 12-hour split, make sure that your body is properly adjusted to your schedule. Also keep in mind that your sleep schedule will probably continue into your exam week, so make sure that your sleeping patterns are not inconvenient for your scheduled testing times.
Limit your amount of caffeine intake during the early stages of your studying. Too much caffeine can throw off your sleep schedule, induce headaches, and make you dependent. Instead, save the caffeine for when you really need it; that way you can be sure that your double-shot espresso will pull through for you during your last-minute 24-hour cram session.
Rewarding your hard work
While looking forward to activities scheduled after exams may seem like the perfect distraction, it can, in fact, be extremely beneficial. Feeling largely unmotivated to study for exams? Plan an after-finals barbeque or picnic in Schenley Park and invite all of your friends on Facebook. Looking forward to a group get-together in the warm weather can act as an incentive for you to get through your studying smoothly and efficiently, and to own your exams come finals week.
Motivation can also be found in the form of reward. If you are questioning your motivation to study efficiently and master a subject, make yourself a bargain. If upon taking your exam you feel as though you knew the material sufficiently well and studied the subject as well as you personally could, then reward yourself! Throw a huge end-of-the-year party at your apartment or a friend’s house, take your best friends out for dinner on the Strip, or treat yourself to a delicious Rita’s ice in Squirrel Hill. If none of these options seem appealing, then why not just veg out for three straight days? Catch up on sleep and your favorite television shows, and rejoice in your complete lack of drive to do anything.
While the impending exams may seem daunting, remember that your entire experience will be completely dependent on your level of preparation. How stressful your exams will be is up to you. Start brainstorming, outlining, and highlighting as soon as possible to ensure your own exam security. By putting these tips and tricks to use, you can ensure that your exam experience will be as painless as possible.

The swarm of plaid button-downs and thick-rimmed glasses around Baker Hall last Friday night was a sure sign that something literary was going down. And sure enough, prose was recited, poetry performed, and bows dipped as the creative writing seniors of Carnegie Mellon performed a final reading together.
At 8 p.m., a group of seniors, faculty, and friends gathered in the Adamson Wing to listen to the collective work of senior writers. Before the performance, sophomore English major Elizabeth Harbaugh confessed high expectations of the upcoming reading. “I expect to be dazzled,” she declared. “No. I demand to be dazzled.”
And dazzling did occur. The reading began with senior creative writing major Tom Pike presenting samples of his poetry, which prompted both laughs and serious silences from the audience with its varied themes — among them, the origin of Fig Newtons.
Each student approached the podium and greeted the audience in their own unique way, before presenting their work and welcoming the next reader to the stage. Themes varied from the origins of life and snack foods to aggravating traveling partners and the proper way to dig a ditch.
Those performing were not limited to English-related majors: All seniors interested in poetry or prose were welcome to share their work. Senior Su Chu, a statistics major, presented her poem “Synch Sister.” Describing the themes and inspiration behind her work, she said: “I feel very strongly about people, and a lot of my work is inspired by the dynamics between the people who are close to me.”
As writer after writer stepped up to the podium, one got a sense of the finality of the event. That night, students and faculty came together to acknowledge the effort and hard work that occurred over the past four years.
Senior creative writing major John Lehmann felt the same sense of culmination at the event. “It’s good to hear everyone one last time — just for fun.” He remarked. “One last time outside of classes to see how something floats, and a chance to make a list of people I’m going to send my work to for criticism.”
The reading on Friday was the perfect way to celebrate four years of hard work, revision, and growth by sharing final words and work with fellow students and the mentors who guided each draft and scribble over the years. While this reading symbolizes the ending chapter for these writers at Carnegie Mellon, it also serves as an introduction to the future and their upcoming journeys to professional success.

Squirrel Hill has always been a convenient place for Carnegie Mellon students to get food and groceries. The neighborhood is close enough to campus that the trip is within walking distance; however, it is far enough to still take students away from the university atmosphere. With various restaurants, eateries, and cafés, one should also take time to remember the various sweet dessert options in Squirrel Hill that one can grab to go.
With so many places in such a small area, feel free to go to different places on Murray Avenue and compare the classics.
Dozen — Dozen has always had a permanent place in Squirrel Hill dessert discussions. Located conveniently near the corner of Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue, one can just go in and grab a cupcake to go — it’s that easy. Dozen is no longer just a cupcake shop, however, but a full-fledged bakery. From somewhat classic cupcakes to sumptuous-looking cinnamon rolls, the business is growing. Now, Dozen Bake Shops are all around Pittsburgh. Classics like vanilla vanilla, characterized by powdered sugar buttercream icing, will always hold promise. If you are a chocolate person, try the vegan mostess cupcake, a vegan chocolate cupcake with buttercream filling and frosted with chocolate ganache.
Gullifty’s Restaurant — Priding itself on a selection of award-winning desserts, Gullifty’s is truly the ultimate American restaurant. From humongous cakes to ostentatious key lime pies and different kinds of cheesecake, most diners are getting a meal rather than a simple dessert. Even if this restaurant is known for its desserts, the regular menu at Gullifty’s is definitely worth choosing from as well.
Gluuteny — Gluuteny is a wheat- and dairy-free bakery located right next to Giant Eagle. Although these treats are definitely not the desserts that most students are used to, from sugar cookies to brownies to bread, Gluuteny has something good for every eater. All of this bakery’s goodies are homemade, baked right at the store’s location.
Allegro Hearth Bakery — Hands down, this hearth sells some of the best breads in Pittsburgh. As for desserts, what you see is really what you get. From the shop’s in-house dessert tasting, the vanilla cupcake rates the highest. All cakes and bars are moist, sweet, fragrant, and messy — be ready to lick buttery buttercream off your fingers after you finish. If the sugar is getting to be too much, the salty baked baguettes sliced and sold in small bags by the register can relax your overwhelmed taste buds.
Rose Tea Café — There is a reason the Rose Tea Café is packed with Asians: Many students at Carnegie Mellon say they serve the best bubble tea, hands down. Since we are only talking about the classics, the café’s black milk tea will always hit the spot. One can walk in for a meal or just get bubble tea. Either way, the bubbles are made perfectly al dente, not too cooked or undercooked. However, if you are only getting bubble tea, make sure you have cash ready.
RazzyFresh Frozen Yogurt — RazzyFresh has some of the most-talked-about frozen yogurt around Pittsburgh. Why? Because they simply sell the best-tasting frozen yogurt. The same cannot be said about the condiments or the fruits chopped down to such a small scale that they really lose their purpose. Nonetheless, the self-serve style lets you get just what you want. At the end of the line, you can weigh your cup and pay. That way, you can get as much or as little of the condiments as you want. Taste aside, these yogurts are the most affordable as well. The only improvement I would suggest is a larger cup with a better lid. That way, customers can take more of the original tart frozen yogurt to stock up in a fridge.

It was the end of summer, and before I knew it I was no longer on the streets of Manhattan. A bus ride, an eight-hour flight, and a train ride later, instead of tall skyscrapers and bustling tourists I found myself surrounded by tall mountains, green open fields, a huge lake, and even some stray cows. I was in Switzerland. After a 45-minute train ride from Geneva, I reached my final destination, Lausanne — the second largest city on Lake Geneva in the French-speaking region of Switzerland. It was a Sunday afternoon and everything was closed: shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. The pristine and tranquil surroundings felt eerie after having left New York City the previous day. Moreover, how could there not be a restaurant open to find lunch?
After getting settled into my new apartment and meeting my suitemates — exchange students from London, Japan, and Tunisia — I prepared for the next day, which was the first day of language classes. Before I knew it, I was meeting ERASMUS (European exchange) students from Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. So many more new languages to learn!
Many students say “I really want to study abroad, but I can’t get credit for the classes I need and I won’t graduate on time!” It wasn’t easy, but as a junior in electrical and computer engineering, I knew I wanted to study abroad and at the same time not fall behind academically. I was in Switzerland during Fall 2009 at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and I still managed to get credit for my ECE classes (Semiconductors, Analog Circuits, Signals and Systems, and Electromechanics). The catch — my classes were all in French, and the last time I took a French class? Almost four years ago as a junior in high school. 
Within the first week of the three-week summer language classes, I found myself hiking in the Swiss Alps. A Swiss friend from EPFL was so hospitable that he invited a group of us to go hiking. After a few water breaks, time snacking on Swiss chocolate, and a grueling three hours of walking uphill through the mountain, we finally reached the top and the view was worth it. There was a huge lake — Lake Louvie — surrounded by green fields, and the mountain peaks on the other side were covered with snow, even during the middle of summer. There was even a quintessential Swiss log cabin at the top that served fondue. We took a stroll around the entire lake and I could not believe the gorgeousness of it all. I was in the middle of the Swiss Alps — snow, lake, mountains — the works. The descent was much easier and took us less than two hours. There were also hydro-powered dams at the base of the mountain area, since there were many waterfalls and streams. You can literally just drink the water from the streams on the mountain since it was cleaner than the water in a bottle of Evian (which was ironically a city across the lake from Lausanne).
If hiking in Switzerland wasn’t cliché enough, our Swiss friend invited us to his house for some traditional Swiss fondue, which his mom arranged for us. His parents were extremely friendly and hospitable, although they didn’t really speak any English. Needless to say, dining table conversation was a challenge. I don’t think I have ever concentrated so much during dinner. The entire time, we were speaking in French. His parents even began discussing local politics... in French. I was in the middle of Switzerland, in a Swiss family’s house, eating fondue as they discussed politics in French. It was all too surreal. I was waiting for some French teacher to push the stop button and ask listening comprehension questions such as “What was the main topic of this conversation? What was the father’s opinion? What did the son tell the mother in response to the argument?” But it never came. This was real. Nevertheless, the cheese fondue was amazing. What a satisfying end to a beautiful hiking weekend abroad.

It has been a great year in music so far. Many of the award shows gave us something to talk about and something to look forward to for next year, a few artists released comeback albums, and several people did some wild and crazy antics that may have either boosted their popularity or sent them to the bottom of the charts. In either case, the year is far from over, and the changes in music and weather have many anticipating the music scene for the summer months. Summer music is what you hear most — what people play in the car with the windows down, what is blasting from the boom box or headphones as they lay out on the beach, or what is playing from their iHome as they just hang out on the patio.
This summer, we can look forward to more album releases from various artists: American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken, Christina Aguilera, The Cringe, Hanson, Lil Jon, The Roots, Teenage Fanclub, Villagers, Ozzy Osbourne, Eminem, M.I.A., T.I., Stars, American Hi-Fi, Sarah McLachlan, and many others. CDs are released every Tuesday, so check when your favorite artists are releasing albums. Many haven’t had an album in a while, and others are steadily producing. In any case, there will be a plethora of music to listen to this summer.
If you are not the CD-buying type and more of the concert-going type, there are a bunch of music festivals across the country to take part in. Some are pretty costly and others are free. If you happen to be in the Chillicothe, Ill. area around the end of May, you can celebrate Memorial Day weekend at the Summer Camp Music Festival. Artists such as STS9, Yonder Mountain String Band, Keller Williams, Steel Pulse, Family Groove, Backyard Fire Tire, The New Mastersounds, Dumpstaphunk, and many others are scheduled to be in attendance. The three-day pass costs $150, a pre-party pass is $20, and there are VIP upgrades of various values. You can partake in a bunch of different workshops, and there is even a Kids’ Camp for the younger attendees — or maybe the older ones with a young spirit.
In Quincy, Wash., visit the Gorge from May 29 to May 31 for the Sasquatch Music Festival. Not only is the Gorge a beautiful place to visit with amazing scenery right on a lake, but the music festival gives you another reason to be around. Artists such as My Morning Jacket, Broken Social Scene, Public Enemy, MGMT, The Mountain Goats, Massive Attack, and more are listed to perform. Single tickets are $70 per day, but there are other options available for the big spender.
If those didn’t get your blood flowing, take a trip a little further south and head to Manchester, Tenn. from June 10 to June 13. Bonnaroo is sure to be an event that leaves the partygoers wanting more. You can expect to see Kings of Leon, Dave Matthews Band, Stevie Wonder, John Fogerty, Jay-Z, She & Him, Jeff Beck, The Flaming Lips performing “Dark Side of the Moon” by Pink Floyd, and many others. Ticket prices are $249 plus taxes and fees, but there are also yoga classes and a light show to accompany.
Another of the summer’s big festivals is the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans from July 2 to July 4. To be co-hosted by Steve Harvey and Nephew Tommy, this festival has scheduled some of the greatest names to take the stage. The three-day event takes place in the Superdome, and you can expect performances from Mary J. Blige; Alicia Keys; Janet Jackson; Jill Scott; Trey Songz; Charlie Wilson; Keri Hilson; Gladys Knight; Earth, Wind & Fire; Monica; LL Cool J; and so many others. And if that doesn’t get you going, there are empowerment seminars scheduled by Sheryl Lee Ralph, Rev. Al Sharpton, Steve Harvey, Hill Harper, and Tom Joyner, to name a few.
Many things happen in music every day, but the summer of 2010 is looking promising. Many artists have come out of hiding and are bringing back a sound we haven’t heard in a while or have never heard before. Take a chance and open your ears; get out and listen to the sounds of summer music.

This past Wednesday, students, faculty, and community members alike gathered in the Carnegie Mellon bookstore to celebrate the release of a faculty member’s book. Michael Mark Chemers, an assistant professor in the School of Drama and the founder and director of the school’s bachelor’s degree program in dramaturgy, released his newest book, Ghost Light: An Introductory Handbook for Dramaturgy.
Considered by many to be an essential book for all theater practitioners, Chemers’ book explains to readers exactly what dramaturgy is and what a dramaturg, or someone who studies dramaturgy, does.
All in all, it seems quite appropriate that a major like this one has found its way to Carnegie Mellon. In the theater world, dramaturgy is considered the science of drama. Those who study dramaturgy are involved in every step of the creative process, from directing to costuming to editing to cutting. A dramaturgy major learns the ropes of the entire theater process and uses that knowledge in the process of perfecting production.
Chemers explains the intricate studies of dramaturgy majors. Because it involves theater history and practice, critical theory, and world history, a dramaturgy major is an essential component of a production’s creative team.
The book’s Amazon profile explains how Ghost Light is divided into three parts. The first part of Chemer’s book explores the philosophy and history of dramaturgy, explaining what those who study the subject do. It also includes an explanation of the critical theories necessary to analyze texts associated with dramaturgy. The second part of the book explores the practice of dramaturgy and explains how the dramaturgy major can be used to collaborate with those involved with a production. The third part of the book is a guide for students: It includes a series of exercises and assignments that are classroom appropriate.
It’s always exciting when a Carnegie Mellon faculty member is honored through publication, but it’s especially wonderful to see a genre of theatrical studies emerge here at Carnegie Mellon. Hopefully, universities and students around the world will realize the benefits of dramaturgy and include this text in their study.

Dear Rohit,
I was recently caught by the police for public drunkenness. Besides this smear, I’m usually a model student. I get straight As, volunteer for charity regularly, and am even used as a role model by my adviser for incoming freshmen. How do I keep this red mark from invading my otherwise squeaky-clean image?
—Drunk with Regret
Dear Drunk,
To answer in short: You don’t. The fact of the matter is that you acted irresponsibly, and now you’re paying for it. While your first impulse may be to cover it all up, the more honorable thing to do is accept your mistake head on. You may get scolded by others, your adviser may stop using you as a role model for freshmen, but eventually, all the commotion about your citation will pass, and you can get back to your old lifestyle.
To be honest, chances are you’ll screw up again. Just make sure that when you make future mistakes, you try to learn something from them. I know I sound like an old man saying this, but now’s the time to make these mistakes. When we all grow up and are responsible for not only ourselves but many others, we won’t have the luxury of getting irresponsibly drunk. I hope you can get through these hard times with your chin up. Just remember, it’s a wonderful life, even when you’re caught drinking.
You’ll sober up,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I’m graduating this semester and I am in panic mode! I have no idea what life outside college is going to be like and, to be honest, I don’t think I am ready for it. Can you help me with this?
—Senioritis
Dear Senioritis,
Just relax. Thousands of students before you have graduated from this great institution of ours. Look at how successful they have been. If there’s one thing I have learned from Carnegie Mellon (aside from how to work abnormal hours and take a vacation that lasts less than 72 hours every four years), it’s that college has prepared me for challenges. Can it get much harder than it already is here?
I do realize that life will be more unpredictable once we graduate, but isn’t that what we’re preparing for? As far as friends and relationships go — just because you are not in college anymore does not mean that they will disappear from your life. If they are worth having, then they will always be there, and if not, life is about meeting new people every day and learning new things. Take a deep breath and I assure you that things will turn out just fine. Do, however, send me 10 percent of your earnings five years down the line for this great piece of advice!
**You are cured, **
—Rohit

In the hype of new music, it is often too easy to forget the small players that make an album great. People do not stay abreast with the most popular producers or the most revolutionary sound engineers. I doubt anyone can name the new-faced composer who has taken over music in the last year. People should be more aware of the faces behind their favorite albums. People should know about Nico Muhly.
Muhly is a Western composer who has been responsible for some of the most interesting music this decade. The proof is in his album Mothertongue, with its highly experimental work on tracks like “Skip Town.” 
Muhly has a wonderful style that cannot be replicated, much less described in words. He is one of this decade’s most important musicians, and unfortunately, no one knows about him.
Many people would point to Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimist as one of this year’s better albums, and looking forward, many people are also anticipating The National’s new album, High Violet, to be the rock album of the decade. Muhly has, predictably enough, a distinct presence on both of these albums. 
It would be no small exaggeration to say that Muhly is responsible for the compositional brilliance of Veckatimist. In terms of The National, Muhly produced one of the most innovative arrangements ever heard with his work in the song “So Far Around the Bend” on The National’s Dark Was the Night. Looking at High Violet, we can expect much of the same magnificence with the track “Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks,” thanks to Muhly’s distinct retooling.
People should be more aware of the faceless composers and musicians behind the greatest albums of the last decade. When thinking of The National and Grizzly Bear, people should think of Muhly. Most great bands I know have been helped along by a brilliant composer at some point or another; it’s time that we look at these composers in their own right.

The Cove
Thursday, April 29
8 10 12
Documentary Thursday continues this week with The Cove, a 2009 Academy Award-winning film. The documentary is about dolphins, though not at all in a cute way, but rather in a much sadder and tragic way. The crew infiltrates a cove near Taijii, Japan to reveal horrific instances of animal abuse perpetrated by the Japanese whaling industry. The movie follows Ric O’Barry, who famously trained the Flipper dolphins, as he documents the dolphin hunting operations that some Japanese fishermen try desperately to hide from the public eye.
Pink Prison
Friday, April 30
Stay Tuned for Times
It’s TBA time, folks. The movie this semester is a dreamy Danish erotic film for women, though men will surely enjoy it. Pink Prison follows a news reporter as she breaks into a men’s penitentiary to win a bet. That may sound like a flimsy plot, but this flick was actually a big success overseas and turns a whole bunch of porn-film perceptions upside down in the process. Be sure to take your friends if you go watch Pink Prison, because if there’s anything that will bring a group of guys and girls together, it’s a good old-fashioned Carnegie Mellon tradition.
Transamerica
Saturday, May 1
8 10 12
ALLIES partners with AB Films this week to bring you Transamerica. Felicity Huffman stars in this 2005 dramedy as a transgendered woman who goes on a road trip with her long-lost 17-year-old son, whom she fathered before she became a woman. Crazy, ain’t it? The movie received fairly positive reviews, including many for Huffman’s performance as the lead. The mother/son road trip acts as a personal journey for both, where they experience self-discovery and all that other mushy stuff. So if you’re into good films that reference vaginoplasty, this is one for you.
The Number 23
Sunday, May 2
8 10 12
In Jim Carrey’s only — and hopefully last — foray into suspense thrillers, he stars as an animal control officer married to Virginia Madsen, a cake shop owner. Carrey discover a book in a used-book store written by a man obsessed with the number 23 and, along with the book, inherits the author’s obsession. The movie itself received mixed reviews, as Carrey is often perceived as a strictly comedic author. Personally, if Jim Carrey just performed Liar, Liar on stage for the rest of his life, I think everyone would be perfectly happy.

100 Years Ago
April 27, 1910
The Tech baseball team triumphed over Denison this week after a game-winning single in the bottom of the ninth. However, this apparently wasn’t enough to save the program as a whole, as we no longer have a varsity baseball team.
50 Years Ago **
**April 27, 1960
In the article “Tech Installs The Latest In Computers,” one author discusses a computer purchased by Carnegie Tech that was capable of a whopping 50,000 computations a second. I don’t know what that means, but some CS major is probably laughing really hard right now.

An ad for the film 2010 appears in this issue as a film AB is premiering for free on campus. With a subtitle of “the year we make contact,” it seems like our 2010 could end up getting pretty crazy if things work out like they did in the film.

A structure near the Purnell Center on the Cut was erected recently, celebrating the University’s centennial. Just like “Walking to the Sky,” it too is phallic shaped, albeit to a smaller extent. I am happy to see that Carnegie Mellon is drawing connections through its choice of campus art.

A hacker apparently attacked computers in the Tepper School of Business in the past couple weeks, possibly compromising the information of up to 6000 students. I wouldn’t be worried; it was probably just some CS student who changed everyone’s name to Optimus Prime.

WRCT celebrated its 60th anniversary of being a radio station this year and consistently being at the forefront of music technology. Good thing WRCT didn’t honor their heritage by playing tunes from the 1950s... because apparently that’s the era I get my jokes from.

Your summer will be wet in every way. Rain will leak through the seams of your house, the lining of your jacket, and the soles of your shoes. Your fish tank will soak your living room. You will yearn for the desert.
Your friend will invite you on a road trip. Somewhere in Montana you will find a boarded-up town, break into what was once a theater, and re-enact Richard III on the dusty stage. The ghost will be real.
As hard as you might try, you will be unable to escape Pittsburgh. The local iron and steel will bind you to the bridges and skyscrapers as if your body were a magnet. You will give up and don a Stillers jersey.
You will arrive at your internship to realize it pays twice as much as you had expected. You will also realize they gave it to someone else.
You will be employed as a barista. Try as you might, you will never be hipster enough: Your jeans will be too loose and you won’t know any of the correct obscure bands. Each night, you will lack the motivation to even cut yourself.
You will move 2500 miles away from a friend. The distance might actually hurt.
You will fly to Iceland to go volcano climbing. The beauty of the landscape will consume you. You will stay forever and never be missed.
You will visit San Francisco and have sex with a one-legged woman. Afterwards, you will notice the tattoo on her shoulder that says "Once, Always."
To plan your summer you will visit a fortune teller, who will advise you to base your summer adventures on this horoscope.
Your summer will be exactly one-third as awesome as you currently expect. Adjust your expectations accordingly.
Your summer job as a communications expert will involve you learning Morse code. Another invaluable skill for your résumé.
You will discover that you are actually a dragonfly. This will concern you greatly, but you will return to Carnegie Mellon in the fall with a renewed motivation.

President Barack Obama addressed an invitation-only audience in Carnegie Mellon’s Wiegand Gymnasium on Wednesday, June 2. Though Barack and Michelle Obama visited Carnegie Mellon during the 2008 election campaign, this event marked the President’s first visit to campus since being elected. His speech focused on the economy and a sustainable energy future, including the progress his administration has made thus far and the goals he has for the coming years. For a transcript of the President’s remarks, visit http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-economy-carnegie-mellon-university.

Gina Casalegno, interim director of the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) and previous director of Student Activities, was interviewed on Tuesday for the dean of Student Affairs position.
Four candidates were previously identified through a search that began in late January and that was assisted by the search firm Isaacson Miller. The process was opened to the campus community April 20–29 through a series of town hall meetings, as mentioned in a previous article published in the April 26 edition of The Tartan. The remaining candidates have been notified that an internal candidate, Casalegno, has come forward late in the process and is currently also under consideration. Casalegno served as part of the Student Affairs leadership team that was present at the prior interviews.
In response to Casalegno's recent candidacy, a fifth town hall meeting was held Tuesday, May 25. In a nearly full Danforth Lounge, Casalegno spoke of her experience and deep connection from the eight years she has spent learning to "know and love CMU" as well as why she had only applied for the position the week before. She expressed trepidation toward taking on the role of dean of Student Affairs and filling the much-loved position previously held by Karen Boyd, Dick Tucker, Jennifer Church, and Michael Murphy. She also cited concerns about balancing the role with her family life.
Through conversations with Murphy, who is now vice president for Campus Affairs, Casalegno realized she had come to a point where the deanship made sense. Describing herself as someone who always leaves positions "kicking and screaming" because she knows she "still has things to learn and more to give," she said she was now at the point where she could stand before the campus community ready for the role.
During Tuesday's town hall meeting, Casalegno fielded questions on emergency response preparations, her vision for the Division of Student Affairs, the legacies that Church and Murphy created as deans, the college liaison model, parent involvement, Carnegie Mellon's relationship with Pittsburgh, and issues of school spirit. She handled these questions with a sure understanding of the idiosyncrasies of Carnegie Mellon, addressing almost every student, faculty, and staff member in the room by name.
Throughout the meeting she openly discussed her unconventional, late candidacy, her experiences in Residence Life, Student Activities, her current involvement with the CPDC, and her family's role in her life. She concluded by stating that "you make choices and you prioritize," but kept returning to the excitement she feels whenever she describes the student experience at such an "authentic, genuine place."
Editor's Note: Gina Casalegno served as the adviser for The Tartan until fall 2009.

“I pee in the shower.” 
“I flick boogers at my roommate’s stuff when she’s too loud and wakes me up in the morning.” 
“When I’m in a crowded elevator I envision the porn scene that could ensue.” 
“I tell people I’m an atheist, but I believe I’m going to hell.” 
These are just a small sampling of the 500,000 secrets that people have written on postcards and sent to the home of Frank Warren, a man known as “the most trusted stranger in America.” 
Warren, creator and curator of the PostSecret project, introduced himself to several hundred students and community members on Monday, April 26 in Wiegand Gym, saying: “Hi. My name is Frank, and I collect secrets.” 
Warren began collecting secrets in 2004, when he handed out 3000 self-addressed postcards to strangers in Washington, D.C. and invited them to send him a secret: something that was true and they had never shared before. “Slowly, secrets began to find their way to my mailbox,” Warren told The Tartan. He claims that the idea of submitting to PostSecret “spread virally,” and within the first month of the project, he had received enough secrets to begin posting them on the Web. Since January 2005, Warren has shared the unvoiced secrets of people from around the world on his blog, postsecret.blogspot.com. 
With postcards arriving at his mailbox at a rate of over 1000 per week, Warren has gotten to know his mail carrier, Kathy, pretty well. “She’s a supporter of the project,” he said. Warren recalled an occasion when a fan stopped Kathy in the middle of her delivery route and asked for her autograph. Throughout the years, Kathy has delivered people’s secrets scrawled on sonograms, death certificates, a fake banana, real potatoes, complimentary bags of coffee, and even a bag from the fast food chain In-N-Out Burger. “The real gifts for me are the secrets.... I still feel like a kid Christmas morning walking out to my mailbox everyday and finding these gifts,” Warren said.
During his lecture at Carnegie Mellon, Warren explained that there are two types of secrets: secrets we keep from others, and secrets we keep from ourselves. “When we think we’re keeping a secret, that secret is actually keeping us.” He urged the audience members to face their own secrets: the parts of their lives that they sometimes prefer to bury down deep inside. He also urged people to free their secrets and to share them with others. Warren confided that he is now thankful for his struggles when he was younger, because “each one of them allowed me to develop my character as an adult now.” 
Junior creative writing major Laura Alfonso, who has had one of her submissions posted on Warren’s blog, said she appreciates the authenticity of PostSecret: “I think it’s about how honest people are — funny, silly, embarrassing, heartbreaking. There is a level of transparency there and honesty that you don’t really get from people a lot of times. I think what I look for in writing and art is a level of connection to people when we realize that everyone is just a person; we all have a lot in common.”
While many secrets that people submit to PostSecret are humorous, others are personal and dark. 
Warren cited “staggering statistics” about the secrets that are often overlooked by media and popular culture. He receives an overwhelming number of secrets on the topics of loneliness, depression, and suicide. Warren has volunteered for Hopeline, and the PostSecret website’s “Wellness Resources” page currently provides contact information for 10 different crisis counseling hotlines. 
After telling the story of his own PostSecret start, Warren asked the audience in Wiegand Gym, “What’s your crazy idea?... My hope is that someone in this room will maybe make the world a little bit better.”
His advice to students: “If you’re thinking about creating a blog, it’s a fantastic way to exercise your writing ability, your communication techniques.... Do it to explore one of your passions and find that other community out there that shares your passion. That can lead to something a lot more magical than just making a good income from a blog.” 
Warren said that he has never taken a single dollar for an advertisement. Although the PostSecret site has received over 300 million hits, it is still ad-free. In addition to his blog, Warren has compiled and published five books filled with unvoiced secrets that people have shared with him. His most recent book, Confessions on Life, Death, & God, was released on Oct. 6, 2009.

When faculty members leave Carnegie Mellon, it is often instructive to reflect on what they’ve achieved throughout their tenure at the university. Indira Nair, who will be retiring from her position as vice provost for education after 32 years of service at Carnegie Mellon, is no exception.
Nair was born in Trivandrum, Kerala in southern India. Since her father was a member of the army, she moved a total of 10 times before completing 12 years of education. She attended the Institute of Science in Bombay, completing her bachelor’s degree in physics. She then moved to the United States and received her master’s degree from Kansas State University and, later, her Ph.D. at Northwestern University.
Nair first arrived in Pittsburgh with the intention of pursuing a career as a high school physics teacher. After spending several years teaching not only physics but also other sciences, including chemistry and geology, she took a small job in the engineering and public policy department here at Carnegie Mellon. Eventually, she joined the Office of the Provost and accepted her current role as the vice provost for education.
At Carnegie Mellon, the provost is the chief academic adviser at the university and is one of the most powerful positions outside the university’s president. The provost oversees all of the faculty and deans in the various schools. One of the major offices underneath the provost is that of the vice provost for education, which has several organizations of its own working beneath it.
“The curriculum itself is divided on a department level, but I look at common needs,” Nair said from her office in Warner Hall. “[I ask my department] what can we do to enhance that experience.”
Beneath Nair is a host of different organizations aimed at making education an integral part of the school and community. The Leonard Gelfand Center, for example, is part of the vice provost’s responsibility and focuses on educational outreach. “Carnegie Mellon reaches 10,000 students every semester,” Nair said. One program within the center is C-MITES, helping to foster math and science skills in gifted students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Classes are taught during the summer for these students, and in the years to come, students from Qatar will also begin attending these classes.
Other important offices under Nair are the assistant provost for graduate education and the director of Undergraduate Research and Fellowship Resources.
Nair has helped organize several large projects aimed at enriching the undergraduate experience. 
One of these programs, Odyssey, is aimed at college sophomores and what they will do with their scholarship to fulfill their citizenship duties. The faculty nominates students that they find to be intellectual seekers and host a three-day workshop right before spring semester.
Another project is the acclaimed University Lecture Series, which runs year-round. Every Monday and Thursday, the faculty invites accomplished individuals — sometimes faculty, sometimes guests — to give a lecture about whatever topic they are currently working on. A recent speaker, Allan Meltzer of the Tepper School of Business, discussed the Federal Reserve and money supply in the United States.
Nair has also made revolutions in courses offered at Carnegie Mellon, beginning with a course titled India Today, a weekend course worth only three units but requiring over 40 hours of class time and writing papers. Iit was first created in fall 2008 in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, and the class studies different countries every year, including China, Brazil, and Russia. “These countries are considered the most emerging countries today,” Nair said.
Qatar has also been a target of interest for Nair since she arrived. Her course Global Issues, Local Solutions, created in the spring of 2009, addressed the question of how to solve global problems depending on a country’s current economic, political, or geographic situation. Recently, Carnegie Mellon hosted the Global Issues, Global Solutions conference, which further addressed these issues.
Nair’s role as chair of the University Education Council has also been influential. The council’s role to approve university-wide courses has been an important one; thanks to Nair and the council, interdisciplinary classes on urban farming and materials science, energy, and the environment are now available.
Nair has a great respect for interdisciplinary action. “Different disciplines are different lenses,” Nair said. “The same thing you’re thinking, someone else is thinking from a different perspective.” To help with interdisciplinary relations, Nair helped to organize 1905 = mc2: Photons and Relativity, a course focused on studying how different ideas in science developed.
Other faculty members have praised Nair’s influence across all areas of the university. “Indira’s service to the Pittsburgh and global community, to science education, and to Carnegie Mellon’s history and its future are immeasurable,” said Provost Mark Kamlet, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release.
“Her passion is  contagious,” said history professor Nico Slate. Slate, who first met Nair in August 2009 through other faculty members of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, found a mutual interest in India and undergraduate education. Several of the students in one of Slate’s history courses raised funds for an environmental project in India, and the money was donated in Nair’s name. “It’s been a real honor working with her,” Slate concluded.
For the students she is leaving behind, Nair offers these words of advice: “Look around and find opportunities.” She points to the rising number of Carnegie Mellon students taking a foreign language as a positive sign of inter-school participation. She also advises acting on these opportunities. “If you have an idea,” she asserted, “you can find a way to carry it out.”
After retiring, Nair plans to move to New Mexico to be closer to her two daughters. She said she plans to do much “thinking, writing, and reading.”

After much anticipation, the 2010 commencement speaker was announced last Friday. Ian Rawson, the managing director of Haiti’s Hôpital Albert Schweitzer, will give the keynote address.
Rawson has many ties to the Pittsburgh area. He is a long-time resident of the city and has a Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in medical anthropology. In addition to earning a bachelor’s degree in political science from the American University of Beirut, Rawson also attended Harvard University’s School of Public Health executive program in health planning and administration.
Additionally, Rawson has specific ties to the Carnegie Mellon community. Rawson has been an adjunct professor in the Heinz College and an advisory board member of TechBridgeWorld.
Rawson’s involvement in Haiti stems from his parents’ interests in the country. Rawson’s stepfather and mother, William Larimer Mellon, Jr. and Gwen Grant Mellon, dedicated their lives to improving the quality of life in Haiti after being inspired by Albert Schweitzer’s exemplary efforts in central Africa. The Mellons founded Hôpital Albert Schweitzer in 1956. Rawson was the board chair of the hospital before becoming the managing director.
“Ian Rawson has led the Hôpital Albert Schweitzer in Haiti for many years,” University President Jared Cohon said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “He has worked tirelessly and literally non-stop since the devastation of the January earthquake to treat the injured and to care for thousands of refugees. His is a story of leadership and selfless dedication that will inspire and motivate us to respond to the challenges facing the world.”
Student reactions to the announcement are diverse. Senior electrical and computer engineering major Arda Orhan simply responded, “I don’t care.” Eric Blood, a senior mechanical engineering major, had a slightly disappointed reaction. “I was not excited because I usually look forward to someone that isn’t affiliated with campus,” Blood said. “People affiliated with campus, we can see them at lecture series or classes. I’m sure he’s qualified, but I was looking forward to someone from the outside.” 
Amy Maples, a senior chemical engineering and engineering and public policy major, was uncertain about the university’s choice. “I think that a politician or comedian is a better choice because they give speeches for a living. But I don’t know anything about him, so I can’t say.”
Carnegie Mellon’s 113th commencement ceremony is set for May 16 at 11 a.m. in Gesling Stadium.

For the 23rd year, Larry Cartwright’s Design and Construction course is working to improve the campus landscape. While right now the class’s work site is still a maze of yellow caution tape, wooden supports and frames, and a mass of moved earth, this is only the beginning of the park space that it will become.
This year’s project aims to memorialize Bill Brown, a professor in the biology department who died in July 2007. (Read more at www.thetartan.org/2007/4/30/news/brown.) 
Francesca Fenzi, a sophomore in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program, described the “focus of the space to be on collaboration, as this is something that Bill advocated.” The space, slated to be finished by commencement, is a two-tiered patio network based off a polygon design inspired by Brown’s work in biology. The space, which is just off the Mall, in front of Doherty Hall, will have benches and a table for students to sit, read, discuss, work, and most importantly collaborate. 
Christopher Donlon, a senior in civil engineering and the on-site student foreman, said, “I think it is important for students to leave their mark on CMU’s campus ... and it’s an honor to be involved in this class and particular project.”
Students in Cartwright’s class have been leaving their mark on campus since the course’s first project in 1988. This project was the construction of a retaining wall and driveway for the Robotics Institute and was budgeted at only $3000. Over the last two decades, the projects have grown in scope and design freedom. In recent years projects have been more commonly allotted budgets in the $25,000 to $50,000 range and have included the Doherty stairs, Scotty’s Corner, both the Simon and Newell Memorials, and the WQED footbridge. Many of these sites have been completely absorbed into the fabric of campus, and it is likely that many campus community members are completely unaware that they represent the tireless work of Cartwright’s class over the last 23 years.
Fenzi said the site “in front of Scaife is probably my favorite, but also the most hidden,” while Donlon spoke highly of the Simon Memorial — a seating area and workspace set into the ground outside Baker Hall that was built in 2002. 
“It fits so well into the CMU landscape and if you did not look close you would never notice it,” said Donlon. He also said “the class of 2008 did a great job with the deck added to the materials science department outside of Wean and Doherty on the Gates side.”
Ralph Horgan, Carnegie Mellon’s associate vice provost for Campus Design and Facility Development, says that “from a pragmatic perspective, Larry and his students have created low-cost improvements to public spaces on campus.” 
Instead of requiring millions of dollars to be donated for construction, departments can entrust Cartwright and his students to improve a small part of campus, and give it a specific purpose like the Mellon College of Science has with their memorial to Brown.
Horgan said that when members of his team at Campus Design and Facility Development give tours of campus and they come across many of Cartwright’s projects, people inevitably question the decision to let students design and construct permanent projects. Horgan’s response: “We encourage it, because it’s Larry and his fourth year class. It’s part of the DNA here; we still make things.”
The class and its mission, which Horgan sees as part of the very essence of Carnegie Mellon, is firmly supported by the students. Donlon agreed, “this class is different from any other class I have ever taken at CMU and the hands on experience and learning is unbelievable,” he said. “It is a time commitment, but I enjoy spending time getting dirty and using some elbow grease.”
Fenzi also knows the course is unique, and while she wishes that more students could have these sorts of opportunities, she was quick to remind me that students can still have this opportunity as “Larry’s teaching the class next year so it’s not too late!”

Carnegie Mellon is in the process of searching for a new dean of Student Affairs after the previous dean, Karen Boyd, resigned in December to finish her Ph.D. dissertation. The school is working with executive search firm Isaacson, Miller, and the search has been narrowed down to four candidates. Carnegie Mellon is expected to conclude the search and appoint its new dean of Student Affairs by this summer.
In the meantime, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy now serves as the interim dean of Student Affairs and has kept the school community informed about the search committee’s and Isaacson, Miller’s efforts.
“One of the values of the process is making sure that we get as many perspectives as possible in the selection of our new dean,” said Murphy. “It is essential that the dean has a real appreciation for the special climate here and the deep sense of commitment and collaborative spirit that is such a part of this place. Certainly, someone who will genuinely care for and about students, and someone who will embrace the opportunity to immerse themselves in the day-to-day life of the campus.”
At Isaacson, Miller, Vice President Vivian Brocard and Senior Associate Ponneh A. Varho detail similar requirements in the job description on the company’s website: “While first-rate administrative skills are essential for success in this role, the ideal candidate will possess an educator’s passion and an abiding commitment to the individual that will contribute to the lifelong welfare and success of each student.”
Within the last two years, Carnegie Mellon has had four individuals in the role of dean of Student Affairs. This progression started in 2008 when then dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church resigned after two years of service. 
“When Jennifer Church left unexpectedly, we were fortunate that Dick Tucker agreed to serve as interim dean of Student Affairs for a year,” Murphy said. 
In July 2009, the university named Boyd as the new permanent dean. However, Boyd resigned after only six months of service in December that year.
“The fact that we are in a new search so soon is unfortunate, but everyone has stepped up, including students, which I appreciate enormously. That said, it will be terrific to have the new dean on board this summer,” Murphy said.
Murphy strongly urged students to attend the upcoming town meetings for each of the four finalists, at which students will be given the opportunity to meet and ask questions of the candidates.
“The four finalists are great. The committee has done a very good job of selecting from an impressive and competitive national applicant pool,” Murphy said. “The candidates are all very excited about this opportunity, and appreciate what an important role this is on our campus.”
However, after having been through this experience before, some students are less than enthusiastic.
“I know it may sound shallow, but I think at this point, it’s hard to get personally attached [to a new dean],” sophomore business administration major Lillian Su said. “I’m really just hoping that he or she will be able to boost our ratings,” said Su, referring to Carnegie Mellon’s Greek and social life ratings, which are typically relatively low compared to ratings in academic categories.
A sophomore computer science major, Michael Arntzenius, attended the town meeting last Tuesday remarked “I think what the university is just looking for right now is someone who is going to stay… [the candidate] had an impressive resume, but can they really promise that they will stay at this school in particular?”
For now, personal information about any of the four candidates has not yet been released to the public.
“We are not announcing the names, just to maintain some level of confidentiality for the candidates,” explained Murphy. “But of course anyone who participates in the open process will meet them and receive a copy of their resumes.”
The remaining three town hall meetings are scheduled for April 26, April 28, and April 29. These will take place in Danforth Lounge.

Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh co-hosted the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS) Northeast Regional Conference this past weekend. The conference was a meeting of schools in the region to discuss best practices, programs, social events, and national issues that concern graduate students across the country.
The conference began with an open-to-the-public lecture in David Lawrence Hall by Jorge Cham, a Stanford graduate who produces the popular comic Piled Higher and Deeper. Piled Higher and Deeper, or PhD for short, details the often comedic yet tragic lives of graduate students. Afterward, Cham signed books at a barbecue hosted in front of the William Pitt Union.
P.J. Dillon, a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh and the current vice president of communications of the university’s Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA) was very happy with the turnout for the event. “To have the graduate student community really come out, having them hear him talk and laugh, and migrate to the food—it kind of carried over that good vibe and allowed us all to mingle on the grass with good weather,” Dillon said.
Saturday was the main business day for the conference. Jason Heustis of Tufts University, who is the NAGPS Northeast Regional chair, kicked off the conference with an overview of the organization and the regional status. After this report and breakfast, 12 seminars were held throughout the day, including talks on lobbying and advocacy, community-building activities, building better websites, health insurance, employment concerns, and internal funding management. 
Alex Evans, a Ph.D. student in geophysics at MIT and the current president of NAGPS, was also at the event. Evans discussed how regional conferences are an excellent forum for dealing with graduate student issues. “A lot of the issues we deal with are local, and this provides us an opportunity to discuss those issues and effect change at a regional level,” Evans said.
Saturday’s evening activities took the conference to Harris Grill for a “Pittsburgh-style” dinner, followed by Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) hosted wine-tasting. Jon Kowalski, a doctoral student in engineering and public policy and Carnegie Mellon GSA’s vice president of external affairs and current director of finance for NAGPS, said “this conference is a fantastic opportunity for us to showcase our premier social event of the year to graduate student governments all over the northeast.” GSA’s wine-tasting is an annual event held at the PPG Aquarium.
On Sunday, the conference hosted another installment of GPSA’s popular series “Pancakes & Politics” with Allegheny County Council President Rich Fitzgerald. Following the event was the regional business meeting and a closing lunch. Carnegie Mellon GSA President and Ph.D. student in engineering and public policy, Carolyn Denomme, was glad that Pittsburgh was able to host the conference. “The regional conference is a great way to network with other graduate student leaders and to learn how the services that Carnegie Mellon and our GSA provide to graduate students compare to other institutions and help us improve that.”
Kowalski, who served as one of the conference co-chairs was pleased that the conference was a success and was glad that Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh found “another great opportunity to collaborate.”

Janine Antoni
Tuesday, April 27 at 5 p.m.
Kresge Theatre
The School of Art presents Janine Antoni, who blurs the distinction between performance art and sculpture. She transforms everyday activities like eating, bathing, and sleeping into a way of making art. The main tool she uses in her creations is her own body. Previous pieces have included cubes of lard and chocolate chiseled with her teeth or brainwave signals recorded from her dreams applied as a pattern for weaving a blanket. Antoni’s one-of-a-kind work has been displayed in prestigious galleries and museums including the Guggenheim and the Whitney in New York, as well as the Reina Sofia in Madrid.
2010 Buhl Lecture: Viruses “From Scratch”
Wednesday, April 28 at 4:30 p.m.
Mellon Institute Auditorium, 4400 Fifth Ave.
Everyone knows how deadly viruses like influenza, hepatitis, and AIDS can be. Viruses are arguably the most prevalent and deadly disease agents. However, there are some people who see these as the most beautiful, symmetric, and astonishing structures in biology. In this lecture, William Gelbart, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCLA, discusses viruses from a physical point of view, emphasizing their unique simplicity and what they all have in common. The most minimal ones consist of just two different kinds of molecules and are simple enough that they can be made “from scratch” in a test tube. Gelbart will also talk about why viruses were only discovered a hundred years ago and what allows them to evolve faster than any living organism.
Caught Looking 3
Wednesday, April 28 at 7 p.m.

EPA honors green purchases
The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Green Power Partnership, started in April 2006, tracks colleges and universities with the highest green power purchases among collegiate athletic conferences. 
The Individual Conference Champion Award recognizes the school that has made the largest purchase of green power within a qualifying conference. Carnegie Mellon University has been recognized as the 2009–2010 Individual Conference Champion, meaning that the university uses more green power than any other school in its division (the University Athletic Association).
This year, Carnegie Mellon purchased almost 87 million kilowatt-hours of green power. This purchase represents 75 percent of the school’s annual electricity usage. The EPA estimates that this purchase is equivalent to the carbon dioxide emitted by the electricity use in 8000 average American homes each year or taking nearly 12,000 passenger cars off the road annually.
Carnegie Mellon’s contribution represents the majority of the UAA’s collective green power purchases, with 87 million of more than 92 million kilowatt-hours of green power. Other members of the UAA include the University of Rochester, Brandeis University, Case Western Reserve University, and Emory University. Member universities are located in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Ohio, and New York.
All colleges and universities are invited to enter the challenge. For more information, visit www.epa.gov/greenpower/initiatives/cu_challenge.htm.
Students to attend nationals
Carnegie Mellon’s Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) will be attending a national competition in Minneapolis, Minn. from May 11 to May 13 after winning a regional competition in Philadelphia in the spring.
In three corporate topic competitions, SIFE also placed in the top 20 as national finalists to receive $3000 in prizes.
 The awards were provided by the Robert Half International Success Skills Competition, the HSBC Financial Literacy Competition, and the Sealed Air Business Ethics Competition.
To gain this honor, 11 projects were completed by 225 Carnegie Mellon SIFE students, revolving around the six pillars of SIFE, for a total of 7880 hours of service for the past year. 
The six pillars are market economics, success skills, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, business ethics, and environmental sustainability. Some of the 11 projects included Project Pulse, Project Nicaragua, Project Panama, Eco-market, Global Economy, and Global Threads. 
Coached by Anthony Stanton, a teaching professor of graphic media in the Tepper School of Business, students from all seven colleges at Carnegie Mellon are represented, and, according to SIFE’s website, the team has quickly grown from a “rookie” to competing on the national level. 
On a global scale, over 1500 universities in 40 countries actively participate in SIFE .

This past week, a new record was set for the Boston Marathon. This race is one of the most notable events in the running world. The Boston Marathon is the world’s oldest marathon and is one of the five World Marathon Majors.
Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot of Kenya set the record. This 22-year-old is definitely a force to be reckoned with, as he has finished fifth or better in the four marathons that he has competed in. Here are some facts and figures about the new champion and the classic race.
Year of the first Boston Marathon: 1897
Distance of Boston Marathon: 26.22 miles
Cheruiyot's record-breaking time: 2:05:22
Reward for first-place winner: $175,000
Of the past 20 Boston Marathons, the number of times a Kenyan has won: 18

A relatively small group of Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh leaders watched as President Barack Obama delivered an address in Wiegand Gym on Wednesday, June 2. Though I, like most students, was not in Pittsburgh for the event (and would not have received an invitation anyway), reading the transcript of the President’s remarks impressed upon me a disappointing fact: The candidate who spoke of the audacity of hope has, as President, adopted too many of the worst aspects of Washington politics.
As I read Obama’s address, I was dismayed by the overwhelmingly partisan rhetoric he used, particularly in the first half. While a post-partisan society is likely impossible and at the very least many years away, candidate Obama seemed able to focus more on a hopeful future than a disappointing present. Despite the ostensible theme of Wednesday’s speech being on building a foundation for the future, I saw mostly a series of attacks on the Republican Party.
Of course, it might have been hard to tell that Obama was criticizing the Republicans, since he refused to utter their name for almost the entirety of his 40-minute address. While there are over 20 references to “the other party” or “they” (pointedly referring to said other party), there are a grand total of two times that the word “Republican” was said. Mr. President, I know who the other party is, and I know you do, too. Not saying their name won’t make them go away. I’m sorry. The same holds true for “the previous administration.” This may be a common trick used by speechwriters, but Obama should set a higher standard.
The President’s hide-and-seek game with the word “Republican” unfortunately was not the only embarrassingly partisan occasion in his speech. Toward the middle of the address, Obama said, “But to be fair, a good deal of the other party’s opposition to our agenda has also been rooted in their sincere and fundamental belief about the role of government.... It’s [a belief] that basically offers two answers to every problem we face: more tax breaks for the wealthy and fewer rules for corporations.” I think the White House speechwriters have a different dictionary than I. Last time I checked, none of the definitions of “fair” is equivalent to oversimplifying one’s opponents’ position to absurdity.
Partisan rhetoric did not comprise all of Wednesday’s address. Yet even when Obama discussed his accomplishments and plans for the future, the ideas seemed stale and weak. This was a defensive speech couched as forward-looking. At this stage, almost nobody believes that fossil fuels are a long-term energy solution. Cap-and-trade legislation — one way of taxing carbon emissions — has been part of the President’s platform for years. After torturous debate, health care reform has been passed, yet it formed a significant section of Obama’s address. Perhaps he was playing to the UPMC representatives in the audience, or maybe he became so used to talking about it that he doesn’t remember how to stop.
At Carnegie Mellon, a center of innovation and research, the President should have renewed his vision and inspiration for the future instead of giving what was ultimately a cliched and political speech. Obama has faced political setbacks and a series of crises since he took office, but he should continue to look forward.
Michael Kahn (mkahn@) is Forum editor and wonders if he can get credit on exams for writing ambiguous answers and claiming they are rhetorically superior.

At the close of every year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and the world at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to Google for standing up for human rights and making the decision to reject the censorship of the Chinese government. We are glad the company is not putting profit ahead of its principles and the freedom of people across the globe.
A thorn to the G-20 protesters and the ensuing police response. Smashing the windows of Pamela’s and other local businesses doesn’t support any cause, and using rubber bullets, tear gas, and military-grade sonic weapons on students is excessive.
A thistle to the university for buying several pieces of land in Oakland over the last few years. Despite hard economic times, we are pleased to see that the university is still moving forward and developing plans for expanding to meet the needs of our growing campus community. 
A thorn to the Steelers and Ben Roethlisberger. In 2009, the Pittsburgh Steelers were national champions. This year, the team didn’t even make the playoffs. Even more disappointing than the team’s season, however, are the actions of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger has been in the news, not for football, but for allegations of sexual assault. We expect more from Big Ben.
A thistle to the campus community for hosting many events this semester. Each weekend is jam-packed with lectures, shows, movies, and more. We are excited to see student activities thriving and hope that this trend continues while increasing student involvement on campus.
A thorn to the sororities that used spray chalk during recruitment. This took a Carnegie Mellon tradition and abused it, making our campus sidewalks look like they had been defaced and not like they were advertising exciting student events. FMS employees should not have had to pressure wash the sidewalks prior to Bill Gates’ visit, or at all.
A thistle to the administration for taking Dean Karen Boyd’s resignation in stride and again working to find a qualified, committed, and beloved dean of Student Affairs while keeping the campus population informed.
A thorn to the position of dean of Student Affairs for not staying filled for longer than a year for the past three years. This is an important part of our campus community that should be filled by a candidate who will be with the university for many years.
A thistle to the 1000plus community service initiative for obtaining 1000 volunteers for the first time in its three-year history. 1000plus has increased the presence of community service on campus through the organization of a complicated and successful event. We hope they will continue to grow for years to come.
A thorn to the city of Pittsburgh for being woefully unprepared to deal with the blizzard this winter. Missing three days of class was a nice and certainly unexpected break, but it is not justified given the amount of snow. We believe the city should take up Carnegie Mellon’s offer to help them better prepare for any future snowfall.
A thistle to CulinArt and Dining Services for listening to students’ concerns about campus dining. We have seen a greater variety of eating options, and we appreciate the well-informed decision to keep the Downtown Deli in the UC Marketplace open until 8 p.m. and the opening of Tazza D’Oro in the Gates Center. We believe CulinArt had a great first year and remain excited to see what else they will do.
A thorn to the School of Computer Science for locking most of the Gates Hillman Complex to undergraduates after 6 p.m. and on weekends. This makes it harder for students to get to office hours, and it discourages collaboration among students and faculty.
A thistle to Vice Provost for Education Indira Nair for her dedication and commitment over her 32 years at Carnegie Mellon. We wish her the best in her retirement; she will be truly missed by the campus community. For more on Dr. Nair’s tenure at the university, see page A1.
A thorn to the Tepper School of Business and others behind the Ginger’s — ahem, The Exchange’s — redesign. We miss having enough space to sit and do not see the utility in the extra counter. We are happy, however, to see that the service and food have remained the same.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon Health Services for responding to the swine flu outbreak by helping students protect themselves. While the e-mails may have seemed excessive at times, keeping campus safe is clearly a priority. Regardless, the addition of hand sanitizer dispensers near every building exit is both useful and sensible.
A thorn to Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl for his misguided tuition tax. Carnegie Mellon and other university students pay enough to come here without an added bill to cover Pittsburgh’s rampant budgetary failures.
A thistle to the campus and Pittsburgh university communities for working together on common projects. From protesting the tuition tax to supporting relief efforts in Haiti, Carnegie Mellon and our nearby schools made an impact in our local and global community.
A thorn to Student Senate for not convincing the student body that student government is important enough to be involved in. Many Senate seats went uncontested or vacant this year, and the campus response has seemingly been dismissive that these vacancies matter at all.
A thistle to the men’s soccer team for making it to NCAA Sweet 16 for the first time in its history. We hope the campus community shows more recognition of our school’s athletic successes.
A thorn to the Buggy safety policy, which has a zero-tolerance approach but ambiguous guidelines. We agree that safety should not be compromised, but using unspecific terms like “near” places both teams and officials in difficult positions.
A thistle to Gina Casalegno for stepping up to run the Career and Professional Development Center and act as assistant dean of Student Affairs. We already miss her tremendously as a strong and capable leader of the Student Activities Office, and we thank her for serving as our adviser for several years.
A thorn to those responsible for spray painting chickens and setting them loose around campus. These acts of animal cruelty show a blatant lack of responsibility and embarrass the entire Carnegie Mellon community.
Looking forward to the 2010–11 year, we hope to see growth in Student Affairs and less spray vandalism.

As college students, we are always being warned to be careful of what we put online for everyone to see because it could come back to hurt us later. Most of us don’t consider our e-mail accounts to be something everyone can see, and so we often put things into e-mails that we wouldn’t want everyone to know.
The Department of Justice (DOJ), however, seems to disagree. It considers e-mail accounts “public” — that is, it does not believe that police and government agents should need warrants or probable cause to search through them.
Recently, the DOJ took Yahoo! to court over this issue, fighting to be allowed to read e-mail stored on Yahoo! mail servers. Yahoo! fought back to protect its users’ rights, and other companies, including Google, joined the fight against this invasion of privacy.
Significantly, the DOJ dropped the suit last week, giving up (for now) on the right to read e-mails.
This open disregard for privacy is troubling, but not wholly unexpected. After 9/11, we allowed the government to go much further in the invasion of privacy than we did before, and this has opened the door for more unreasonable requests. The difference now is that someone is fighting back.
The government should not be allowed access to personal e-mail accounts without a warrant, regardless of which server they are stored on or how old they are. Currently, there are different rules for e-mails over 181 days old, and warrants are not required for these older messages.
This means that any messages that are over six months old are fair game, and the government could presumably access them without a warrant. Users who store their e-mails perpetually should perhaps rethink their storage plan, as the government can go look at these messages, no matter how private or personal, and potentially use them against their owners.
This rule should be changed. If it can’t be, then users should be made clearly aware of it — and not in one of those long, fine-print, rarely read privacy policy agreements.
E-mails, regardless of how old they are, should be treated like any other form of communication or property. The government must obtain a warrant for mail sent through the postal service, so why not for e-mail as well?
No e-mails should be available to any government representative without a warrant, whether they’ve been opened, or what the government thinks it can learn. If there’s a valid reason to suspect that something suspicious will be contained in an e-mail, then there should be no trouble obtaining a warrant.
In 2007, when the government gained access to a man’s e-mail without a warrant in order to find evidence for a fraud case — the man was accused of “selling” male enhancement products through e-mail — the courts ruled that this was unconstitutional and that the government needed a warrant for the evidence to be admissible.
Now, three years later, the same argument is again being waged on a larger scale, but this time the government didn’t wait for the court to rule against them before backing down.
Yahoo!, Google, and the other companies in opposition to the government on this matter should be commended for their willingness to protect their users’ rights and privacy.
In order to protect the rights of consumers, the Digital Due Process Coalition was formed. Organizations and corporations have banded together to lobby for the protection of digital communications privacy rights. This group is trying to require the government to obtain a warrant in order to use e-mails in court and to use GPS technology in cell phones to locate criminals or suspected criminals.
This group and others like it are extremely important today, when most people use the Internet and cell phones without even thinking, expecting that their conversations and dealings are private and visible only to the intended recipient. In fact, in many e-mail messages, a disclaimer at the bottom states that only the intended recipient should read the contents of the message.
Companies and those accused of crimes are finally beginning to challenge what has been an almost unrestricted power of the government for nearly a decade.
While allowances were made shortly following the 9/11 attacks, it is beyond time to return to the Constitution.
Amanda Cole (acole@) is a senior in English and history. She is glad that the government won’t be able to read her e-mails and welcomes all responses.

Over the years, the nuclear disarmament process has gained great momentum, with the two Cold War powers — the United States and Russia — showing strong resolve to reduce their vast nuclear stockpiles. On April 14, world leaders concluded a two-day summit on international nuclear security. While President Obama was quick to deem it a step forward, his argument is anything but convincing.
Though Russia and the United States renewed their vows at the summit, Obama has had great difficulty in bringing nations such as China, India, and Pakistan to the negotiating table. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was afraid that there would be demands for Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so he just stayed home. Iran was not invited and held its own International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in protest.
While it is important that Russia, the country with the world’s largest stockpile, is continuing the disarmament process, without support from every nation it will be impossible to achieve the lofty goal of complete disarmament. And the problem that we face today is not of legality but of mixed messages and poor diplomacy. The Iran issue serves as a great example of the hypocrisy of America’s approach to the problem.
Israel has maintained a (not-so-)secret nuclear program for about 30 years now and, while there have been whimpers of complaint, America has generally accepted it and moved on. Never do we hear of American politicians berating Israel for flouting international regulations or breaking IAEA rules. 
Another country with nuclear ambitions is India. After years of mistrust and burdensome sanctions, George W. Bush finally accepted that India was not going to abandon its nascent nuclear program. Amid much controversy, a civilian nuclear deal was finally signed in 2008, despite India’s being a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. International rules were bent to make way for common sense.
And now it looks like Obama is getting drawn into another pointless legal battle, using sanctions when they make no logical sense. Just because Iran is a theocratic and unstable country does not mean they do not have the right to possess nuclear weapons. No amount of legal maneuvering and international condemnation will change Iran’s mind. Nuclear development has become a matter of national pride, and all the taunting is only serving to strengthen their resolve, allowing leaders like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to keep their public emotionally charged.
While the summit was a good way for Obama to display his commitment to world peace, until the focus of nuclear disarmament policy is shifted from enforcing legal requirements to understanding international motivations, we will remain years away from a nuclear-arms-free world.

On April 13, the music stopped. It disappeared. The airwaves were emptied of rhythm and beat, of singing and instrumentation. Somalian radios now only amplify the sounds of the natural environment: people speaking, animals crooning, gunfire, and explosions.
This change in programming was due not to a governmental edict but on the orders of an insurgent group, the Hizbul Islam. They declared that broadcasting music was against the principles of Islam (for a very strict definition), and the stations complied. 
Of the 16 stations available in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital city, 14 have removed all music — not just the playing of songs, traditional or contemporary, but also program introductions, jingles during the commercials, and anything else that might be considered music. Two have resisted thus far: Radio Mogadishu, which is government-controlled — just about the only thing left in Somalia where the government has control — and Radio Bar-Kulan, based in Nairobi.
In a quasi-rebellion, the music has been replaced with “natural” sounds, but this is likely just a temporary game, as a harsher decree will be next. First, remove all sounds that aren’t humans talking. Next, broadcast only the bulletins of our order, approved by the militant leaders (i.e. you can broadcast if you have more guns). Finally, just shut down the entire radio network.
This is Somalia.
Since 1991, the country has hardly been a country at all. With a civil war that became another conflict, followed by yet more war and more conflict, any sort of normalcy, unity, or government has been impossible to maintain. So the people are left in a decades-long battle since the conflict first began, one that no longer has a soundtrack. The Guardian, in its piece on the radio silencing, suggests, “The music ban is likely to be highly unpopular…” as if there is some chance that one more lost freedom is going to cause the Somali people to run into the street singing and dancing, which would, of course, be against the law.
Oh, and if you happen to believe music on the radio should be banned, you might also agree with a second Somali militant group’s decision to stop using bells to end classes. Bells: also too musical. Bells sound like bells in Christian churches. (Apparently Christians have a monopoly on the sound of bells.) Regarding bells: “Any school heard using bell sounds after now will be brought to Islamic justice.” Some 2 million people live in Mogadishu, and today they continue to have their rights further restricted, with no real end in sight. 
As the groups exert further pressure on the remaining media that exists, journalism becomes even more difficult. Just last year nine journalists were killed in Somalia, more than any other African nation.
But maybe this decade will be better. With some hope, some luck, or an awful lot of concerted effort, maybe a government that can actually hold power will unite Somalia, help journalists freely report on their country, allow schools to signal the ends of their classes with a noise of their choosing, and allow radio stations to broadcast a bit of entertainment into Somali homes in the evening. Maybe that music won’t have to be turned up to drown out the explosions occurring across the city.
Or maybe Somalia will grow even more cut off from the rest of the world, the entire country silenced.

Son of a bitch — the six-season television phenomena LOST is quickly coming to a close.
The series was able to keep us entertained for six seasons, building off a simple plot that seemingly wouldn’t last beyond the very first season — a plane crashed on a deserted island, and the survivors needed to find a way to save themselves and get home. Except then we found out that the Island (and yes, as all LOST fans will understand, it really does deserve the capital “I”) wasn’t deserted, that “the Others” lived there and had been spying on them from the very beginning. And then we met Desmond, the dedicated button-pusher, via Locke’s crazy mission to open the Hatch, and with him the Dharma Initiative was introduced as well.
Just when we thought that we had things figured out, and the survivors were clearly going to be stuck on the Island forever, six of them were able to make it off — only to return not even a full season later. And while the Oceanic Six were enjoying (or lamenting, if you’re Jack) being off the Island, the remaining survivors stuck there were time traveling. Yes, that is correct, they time traveled back to the 1970s, to live in Dharmaville. And now, as the final season draws to an end, we’re watching two alternate universes unraveling at the same time, trying to figure out which one the characters will end up in.
It’s not only the crazy plot twists that have kept viewers’ attention, either. The characters’ personalities and the relationships between them are so compelling that it’s hard not to find yourself drawn in and taking sides. (Jack and Kate are so clearly meant to be together.) I’m sure that Sun and Jin’s long-awaited reunion brought tears to almost everyone’s eyes, and I know that I’m not the only one who is upset over Sayid’s current zombie-like state.
So, as much as I’m going to miss LOST once this season ends, I want to commend the creators, directors, and producers of the show for ending now, before it has a chance to go bad. With the number of questions that have been introduced throughout the show’s run (and are still unanswered), it would certainly be possible for the show to run indefinitely. But instead, the LOST team is choosing to end it when people are still interested, when the plot is still fresh and viewers still want to know what will happen next and how it will end. Even for those who have fallen out of watching the show over the years, many plan to tune back in for the last episode, just to see how things end.
Movies and television today are so centered on drawing things out long after they should have ended — I’m pretty sure we’re on season 20 of The Hills, and I’m almost positive every other movie trailer I see is either a sequel or a remake of an old movie. The LOST creators could certainly choose to continue capitalizing off their success, if they so desired, and keep filming more seasons. But they’re not; they’re choosing the viewers, and their opinion of the show, over the chance to make more profit. They want to end the show on a high note, instead of ending after a few more seasons of earnings accompanied by tired plotlines and relationships.
So, while I will be sad once I am no longer able to see Sayid for an hour each Tuesday night, or watch Jack and Kate give each other slightly awkward, pointed, love-filled stares, I do believe the choice to end the show now is the right one.
Namasté.

This past weekend was the culmination of a busy semester for the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA). Saturday night was our annual wine-tasting event, where 1000 graduate students and guests traded lab coats for cocktail dresses and suits and took over the Pittsburgh Aquarium to sample Old and New World wines. 
Sprinkled among the Carnegie Mellon grad students, sharks, and sea otters were graduate leaders from other northeastern schools who were in Pittsburgh for the regional conference of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS), co-hosted by us and the University of Pittsburgh. It was a weekend that focused on graduate student life, and it was a great chance for us to share how we use our social events to promote interaction among graduate students and help them take a break from their long hours of research and studying.
Back in February, we took advantage of the Legislative Action Days event in Washington, D.C. organized by NAGPS. Three graduate students met with 13 congressmen over two days and discussed the importance of open access to research. GSA is now discussing the implications of passing a resolution about open access and is talking with other schools about the Right to Research Coalition.
Around Pittsburgh, we, along with other members of the Pittsburgh Council for Higher Education, have formed the Pittsburgh Student Governments’ Council to keep the momentum of student involvement that grew out of the tuition tax debate. We’re also branching out by hosting some of our monthly happy hours in new neighborhoods — this semester we have held events in the South Side and Greenfield.
Around campus we have been busy, too. Graduate students were celebrated during Graduate Student Appreciation Week in early April with free breakfast, free massages, a research exhibition, and departmental events. Graduate students have been involved with search committees for the new dean of Student Affairs, director of Student Activities, and career center director.
GSA stays active during the summer and will be discussing survey results from last year’s graduate student survey, the university’s master plan, and our upcoming budget. We are always looking for your thoughts and ideas about ways to improve graduate student life, so please let us know what you think!
