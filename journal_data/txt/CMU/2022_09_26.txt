Football
This past weekend, undefeated #17 Carnegie Mellon took on Thiel at the Tomcats’ stadium in Greenville, Penn. The scoring started late into the first quarter; with 2:44 left, junior Thomas Coury blocked a punt that junior Kevin Cooke took into the endzone for a 7-0 Tartans lead.
Just under halfway into the second quarter, first-year Joey McGinnis got himself into the endzone after a one-yard push, extending the Tartans’ lead to 14-0. There was no more scoring in the first half of the game.
However, on the opening kickoff of the half, sophomore Emmanuel Obu returned the kick to the Tomcats 16-yard line. The drive was finished with a one-yard run from first-year Cole Franklin less than two minutes into the half. This made the score 21-0 in favor of the Tartans.
The Tartans pushed their advantage in the third quarter when sophomore Will Squibb completed a nine-yard touchdown rush with 7:44 left on the clock, giving the Tartans a 28-0 lead. However, early in the fourth quarter, the Tomcats were finally able to make their way onto the board with a one-yard rush touchdown. Thiel then failed their two-point conversion, making it 28-6, Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon finished scoring for the game with a 39-yard touch pass from senior Jack Fierro to junior Brian Stacy. As the clock marked the end of the fourth quarter, the scoreboard read 35-6.
The Tartans will look to keep up their undefeated streak when they take on Westminster on Sat., Oct. 1 for a 7 p.m. kickoff.
Men’s Soccer
The #8 Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team traveled to Mount Aloysius on Wed., Sept. 21. The Tartans took the lead relatively early in the head-to-head with a goal from senior Josh Baugh in the 27th minute. In the 75th minute of the game, sophomore Jake Kavan put another one in the net, advancing the Tartan’s lead to 2-0.
Sophomore Kuba Yiadom put the final goal of the game past the keeper in the 87th minute after a header from sophomore Billy Boucuvalas. This 3-0 victory was the Tartan’s fifth shutout of the season, moving them to a 7-0 record for the season.
The men’s soccer team will next take on Juniata College on Wed., Sep. 28 with a 7:00 p.m. kickoff time on home turf.
Women’s Soccer
The #8 Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team returned home for a Friday game against Baldwin Wallace. First-year Jenna Hallbeck opened the scoring for the Tartans in the 19th minute. Junior Cecelia Dieterich followed not long after in the 27th minute with a shot to the upper left corner that hit the crossbar and found its way into the net. 
Less than a minute after the kickoff, sophomore Catherine MacNichol opened the scoring for the Tartans in the second half. She also recorded her second goal of the game in the 62nd minute off a penalty kick after she was fouled in the box. The last goal for the Tartans and of the game was scored by sophomore Maria Askounis following a pass from sophomore Emma Shirzad, making the final scoreline 5-0 Tartans. This victory advanced the Tartans to 5-1-1 for the year. 
On Sunday, Sept. 25, the team once again faced off at home, this time against Penn State Behrend. Two minutes after entering the game, senior Alex Adams scored the opening goal in the 22nd minute after receiving a pass from sophomore Gemma Jefferson. 
MacNichol followed suit near the end of the first half with a goal of her own after a pass over the defense from junior Rachel Legg. The game was scoreless in the second half, giving the Tartans another shutout victory, moving them to 6-1-1 for the season. 
The women’s soccer team will next take on New York University on Sat., Oct. 1 with a 1:30 p.m. kickoff time on home turf.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
Last weekend marked the second week of rolls for Carnegie Mellon buggy teams. The weather remained clear for Saturday and the teams who made it out to rolls were able to take full advantage.
In total, seven teams rolled on Saturday, Sept. 24. In roll order, they were: Apex, SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon), SDC (The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council), SPIRIT, PiKA (Pi Kappa Alpha), Fringe, and CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association).
Although rolls were planned to commence at 7:00 a.m., the first round of rolls were delayed until 7:20 a.m. as trucks delivering crane parts to the Highmark Center construction site needed to navigate up Frew Street.
Apex rolled three buggies: Molotov, Phoenix, and Solaris. Each buggy got three rolls in.
SigEp rolled one buggy, Barracuda, which got three rolls.
SDC rolled three buggies: Vanity, Avarice, and Inferno. The former got two rolls in while the latter two got three rolls in.
SPIRIT rolled four buggies: Kingpin II, Seraph, Inviscid, and Mapambazuko (Zuke). Seraph and Inviscid got three rolls in while Kingpin II and Zuke got two rolls in.
PiKA rolled two buggies: Banshee and Raptor. Both buggies got three rolls in.
Fringe rolled two buggies: Burnout and Blind Faith. Both buggies got three rolls in, with the latter’s roll count being split (two and one) between two drivers.
CIA rolled four buggies: Roadrunner, Emperor, Kingfisher, and Equinox. The former got two rolls in while the latter three all got three rolls in.
There were no rolls on Sunday, Sept. 25 due to the road closures and traffic detours that come with The Great Race.

On Sept. 15, legendary tennis player Roger Federer took to Instagram and made an announcement that fans have long been dreading: He will officially be retiring from professional tennis, finally hanging it up at the “young age” of 41. Of course, most tennis fans find sadness from this due to its most direct consequence: Their idol, Federer, undoubtedly the most beloved tennis player of this generation, will no longer be around for them to root for. However, for some fans, specifically pure enthusiasts of the game itself, there is another fear: The quality of play we’ve been treated to for a decade plus is now soon to be lost, and it doesn’t appear that it’s going to be replaced anytime soon.
This isn’t a knock on new players on the tour; the reality is that outside of the Big Three, no one player has stood out as the next star to take over the tennis world — an especially important fact considering Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal continue to inch closer to their own departures. Russian sensation Daniil Medvedev appeared to be on that track, but following his heartbreaking loss to Nadal earlier this year at the Australian Open final, his performance has been underwhelming at best. For Austrian star Dominic Thiem, who looked more poised than anyone to challenge the Big Three following numerous finals appearances and a U.S. Open win, it has been anything but smooth sailing for him, with an array of injuries, as well as disappointing results.
Enter a 19-year-old kid from Spain by the name of Carlos Alcaraz. Fresh off his first grand slam title earlier this month, Alcaraz has not only made a splash in the tennis world but accomplished something that most players aren’t able to attain in their entire career. Despite still being a teen, Alcaraz is mature beyond his years, with seemingly no moment too big for him. In the quarterfinals against Italian phenom Jannik Sinner, Alcaraz not only staved off a match point in the fourth set, but he would go on to win the five-and-a-half hour match in what many experts have already dubbed the game of the year. But despite such a titanic effort against Sinner, Alcaraz returned even stronger in his semifinal matchup, another lengthy five-set battle against American France Tiafoe. Alcaraz isn’t just pure endurance though; the Spaniard has one of top forehands on the tour in terms of both accuracy and velocity, paired with raw athleticism that keeps him in points long enough for his power to take over. Against Sinner, Alcaraz even slapped a behind-the-back shot on the run — just one instance of his ability to combine agility, intelligence, and pure skill on the tennis court.
But winning isn’t enough to make a tennis player universally loved, even for a player like Roger Federer. Persona matters, and it’s part of what has made the Big Three so entrenched in tennis discussion for years. Not only have the three been almost completely free from any off-court controversy (save Djokovic’s recent vaccination issues), but they’re model individuals as well, both in and out of the tennis community. For tennis’s new generation, though, the same can’t be said. German talent Alexander Zverev has had his share of questionable moments, including but not limited to domestic abuse allegations and an ejection from the Mexican Open after smashing his racquet on the umpire’s chair stand. Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios is perhaps better known for his antics than his playing ability, often viewed as a rare talent wasted on smashed racquets and verbal abuse of umpires amongst other faults. Alcaraz’s on-court personality is a welcoming deviation from this. The teenager is composed, rarely lashing out or showing negative energy; in fact, in contrast to a player like Kyrgios, Alcaraz demonstrates an abundance of positive emotion, constantly getting the crowd involved and on his side. It’s no surprise that when asked about Alcaraz and his meteoric rise, even Federer himself commented that “the game is bright,” with Alcaraz at the forefront.
This isn’t to say that Alcaraz is bound to match Federer’s immense grace, fanbase, or success on the court. But the reality is that he doesn’t have to. With the Big Three’s dominance over the tennis world for so long, expecting a set of players, or even one, to fill in immediately would be highly foolish. Tennis enthusiasts need another Big Three, or even a Big One. They just need tennis to be in good hands for the foreseeable future. For now, at least, a teenager from Spain is making that happen.

The Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season is finally coming to an end after nearly six long months and over 4,200 games between the 30 teams. With the end of the regular season comes the start of the postseason, better known as October Baseball. Twelve teams, six teams from each league, will have their ticket to the dance to fight for that all-important World Series title. Before we reach that stage, there are a number of important storylines that must be sorted out. Aaron Judge put up a historical season as he battled with Shohei Ohtani for the American League MVP. Albert Pujols, in his last season, looks to achieve 700 career home runs, a feat which only four players in MLB history have ever reached; and many teams are still searching for their spot in the postseason while a few teams are already setting their rosters for their playoff push. The 2022 MLB regular season has offered a lot of incredible moments, from spectacular web gems to massive homers, and there is no doubt that it has much more left to offer.
The most important storyline of this season has to be Aaron Judge and his monumental season. Aaron Judge has hit 60 home runs and is very much in the conversation for the Triple Crown, all while carrying the Yankees to the playoffs and likely the AL East division title. For reference, only five people in history had ever hit 60+ home runs in a season before Judge accomplished that feat no less than a week ago. Furthermore, three of those men were linked to steroid use, so it can be said that Aaron Judge may be the first player to fairly achieve this feat since Roger Maris in 1961 and Babe Ruth in 1927.
A Triple Crown is when a player leads in Runs Batted In (RBI), home runs, and batting average. Only one person has done so since 1967, that being Miguel Cabrera in 2012. Judge leads in walks, total bases, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, and OPS+. This is excluding a number of other stats as well. What is even more incredible is the fact that Judge is leading in all of these categories by significant margins. For example, his OPS+ is 215 when the league average OPS+ is 100, so he is contributing more than double what the average player does. OPS+ is on-base plus slugging (OPS), but weighted to account for which league and which parks the player has played in. These numbers are incredible, but what is even more important is that Judge is doing all this while under the pressure of playing for the great New York Yankees beneath the constant eye of the media and their fanbase. He has also been, at times, the only offense for the Yankees and has carried them on his back.
With all this in mind, Judge is basically a shoe-in for the MVP (Most Valuable Player), but there is one person who could steal some votes away from Judge. That would be Shohei Ohtani, who continues to be a spectacle that baseball fans have never seen before. The mythical legend that is Babe Ruth was a great pitcher and home run hitter, but even he did not do both simultaneously at such a level. Ohtani’s ability to be an elite starting pitcher as well as a top of the line hitter makes him incredibly valuable, so he will forever be in the MVP conversation. After he won the MVP last season, he has put together another incredible season that would have probably earned him another MVP had Judge not been having a season that has not been seen in decades. Ohtani has a 2.43 Earned Run Average (ERA) over 148 innings and a 149 OPS+ in 144 games. The average ERA for MLB pitchers is 3.98 and we already know that league average OPS+ is 100. No one has been even remotely close to achieving this since Babe Ruth and that was nearly a 100 years ago. It is unprecedented how incredible Shohei Ohtani is and everyone should jump at the nearest opportunity to see him play. There are a number of other great players in the show right now. Some important names are Paul Goldschmidt, Nolan Arenado, and Freddie Freeman who are all involved in the National League MVP conversation.
A storyline that is not just relevant to this season, but to the last two decades is the career of Albert Pujols. Albert Pujols has been one of the greatest hitters of our generation and he is in the conversation for greatest right-handed hitter to ever exist. He is well on his way to the Baseball Hall of Fame and will likely be voted in five years from now when he is first ballot-eligible.
Albert Pujols is 42 years old and he came into this season with 679 career home runs, accumulated over his 22 year career with the St. Louis Cardinals, the Anaheim Angels, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He returned to St. Louis for his last season and was 21 home runs shy of 700 career home runs which many people saw as a long shot considering his age and performance over the last few seasons. This was the case, but Albert Pujols has been very good in the second half of the season, hitting 13 home runs with a 1.304 on-base plus slugging over 47 games since the All-Star Break in mid-July. As I was writing this very article, Albert Pujols tacked on two more home runs against my very own Los Angeles Dodgers to eclipse 700 home runs. Only three other people have ever hit 700 career home runs, with those being Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, and Babe Ruth. These three names are considered baseball royalty — legends of the game. Pujols also joins Hank Aaron as one of the only two players to hit 700 home runs and 3,000 hits. Now, Pujols is a part of those lists until the end of time: true baseball immortality. He has proved everything there is to prove, but it is just extremely cool to see him making this push in his last season for the team where he had so much initial success. His career deserves an article of its own, but it is important to highlight how much he has meant to the game and all baseball fans this year. The Cardinals are also coming to Pittsburgh to play the Pirates from Oct. 3-5 to finish off the season, so you could see history unfold by heading down to PNC Park one of those evenings.
Although baseball and baseball statistics is very much focused on the individual players and their performances, at its core, baseball is a team game and that is what truly matters. There have been a few good teams that have stood above the rest during this regular season: the National League has a better overall crop, but the American League has some heavy hitters and some teams that I think could surprise people when it comes to October. The Los Angeles Dodgers currently have 104 wins and 46 losses, which puts them on pace to win more than 110 games, which has not been done since the Seattle Mariners in 2001. They have practically locked up the top seed in the National League after a dominant season. They hope to win the World Series and insert themselves into the conversation for the greatest team of all time. The New York Mets have inserted themselves back into the NL conversation as they battle with the defending World Series champs, the Atlanta Braves, for the NL East title. Both teams are huge threats to win the NL pennant and compete for a World Series title. The St. Louis Cardinals do not have the regular season record of these other three teams, but they can be tough to beat in a short series. They also have the storylines going for them with multiple veterans retiring after this season. We discussed Albert Pujols and all he has done, but Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright have been incredible in their own right. Both guys have been with the Cardinals for more than 17 years, so they will definitely want to end with a proper send off. All in all, the National League playoffs are going to be a true dogfight from beginning to end and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.
In the American League, the Houston Astros stand head-and-shoulders above the rest of the field. They currently own a record of 99-53 and they will likely end up with the top seed. They also come with so much postseason experience as they seem to be in the American League Championship Series every year. The New York Yankees have had an up-and-down season, but they have the bones of a good team and Aaron Judge could easily carry them deep into the postseason. From there, there are a number of teams who can make their mark, but they are not on the same level as these two teams. Even the Yankees are not on the level of the Houston Astros. The Cleveland Guardians have been a fun team and have secured the AL Central title, but they are a young team that remains unproven. The playoff scenarios that lay ahead deserve more focus, and it is going to be extremely exciting to see how it all plays out.
Since Carnegie Mellon is in Pittsburgh, we share a city with the Pittsburgh Pirates. They have not had the season they had hoped, but there are a number of young players that fans should be excited for. Oneil Cruz is a flashy rookie shortstop who hits balls harder than anyone else in the game. Ke’Bryan Hayes has shown flashes of greatness and Bryan Reynolds remains a very quality center fielder of the big leagues. Hopefully, the front office and ownership can capitalize on this talent and add some free agents that will help the Pirates get back to relevancy. The fans in Pittsburgh deserve more and they can only hope something will change soon.
With the end of the baseball season, some fans head to the ballpark to see their team for the final time while others hope they can see their team play into November. There have been many great storylines from dominant teams to historic seasons, but the playoffs will soon be here. That is where baseball really matters, where heroes are made, and where every pitch matters that much more. Each team is fighting so they can win that last game of the season.

Having undergone a hiatus, our weekly college football roundups are now officially back. Every week between now and the national championship in January, I’ll be providing the results of big games, analyzing their implications for conference championships and the playoff picture, top teams’ schedules for next week, and, perhaps most contentiously, a ranking.
So without further ado, let’s jump right in.
Our Rankings:
At the top of the standings are a pair of SEC teams, Alabama and Georgia, who, barring unexpected upsets, will continue as #1 and #2 all season in an order only to be determined by the SEC Championship at the end of the season. Georgia beat Kent State, their fourth straight, although not by the crushing margins we’ve come to expect; Alabama took care of business against Vanderbilt. No surprises here. Stetson Bennett (Georgia) and Bryce Young (Alabama), both coming off of playoff seasons, will continue their fight for dominance atop the quarterback mountain in the SEC all year long.
Rounding out the top three is Ohio State, currently heavy favorites to win the Big Ten. Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio State are the three best teams in college football, and it isn’t close. Ohio State faced a test the first week of the season and beat Notre Dame. They followed that up by whipping Arkansas State and putting up a mind-boggling 77 points against Toledo in a rout so bad they brought their entire first team off the field. They faced their first conference opponent in Wisconsin on Saturday, in a game many expect to ultimately be replayed in the Big Ten Championship. Nevertheless, they continued their romp, beating Wisconsin 52-21.
Following them at #4 is Michigan, who emerged as a surprise playoff team last year but won an ugly one at home against Maryland on Saturday. They scored fifty points in each of their first three games, although the competition in all of those games was probably the weakest of any in the top ten, but quarterback J.J. McCarthy and the defense struggled against a good Maryland team, winning by two touchdowns in a game that was closer than the score indicated. While their quarterback core is returning from last year’s squad, their two top defensive players — Aidan Hutchinson and David Ojabo — have both gone to the NFL. From here on out, though, it could be rough going for the Wolverines. They face very capable teams for the next four weeks — at Iowa and Indian, and home against Penn State and Michigan State. If they’re going to stumble before their finale against Ohio State, it’s going to be in the next month.
At #5 is Clemson, who beat Wake Forest in a very thrilling two-overtime shootout, 51-45. #6 is USC, who barely escaped Oregon State with a win, but a win nevertheless; #7 is Oklahoma State, who didn’t play this week, but travel to #17 Baylor, then host Texas Tech in the next two weeks, in two games that figure to be fun. #8 is Tennessee, who survived a late Florida comeback to win a huge game to stay undefeated, jumping into the top ten. The #9 team is Kentucky, who barely survived a game in which they were the heavy favorites against Northern Illinois, and North Carolina State stayed undefeated, winning against Connecticut to join the top ten.
Oklahoma and Arkansas both fell out of the top ten after surprise losses to Kansas State and Texas A&M, respectively, who are nipping on the heels of the top ten themselves now. Just outside the top ten, undefeated Penn State and one-loss Utah and Oregon all managed to stay alive with wins —  Utah and Penn State convincingly so and Oregon with a nail-biter against a very good Washington State team.
Next Week:
Neither Clemson nor North Carolina State can survive a loss and stay in the top ten, so at least one new squad will be joining the ranks next week, be it Utah, Penn State, Oregon, or someone else. Not many upsets seem to be in store, but Arkansas could cause Alabama trouble, LSU could do the same for Tennessee, Iowa could make a mess against Michigan, and the Clemson-NC State game should be an absolute doozy to watch.
All of which is to say that we will be back for Week 5 with some brand new rankings that could end up substantially different from this week.

        We're testing a new look for The Tartan. Let us know what you think!

In Summer 2019, Carnegie Mellon added a new feature to its risk management approach, rolling out a new app, Rave Guardian, during first year orientation. Despite COVID-19 hitting just months later, sending students home and making risk management take a backseat in the face of new challenges like online learning, Rave Guardian has been a recommended download to every class of first year students since the roll-out. But what is Rave Guardian, and what can it do for student safety?
Frank Marcopolos and the Enterprise Risk Management team here at CMU took the time to answer some questions about Rave Guardian in a statement to The Tartan, providing more context on the app and how it’s used at Carnegie Mellon. 
Even prior to Carnegie Mellon adopting Rave Guardian, there was a comprehensive risk management program in place on campus, most of it with behind the scenes support and actions from Carnegie Mellon risk staff. More visible elements include our campus police, blue dot system, and CMU-Alert system. The Enterprise team explains that “the biggest incentive to adding Rave Guardian was to provide students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to have access to an app on their mobile phones for multiple emergency communications purposes.” This was a way to take the existing online support and hotlines, and combine them in a singular location for easier access. Bruce Gerson of The Piper explains some of these connected resources, which include hotlines to University Police, UHS, CaPS, and the Employee Assistance Program, as well as links for the CMU escort service and CMU shuttle bus.
Hotlines aren’t the only useful feature on the app. Gerson furthers that users can create an emergency profile, and information such as their name and image can be sent to University Police along with their location when an emergency call is made, to make it easier for emergency response. The app even compliments the CMU-Alert system, enabling students to receive CMU-Alert notifications even when they don’t have cell service.
One of the best extra features? The Safety Timer. 
“We call it our ‘virtual buddy system,’" the Enterprise team explains. "The best way to describe it is if you are walking alone at night, the safety timer will allow you to set a timer for how long you think it will take you to get to your destination safely. If the timer expires, Rave Guardian will notify your pre-selected contacts or University Police.” 
Of course, with any app containing location tracking software, students can expect to have questions pertaining to the privacy concerns. 
Luckily, being the highly-ranked computer science university that Carnegie Mellon is, the app couldn’t have rolled out without thorough review. The Enterprise team echoes this sentiment, stating that “Privacy and security are important for any new technology being implemented.” Prior to Carnegie Mellon adopting this tool, Gerson explains, the Information Security Office ensured its security and safety, conducting “a complete examination of the app and how it stores information.” Not only was it satisfactory, but the methods to which information is shared are limited to ensure the app is non-invasive. Enterprise explains that the main use of location services are to send the location to the University Police at the time of the emergency call so that officers know where to go, clarifying that “Rave Guardian location information is only activated at that time and when the location settings are enabled on a user's smartphone.”
When downloading a new app, especially one with such capabilities, it’s ok to hesitate when it comes to privacy. But in the case of Rave Guardian, Carnegie Mellon really did their homework, and found an option that substantially increases their emergency response capabilities for crises in the real world, while also maintaining an incredibly safe environment for users in cyberspace.
When asked about app usage, Enterprise stressed that “If just one of these situations helped keep someone safe, then it is successful.” So the best way to benefit from this safety and success? Download the app.

SciTech Roundup
A lot happened in the SciTech world this week: Silicon Valley layoffs, a James Webb telescope picture of Neptune, and a new COVID-19 booster shot. 
RESEARCH ROUNDUP
Using reinforcement learning to shoot particles into hydrogen plasma donuts
Doctoral candidate Ian Char from the School of Computer Science's machine learning department was able to use reinforcement learning to help control nuclear fusion reactions. Nuclear fusion is a powerful clean energy alternative to the fossil fuel industry. To produce electricity that can be put on the grid, scientists must control the enormous amount of energy emitted when hydrogen nuclei fuse. These nuclei fuse naturally in the sun, which has high temperature and pressure but is difficult to harness, and also fuse in thermonuclear weapons, which cannot be used as an energy source. 
Instead, Char used a tokamak — a "massive machine that uses magnetic fields to confine the hydrogen plasma in a donut shape called a torus." There is only one large-scale tokamak in the U.S. that can facilitate Char's research, the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in San Diego, California. To control the energy, scientists must control the speed at which hydrogen particles enter the "plasma donut." Char controlled the speed using reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique that learns the best outcome by trying different options and assessing the rewards and costs of each option. After pitching his idea to a Department of Energy-funded facility, he was given a three-hour slot to run his algorithms on June 28. Reinforcement learning does not seem to have been previously run on a tokamak before.
NATIONAL NEWS
More James Webb Telescope pictures!
During the summer, NASA released stunning pictures of the galaxy taken by the James Webb Telescope (JWST), and on Sept. 23, they released a picture of Neptune, glowing softly with iridescent specks that the Irish Times described as "​​glittering like a mirrorball, as its rings and moons dance around it."
JWST is made to capture what the Hubble Telescope could not, using infrared technologies. The recent Neptune image shows Neptune's rings and dust bands, some of which haven't been seen since Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989. While many depictions of Neptune show the planet as blue, the JWST pictures do not appear so because the methane gas that makes Neptune blue absorbs the infrared that JWST uses to capture images. JWST also captured images of Neptune's 14 known moons.
Personally, my interest in the images peaked when I heard from vlogger and science educator Hank Green explain how the images show that "the past is in every direction." If you're as uneducated in this field as I am, you might be confused. But it actually just requires some knowledge of how light works.
So like most things in the world, light has a speed. The way you see an object, like an apple or this article, for example, is that light hits the object, and then the light that reflects off and travels to your eye. Most of the time, the distance between your eye and the object is close enough that you don't notice the travel time — the light almost instantaneously reaches your eye, producing an almost instantaneous image for your brain to register. But if the distance between your eye and the object is far enough, it will take longer. Light from the sun, for example, takes eight minutes to travel to the Earth's surface, and also your eye I guess, if you're staring directly at the sun.
Then what about stars from further galaxies? It would take a lot longer to reach your eye, somewhere between four years (which is the distance of the next closest star, Proxima Centauri) and a few hundred years. And that's just the stars that we can see. So essentially when we look at a star four light years away, we're seeing what that star looked like four years ago. After four more years on Earth, we'll be able to see what that star looks like right now.
The JWST is just a gigantic, extremely high quality eye, and can subsequently see more things that the human eye cannot. That also means that it can look further into the past than we can. And it also means that no matter which direction it looks in the sky, as long as it's able to see an object from the past, "the past is in every direction."
Some other fun facts: Apparently the reason why the stars in the photos appear to have six spikes is actually just because of the way JWST captures images. They're called diffraction spikes, and are produced due to JWST's hexagonal structs that are used to support the telescope. (The Hubble telescope only has four struts, so stars in their images have only four spikes.) Also in the galaxy pictures, some galaxies appear twice due to an effect called gravitational lensing.
Meta and Google starts cutting down on workforce, making employees uneasy
The recession is definitely hitting hard, but Silicon Valley is usually cushy enough to not feel the impact, continuing to offer in-office perks like free candy, sleep pods, and rock-climbing gyms. Now, it seems that they're starting to feel the burn.
Both Meta and Google have recently announced intentions to cut down on their workforce. In July, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would likely be hiring thousands less employees, and possibly stop hiring in some departments entirely. He also told Meta workers to be prepared to work harder with fewer resources, or rather, "to execute flawlessly in an environment of slower growth." CEO Sundar Pichai has said similarly that Google needs to become "20 percent more effective." Google has also disbanded the Pixelbook Laptop team and slashed projects at its in-house research lab, Area 120, giving project members 90 days to find another job within Google.
As quoted in the New York Times: “I think some of you might decide that this place isn’t for you, and that self-selection is OK with me,” Zuckerberg said in a call. “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here.”
That's honestly pretty ruthless coming from a sector that has been known for six- to seven-figure salaries, a plethora of benefits, casual meetings, and "fun office perks," convincing employees to integrate as much of their life with the company as possible. In fact, there are some people who collect salaries and stocks, enjoy all the company's benefits, and yet barely do any work at all. 
These types of people are called the "rest and vest," and while some are "10x engineers" that can supposedly do 10 times the amount of work in the same time as other engineers, some honestly just don't want to work hard, working four hours a day and "coasting" along on their benefits. The "rest and vest" type has even been parodied in a TV-show called "Silicon Valley." The "rest and vest" tend to be common in research and development arms of companies, such as Google X, "the moonshot factory" in which Google experiments with products that aren't tied to their main brand, like Google Glass and self-driving car service Waymo. Because these projects don't have hard deadlines, employees can get away with having longer lunch breaks and going to a yoga class instead of working.
In the past, there was actually a benefit to keeping the "rest and vest" around: they could debug code that others couldn't, and train newcomers on old software. But in 2022, with tight wallets, Meta and Google don't want to finance those kinds of people anymore.
Meta has taken a few financial hits recently: Apple's privacy changes have cut into their advertising revenue, and Zuckerberg has also dedicated billions of dollars to build his proposed "metaverse." Google has also felt financial pressure from the recession, and CEO Sundar Pichai has also brought up concerns about competitors like TikTok gaining enormous success and competing against YouTube for a similar user base. 
New Omicron booster shot available
You can now get a booster shot of the newest approved COVID-19 booster vaccine at local pharmacies or on campus. To get the booster shot on campus, make an appointment online for one of the clinics on Sept. 28, Oct. 24 or Nov. 15. Carnegie Mellon requires all community members to be vaccinated with at least one booster shot.
Why get a booster? Vaccines and their boosters remain a trusted way to not only prevent COVID-19 infections, but also to lower the severity of outcomes if you do get COVID-19 at all. For example, you might recover in a few days instead of a week, or you might just stay in bed for a few days instead of being hospitalized. And the COVID-19 virus will continue evolving into new strains unless we're able to eradicate it from the population completely, which will not happen any time soon. Think about it like a flu shot: you're normally recommended to get it every year to stay up to date.
To get the booster, you must have already completed your first series of COVID-19 vaccinations, called the primary series. The number of doses to complete the primary series depends on your age and which brand of vaccine you got. For adults, if you need two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax, or just one dose of Janssen.
A little more info about the booster itself: This booster is the first to work against multiple COVID-19 strains. Specifically, it's the first bivalent booster, meaning it targets both the original COVID-19 strain that appeared in 2020 as well as the newer Omicron strains that appeared the summer of 2022. It was approved by the FDA for emergency use on Aug. 31, and on Sept. 1 the CDC recommended all those eligible to get it as "the first updated COVID-19 booster." In both the Moderna and Pfizer clinical trials of a different but similar bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, those who took the shot had better immune responses against the Omicron subvariant called BA.1.
It's also worth noting that you can no longer get monovalent boosters, as the FDA has removed emergency-use authorization for them while approving the new bivalent versions. However, you can still get a monovalent primary vaccine shot.

In their 2021 paper, a group of scientists evaluated what they referred to as climate change “tipping points.” These tipping points, which include a variety of climate-related systems, indicate that large — and potentially irreversible — changes have occurred within a system once a certain threshold has been exceeded. The changes can take place over several years or potentially millennia depending on the response times of the systems. 
The study quantified these with respect to the rise in global mean surface temperature. There are three clusters of this temperature: a rise between one and three degrees Celsius, three and five degrees Celsius, and above five degrees Celsius. The earth is already approaching the first cluster, which will have the largest impact on Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. 
In fact, since the study was published, scientists have determined that sea-level rise from the melting of the Greenland ice cap is inevitable; there is no amount of climate change prevention that will be able to slow down or stop this. 
While computers have been used in the past to estimate how much the ice caps have melted, a team of scientists used satellite imaging of ice caps from 2000 to 2019 to determine the melting rate. 
The study states that, at best, there will be a 27 centimeter rise in sea-level regardless of future action. This is from approximately 3.3 percent of the Greenland ice cap’s volume. However, a model using 2012 data points toward a much larger overall rise if the rate continues — a total sea rise of 78 ± 13 centimeters.
While the trend has not followed the 2012 melting rate, that doesn’t mean it’s not impossible. If no action is taken, the world will potentially see a 78 centimeter sea-level rise. The world is currently sitting at a 1.1 degree Celsius rise, so just into the first cluster of tipping points. The Paris Agreement aims to make sure the rise in global surface temperature is less than two degrees Celsius — ideally, no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
According to a study published in Science, it is possible for many of the tipping points to occur at the temperature increase range targeted by the Paris Agreement. This includes coral reefs dying off, forest diebacks in the south and forest expansions in the north, sea ice collapse and sea current die-off, and abrupt boreal permafrost thaw. 
Ice caps aren’t the only visible effects of climate change — there are many signs of destabilization in the Amazon rainforest. The resilience of the Amazon rainforest to climate and land-use change is necessary for the rainforest’s survival. However, since the early 2000s, it has steadily been losing resilience, especially in regions with less rainfall and areas close to human activity. This currently includes three-quarters of the entire rainforest. As the Amazon rainforest is home to a large amount of biodiversity and carbon storage, there are heavy implications for climate change on a global basis.
Triggering many of these climate tipping points is non-negligible — even with stringent climate mitigation measures. As the Paris Agreement (a best-case scenario) aims to limit global warming to at most two degrees Celcius, that still puts the world above many climate change limits. While it seems 1.5 degree Celcius is still feasible, countries need to focus on their efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-change causing actions.

Another week in, keep your head up.
We are once again back. Notice how there wasn't a Tuesday last week? Things just piling on.
After an extended one week absence due to personal injuries, the Muppet Corner has returned, finishing the cliffhanger it had previously laid out. We are anxious to read all about something that we easily could have just experienced ourselves.
Page 6 lets Cole Skuse tells us all about some of the most important recent events in the "Red White & Blood" comics line. Seems mighty confusing, but I guess most of the fun comes from getting to know all about Moon Knight, and then telling everyone about Moon Knight.
Page 8 has the newest press release from William Curvan, all about the newest breakthrough that Carnegie Mellon students have done, this time in the field of cryptocurrency. The power of the decentralized cryptocurrency has been explained, all for you to read.
Page 10 continues Anna Cappella's serial story telling extravaganza. Why are these letters from Mags (Maggie)? Who is Cass (Cassandra)? The newest "The Count of Monte Cristo" is being created before your very eyes, don't miss it.
Good old Haley Williams is still obsessed, so read all about her generic obsession with Paul Dano, actor.
Gelman is back page 14, with a thoughtful review of music reviewers, a field we've been told is surprisingly bad!
Page 16 contains the work of another Tartan Editor, Kaylin Li. If you've ever wanted to learn about this one specific KPop group, then the article is for you. Otherwise, it still is for you, as you'll get to learn all about Newjeans.
Page 18 drops another prototypical Rossian classic. Good for him.
And as always, playlist on page 19.
Ciao,
Your one and only Pillbox Editor

And we’re back. Muppet corner returns for the second part of a two-part feature. We will be analyzing the second side of the one and only “The Muppet Show” (album). We get off to a raucous start, with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem playing a notably violent rendition of “Tenderly,” originally composed by Walter Gross and Jack Lawrence. It is a real bop, filled with the chaotic energy that makes us love Electric Mayhem so much. Animal is a monster on the drums, and gets his own mini solo at the end, followed by one of his classic roars. We also get a delightful little duet with Zoot and Lips in the middle. This is the type of music that people should think of when pondering the question of Muppet covers. A respectful version of the OG composition that grants humor while maintaining a strong ‘listenability’ that keeps us moving the needle back to replay it. As Kermit says: “I’ve always felt that the Dr. Teeth group is one of the exemplary practitioners of contemporary music.”
Up next we have the anti-racist anthem “I’m in Love With A Big Blue Frog,” fitting sung by a collections of frogs and Kermit. Their interpretatlyion of the song remains very close to the original version Peter, Paul and Mary, a folk music trio brilliantly satirized as Bill, Mary and Tom in the exceptional film “Nashville” (1975) by Robert Altman. This movie, although probably his most ambitious and exceptional, is actually not my favorite. I prefer both “The Long Goodbye” and “The Player.” I guess I’m more of a cinematic normie, and prefer simpler plots with singular main characters. However, these three movies are all exceptional, and I would give them all four Ebertian stars. Anyways, the anti anti-miscegenation message of this song is the exact type of just message that the Muppets managed to so well convey to their audience.
We get led directly into our next interlude with Statler and Waldorf, where they seemingly reside on a critical seesaw. As one’s opinion on the act decreases, the other increases. This demonstrates our natural contrarian tendencies, and how we will often feel the need to hate something just because others love it, or perhaps internally redeem another work after others critically appraise it oh so low.
The third track contains a rendition of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Tit Willow” by Rowlf and Sam the Eagle. Rowlf is his usual incredible self, and Sam acts increasingly awkward as he tries to follow along with the song, as singing is not in his nature. This duo recalls the Muppet pilot “The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence” where Sam the Eagle gained his now classic patriotic personality. This pilot was otherwise rather disastrous, but we can always respect what we have gained, and forget to mourn for what was otherwise lost.
Next we have “Veterinarian’s Hospital,” an ongoing segment parodying soap operas, starring Rowlf as Dr. Bob. He’s aided by Nurse Janice (portrayed by Janice of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem fame), and Nurse Piggy (obviously Miss Piggy). This segment is not anything special, and serves as an example of what a generic segment of Veterinarian’s Hospital would contain. There’s classic word play, and a jocular Muppet who clearly shouldn’t be practicing. I’ve already made clear my preference of the musical segments over the skits, but you can’t knock the classics.
“Simon Smith and the Dancing Bear” is a Randy Newman original that Scooter and Fozzie play very straight. The only humor here comes from the mere idea of Fozzie singing. The song is altogether popular, but I don’t see what makes it a necessity as a Muppets track. It is here that you can see the trouble in making this album after only one season of the show. Imagine making a greatest hits album after only one album has come out! Just getting 19 bits must have been a real tough act.
Speaking of tough acts, Piggy is up next as she manages to strongarm Kermit into letting her perform “What Now My Love.” There is real emotion being sung here through Piggy’s felt vocal chords. Even ardent Piggy haters can still find moving the power she emits in this feminist anthem. Again the Muppety elements come mostly from the silly voices, but as well again the sheer listenability of the whole song delights. It’s no “I’m Gonna Always Love You”, but then again, what is?
Next Fozzie does what is probably his funniest joke in the first season. As Muppet Wiki describes it,
“Fozzie gets Kermit to participate in his act. It’s all unrehearsed, and Fozzie tells Kermit that when he hears the word “hear,” he is supposed to shout “Good Grief! The Comedian’s a Bear!” However, Fozzie keeps saying “hear” during parts of the joke where Kermit isn’t supposed to say the line, and eventually Fozzie has to change his method of demonstration.”
The joke ends up being that he’s actually wearing a necktie. It’s the kind of wordplay that doesn’t translate well over text, but the obvious exasperation Kermit is feeling, and the anti-joke surrounding the regular joke lend a true comedy moment.
Then, Wayne and Wanda sing the poem “Trees.” Well they only sing for a few moments, and then get crushed, presumably by the titular tree. Nothing else to say here.
“Sax and Violence” is an always classic accompanied with a quick joke about Nigel firing Zoot. Nigel shouldn’t be making jokes about firing people, if anything he should be worried about getting fired. What a worthless little Muppet. The rest of the performance is just a regular sax solo. If you love sax, you’ll love this one.
And finally, Kermit performs “Being Green.” What else is there to even say about it? It’s “Being Green.” And that’s enough.

Who knew that using only three colors could produce unique, interesting stories? The “Black, White & Blood” series explores a variety of superhero stories through only three colors: black, white, and red. My first introduction to this style was “Moon Knight: Black, White & Blood,” but I also managed to get my hands on a copy of “Wolverine: Black, White & Blood.” It also just so happens they are my two favorite Marvel Superheroes!
Each issue in the series contains three different stories by different storytellers and have minimal connection between each other, besides some shared elements. I think this works to the benefit of the stories; the unique art styles aren’t bound to a consistent story, so they are free to explore whatever they want to fully take advantage of the unique series.
Moon Knight
The “Moon Knight” series starts off with a sci-fi story that is co-written by one of my favorite Marvel writers, Jonathan Hickman. I’d say it’s pretty standard Hickman work, but I felt like the art was a bit weak in this story compared to the rest of the series. 
The lackluster start, though, immediately makes way for some really interesting stories that involve other characters. Spider-Man and Deadpool make an early appearance in the second story of issue one and really fit in with the color scheme (given they are red and black). Doctor Strange makes his appearance in the first story of issue two as a minor character. 
One of the things that stuck out to me almost immediately was the stark contrast between some of the stories. At times, a story makes a joke about space spaghetti being soggy while another has Moon Knight trying to free himself from being Khonshu’s Avatar. This is only possible because of the jumps between stories.
One of my favorites from this collection is the second story from issue two, “A Hard Day’s Knight.” It depicts the bleeding Marc Spector showing up to Ruby’s Diner and having himself a nice meal with the other personalities that live inside him. I love the art style used in this comic and the color scheme really stands out. It’s an equally light and dark story and highlights what I feel to be every aspect of Moon Knight and why I like him as a character so much.
Wolverine
Similar to its “Moon Knight” counterpart, “Wolverine’s” stories are also independent of each other and feature characters from other Marvel stories. One aspect of “Wolverine” that I really liked is how it tells stories from a variety of points in his life. The first story is when Logan was still part of Project X, his origin story, and another story focuses on the time of his life when he called himself “Patch” in Madripoor. 
One of the initial things that scared me about getting into comics is the sheer volume of stories that are out there and the prerequisite knowledge to get into them. “Black, White & Blood” excels at making things approachable. While some of the stories take place at important times in other stories, this series feels relatively well-contained, which I really like. 
Another difference from “Moon Knight” is that these stories feel a lot more action-driven than story-driven, which I feel suits the respective stories very well. Like other “Wolverine” stories, these stories have some priceless action panels — I’m a sucker for Wolverine’s claws protruding from the top of some bad guy’s head. The colors do a really good job of highlighting the action; the artists really went over the top for these stories, and I absolutely love it.
Overall, the “Black, White & Blood” series is one to check out regardless of how involved you are with Marvel Comics and the character stories. They’re easy reads and just look really, really good. If you get a chance to read any of them, give it a shot!

Note from the editor: We here at The Tartan take our journalism very seriously. As such, we would like to sincerely apologize for an inaccurate assertion we made in our last issue of Pillbox. In our reporting on the multi-enfabulator, we erroneously claimed that the panametric fan consisted of hydrocoptic marzelvanes. The enfabulator project team asked us to clarify that vanes are an obsolete technology; the new panametric assembly actually uses a marzel-type fitting with a low slip coefficient to house a reductive chafe-membrane. We deeply apologize for any confusion this has caused. The junior staff writer responsible for the mistake has been locked in the Wasp Room until further notice. 
Last week the CMU Crypto Cats, a cryptocurrency-based student organization, made an announcement saying they had finalized development on an original cryptocurrency that they call AndyCoin.
The most novel aspect of this currency is the design of its "blockchain." For those unfamiliar, blockchains (also known as "Distributed Ledger Technology") are the means by which a cryptocurrency operates. Simply put, they are a ledger of every transaction that occurs with the associated cryptocurrency. The blockchain gets stored on hundreds, if not thousands of different computers, meaning that the official tally of who has how many coins is distributed among many different people — this is how they keep the record decentralized. Anytime somebody wishes to transfer cryptocurrency, their request must be approved by every computer on the network before a new transaction is appended to the end of the blockchain. As long as all the versions of the blockchain agree, people can freely trade crypto without the need for a central authority. 
In their announcement, the Crypto Cats explain their work. "With data obfuscation, procedural obtuseness, and consumer-end price volatility as our primary goal, work has been proceeding on developing a novel blockchain protocol that would maximize speculative financial contributions while also inflating the apparent individual commodity value. The value of AndyCoin in conventional fiat currency is realized through an innovative process that converts asset bundles from recent investors into payout for earlier contributors." They also explain their motivation, claiming, "we wanted to spread the gospel of Web3 and crypto to the students of Carnegie Mellon University, and what better way than to create a CMU-centered cryptocurrency?" According to their announcement, their end goal is to phase out flex-cash and replace it entirely with AndyCoins. "Students will soon be able to buy into this exciting new currency, and those who adopt early may even make a small profit once we see widespread acceptance." 
The only new principle involved is that instead of the blockchain relying on proof-of-stake verification, the chain operates on a micro-bid-oriented matrix-scape wherein any front-end certifications are initially sent downstream to the public DAO server (provided that the bid tokens are still functionally fungible at the moment of a transaction). After a user sends a transaction request, a new appendage is made to the ledger after its vector multiples are consummated. The user is then sent an aggregated metadata packet which gets reoriented into a unique 64-bit hash ledger, allowing their crypto wallet to receive the appropriate funds. Spontaneous executions within the liminal void space are of course a concern, however the wire-stack permits integration of a null-key by verified DAO accounts to mitigate the effects of this. Furthermore, Linux-based aggregation dummies are entirely forbidden to minimize the need for null-admin interventions. A lymphatically-driven class arbitrator will also be semantically employed to prevent a consensus fork in the chain, thus encouraging token stability.
When asked what inspired this revolutionary new procedure, the team leader cited the principle of "minimally distal bar sequences'' pioneered by Herbert Simon. This principle, developed by legendary Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Herbert Simon (the namesake of Newell-Simon Hall), demonstrates that low-echelon bin operators will always arbitrate the nearest local bar sequence in a skew-framework. The Crypto Cats have ingeniously employed this principle in such a way that the blockchain can more efficiently integrate the proximal components of the distal command network.
The announcement has also garnered attention from the founder of Ether, Vitalik Buterin, who attended a recent conference hosted by the Crypto Cats. "I'm so excited to see the future of computing getting so involved with Web3. Carnegie Mellon has been at the forefront of computer science for decades, and these kids are continuing that tradition by revolutionizing the efficiency with which blockchains can concentrate crypto-backed assets among select stakeholders". He added, "I'm particularly interested to see how these new ideas might be integrated into the metaverse". 
Such exciting news. At any rate, this reporter is sold on the idea, and I look forward to the prospect of minting an NFT of Farnam Jahanian on the AndyCoin blockchain. To the moon!

Cass,
Things are always harder, more complicated than they need to be. Every time I finish a paper, there is another one to follow it — more in depth, more researched, clearer, more truthful. Nothing is ever enough at The Big U, or at least that’s what Professor Steinhardt says. He also says that honesty is never an excuse for bad writing. In that case, I feel very well prepared to succeed in all of my coursework while still leading a life I find fulfilling, interesting, and healthy.
You know I ran into Henry again last night? He was with Sasha and Candace and Heron, and they were walking together back to 5C. It seemed like really perfect timing, because he had asked me to get dinner that morning and I hadn’t responded. Didn’t want to look like I cared too much. Of course, I care. And when I saw him, I told him I’d go, and he said, “Now?” and I said “Sure!” even though my planner was screaming at me from inside my backpack to go home and open my laptop and do anything else but sit and eat with this short, fluffy-haired boy. You have to admit, his hair is excessively fluffy for being so dark. 
Also, Lou wrote me yesterday, which I know you already know about because I never shut up about Lou and how I feel about Lou and how Lou feels about me and how I hate him and love him at the same time. I told him so, and honestly, it made me feel better, even though the conversation was no more than a dream, again. It’s been almost a year. How could he even exist anymore, let alone speak to me, really and truly?
This is what I was thinking about as I walked to the Underground with Henry. After Lou, it feels like I don’t have the stamina to do it all again, but I went anyway, even though the Underground should be terrible. Somehow, I find myself there constantly this semester, often with you, I guess. Mostly to get an Undergrownie or some of those cheese sticks. Which, of course, is exactly what I got with Henry, in addition to a bowl of pasta. I hope you don’t feel betrayed by my sharing of our tradition, but eating things that make my brain happy is simply too important in these times.
It is taking me a really long time to tell this story, as it always does, and even though I don’t think I could cover my whole conversation with Henry even if I wanted to do that. The important thing is that it was really fun and he was nice to talk to and he told me how he’s from Vermont and studying chemistry and Heron is his best friend in the entire world and they went to high school together.
It was then that I remembered seeing Heron in Gardens, which I mentioned to him. I asked him if he knew that Heron knew my suitemate, and how. He said he had never heard him mention her before nor could he think of any way that he would have known her. He also said that Heron was at their apartment the night I saw him. So.
He also mentioned someone named Bridget, who he thought I might know. Apparently she’s in APhi, so I thought you might know about her. Just another character, I guess.
So anyways, that happened. I thought I’d update you. Kind of silly.
In exchange, I would love to hear more about your little lunch with Wendy last weekend. I know we talked about it, but I’m curious to hear more. There are so many stories that make up the majority of the experience here, and each one always has more important details than it seems to at first. Like how I met Eric during orientation and he said that really silly thing about my hair being pretty and I came back and told everyone how silly it was, but I failed to mention that he was in all of your classes and now you’re friends with him and I missed it completely. Just something I was thinking about.
Also, good luck on your econ exam tomorrow; you’re gonna kill it.
Love,
Mags

Good morning, afternoon, evening and night, loyal Tartan readers! I’m back with what you’ve all been waiting for: more Paul Dano content! The subject of this week’s indulgence is “Swiss Army Man” (2016), written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. “Swiss Army Man” follows Hank (played by Paul Dano) as he escapes a remote island and then attempts to find his way back to society, aided by Manny (played by Daniel Radcliffe), a corpse with some special powers. While Hank tries to get Manny to remember his life before death, the pair grow an unbreakable bond as they work through lessons about life, love, and what it means to be weird. 
This movie is delightful.  Despite the heavy tone of the opening, things quickly improve as soon as Manny enters the scene by washing up on shore and distracting Hank from his suicide attempt. While this is quite a sweet movie showcasing the bond between a man and his new corpse best friend, it is also ripe with just ridiculous humor. More specifically, farting is a large part of the plot in this movie. If you like a good fart joke, this movie should absolutely be on your watchlist. Manny is just letting ‘em rip, one right after the other, but not for naught! Hank actually escapes his island by riding Manny like a fart-powered jet ski, and in the end of the movie (spoiler alert) Manny farts himself off into the sunset, giving Hank a soft smile as he flatulates himself to eternal freedom from the standards of society. In between the farts, there are plenty of genuine moments between Hank and Manny, as Hank attempts to teach Manny how to be “normal.” This includes Hank teaching Manny all about the joys of car rides, movies, and eating at restaurants, as well as lessons on how to talk to girls, despite the fact that Hank is cripplingly shy in real life. All of these lessons are aided by lots of fun props and simple machines constructed out of forest materials and trash, and the girl-talk lessons come complete with Hank dressed up as Sarah, the supposed object of Manny’s affections. Their relationship has its ups and downs, but the overall impression this movie left me with was that of a sweet friendship (and perhaps something more?). 
I want to shout out the cinematography and editing for this movie. One of my favorite parts was a montage sequence around the middle of the movie, during Hank’s lessons for Manny. It’s all shot and edited like your classic falling-in-love flashback montage, but everywhere there would be a beautiful girl, it’s instead Paul Dano in a dress and a ratty wig. The style of this movie is just immaculate, and one of it's best features in my opinion. Every time I saw a quirkily edited sequence I was just like, “Oh yeah. This is the good stuff.” Having done some research into the editor of this movie, Matthew Hannam, this makes sense. Hannam has gone on the record saying, “I’ve always made very, very strange films.” What more do you need to know?
Of course, this wouldn’t be my review if I didn’t mention the score. One of the first things that stands out about this score is that it has no instruments! Eagle-eared listeners will notice that this is a reference to the fact that Hank is alone in the wilderness with no instruments. While it’s a quite obvious link, it still made me smile every time a silly a cappella version of the “Jurassic Park” theme came on. There’s also a brief mention of “Cotton Eyed Joe,” which proves that this is a movie after my own heart. The lack of instruments throughout most of the score also makes it just that much more impactful towards the end of the movie when we get some sweet little string moments. It’s a good, clean score, and heavily features Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. Chef’s kiss.
Overall, this movie is very good, but also very weird. The acting and editing and production are all just so good, but when the credits rolled at the end, I was not shocked in the least to realize that it was an A24 film. Weird is definitely not bad, but just keep that in mind when you’re scrolling through various streaming services looking for a silly little movie to watch. This film is gonna get a good rating from me, because not only was it unhinged, it included Dano and Radcliffe being freaky little weirdos (the best type of characters). While I did thoroughly enjoy this movie, it doesn’t rank at the top of my charts. In the end I’d say that all of the warm gasses being let out in this movie elevate it, and “Swiss Army Man” will earn a “silly little movie with silly little guys in it :)” on the "Good Time - Bad Time" scale.

It is so hard to be a music critic nowadays. Clocking in to write your required maudlin words about some miserable little work. Your purpose is gone, and your opinion doesn’t matter. The job of music critic has become one of the most wretched among an already detestable journalistic field. If you write reviews of music, I hate you. My hate is undoubtedly not the only hate that you receive. Not only does your shrinking heart hate what it’s college-graduate, big-city-dreaming owner has done with their degree in Media Writing, you receive hate daily from the most illustrious elements of the internet, just because you dared to give “Harry’s House” a 7.2 instead of an 8.5, or “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” a light 6 instead of a strong 10. Well, I am here to tell you that all this hate is correct. In the words of one Low Tier God, “Your life is NOTHING. You serve ZERO purpose.”
This position can be decried as needlessly inflammatory, or perhaps simply a manifestation of my jealousy. After all, I am what some may call an unsuccessful music critic. My infrequent analyses of musical works have — although been described as "beautifully written" and "great" — not made much of an impression. I don’t reach the lofty checks given to freelancers writing for as illustrious mags as Pitchfork, and I receive a mere portion of the hate mail sent to critics with wider audiences. But, not only am I not just a music critic, I’m also not a music critic. Out of the 26 articles I have written for the Tartan, a mere 3 have been reviews of musical releases. I don’t write for the deadline; I write with skin in the game.
The thing you have to understand about the field of music journalism is that it is the cross product of two dying mediums. Media writing is somehow an overcrowded field that is also lacking almost any writers of worth. This lack of worthy writers leads to the remaining pack of minnows fighting over meager pay checks to write drivel. All lacking taste, yet somehow meant to be the taste-makers. So what is going on here?
On the one hand, people are much more adverse to paying directly for what they consume. In general, people don’t purchase newspaper subscriptions, so this is a direct form of revenue that these papers and magazines have been losing. The switch to an advertising-based model has forced companies to reduce their workforce, pay, and focus more on making individual articles that people will click. Here lies clickbait, as well as “We hired a freelancer to say that the thing you like is dogshit.” But people have been critical of the field for longer than this. As Piero Scarucci wrote in an infamous 1999 article, “The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ‘the greatest or most significant or most influential’ rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.” [https://www.scaruffi.com/vol1/beatles.html]
Beyond all the generic problems already associated with the state of modern journalism, the field of modern music criticism finds itself faced with three fatal flaws: redundancy, fear, and necessity.
Fatal flaw number one: There is nothing left to say about these albums. The modern critic has no cultural context, no interesting perspective, absolutely nothing new to say. And of course the subject of their reviews will frequently not help them. Say I am an NYU graduate trying to write the review for Drake’s “Honestly, Nevermind,” an already insipid album devoid of artistic merit. I don’t have any personal context that can permeate my review, giving it something more. I must therefore simply describe the album, try to explain anything about the context that led to the release of the album, and write a few “witty” zingers about the album. But of course, who cares about the content of the review, all we need is the little number attached. If it’s less than 7.4, then it’s bad, otherwise good.
It’s important to write an article that contains the point of view of an expert, so I asked Anna Cappella, music lover and critic who has written eleven reviews for The Tartan (one of them was even negative), why she did what she does. Her statement:
“I think that the reason that I write music criticism is that I want everyone to know what I think (because I'm really self-centered). This doesn’t mean that anyone should care what I think, because if I write a music review I don't care what anyone else says about it. Music criticism is for the critic and not the reader, therefore ending up completely pointless for the musician and the readers. The musicians should search for better feedback than that from someone writing at 2 a.m. about an album they listened to less than three times.”
Fatal flaw number two: Complete and abject fear. An envelope of fear has enveloped modern pop-timists, fear of the fans. They can be brutal, roving gangs of Twitter teenagers there to strike fear in the hearts of all self-respecting adults. Where do they get the time to argue, make fan-cams, be racist? These people have abandoned everything: their homework, their friends, pre-marital sex, all to support their favorite artists. In the same way that the Daily Mail can create a whole week of news based off tweets with three likes each, these other journalists get this fear. How else can you explain the trend of the apology tour, where a publication releases an article by an overpaid freelancer apologizing for articles written by other overpaid freelancers. See Consequence’s article, "What Were We Thinking? 15 Times We Were Wrong", subtitled “Consider this our mea culpa for some bad takes over the years.” And they are correct, they do have some truly atrocious takes here. But apologizing for “Screwing up the Metacritic score” of an album is reprehensible. And of course, we get an apology for their list of the greatest songs of all time. Man, what a dumb concept. Nobody has ever used one of those lists to find new music to listen to, and nobody at Concept has the intellectual or cultural capacity to accurately determine the best music, so all that remains is a list for us to Control F our favorite songs for, and then get mad when they aren’t there. How pathetic.
Now we arrive to our final favorite flaw: necessity, or the lack thereof. As music has gotten more accessible, the need for music critics has lessened and lessened, now reaching its critical failure point. Let’s say Harry Styles releases his new album. Why would anyone ever need a review of it? There is no revealing of a hidden gem, no saving of anybody's time, no interesting critical analysis of the forms in a Cahiers du Cinema kind of way. Practically all music can now be easily and instantaneously listened to for free. The barrier of entry is on the ground. I don’t need a gatekeeper to tell me if I should save my money or time, in the way a movie critic would. Music listening is a passive activity that can now be done whenever, wherever. Nobody needs to be told an album oozes easy charisma, or has a subtle charm. You have given me nothing I couldn’t learn myself. Just completely pointless.
If you write musical criticism, you should never complain about it. You have been gifted a fake job, and should be thanking God every day you are being paid so much more than what you deserve. Congratulations on your job as a parasite, leeching hundreths of a percent off whatever megacorp owns the business that owns your magazine. Once they take notice, I pray you are squashed like the gnat you are.

For some reason, recent K-pop girl groups have been able to gain almost instantaneous popularity, and the newest NewJeans is a prime example. They feel smooth and laid-back but upbeat, Gen Z and TikTok-inspired. As of now, they have 10 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and that's with just four songs released!
For those who are unfamiliar with the group, here's a quick glimpse at their popularity: They debuted on Aug. 1 this year, and by Aug. 18, they won first place on Mnet’s “M Countdown” for their song "Attention" over Girls' Generation “FOREVER 1.” (For reference, Girls' Generation was once a big name in the K-pop industry; They disbanded in 2017 but made a reappearance this year with "FOREVER 1.") Now, just two months after they've debuted, NewJeans has become the first fourth-generation group to surpass 10 million monthly listeners on Spotify. I must again emphasize that they've only released four songs so far.
The group seems like it was built for early success: Two of their members are former models, and one of them was an opera singer. Minji and Hanni were both featured in the BTS "Permission to Dance" music video, as NewJeans and BTS are both groups under entertainment company HYBE. Jessi, a popular solo K-pop artist known for her bluntness, has praised their success. Other big name K-pop stars have also dance-covered some of their most popular songs, "Hype Boy" and "Attention." Even the name NewJeans is a reference to how jeans never go out of style.
Like many others, I became a fan of their newest and first album, self-titled as "New Jeans," pretty quickly. For the record, I'm pretty limited in genre terminology, so this review is mostly vibes-based.
I am obsessed with their song "Attention," so I am a bit biased in this review. This song feels slick, cool, clean, and so groovy. For background, the song is basically about someone who has a crush on somebody and they want attention from them. I love the chorus so much. They sing, "You got me looking for attention," drawing out the "Attention" as the background music continues its chord progression, dancing between major and minor in a way that makes the chorus not feel repetitive despite being repeated like 10 times throughout the song. It makes me feel the way the end of a sunset feels, with the sky still slightly aglow, but the majority of buildings fading into pale blue shadows. It makes me feel both confident and curious, laid-back but with a want to try everything that the world has to offer. In this song, their vocals don't actually stand out that much, but the way they transition from the clarity of their lower vocals to the softness of their upper ranges complements the backtrack so well. Also, whenever Danielle and Hanni say "You give me butterflies, you know," my heart melts. It's such a cute lyric.
"Hype Boy" is probably the fastest and most upbeat song in the album. It's got a bit of electro and synths going on with a light beat that speeds up, especially in the beginning and the pre-chorus, then gives way to the vocals and chorus. This song definitely emphasizes their vocals more than "Attention," with more belting and brighter vocals. The song is about someone who is anxious for the person they like to call them back, and combined with the up-beat but slick music, it reminds me a lot of high school.
"Hurt" is a pretty cute song, soft with a little bit of lo-fi vibes. While not particularly standout in terms of vocals or music, it doesn't feel too derivative either. It feels more like a comfort song, like a warm blanket on a Sunday morning or a pillow to hug as you lie down and stare at the ceiling.
"Cookie" is an okay song. It's slow but upbeat, and in terms of background music, it feels very minimal, with little bits of synth and a clean, laid-back drum backing. The chorus is interesting, with the singers suspending the word "cookie" as the background music continues to play. Apparently, cookies in the song are a metaphor for NewJeans' music, about how once you "get a taste" of their music, you won't be able to resist "taking another bite."
Overall, I think their vocals are pretty good; soft, not really a traditional belting pop voice, a little bit of vocal fry. Their vocal immaturity does kind of shine through sometimes, with some unstable notes every once in a while. I'd be pretty interested in hearing how they do with louder songs, or just different types of songs in general. 
Beyond their music though, they've gotten some interesting press and attention for how young they are. Their ages range from 14-18, and hence, people have expressed concern about middle-aged men attending their fan sign events. But honestly, 14-18 is actually not uncommon for the K-pop industry, as trainees tend to join entertainment companies pretty young, but not too common for a group this popular, as it usually takes a lot longer for younger groups to gain fame. I would agree that perhaps the members should avoid conducting fan sign events until all of them are above 18, but it's also a little weird that NewJeans specifically has been called out for being unusually young, and brings up suspicions about the demographics of fans.
In addition, their debut song was "Cookie," which some English viewers interpreted as slang for female genitalia, and also connecting it to some of the lyrics in the song. In response, NewJeans' label ADOR put out a statement on how they consulted a variety of professionals, found that any food they picked would have had a variety of interpretations, and also that the sexual interpretation of "cookie" was very uncommon. They believed that while some could interpret it as such, it was natural for different listeners to project their own expectations and cultural beliefs. ADOR elaborated in their pretty direct but kind of scathing statement: "If someone wants to stir up controversy, then, it isn’t any specific words that’s problematic but any words they choose to target at all. Importantly, words take on entirely different informal meanings in the context of different cultures, places, and at different times in history, so judging how suitable any one word is is ambiguous at best. [...] What we don’t condone, and what we regret to see, is those people who stir up controversy for its own sake but under the deceptive guise of protecting minors."
In any case, I find their popularity rightfully deserved, but I'm also genuinely surprised at how quickly they got popular. The speed of their popularity reminds me a lot of ITZY and Aespa, both of which gained popularity equivalent to older girl groups like Red Velvet despite debuting in 2019 and 2020 respectively. But even then, I don't think it was nearly as quick as NewJeans' popularity. Some of it probably does have to do with TikTok: K-pop groups recently have upped their TikTok game, with dance challenge after dance challenge after dance challenge. IVE's "Eleven" definitely took off on TikTok for their hand dance, as did ITZY's "Wannabe" for Ryujin's shoulder dance. Likewise, NewJeans' "Hype Boy" took off on TikTok for their dance challenge that requires two people, but when pulled off, the symmetry and asymmetry between the two dancers is so attention-grabbing and cool to watch.
I'll definitely continue to follow NewJeans as their music evolves and their group stabilizes a bit after the initial wave of controversy. I'm excited to see if they'll venture into new music styles and watch as they grow vocally and in stage presence as artists.

In May 2022, a group of students and staff and Carnegie Mellon released what they call the Carnegie Mellon Voter Engagement Action Plan. This voter engagement plan was put together as part of the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenger, which describes itself as an organization that, ”Through institutional engagement, direct student engagement, and fostering a national higher education network, ALL IN strives for an electorate that mirrors our country’s makeup and in which college students are democratically engaged on an ongoing basis, during and between elections, and not just at the polls.”
The group behind this plan is the Voter Engagement Committee, which was formed last year. 
“The Voter Engagement Committee was formed for a couple of reasons. First there was a desire to work on coordination of our democratic engagement efforts on campus, to help with collaboration and marketing of these efforts,” Meggan Lloyd, who serves as a Coordinator at SLICE and on the committee, said.
This upcoming November, the 2022 midterm elections will be taking place. The voter engagement plan has set a few standards for the University community to meet: Narrow the gap between registered students and students who vote to less than 10 percent, reach an 80 percent voting rate for registered students in the midterm elections, and have an overall student voting rate of 80 percent for the 2022 election.
To achieve this, several plans are in place, including the formation of a voter ambassador program that is part of the voter engagement plan. “The ambassador program provides low-level time commitment opportunities for students, such as helping with voter registration drives, creating social media creation, and hosting events like democratic engagement trivia games,” Lloyd said. 
A lot of the plan’s aspects are based on the information gathered by the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE). The data is “the result of matching student enrollment records with public voting files.”
“NSLVE [sic] is an initiative of The Institute for Democracy & Higher Education (IDHE). IDHE has a partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse, and to compile NSLVE [sic] data IDHE matches data submitted to the National Clearinghouse with publicly-available voter registration and turnout records,” Lloyd said. “Once the records have been matched, the Clearinghouse de-identifies the records (all names and information identifying individual students is removed) and sends the records to IDHE, who then compiles a report and sends it to institutions. [sic]” 
The data in the report reveals a lot about the voting habits of Carnegie Mellon students. For instance, in the 2020 election, while 58 percent of the 18 to 21 years old population at Carnegie Mellon voted, only 28 percent of the 22 to 24 years old population voted. This lines up with the disparity between undergraduate and graduate engagement: 57 percent of the eligible undergraduate population voted while 32 percent of the graduate population voted. 
Gaps like this are also seen between the colleges. While fields like English languages and literature had a voter participation rate of 79 percent, only 33 percent of students in computer and information science voted. 
“I remember student research groups talking about these issues, and interviewing other students and doing focus groups on campus; they definitely found that there was tons of variation and how much people talked about this in their majors, and how much content they'd ever related to things in class,” assistant professor in the Institute for Politics and Strategy Dan Silverman said. Silverman served as an advisory resource to those on the Voter Engagement Committee. “There was almost a total void in  [computer science], in terms of getting political material and class. And so, I think that's not going to entirely change, but it's something to think about, as you look at resource allocation. I mean, those are smart, young students who are forming their beliefs and even more than a quarter of them might want to express them, even if they super busy. Maybe hearing a case about how all the technological innovation they're doing is still so shaped and constrained by politics. And so I think there's just a lot of room to grow there by major.”
As it currently stands, students are expected to attend class on election day, which is slated to be Tuesday, Nov. 8. 
Sophomore Brenna Wrubel is a part of the Voter Engagement Committee, but she also serves as minority inspector of elections in her hometown. This means she has to be present at polls during the entire day, so she cannot attend classes on election day. While the University encourages professors and staff to be flexible on election day, there is no set policy regarding what should be done.
“I had a class and when I went to vote before I was running the election, I had to go vote, and then drive back up for my class. And there was one class that said, ‘Yeah, okay, you are totally fine to miss this class.’ And then there was another where they didn't say anything about it,” Wrubel said. “So it's sort of haphazard, and each individual teacher can do that right now to decide their attendance policy. So I did talk to them about getting that more standardized at the university wide level. To say, yes, you can miss class today for election stuff. And I would like to see it be a federal holiday, and also a university holiday. I'm not sure how close we are to that though.”
Voter engagement has been hitting Carnegie Mellon ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. 
There have been various student groups, faculty members, and community partners around campus that have been working to get students registered to vote. According to Lloyd, an email will be sent out for National Voter Education Week that highlights events of the week and will include a reminder for students to register to vote and for them to check their voter registration status. 
According to Liz Vaughan, Director at SLICE and a member of the Voter Engagement Committee, this is just the beginning for the committee. “We've been steadily sort of chipping away at [voter engagement] every election cycle; we've had the goal of trying to be in a better place than we were the year prior trying new strategies and just trying to build momentum and build off of that momentum,” she said. “But it was really exciting when we decided to create the action plan, because we were at a point in that progress that we were seeing gains that having a longer, longer vision was going to allow us to help to make 10-year plans, think about resources, think about new programs, or initiatives that needed to be developed, that it makes that work more year round.”
As getting out and voting is the end goal, Vaughan emphasized the smaller interactions that students have with their friends as a way to get others out to vote. “We want students to be having those 3 a.m. conversations in the residence hall, getting into these discussions with their student organization meetings, and, ideally, making a plan to head to their polling place with their house man, or whatever it might be.”
On the SLICE website, there are resources for students who want to learn more about the upcoming election. This includes an election day FAQ, sample ballots, a polling place lookup, and more.

Starbucks branches across the United States have been unionizing at an unprecedented speed, with over 200 stores unionizing since December 2021. Carnegie Mellon’s own neighborhood Starbucks, located at the intersection of Forbes Ave and South Craig Street, voted to unionize this past May. The Tartan spoke with Kyli Hilaire (Dietrich, '25) to learn about the obstacles these workers encountered. 
Their first step in forming their union was to create an organizing committee, a core group of "partners" (a Starbucks term meaning employees) who volunteer to spearhead the effort. Their committee, consisting of two University of Pittsburgh and two Carnegie Mellon students, "contacted each other around the same time," so the effort "came together naturally," Hilaire said.  
Prior to Craig Street, Hilaire worked at the Elmwood branch in her home town of Buffalo, NY, which made headlines last December for being the first company-owned store to unionize. She says that her coworkers from Buffalo put her into contact with Daisy Pitkin, a local organizer who guided them through the process. 
The next step involved getting at least three-quarters of the partners at the store to sign an "interest card," after which the local organizer can begin negotiations with Starbucks' lawyers to decide the terms of a union vote.
This, Hilaire says, is where the corporate malfeasance began. The Craig Street branch, located between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon, is staffed largely by college students who don't stay in Pittsburgh over the summer. Starbucks chose May 11 to be the day of their vote, after both schools had let out for the summer. Furthermore, they insisted the vote be in-person, which would exclude many of the interest-card signatories from voting. 
Corporate representatives also put posters up around the branch to discourage workers from unionizing. One poster, pictured here, said that workers who formed unions would lose the right to transfer between stores, alluding to the case of a unionized store in Canada. This is by no means a guaranteed outcome of unionization. 
In another case, the district manager told a partner who worked at the Carnegie Museum that they were not allowed to be in two unions at once. This is not true, and furthermore, it is illegal to say this. Corporations are required by law to bargain "in good faith," and to imply they've already decided a term of the contract implies they mean to control the outcome. 
Despite this, the representatives of Starbucks Workers United negotiated the use of mail-in ballots for Craig Street, and the partners voted in favor of unionizing by a narrow 9-8 margin. Starbucks still challenged this result, arguing that votes from partners who weren't actively working in the store shouldn't be considered.
Recently, the National Labor Review Board filed a complaint against Starbucks, alleging intimidation against workers at Craig Street and three other Pittsburgh branches.
When asked how working in a unionized store is different, Hilaire pointed to a few tangible improvements. For example, workers are now allowed to have another employee present when receiving disciplinary action. However, the final step is for the workers to negotiate a new contract, a process which can take months or years — Starbucks has yet to ratify a contract with the first unionized branch in Buffalo. 
Hillaire says that one of their main goals is to "establish a base of security." She describes a work environment in which the number of schedulable hours are determined by corporate representatives, who often "stretch [the workers] thin" through deliberate understaffing. If your shift gets cut because there's not enough hours to go around, Starbucks provides no recourse. The scheduling happens "at will," and the workers have no protections or safety net. 
This is one of the many issues that has spurred workers to organize. Hilaire says that talking with organizers across the country opened her eyes to certain larger issues that she had no firsthand experience with. She learned about workers with disabilities being mistreated, people being forced to work with their abusers, and people accused of workplace harassment being shuffled around to new stores. "We can do nothing, just go into work and go home. Or when the opportunity is there you can do something about it … even if you're not dealing with the big problems, you have to join in the effort, because we can't really do it in small numbers."
Craig Street is one of now 11 Starbucks stores in Pittsburgh to have unionized, and Starbucks Workers United is continuing to establish the infrastructure for large-scale organizing.

On Sept. 14, two planes of migrants were sent to Martha’s Vineyard from a shelter in San Antonio, leading to over 50 people being relocated. The person behind these flights? Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 
CNN’s Amy Simonson explains that this group included seven families, including four young children, who were originally from Venezuela before making their way to the U.S. The New York Times’ Patricia Mazzei gives further context to the group’s journey, explaining how many of the families had crossed from Venezuela up through the Darien Gap before going through Central America and Mexico and arriving in Texas. Many families spent days in immigration detention before being released, where they were told they could receive passage to Boston, Mass.
Instead of arriving in Boston, the group landed in Martha’s Vineyard, a small island off the coast of Massachusetts. 
The group was sent without advance notice, leaving the community to scramble to pull together enough resources to support them. The residents of Martha’s Vineyard rose to the challenge, with Simonson noting that officials came together to provide “shelter, food, and care to individuals,” and finding them a bed to sleep in for the night. Matt Dixon of Politico notes that local high school AP Spanish students even left class to serve as translators for the migrants, to ensure that their needs were being met. 
Such actions weren’t an isolated occurrence or one-off plan by DeSantis. In fact, they were part of his campaign strategy, and only the latest of Florida’s immigration policies. Jessica Chasmar of Fox News explains how this action was DeSantis following through on “his promise to drop off illegal immigrants in progressive states,” making the argument that such individuals were let into the country due to these progressive state’s policies, and thus not only should they share the burden in caring for them, but that such areas can do so better. Chasmar furthers that such actions were funded by a recent appropriation of $12 million by the Florida legislature to implement an “immigration relocation program.”
Florida isn’t alone in such policies. Mazzei furthers that Republican Governor Greg Abbott has been doing this tactic for months, using buses instead of planes. Similar actions have also been taken by the state of Arizona. This includes at least 6,200 migrants sent from Texas to Washington, D.C., and additional buses to locations such as Chicago and New York. Simonson furthers that shortly after DeSantis’ move, Abbott sent two buses of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in Washington, D.C. 
The difference, Mazzei explains, is that DeSantis’ actions are an escalation of these existing policies. 
The use of flights and DeSantis’ refusal to give advance notice to the communities he’s sending migrants to are causing panic in immigrant support groups and states who’ve been named as potential destinations. Luckily, Dixon furthers, relief groups are collaborating to prepare for future planes of migrants from DeSantis, using informal networks between immigration and advocacy organizations to “rapidly deploy services once they get news of the next flight.” He furthers that such groups are strengthening coordination and increasing services across the board, bulking up existing networks that have existed in response to the “confusion and disorder DeSantis and Abbott’s migrant transports are causing.” 
DeSantis also chose a more politically-motivated destination than in prior relocation initiatives. Fox News’ Jessica Chasmar describes the area as a “playground for rich progressives, including former President Barack Obama,” representing a common Republican viewpoint that could be shared by DeSantis. Such a small island reliant on seasonal visits from wealthy residents does not have the resources to sustain the immigrant population. Mazzei explains how the migrants had to stay in a church because their homeless shelter only had room for ten people, how the island itself faces a serious lack of affordable housing, and how the plane came at the end of their summer season, meaning there are no available jobs throughout the winter for the migrants to work. 
This new iteration of migrant relocations has led to legal investigations. 
Mazzei notes that while it is not illegal for migrants to travel throughout the U.S. once released from immigration custody, and similarly not against the law for state governments to finance that travel, the migrants on the Martha’s Vineyard flights have filed a suit against DeSantis and other Florida officials for doing so through use of a “fraudulent and discriminatory scheme” through lies concerning the journey. Eve Zuckoff of NPR interviewed several of these migrants, who told her that a woman approached them outside the shelter, luring them into boarding the plane with promises of a safe flight to Boston, expedited work papers, and other support systems. These people were left confused when the plane turned up in a different destination without the promised support, leaving local Martha’s Vineyard police with the burden of explaining what had happened to them.
Reporters at Orlando Weekly covered the current lawsuit, stating that asylum seekers are seeking “a nationwide injunction to block the governor from luring immigrants to travel across state lines.” Such a suit would include monetary damages, and would prevent the DeSantis administration from using fraud and misrepresentation to convince people to cross state lines. Orlando Weekly furthers that the migrants were told false promises that they would “receive employment, housing, educational opportunities and other like assistance” in Boston, and given official-looking documents in a welcome-package-like folder, which contained false information about the immigration process with benefits that wouldn’t apply for the group of Venezuelan immigrants. The difference between this case and previous migrant movements is the manner with which the immigrants were treated, not the movement itself.
Updates on this groundbreaking lawsuit and future actions by DeSantis and other states regarding migrant relocation are expected to play out over the coming months, and be a crucial issue in the coming elections.

On Sept. 22, the Carnegie Mellon community received an update email regarding COVID-19 on campus and news about upcoming booster clinics. 
“The university’s approach this year is one of transition. We are monitoring the factors that influence campus spread, but are focusing on case severity as the thinking and guidance from the various public health agencies move in that direction,” Chief Information Officer and COVID-19 Coordinator Stan Waddell wrote to The Tartan.
Per the Carnegie Mellon COVID-19 dashboard, 98 percent of the campus community is vaccinated and 96 percent have received at least one booster shot. Carnegie Mellon currently requires individuals that have not been approved for an exemption to have the initial vaccination plus at least one approved booster. The University will be hosting clinics on Sept. 28, Oct. 24, and Nov. 15 for individuals to receive the new bivalent booster. This booster is designed to “provide broader protection against the virus, including its Omicron subvariants.” Flu vaccines are also available for members of the community.
When students came to campus last year, they were required to take two baseline tests; this requirement was not in place for this year. “We did discuss the baseline testing requirement. We elected to not require one for the start of the semester in accordance with changing guidance from the CDC and to be in alignment with many other higher education institutions,” Waddell said. “This being said, CMU continued to provide access to home testing kits and Tartan Testing was open and available for testing and many community members continue to take advantage of those options.”
This past week, Sept. 19 to Sept. 22, a total of 45 positive COVID-19 cases were reported according to the Carnegie Mellon public dataset. Of those, 29 were students and 16 were staff, faculty, and vendors. 
“The case counts are higher this year than in previous years, but the campus community continues to report low levels of case severity. In fact, we have had no hospitalizations due to COVID since April of 2022. Also, data from the past couple of weeks indicate, positivity rates continue to drop in our observed testing (Tartan Testing and UHS),” Waddell wrote.
The campus community is still encouraged to take part in Tartan Testing. Between Sept. 19 and Sept. 21, a total of 92 Tartan Tests were completed; two people tested positive for a positivity rate of 2.17 percent. This is just under the previous week’s positivity percent of 2.34 percent. The COVID-19 dashboard did not reflect the data for the week of Sept. 19 as of Sept. 25; the numbers were only reported in the public dataset. 
While masking is not required on campus, there are KN95 facial coverings and at-home test kits available in vending machines around campus. 
However, per the policy established in the campus’ COVID-19 communication earlier this semester, isolation housing is no longer being provided by the University. This has prompted questions about students and faculty who have been deemed “close contact.”
“The university shifted to an "isolate in place" model of isolation and quarantine in April of 2022. Given what we learned from this approach during the 2022 spring and summer terms, members of our campus community can navigate a positive test result and recover in place effectively,” Waddell wrote. “This approach is similar to how residents have historically navigated communicable illnesses such as the flu or mononucleosis.”
Students should continue to attend class unless they have tested positive for COVID-19 or are experiencing symptoms. Students are also expected to report their positive result through the online self-reporting form on the University’s webpage.
In regards to how Carnegie Mellon has navigated the pandemic so far, Waddell says the University's response has been “highly effective.” He cites the University's use of data; testing resources through UHS, Tartan Testing, and at-home tests; staffing for medical care and contact tracing; and the University’s ability to be nimble as the strengths that has helped the University navigate through the pandemic.

On Wednesday, Sept. 14 Florida Governor Ron DeSantis flew approximately 50 predominately Venezuelan immigrants from Texas to Massachusetts under false pretenses — he engaged in human trafficking. The people in power need to stop playing chess with the lives of those too disadvantaged to prevent themselves from being used as pawns.
What stood out to me the most while doing research about DeSantis’ actions wasn’t the amount of money spent on organizing only two plane trips, or the lack of empathy in his public statements. It was a quote by one of the immigrants, which when asked about why he boarded the plane, said, “Look, when you have no money and someone offers help, well, it means a lot.” 
These weren’t just people who were tricked into getting on a plane being told they were going one place and ending up in another. Instead, these are people who have spent weeks struggling to make it to a place where they can start over, and who are hoping that maybe, just maybe, this time someone is willing to help make their journey easier. DeSantis took advantage of that hope, making these people believe that they would finally get somewhere where they could have a better life, only to arrive there and have no one know they were coming.
What really struck me as cruel about DeSantis’ policies wasn’t the actual act of moving migrants from a red state to a blue state. It was the way they dehumanized the people while doing it, making it a clear political stunt focused more on the impact to polls than it was on those peoples actual lives.
This wasn’t about getting immigrants to a place where they can be better supported, or even about alleviating Florida’s immigration burden. If it was, DeSantis would have sent migrants from Florida, not Texas, and would have sent them to a major city, not a small island resort community with little means to support them. If it was, the governments of these blue states would have been told about the incoming migrants, and immigration support groups would have had time to prepare. If it was, DeSantis wouldn’t have had to lie. Clearly, when these people have as little as they do, they appreciate any measure of support they can get. If he approached this through a lens of humanity and compassion instead of politics, DeSantis and other governors might have realized that and achieved the same outcomes without the backlash and trauma to people who didn’t deserve it.
Blatantly taking advantage of people without support systems shouldn’t be a partisan issue, it’s instead an issue with how our political system runs. The U.S. has made it a smart political move to cause chaos and drama to draw attention to hot button issues before major elections. Our news cycle promotes it, people talk about it, candidates endorse it. But eventually, our focus on shock-inducing political moves needs to have a limit. That limit needs to be respecting each other’s well-being and humanity.
In no world should it be okay to move people across state lines with lies about where they are going and false promises about what they will find when they get there.
Imagine instead of a group of immigrants, it was a group of families on vacation. Fifty people are told they can have the trip of a lifetime, and to them it seems like it’ll happen — they’re housed in a hotel for the days before their private chartered flight, they’re given fancy information packets with all the amenities they can expect from their stay, they’re promised the best housing and food once they get there. But when their plane lands, not only are they on a completely different, unrecognizable island from where they thought they were going, but the local people had no idea they were coming, and, of course, they speak a different language, so communication is hazy at best. Remove the political lens, and the backlash would be universal. There is no reason the company in charge of that trip wouldn’t get in trouble for fraud and misrepresentation. As this literally did happen with the infamous Fyre Festivalwhere the perpetrator was faced with solitary confinement in light of his deception. So why is it different when the group being impacted are immigrants, and the actor is the government?
If anything, it only compounds the issue. If this was merely an issue of a fraudulent vacation, the families could pull out their phones and use Google Translate for communication, or easily book a flight back home and forget this ever happened. For the people who actually just went through this in Martha’s Vineyard, they don’t have a home to go back to, nor the means to use technology and find themselves a simple solution. To drop someone in a new location with no support or warning is just appalling. So regardless of political leaning or views on immigration policy, there is a problem with the way DeSantis is treating people and his total lack of remorse.
Usually when people talk about politics as playing chess, the pieces are metaphorical, and the movements occur in the world of ideas and public thought, not reality. DeSantis took this metaphor literally, moving people across the chessboard that is the United States with little regard for how it impacted any of the other pieces on the field. To him, he could sacrifice a pawn if it got him the King, ignoring the fact that these pawns were human beings with lives and families and aspirations, not plastic toys for his political agenda.

I don’t think it should be a hot take to say that we, as a society, have progressed past the need for monarchy. They are relics of a bygone era, a time before the modern thinking on what government should look like. But against all reason, the majority of the British public maintain support for the monarchy as an institution.
People who want to maintain royals argue that they boost national identity, bring in tourist money, and bring up the simple fact that most people still want them to be there. One of the more common reactions among people I’ve spoken to, though, is that of indifference: “Why does it matter? It’s not like the monarchy actually has any power anymore” — and this is where my objection lies.
It’s easy to believe at first glance that they don’t hold any power or are just figureheads, because the monarchies we read about in history books were absolute. But the fact that they have less power doesn’t mean that they have no power. That seemingly subtle difference has been made crystal clear by the recent death of the Queen. All of the remaining vestiges of royal influence have been dragged unceremoniously out of the woodwork. Currently, one cannot live in the United Kingdom and go about their normal life. The national performance of grief is legally enforced. Everything, and I mean everything, is subject to the official mourning period which runs until the evening of her funeral. While there isn’t a direct mandate to close, there is a strong cultural pressure to do so (see the backlash against the amateur football teams who dared to play after the Queen’s death, as well as the essential services like food banks that closed.) While there isn’t a direct mandate to close, there is a strong cultural pressure to do so (see the backlash against the amateur football teams who dared to play after the Queen’s death, as well as the essential services like food banks that closed.) While under normal circumstances you could go about your life as a sort of conscientious objector to the monarchy, quietly ignoring their existence, that option is no longer available. Regardless of the lack of direct legal mandate, the social pressure makes it so that you effectively must participate in the mourning.
The way the country has been forcefully ground to a screeching halt is a direct example of the power the monarchy maintains. In the days following the Queen’s death, peaceful protestors have quite literally been arrested for holding signs criticizing the monarchy. If you told me about Brits getting arrested for daring to criticize the monarchy, I would assume you were retelling a story from medieval times. But somehow, the “nonexistent” power of the monarchy surpasses the right of free speech to this day.
Fine, fine, I hear you saying — who cares, it’s not like they have any power over the law! Unfortunately though, that is not the case. For example, the brand new King Charles is set to receive a massive royal inheritance… with zero inheritance tax. While the lowly British commoner is usually required to pay a hefty 40 percent tax on “any part of an estate that's valued above a threshold of 325,000 pounds (about $374,000)," the monarchy made a deal with the Prime Minister in 1993 that they would simply not pay inheritance tax… how convenient! This particular arrangement is under fresh scrutiny today given that the United Kingdom is in dire straits financially, facing a massive cost-of-living crisis. While the exact monetary value of the King’s inheritance is not clear, the best guess places it at least in the hundreds of millions of pounds. Queen Elizabeth’s personal net worth was estimated by Forbes to be at least $500 million, while the crown’s real estate holdings are valued in the tens of billions. Even if they didn’t have any political influence — which simply isn’t true — the power inherent in that magnitude of wealth cannot be overlooked.
Everyone knows that the Queen’s (well, soon to be the King’s) face is printed on the UK’s money. But were you aware that Queen Elizabeth’s portrait appears on 32 other currencies? Yes, Lizzie sat at the helm of one of the greatest colonial powers in history. How can anyone claim that someone whose face appears on that much of the world’s currency doesn’t hold significant power or influence?
This is all to say, I find the argument that the British monarchy doesn’t hold any power to be absurd. Remnants of a time long gone are still present in almost every facet of British society. Passports are created in the name of the crown, the King is Head of the Armed Forces in his position as Sovereign, and to this day prime ministers still must be approved by the King.
The simple fact that the monarchy still holds so much power, regardless of how ceremonial their power appears to be, requires us to consider whether we really still want a royal family at all. By definition, this power was granted by virtue of their bloodline.
A question for the royalists out there: if you think royals should still exist, do you really believe they should still hold all this power? As of the most recent coronation (Queen Elizabeth II in 1953), the monarch is anointed with the will of God. The divine right of kings is not a common belief in our society, so it begs the question: Why are they still here? What right do they have to wield this power? How can our modern values coexist with a literal King?
The switch from Queen Elizabeth to King Charles in particular raises some interesting questions about the public’s continued support. Queen Elizabeth kept up the performance of royalty about as well as anyone possibly could, she embodied the idea of royal superiority (and therefore the idea that they were deserving of all that power). But Charles … is normal. Unlike the Queen, his normalcy is widely known by the public. He loses his temper, he has his vices — just like the rest of us. Will the overwhelming public support last in the face of an unlikeable king? More than any other point in history, the monarchy’s continued existence is completely contingent upon the public’s continued desire to keep supporting them. And that shift in the source of their power should really not be overlooked.
In the Middle Ages, the approval of the general public didn’t matter nearly as much. The divine right of kings was so widely believed and enforced that it maintained the legitimacy of their power on its own. The average medieval peasant didn’t know anything about the monarch personally, they didn’t have tabloid media, they just lived in a world where the popular consensus was that there was monarchy because certain bloodlines were appointed by God. Today, though, the source of monarchic legitimacy has shifted to reflect the more democratic system of government — in a world where the public is told that they have a say in their political leaders, public approval of the monarchy is vital to even maintain its existence. 
At this point, once the public moves on, any remaining legitimacy is gone. So until that day, the Crown’s public relations people are toiling in the consent manufacturing factory simply to justify their own existence. So when you’re told that the monarchy is harmless, think about what it really is to be harmless. Because reconsideration and critical thought on the ethics of monarchy could quite literally be their end.

We have heard the story time and time again. A new start-up innovates and finds its place in the industry, only for it to be eaten up (i.e bought by an engorged corporation), dissected, and dissolved so it never sees daylight again. I am truly terrified of this happening to Figma.
Recently, Adobe — which pioneered the modern design world with the invention of the PDF and now commonly known for design platforms such as Photoshop and Illustrator — announced its acquisition of competing design platform Figma for approximately $20 billion in cash and stock.
As someone who has utilized Figma for multiple projects, Figma is a dream. Its real-time collaboration capabilities, fast performance, and intuitive, powerful interface make the support and popularity among designers around Figma almost expected. In comparison, Adobe’s version of Figma is Adobe XD, which designers have critiqued ffor its lackluster and frustrating user experience as well as its somewhat limited use cases.
To be frank, I haven’t had the chance to personally try out Adobe XD. Why? The reason is solely because Adobe seems to love throwing subscription paywalls after a week-long free trial across all of its Creative Cloud platforms while Figma offers free usage for students and educators. Figma welcomes students into the design world while giving the tools and power to create whatever they want. It is because of this that Figma has a dedicated and loyal student and young designer following: the people who also have the most to lose during this acquisition.
There is some hope, however. When Adobe acquired TypeKit, now known as Adobe Fonts, sync limits, “web-only” fonts, and domain limits were all removed. In 2018, Adobe bought e-commerce service Magento, and simply changed its name to Adobe Commerce. For the most part, it seems to be intact. No major changes seem to have been made about its payment structure, free options, or services. So clearly, there is some good news. But that doesn’t mean we can ignore the possibility that Adobe can make impactful changes and ruin Figma as we know it. 
While Adobe and Figma insist that they won't increase prices, I am skeptical. Adobe paid 50 times Figma’s expected 2022 revenue. Even though that is about three percent of what they will make this year, according to a Forbes article, the company will expect to not only make back this investment but profit even more. This leaves us with two possibilities. Best case is that Figma is supplemented with the resources Adobe can provide without getting bogged down. Worst case, Adobe bleeds Figma dry. Which scenario will we end up with? That’s up to Adobe to decide. 
This is the key problem with tech monopolies, isn’t it? If Adobe insists on adding paywalls, what can we do? Use Microsoft Paint? Or do we just suck it up and wait until the next Figma-like platform comes out. Yes, there are other alternatives. But it is nonetheless disappointing how designers will now have to actively choose whether to use a janky software or have Adobe shoved down their throats one way or the other.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
The origin of the modern romance novel began in the 18th and 19th centuries with writers like Ann Radcliffe and Jane Austen who introduced Western literature to novels focused on the lives and struggles of female protagonists. While the modern genre includes people of all genders and sexualities, “romance novels separate themselves from other genres by being primarily written by women, for women, and about women.” So why is this genre the subject of so much disapproval? 
Obviously the answer has to do with misogyny, but let’s take this a bit deeper. Romance novels have skyrocketed in popularity on social media with authors like Emily Henry, Ali Hazelwood, Helen Hoang, Colleen Hoover, Tessa Bailey, and so many more. People, predominantly women, read these books with insatiable curiosity, often finishing them over the course of a singular evening and their digestibility only aids their popularity. However, those who are fans of romance are often patronized, with critics describing romance as a subpar form of literature, usually calling out its unapologetic sexuality and particularly its sexuality aimed toward female desire.
Why is it wrong for women to engage with their sexuality and why are contemporary novels featuring female sexuality discredited as not “real reading”? An article from Vulture describes,, “literary fiction has plenty of sex, but it’s rarely about the characters’ pleasure. Literary sex tends to be sad or gross, often enough presaging a character’s tragedy, as if she’s a promiscuous teen in a horror movie. In romance, people get to have sex, and it’s good.” Because the romance genre paints sex positively and is deemed as “smut,” people seem to believe that it does not deserve a place among literature. However, writing about sex is not a bad thing, I wouldn’t be surprised if it is historically one of the most recorded and debated aspects of humanity.
In fact, sexuality is a part of life that tends to affect everyone’s development in some way, shape, or form. Books should not have to be disturbing or deeply impactful in order to include sexuality — particularly female sexuality — they should be able to include sex as just a part of who their characters are. Learning about how characters interact with one another — physically or socially — and develop relationships is important to building compassion. Watching characters be stupid, make relationship mistakes, or struggle with intimacy, are real issues and stories that people can and should learn from.
Further, what is unique to the romance genre is that it is fully and thoroughly fun. It is fun to read about people finding happiness, developing as people, and just being in love. While romances can be sometimes unrealistic or overly sunshine-rainbow-y, part of that just reflects what love can be: a silly little idealistic mess two people find themselves in together. Reading more about that is not silly, but helps us all determine what we deserve and the foundations of strong relationships. Romance is not a genre full of flat characters who find themselves in love, but rather features comprehensive narratives about the human condition and what we owe to one another.

Dr. Mehmet Oz is a cardiothoracic surgeon, author, professor emeritus at Columbia University, and former television personality host who is running against Lt. Governor John Fetterman for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He is one of the most experienced and qualified heart surgeons in the U.S., and also a font of dubious medical information. He has lived a complicated life, and I want to give a fair look at the man who believes he should represent Pennsylvania in Congress. 
Mehmet Oz was born in 1960 in Cleveland, Ohio to two Turkish immigrants. His father, Mustafa, was an accomplished cardiothoracic surgeon who worked in Turkish hospitals well into his 80's. Following in his father's footsteps, Mehmet attended Harvard as a pre-med biology major, where he also played football and water polo. After graduating, he began simultaneously working on his MD and MBA at the University of Pennsylvania. There, he served as both Class President and President of the student body while also completing medical school. 
Oz then began his residency at the Columbia-Presbyterian hospital, where he rose through the ranks to become a professor of surgery at the age of 41.  During his time at Columbia, he performed roughly 75-100 heart surgeries per year. Dr. Mathew Williams, a fellow surgeon at Columbia, called him a "phenomenal surgeon" with "excellent hands." He also has 11 patents for devices relating to heart surgery. 
If Oz's career plateaued here, he would have retired as one of the most successful and accomplished heart surgeons in the world. But that wasn't enough for Oz. In the early 2000's, he began making appearances on "The Oprah Winfrey Show," where he immediately made an impression as a candid, charismatic doctor. He made repeated guest appearances for over six seasons until 2009, when he got his own daytime show, the Dr. Oz show. 
The premise of the Dr. Oz Show was simple. Oz wants his viewers to take their health into their own hands by giving them the honest advice that they wouldn't get elsewhere. According to the show description, "no subject is off-limits, as Dr. Oz addresses viewers' questions and talks to health experts about any and all topics, from sex to diet and exercise to diseases and ways to avoid them." The appeal of the show seems pretty clear; scientific communication is difficult, and there's a demand for intelligent people who are good in front of a camera. 
But it didn't take long for things to veer into pseudoscience. Granted, Oz was no stranger to supernatural belief — prior to his show, he earned the attention of the New York Times in 1995 for allowing a "reiki" practitioner in the operating room during surgery. Reiki is a procedure involving gentle physical touch in order to "deliver energy to your body,” according to the Cleveland Clinic, and is alleged to aid healing. This may seem quack, but keep in mind this procedure is non-invasive and was used to supplement, not substitute, medical intervention. If the doctor and patient think an energy healer might help with recovery, what's the harm I suppose. 
But once the show started, the psychic beliefs really kicked into overdrive. Consider a 2012 episode of his show titled "Medium v Medicine," where he speaks with a woman who said she can communicate with the dead. Or consider his interview with famous TV-psychic John Edwards, where Oz claimed "there are times when science just hasn’t caught up with things.” Believe what you will about the supernatural, but encouraging the general public’s reliance on it as a medical science is unethical and dangerous.
In another episode, he interviewed a self-proclaimed "iridologist,” Mossaref Ali. Iridology is a pseudoscientific, widely-debunked practice purporting that illnesses can be diagnosed from the shape of one's iris. Oz concludes the interview saying that these are "ancient traditions," and, "Who am I to dismiss them?” I will quote Dr. Steven J. Dell, an ophthalmologist who retorted, "Who? Oz is a trained clinician and scientist, someone who can read a scientific article with a critical eye. He is someone who can filter out the noise of the placebo effect or discern the simple carnival tricks of a charlatan. The problem is that most people in his audience cannot."
And that's the problem with "The Dr. Oz Show," isn't it? He is an extremely well-educated, highly competent doctor who can save lives with surgery. But that makes for rather dull TV. To increase ratings, you've got to have a heart surgeon endorse questionable alternative medicine, even if it misleads the audience
In 2015, a group of 10 doctors wrote a letter to Columbia's Dean of Medicine, urging the removal of Dr. Oz from his faculty position at Columbia. They argued that "he has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain." A study by the British Medical Journal randomly selected 80 claims from 40 episodes of the Doctor Oz show, and found that evidence only supported 46% of these claims.  
The dubious claims of "America's Doctor" has led to a thriving industry of sketchy supplement manufacturers and medical grifters riding his coattails. I'll highlight one particularly horrific case. While a guest on Oprah in 2005, Dr. Oz entertained the legitimacy of João de Deus, or "John of God," a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon and energy healer from Brazil. Oz said of João, "either he's a healer who has found some talents that he has innately within him and can help people — or he's crazy." (I have to appreciate how that sentence is a master class in plausible deniability). João gained a massive cult following, with people traveling from around the world to receive treatment for their incurable illnesses. He also sexually abused his patients on a nearly incomprehensible level; the accusations number over 300. The man was plainly a grifter, but Oz's decision to platform him almost certainly augmented the scale at which he could commit his abuse. To top it off, he also has a history of promoting products sold by companies in which he owned an undisclosed financial stake. 
Oz is a career-focused man with insatiable ambition and a compulsive need to be the best. He wasn't satisfied with being one of the most successful heart surgeons in the world, and he wasn't satisfied with having one of the most successful TV shows in America. So now, he's trying his hand at elected office. In an article by Vox, Dr. Richard Greer, a colleague of Oz, told a reporter, "Maybe he should be president. I would vote for him." I sincerely think that might be Oz's end goal here.
To put it bluntly, Dr. Oz is a self-interested, opportunistic snake-oil salesman who has built his career and fortune by preying on people's frustration with the medical industry. He has abused his position of respect as a doctor and his position of power as a TV personality to harm others for his own enrichment. He makes unscientific and irresponsible claims, and is callous toward their consequences. He represents the dangerous intersection of celebrity culture and pseudoscience and, as the AMA Journal of Ethics put it, "is a dangerous rogue unfit for the office of America’s doctor.”
Once again, I implore anybody reading this to please change your registration to Pennsylvania. Dr. Oz is a dangerous, dishonest individual who has no business holding elected office.
