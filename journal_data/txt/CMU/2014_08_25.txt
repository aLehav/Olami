The Carnegie Mellon Athletics Department began offering an expanded outdoor recreation program last week and will continue the program this the fall with a stated goal of “providing greater extracurricular opportunities for members of the campus community,” according to a university press release.
The department said it bought equipment for a number of outdoor games, such as badminton, bocce, cornhole, croquet, Kan Jam, ladder ball, Spikeball, volleyball, washer toss, and wiffle ball.
“Our ambition is to provide more opportunities for social engagement through sport, competition and physical activity,” said Director of Athletics Josh Centor in the release. “We have strategically invested resources in a way that we feel will maximize our potential in this realm.”
Throughout the first week of classes, the department said it will organize games and activities across from Warner Hall from 3-6 p.m. each day.
Students interested in participating should contact Sara Gauntner, assistant director of athletics for instructional programs and recreation, according to the release.

With the NFL season quickly approaching, a busy offseason and a deep and talented draft class have altered the landscape of the league. Football’s restrictive salary cap and high rate of player turnover means there are often huge surprises in the standings from year to year. These teams were under .500 last season but, due to a combination of statistical indicators, offseason moves, and a couple of hunches, could flip expectations on their heads and improve this year.
Houston Texans
It won’t be easy, but it isn’t hard to imagine the Houston Texans being the third consecutive team to launch all the way from the first overall pick to the playoffs in the following season. This may sound like a reach, but the Texans were much better than 2–14 last year. Houston lost nine of their eleven one-score games, which is often an indicator that bad luck drove their record down far more than a lack of talent. The team's late leads over the Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts, and New England Patriots, as well as lost nail biters against the Kansas City Chiefs and St. Louis Cardinals, magnifies their bad luck even more. The Cardinals were the only team in that group to not make the playoffs, and they won 10 games last season in the loaded NFC West. That alone shows that this Texans team was probably closer to an average 6–10 team than a 2–14 team last year.
Further, quarterback Matt Schaub played so badly in the beginning of the season that he was benched for undrafted free agent quarterback, Case Keenum. The duo combined for a monstrous number of interceptions returned for scores and overall terrible play from the quarterback position. While this problem will likely not be solved next year with journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick taking the reins on offense, the offense will still likely take a huge step forward.  
Defensive scores are not a consistent stat from year to year, and are largely determined by randomness. This team will not throw pick sixes in five consecutive games. Further, running back Arian Foster is healthy after never really being at full strength last year, which will add another dimension to this offense and open up more room for the passing game to grow. Even with a subpar quarterback situation, the wide receiving corps of this team more than makes up for it.  Andre Johnson will continue to be a star, and opposite him, DeAndre Hopkins showed flashes of brilliance last year and should continue to improve. Tight end Owen Daniels may have moved on but his replacement, Garrett Graham, showed competence both blocking and receiving. Tackle Tyson Clabo could bolster the Texans protection and give Fitzpatrick more time to get passes away to the talented receivers. This offense has the potential to be significantly better than it was a year ago.
The Texans defense also has the chance to improve in several ways.  The first and most visible is the addition of first overall draft pick, jack linebacker Jadeveon Clowney.  Paired with defensive end JJ Watt, this tandem could wreak havoc upon opposing offensive lines, disrupting passes and producing sacks. If Clowney lives up to his potential, the Texans pass rush could be devastating. Brian Cushing could be returning, but he is no longer a safe bet to play close to 16 games in a season. 
However, the Texans defense wasn’t that bad last year. Watt is still the best defensive end in the league; the secondary, while not great, is not awful; and the Texans have been making due with mediocre inside linebackers for years, and last year was the first time in three seasons they missed the playoffs.   There is a little bit of the plexiglass principle involved as well. This team was dominant two years ago and only returned to average last year. If they improve to somewhere between those two extremes, they will likely improve massively on last year’s nightmare season.
Buffalo Bills
Another cellar dweller primed to make a leap is the Buffalo Bills. Behind the second-best defensive line in the league and rookie middle linebacker Kiko Alonso, this team quietly had a dominant defense last year. While Alonso is out for the season with an injury and safety Jairus Byrd has left for the New Orleans Saints, Brandon Spikes and Da’Norris Searcy are competent replacements, respectively. Although the defense was good last year, the Bills were still awful. The big upgrades will come on the offensive side of the ball.
The Bills’ offense last year was a disaster. Quarterback EJ Manuel was okay when he wasn’t hurt, but his replacements were bad. Running back CJ Spiller had a letdown season and produced nothing for most of the season. Very little on this offense worked last season, but that will likely change next year.
First, the line should improve this season. Left tackle Cordy Glenn should continue to improve in his third season. Eric Wood will still be a helpful player at center for the Bills. Rookie right tackle, Cyrus Kouandjio, could be a major addition for the Bills. He projects as a great run blocker for a run-first team.
This improvement in the line could help open up more space for Spiller. Spiller’s season last year was a disappointment, but it’s probably not permanent. Spiller is not old enough, even for a running back, to already be on the downslope of his career, and he still has the speed and agility that made him great in 2012. The extra gaps created by the line could boost Spiller’s performance next season.
The team’s passing game might improve as well. Manuel missed time last year and was turnover-prone, but both of these things could diminish as he gets more comfortable with the Bills’ system. Furthermore, rookie wide receiver Sammy Watkins might be the best player in this year’s draft class. Whole highlight reels have already been dedicated to Watkins’ one-handed catches and moves with the ball. He could open up space for the running game and launch the Bills into the upper half of the AFC East. It might not be enough to warrant a playoff appearance, but in a weak division, it might be enough.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
In the NFC, the Buccaneers could deliver on some of their 2013 promise. Head coach Greg Schiano and quarterback Josh Freeman had a lockerroom dispute that went public, and Freeman was abysmal on the field. Murphy’s Law held, and the season was lost after a 0–7 start. The team only slightly improved down the stretch, going 4–5 in their last nine games.
The roster is talented enough to think they might improve. Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and outside linebacker Lavonte David are two of the best defensive players in the league. Former Titans cornerback Alterraun Verner was a solid addition to shore up the secondary and cannot possibly be as bad as former cornerback Darrelle Revis was last year. Free safety Dashon Goldson is also likely to be a productive player this season. With some stars and few true weaknesses on the defense, this unit should play well. They were already the eighth best defense by DVOA last season, according to Football Outsiders, and that number should stay the same or improve this year.
Offensively, this team should improve as well. As stated before, Freeman was awful and was traded to the Vikings midseason. Backup quarterback, and rookie Mike Glennon was raw and, despite improving over the course of the season, not very good. Quarterback Josh McCown was a smart offseason addition. Coming off a fantastic year with the Chicago Bears, he should be a solid stopgap before Glennon is ready to take the reins. Running back Doug Martin will probably miss fewer games this year. Rookie wide receiver Mike Evans is a great complement to wide receiver Vincent Jackson in the passing game. This offense may not be dominant, but if it clicks, this team has the potential to be very good. Either way, this team is much better than 4–12.
None of these improvements even touch upon the most important change made to this year’s Bucs. Last year, the team clearly hated head coach Schiano. Schiano was more of a disciplinarian than a coach, and the team consistently came out in predictable sets and looked uninterested.
Lovie Smith was an excellent hire, with a proven track record of winning and likability among players. This will be a good team that will be on the same page with a competent head coach. The AFC South is historically erratic — no team has won the division in consecutive years. The Bucs will probably not win it, with the New Orleans Saints set to have a great team, but this team could end up in the playoff discussion by season’s end.
Detroit Lions
Lastly, this should be the year the Detroit Lions finally deliver on the team’s ability and promise and make the playoffs for the second time in 15 years. This team finished only two games off pace last year after the Green Bay Packers lost Aaron Rodgers for an extended stretch. The Lions appeared to have the division won with several games to go, but went on an ice cold streak, losing six of their last seven. The team went 0–4 in games decided by three points or less over that time frame, and they lost to several bad teams.  The criticism heaped that quarterback Matt Stafford can’t win the big game and that this team suffered from a rash of intangible failures that prevented them from winning down the stretch.
It’s far more likely that this losing streak could be attributed to a number of factors that point toward a better record this season. 
First, as the games became more important, this team became more predictable, sticking to head coach Jim Schwartz’s game plan under any circumstance, which prevented a very talented offense from being effective late in the season, as late game drives continually resulted in interceptions. Of course, some of this was Stafford’s fault, but there were a number of other things at play. 
According to an article run by Grantland, Stafford’s stats as a passer deteriorated the longer he waited in the pocket. This makes no sense, because it means he had more time to throw the ball, but it was a significant enough decrease to imply that another factor was at play. From watching clips of those last seven games, it appeared that Stafford continually had no one open to throw to on those types of plays, leading to a large number of interceptions, which falls on the offensive scheme and Schwartz’s lackluster coaching. Jim Caldwell will not necessarily be a major improvement, but any improvement could cause a significant increase in this team’s offensive output.
In addition to the coaching change, wide receiver Golden Tate is the talented, possession wide receiver this team has been looking for since they added Calvin Johnson.  Kris Durham was terrible last year, dropping almost every pass thrown at him, and was clearly unable to cope with how hard Stafford throws the ball. Tate has always been extremely sure-handed and was an excellent addition to this roster. Further, draft pick Eric Ebron should be very effective at providing a huge red zone target and a third option after Johnson and Tate. With running backs Reggie Bush and Joique Bell coming off productive seasons, this could be a very good offense.
This team’s defense, on the other hand, is not great, but it has good enough pieces. The defensive line could be unstoppable.  Defensive tackles Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley are two of the best defensive linemen in the league, and defensive end Ziggy Ansah was solid last year and should continue to improve. This team has no need to rush with more than four, meaning it could make up for the team’s lackluster secondary. The linebackers on this team are solid, and rookie addition Kyle Van Noy could continue to move this team in the right direction. This team was middle of the pack last year, and while it could improve marginally, that is all this team needs considering their offensive firepower.
This season could prove to be an exciting one, and these four teams should turn in better campaigns than last season. While certainly not locks, all of these teams should be playoff contenders after being something closer to doormats a year ago.  With a small 16-game sample to judge an entire season, no one can be sure, but these teams appear to be headed in the right direction.

Every year, several impressive teams from last season take huge steps back.  Based on offseason moves and some statistical indicators, here are some teams that might disappoint in 2014.
Kansas City Chiefs
After going 2–14 in 2012, the Kansas City Chiefs made a series of big offseason moves and became the second consecutive team to go from worst to playoffs.
However, there is a reason they only had an excellent start. Last season could be split into two parts: their undefeated record before the bye-week and consistent failure after it.
Before the bye, this Chiefs team beat up on a very weak schedule. Only one of the teams they played reached the playoffs, and only two could muster .500 records. The playoff team they did play was the Philadelphia Eagles in week three, before Nick Foles replaced Michael Vick and made that team good. The Chiefs were very lucky to pull out one-point squeakers against the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans, two mediocre squads.
Overall, the teams they played in the first half finished 52–92, a record that would amount to between five and six wins over the course of one NFL season. That would be among the worst in the NFL.
In the second half of the season, two major changes took place. First, the teams they played got better. Second, key injuries slowed the team. The record of teams that the Chiefs played over the final seven weeks of the season was 62–50, which would translate to between eight and nine wins, an average team.
The Chiefs went 2–5 in this leg of the season, which is a huge drop, even with the better competition. Injuries limited the effectiveness of outside linebackers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston, which greatly diminished the pass rush, the keystone to the Chiefs’ success in the first half.
With the pass rush lagging, unexpected first-half standouts like cornerback Marcus Cooper wilted and the team completely fell apart defensively. They consistently gave up point totals topping thirty.
This year, the Chiefs’ schedule gets harder, so some regression would be expected even if they did not get worse. However, this team is much worse than last season.
Cornerback Brandon Flowers, guard Jon Asamoah, and offensive tackle Branden Albert all left with nothing close to suitable replacements.
The offense was bad last year and it lost most of its pass protection without adding anyone to help. Wide receiver Dexter McCluster might be missed in special teams. They will likely be near the middle of the league, but it’s not hard to imagine the Chiefs returning to the top of the draft.
Carolina Panthers
The Carolina Panthers are another fairly obvious candidate for regression. This team had two major weaknesses last year. The receiving corps was awful and the secondary was even worse. Both of those units got worse in free agency. The Panthers’ front office had a history of massively overpaying players, which left this team right up against the cap, even after losing their best cornerback and their best three wide receivers. 
Their replacements were unilaterally disappointing. Wide receivers Jerricho Cotchery and Jason Avant have been somewhat productive as third receivers, but neither is a particularly good NFL wide receiver. Safeties Thomas DeCoud and Roman Harper might have been the worst free safety and strong safety in the league last year. 
These concerns could be overblown. Last year, the receivers weren’t very good either. Steve Smith had lost more than a step, and Brandon LaFell and Ted Ginn were no better than Cotchery and Avant. Rookie wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin could be successful coming into his rookie year, and tight end Greg Olson could take a step forward. The secondary was also terrible, and I’m not sure even Harper and DeCoud could really make it worse.  
That probably will not matter.
This team had an okay offensive line last year at best, and left tackle Jordan Gross hung up the cleats after 11 outstanding years. Left guard Travelle Wharton also walked away. That okay line will be brutal this year.  Quarterback Cam Newton will have to run to avoid the rush far more than he did last year, which was a lot. That could both lead to a decrease in efficiency and injury risks.
Despite all the bad news, the stars of this team are coming back. Newton has been excellent since his rookie season. His leap last year was not much of a leap at all — he had been performing at a high level since he broke the record for passing yards in a game by a rookie during week one of his rookie year. The tandem of middle linebacker Luke Kuechly and outside linebacker Thomas Davis was a force in pass coverage last year, erasing the middle of the field, a very important outlet for most passers when things don’t go perfectly deep. Defensive tackles Star Lotulelei and Kawann Short should improve after amazing rookie seasons where they dominated opposing offensive lines.   The front seven should be dominant again, and that could be enough to push this team in the right direction.
After considering the roster moves, this team is worse than last year’s team, but last year’s team was worse than its record. The team's losses — they went 5–2 in close games — seemed to be a hallmark of head coach Ron Rivera’s term. The schedule was also fairly easy. The NFC South was weaker than expected last year and the AFC East was bad as well. Their out-of-division foes, the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings, could be described as weak at best. This team played the NFC West, but they didn’t play well against the NFC West, going 2–2, so that probably does not affect their strength of schedule. Overall, this team got worse, the NFC South improved around it, and the schedule will get harder. That’s a great recipe for regression.
Green Bay Packers
The Green Bay Packers are not obvious candidates to disappoint this season. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers missed half of 2013.
The receivers are still very talented, and the loss of James Jones will probably not dent their production. Guards T.J. Lang and Josh Sitton should continue to be excellent assets to the team.
There are three reasons this team could still regress.
The first is that their defense is laughable. Outside linebacker Clay Matthews has spent more minutes in commercials than he has on the field, and consistently seems to be out with a nagging injury.
Anyway, he has been mediocre at best while on the field. Nose tackle B.J. Raji and middle linebacker A.J. Hawk have never lived up to expectations. Outside linebacker Julius Peppers is getting very old, and was not productive last year on a terrible Bears defense. Except for rookie free safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, there are no possible impact players on this defense, and that can make it hard for the team to succeed.
This team was 31st in defensive DVOA last year, according to Football Outsiders, and outperformed that ranking in statistics like yards and points surrendered, which indicates that the defense will somehow be even more abysmal than it was last season.
The offense might not be much better than it was last year, either. Seven extra games of Rodgers will be a massive boost, but this offense reportedly plans to run more, which will diminish Rodgers’s value.
Eddie Lacy was a revelation last year, but much of his success came due to game plans that focused on the Packers’ reputation as a passing offense.
Lacy only had two great games last year, one in the game Rodgers got injured and one against the Cowboys, the worst defense in recent memory.
His success was overrated due to his goal line carries which gave him fantasy football value. This coaching staff seems to be buying into his hype, which could cause them to self-destruct.
This team will regress slightly overall, but the massive improvement that is possible throughout the rest of the NFC North, where every other team made significant offseason gains, could put The Pack in a bad spot in 2014.
New York Jets
Finally, the New York Jets are possibly the highest variance team in football. It is easy to envision this team finishing anywhere from 2–14 to 11–5. There is easily a situation where the improvement shown by quarterback Geno Smith over the last four weeks was real; running back Chris Johnson actually was held back by a predictable offense in Tennessee; wide receiver Eric Decker was not just a benefactor of Peyton Manning’s excellence in Denver; second year cornerback Dee Milliner, rookie tight end Jace Amaro, and safety Calvin Pryor turn in huge seasons; and this team is incredible.
None of those things are likely to happen.
Smith has some arm strength but he is a questionable decision maker in the pocket. As the career of former quarterback Mark Sanchez has shown, this team is not very good at improving quarterbacks’ decision making. He is not as good as many seem to think running the football, and is more of a pocket passer. His success at the end of last season had a lot to do with an offense that had been very simplified for him and some bad competition. It was likely a flash in the pan, and he will continue to be an interception machine this year.
Chris Johnson is a running back and, in the NFL, running backs get old fast and they never really recover. I’m not sure why the Jets were so happy with this signing.
Decker’s success last year came largely in the red zone or on deep balls, where he was a big target for Manning.  Manning is a much better quarterback than Smith, and both of those situations call for great precision from a quarterback more than receiving talent. Decker probably will not be great on this offense.
Milliner and Pryor have already dealt with injury issues and Amaro has been largely invisible in the preseason.
That said, all of those players are in spots of extreme weakness in 2013 and cannot possibly be worse in 2014. Chris Ivory and Bilal Powell are very good second and third running backs to have. If Smith is terrible, quarterback Michael Vick can add a huge boost to this offense. Decker and Amaro are both good receivers, if not spectacular, which is a huge improvement over the abysmal receiving corps last year. Antonio Cromartie was awful as the number one corner, and the safety position was a revolving door of terrible, with the team even signing a washed up Ed Reed halfway through the season.
This team still retains some of its strengths from last year. Tackle D’brickishaw Ferguson and center Nick Mangold continue to get older and further removed from their days as world beaters four years ago, but they’re still solid players and the rest of the line is average. Defensive tackles Sheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson should continue to dominate in the pass rush, and this team has been the best in stopping the run since Rex Ryan arrived as head coach.
However, last year’s 8–8 squad was a severe aberration.  This team had the point differential of a five-to-six win team, and that’s a better indicator of next year’s record than the actual win-loss total. That might even be overstating it, since this team thrived in close games.  Two wins were gifted by penalties from opposing teams on the last play in regulation. The team went 5–1 in games decided by a touchdown or less.
The expected improvement on this team just isn’t enough to make up for how much worse this team was than its record. Or maybe it won’t be. Don’t be surprised if this team is in yet another unexpected AFC championship game this season.
Don’t be surprised if they’re the worst team in the league, either.

Like everything in our universe, humans are fundamentally a collection of molecules interacting with each other. Unlike anything else in our universe, however, humans share a unique ability to fully experience the world around them, largely because of our neurological complexity.
Beyond our individual experiences, we also have the capacity to understand the experiences of those around us, an ability commonly known as empathy.
Imagine that one day your friend forgets to bring a jacket, and that it’s unexpectedly cold outside. Seeing their shivering can invoke an emotion of empathy in which you feel bad for them. However, this reaction can be largely influenced by many factors. 
For example, if you brought a large jacket and are feeling comfortable, you may not empathize with your friend as much as someone who brought a small jacket and is also feeling cold.
Scientists are continuously trying to understand the complexity of neurological functions. The past few years have seen some remarkable advancements in our understanding of empathy and the areas of the brain that are involved.
To do so, scientists conduct experiments that mimic real-world situations that we face everyday that can invoke emotions and feelings. They then observe the effect of the emotion on an individual and, in this case, on the individuals around them.
A recent study published in The Journal of Neuroscience in October 2013 by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences identified that the right supramarginal gyrus is involved in one’s ability for empathy. They explained that this region of the brain is responsible for distinguishing our emotional state from others and producing empathy.
Without a properly functioning supramarginal gyrus, it can become extremely difficult to put oneself into somebody else’s shoes. To test this, researchers conducted an experiment in which they showed one participant a picture of something gross and had them touch something slimy while another participant was shown a picture of something cute and touched something furry. Distorted by their own comforting emotion, the second participant assessed their partner’s negative experience less severely.
Another important aspect of learning about neurological functions is understanding psychopathy, a personality disorder that is characterized by a lack of empathy. A recent study published by researchers at the University of Chicago explored the areas of the brain that are more active in psychopaths.
They concluded that, based on the activated regions, psychopaths are sensitive to the thought of pain but cannot feel others’ pain. Instead, when imagining others in pain, they show an increased activity in their ventral striatum, which is known to be involved in pleasure.
By understanding the neurological basis for empathy, better interventions can be constructed to treat patients who suffer from psychopathy. Studies have shown that almost a quarter of prison populations are psychopathic, compared to only one percent of the general population. Improved treatments and understanding could help bring down crime and violence.
Our understanding of the brain and its functions are very primitive, but much has been learned about the unique complexity that allows our brain to experience our own lives as well as the lives of those around us.

If you’ve ever programmed in more than one programming language, chances are that you’ve sometimes wished you could use multiple languages in the same program, because what’s easy to do in one language might be hard or impossible to do in another. A team of researchers, led by Jonathan Aldrich, associate professor in the Institute for Software Research, has been working on solving just this problem.
The group is developing a new programming language called Wyvern that makes it much easier to write web applications. Wyvern allows programmers to use HTML, the language in which web pages are written; JavaScript, which makes web pages dynamic; SQL, in which database queries are performed; and many other languages together in the same program.
Previous attempts to use multiple languages together have involved writing the code in one language and passing in snippets of code written in other languages as strings, which are data in the form of a sequence of characters. This practice is tedious as well as prone to many security flaws, which can make the program vulnerable to malicious attacks like cross-site scripting and SQL injection — the two most common types of attacks used by website hackers today.
Wyvern prevents these attacks by treating pieces of code written in different languages as new types of data, rather than strings. It is based on the idea of a type-specific language (TSL), which ensures that code is valid for the language that it is written in. Using this concept of TSLs, programmers can integrate code snippets from different languages in a clear and concise manner, making the resultant program much easier for other programmers to read and comprehend.
“Wyvern is like a skilled international negotiator who can smoothly switch between languages to get a whole team of people to work together. Such a person can be extremely effective and, likewise, I think our new approach can have a big impact on building software systems,” Aldrich said, in a Carnegie Mellon press release.
Using multiple languages in the same program has opened up many avenues. Cyrus Omar, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and the lead designer of Wyvern’s TSL approach, said via email that he feels that this new concept of “specialized syntax” will be useful in scientific programming.
“Each scientific area tends to come up with its own specialized forms (e.g. bra-ket notation in quantum physics) and allowing them to use them directly makes the gap between what they write up on whiteboards and what they put down into the computer narrower, improving productivity,” Omar said.
Another area where this idea is expected to make a great impact is in the field of end-user programming. “End users is a term used in the literature to describe the kinds of folks who might not even think they do any programming, but they use tools like spreadsheets or Wordpress templates,” Omar explained. “Making things easier for them syntactically by capturing common idioms, while retaining the nice semantics of a language like Wyvern underneath, would help bridge the gap between ‘professional programmers’ and ‘end user programmers’, which I think would be good for everyone involved.”
When asked whether he feels that Wyvern is something that may be widely used in industry, Omar replied, “The hope with projects like these is that our ideas, rather than the artifact itself, will have an impact on future language designs originating in industry.” He added, however, that Wyvern is being actively developed on GitHub, largely through the efforts of Benjamin Chung, a senior computer science major.
Programmers who are excited about Wyvern can start using it as well, contributing to the design of the language. “New languages gain adoption when people who are starting brand new projects, often side projects, make a decision to try something new,” Omar said.

It’s effortless for us to pick up an object and manipulate it in 3-D in real life, but what if we could twist and turn objects in a photograph just as easily? 
Yaser Sheikh, associate research professor of robotics, and Natasha Kholgade, a graduate student in the Robotics Institute, have created a photo editing system that allows users to move objects three-dimensionally, turning or flipping them in ways that reveal parts of the object that were not even in the original photograph. Other members of the group include Tomas Simon, a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute, and Alexei Efros, a former Carnegie Mellon faculty member.
“We started the project about three years ago, when we realized that while interacting with photographs in editing software, there were several 3-D manipulations that we intuitively felt like doing … that were simply not possible in photo-editing software,” Kholgade said. While users can scale, rotate, and move objects in current photo-editing software, Kholgade’s new system allows users to flip and rotate objects in all different directions, knock them over, or pick them up and place them somewhere else in the photograph — all while maintaining the photograph’s realism.
But how is it possible to turn an object to a side that wasn’t even present in the original photograph? The team’s system takes advantage of the 3-D models of common objects that are readily available online. “Today, there are large collections of 3-D models available on public repositories such as 3D Warehouse and TurboSquid,” Kholgade said.
While this method may not be able to cover all the bases right now, the inevitable growth of these online databases will soon solve this problem. “We can expect these repositories to keep growing at an exponential rate, since 3-D printing and scanning technologies are becoming more and more ubiquitous, and several items such as furniture, vehicles, toys, and household equipment are becoming standardized,” Kholgade added. In the current version of the system, the user finds the corresponding 3-D model needed for an object in a photograph by using a word search.
Despite the wide availability of 3-D models online, however, there are always inherent differences between online models of objects and the actual object in a given photo. Kholgade explained that the main differences between online models and an actual object in a photograph are their colors, textures, and shape. “For instance, you will never find that discolored banana in your fruit basket, or your specific dusty, worn out hat in the 3-D model repository,” Kholgade said. To account for this, the system provides a user-guided approach to align the shape of the 3-D model to the object in the photograph. It then factors out scene lighting in the photograph and completes the appearance of a surface that was not in the original photograph by drawing symmetries over an object.
In addition to just turning or flipping an object in 3-D, this system uses the same algorithms to create realistic animation. “Our system is tied to standard animation and modeling software, through which the user can create an animation for an object. Our system then deforms the object in accordance with the animation, while providing plausible shading and shadows, and remaining faithful to the original photograph,” Kholgade said. The system is also compatible with paintings and historical photos, as long as they are converted into an electronic format.
Besides just being a game-changer for photo-editing software, the team’s system has real-world applications in furniture rearrangement while putting personal homes on the market, three-dimensional viewing of merchandise in online shopping catalogs, or even in connecting physical simulations of events or anatomical processes to photographs for forensics or medicinal purposes.
In the future, the team hopes to automate the search and retrieval of online 3-D models, as well as the alignment of 3-D models to actual objects in photographs. This system has flipped the world of photo-editing 180 degrees.

New ant species supports species formation theory
A new species of ant has been discovered in a single patch of eucalyptus trees at Brazil’s São Paulo State University by Christian Rabeling, assistant professor of biology at the University of Rochester, and his research team. Despite having branched off from an already existing species, the new one was found living in the same colony as the original species, an uncommon occurrence in today’s model of species formation. While most new species are the result of geographic isolation, the discovery of this new species of ant suggests that a controversial theory known as sympatric speciation — where a new species forms while still living in the same geographic area as its parent species — may be true. These findings were recently published in the journal Current Biology.

Apple iPhone 6 launch could be facing delays
Apple iPhone 6 suppliers are rushing to produce enough screens to make next month’s expected launch after a recent disruption in panel production caused by a redesign of the screen. Apple initially wanted to use a single layer of backlight film — instead of the conventional two layers — for the 4.7-inch screen, which went into mass production before the 5.5 inch version in order to make the new phone as thin as possible. However, this design turned out to not be bright enough, and the displays had to be reconfigured, causing screen assembly to be put on hold for part of June and July. Suppliers say that production has resumed; Apple has not stated whether this setback will affect the expected launch next month or limit the number of phones initially released.

Researchers map extinction of Neanderthals
A six-year project by researchers at the University of Oxford has recently resulted in the most accurate timeline of Neanderthal extinction published to date. 
Their findings revealed that Neanderthals and present-day humans actually lived at the same time in Europe for between 2,600 and 5,400 years, which is longer than previously thought, before their extinction approximately 40,000 years ago. Creating an accurate timeline of their extinction was difficult in the past because 30,000-year-old samples often become contaminated, making radiocarbon dating very unreliable. The team at the University of Oxford was able to remove this contamination and dated almost 200 samples of Neanderthal bone, charcoal, and shell.

Brains with autism unable to prune synapses growth
A major part of brain development in babies is an explosion in the growth of synapses, the connections that allow neurons to communicate with each other. However, as a child grows older, the brain begins to regulate the synapses so their population in different areas of the brain is limited, allowing different parts of the brain to be specialized for different functions. A recent study led by David Sulzer, a neurobiologist at the Columbia University Medical Center, suggests that this process undergoes problems in children with autism, causing an overpopulation of synapses in certain parts of the brain. The study used tissue from the brains of children and adolescents who died between the ages of two and 20, half of who had autism and half who did not.

Laser light flips magnetization of various materials
Physicist Eric Fullerton and his team at the University of California, San Diego have recently published a paper in Science on the possibility of using lasers to make data storage in computers faster and simpler. 
While computer hard drives traditionally read and write data by flipping the magnetization of memory cells with magnetic fields, Dutch and Japanese researchers discovered in 2007 that they could flip the magnetization of certain materials using a laser light instead (the polarization of the light determines the direction of magnetization). Fullerton’s team has now investigated this mechanism on a larger range of magnetic materials and found that a certain film containing iron and platinum works well with lasers as a hard drive material.

Two American Ebola patients recently released
The Ebola virus has a fatality rate of 60 to 90 percent in hospitals in Africa. Fortunately, two American aid workers, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who have been receiving treatment for Ebola at Emory University Hospital since early August, were recently released after multiple clean blood tests. 
Bruce Ribner, who led the team which cared for the two patients, stated that they are not contagious and are now immune to the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus. Additionaly, they will not relapse and are not carriers for Ebola. Brantly and Writebol, who caught the Ebola virus in Liberia about a month ago, are the first patients that have been treated for Ebola in America.

If you’re a returning student, it’s probably been some time since your last Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) visit. Or maybe you’ve never been and you have a perpetually busy schedule to blame. Maybe you’re a first-year student looking to explore the several free, convenient opportunities to view art in Oakland.
If you’re debating a museum trip — or if you’ve never even thought to go — a visit to the CMOA is well worth the 10-minute walk from campus down Forbes Avenue, especially for two fascinating and soon-to-be-over exhibits currently on display.
Small Prints, Big Artists: Masterpieces from the Renaissance to Baroque and Faked, Forgotten, Found: Five Renaissance Paintings Investigated, both of which run through Sep. 15, are pretty different. Small Prints is understated and displays a high volume of artwork; Faked, Forgotten, Found only features four paintings, but it’s characterized by rich historical information and hyperbolic descriptions.
Despite their differences, both exhibits are equally worth seeing. Whether you’re a fine arts enthusiast or a casual museum goer, you’ll want a trip to the CMOA on your agenda in the next three weeks.
Small Prints, Big Artists
Small Prints, Big Artists showcases over 200 highlighted works from the CMOA’s collection of over 8,000 prints. The prints are small and almost exclusively black and white, but they are arranged thoughtfully — strategically spaced on walls washed in mild orange-yellows and dark blue-grays. They are also grouped by historical period, with concise but illuminating text providing useful historical background.
According to those descriptions, printing began in the mid-15th century as a means of illustrating religious texts with devotional images. By the turn of the 16th century, it had flourished into a new art form. The exhibit highlights four printing techniques — woodcut, engraving, etching, and drypoint — each of which involves a different artistic process and set of tools.
Standout artists include early German engraver and Renaissance pioneer Albrecht Dürer with his wider gradient, compositional depth, and dramatically depicted subjects ranging from religious to fantastical to everyday.
There’s also 17th-century Dutchman Rembrandt van Rijn, with his impressionistic etchings: Their composition is simple, but their strokes are rich and layered, as in his powerful, eye-drawing masterwork “The Great Jewish Bride.” And there is Giovanni Battista Piranesi, an 18th-century Italian visionary who sketched architecturally elaborate, beautifully oppressive prison-like structures drawn purely from his imagination.
At first inspection, the exhibit isn’t particularly earth shattering. The color palette is modest, and as the exhibit name promises, the prints are indeed small. But this exhibit rewards the curious wanderer: If you have the patience to dwell on the details and notice the nuances between artists and periods, you’ll find yourself more engaged than you might have guessed, and graced by tokens of some of the greatest names in printmaking history.
Faked, Forgotten, Found
It’s surprising that any curator could craft a rich, engaging exhibit featuring only four centuries-old paintings, but Faked, Forgotten, Found achieves just that.
The exhibit space is quite small, nestled behind the Small Prints exhibit and confined to only one moderately sized room. In the space, colorful interactive timelines cover the outer walls, relaying the geographical, political, and forensic journeys these paintings endured over their hundreds of years of existence. An inner, circular structure at the center of the room holds the paintings themselves.
The descriptions are intentionally over the top in their attempt to dramatize the historical events that conceived and surrounded these paintings. The number-one featured painting, Alessandro Allori’s 1570s “Portrait of Isabella de’Medici,” is lavishly described as “a long-lost portrait of a scandalous Medici princess” — “the Paris Hilton of Renaissance Florence.”
But viewers soon find that the fascinating stories of these paintings really do match their embellished descriptions. After appearances in Vienna and Victorian London, the Isabella de’Medici portrait sat in CMOA storage for 31 years until curator Lulu Lippincott — originally thinking it was a fake — discovered the painting was actually a valuable original.
The other paintings have similarly wild stories. In 1954, there were two rival versions of Francesco Raibolini’s “Madonna and Child with Angel” circulating in the art world; between 1973 and 2009, the CMOA acquired both paintings and confirmed which of the two was the carefully traced copy. Meanwhile, the CMOA awaits a German court case that will determine the fate of Jan Rombouts the Elder’s 16th-century “The Birth of Saint John the Baptist,” which was allegedly stolen from its owners, Holocaust victims who fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s. And finally, CMOA curators still don’t know whether they possess Hans Holbein the Younger’s 1534 “Portrait of George Nevill” or a convincing 1900 fake.
Faked, Forgotten, Found will entirely suck you in. It’s an exhibit that values quality over quantity, leading visitors to dwell for 20 minutes on individual paintings that otherwise, for the untrained viewer, might get only a moment’s glance. The experience is well worth those 20 minutes: You’ll leave with a new appreciation for the treacherous circumstances a painting can survive and the experts who investigate and restore these pieces to determine which is the fake and which is the real deal.
So, yes — when seen one after the other, Small Prints and Faked, Forgotten, Found provide a diverse but complementary experience. Together, they demonstrate how two different approaches to displaying art can result in two equally well executed exhibits, and both exemplify the kind of thoughtful, information-rich exhibit that visitors have come to expect from the Carnegie Museums.
Small Prints, Big Artists and Faked, Forgotten, Found are on display at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Oakland through Sep. 15.

Wands at the ready.
This summer, Universal Orlando Resort expanded its wildly successful The Wizarding World of Harry Potter with the addition of Diagon Alley in its Universal Studios theme park.
Like the original Hogsmeade village section, opened in 2010 and located in the resort’s Islands of Adventure theme park, the new section immerses visitors in a world as rich as the books and movies that inspired it and offers a limited yet satisfying lineup of additional Harry Potter-themed rides.
Standing outside the Diagon Alley expansion, visitors might think they’ve booked a ticket to London instead of Universal Studios. A recreation of London’s Eros Fountain stands in front of the Kings Cross railway station, a few stores, and a traditional red phone booth. The only things that may seem out of place from this seemingly non-wizarding world is the purple Knight Bus parked next to the fountain and a magical orchestral score emanating onto the streets.
Step into the buildings and through a brick wall, though, and visitors will find themselves standing in an alley before Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, Fred and George Weasley’s joke shop. Just like in the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince film, a multi-story mechanical man with arms and neck protruding from the shop’s front window repeatedly lifts a hat from his head to reveal a rabbit, only to make it disappear seconds later.
Along the expansion’s main alley are a variety of shops, including Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, Flourish and Blotts bookstore, and Ollivanders Wand Shop, all of which pop with brightly painted signs and window displays almost stuffed fuller with magical artifacts than Hermione’s beaded handbag, which she enchants to hold an unlimited number of objects in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. While enthusiasts can’t access all of the shops, the ones they can enter are filled with merchandise and furnishings that look like authentic movie props, including Time-Turner necklaces, Hogwarts house robes, and Hermione’s Yule Ball dress. Every square inch of the alley is covered in cobblestone and brick so that it takes on the bleak tone captured in the franchise’s later movies.
The centerpiece of the alley, a fire-breathing dragon crouched upon Gringotts Wizarding Bank, tops the expansion off. There is not one flaw in the section’s detail that could pull visitors away from the wizarding world and back into their non-magical lives. 
Of course, no theme park section would be complete without its rides, and The Wizarding World expansion delivers on this end too, although on a smaller scale.
Within Gringotts lies the expansion’s main attraction, Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts. This family-friendly roller coaster brings many of the series’ most beloved characters to life in a bank breakout that resembles Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s climactic escape in The Deathly Hallows, but with a few twists. While not a coaster that delivers major drops and speed, it is most memorable in the story that it brings to life.
The expansion’s second attraction, the Hogwarts Express, takes visitors on a train ride from Diagon Alley in Universal Studios to The Wizarding World’s Hogsmeade village in Islands of Adventure. During the ride, the train simulates a trip toward Hogwarts, or back to Kings Cross station, depending on which way it is traveling. Each way offers a significantly different experience, both of which are worth checking out. Since it’s not a thriller, this ride is perfect for the entire family and primarily serves as a bridge between the world’s two sections.
Although these rides are the only two new attractions to The Wizarding World, they nicely supplement the world’s original rides in Hogsmeade. While one more ride in the expanded section would have rounded out Diagon Alley’s offerings, Tßhe Wizarding World does not suffer from a lack of attractions, especially if guests visit both sections in one go.
Florida visitors looking to relive the Harry Potter franchise’s books and movies won’t be disappointed by the expansion. With its detailed buildings and light-hearted rides, the section may even cause some to forget the Muggle world they live in for a bit.

Summer music festivals have been seeing a steady growth in popularity over the past few years. Events such as Coachella and Bonnaroo, once only on the calendars of jam-band freaks and neo-hippies, have grown into hundred-thousand person strong blowouts, attracting attendees from across the entire spectrum of the American college-aged population. Bros in tanks and crunchy granola hippies, Bear Stearns interns and Starbucks baristas — music festivals have become the one place they all congregate as equals.
Given the wide range of personalities, music festivals can also provide a lot of insight into the quirks of our society, as well as a few good lessons that may be impossible to learn in any other setting. That being said, I present to you five important things I’ve learned from music festivals. Enjoy.
Totems are the greatest method of communication, ever.
The totem, an identifying object that primarily serves a practical purpose of replacing cell phones, is also a great example of the kind of creative self-expression that hovers in the atmosphere around a music festival.
Some tend to forget the fact that many of these festivals are based around camping in the middle of nowhere, which means that within 6-12 hours your handheld connection to all of human civilization will be nothing more than a useless piece of metal and plastic. Once digital communication fails, then all that’s left are the kind of primitive methods used for most of human history. A large totem that sticks a few feet in the air can serve as a moving rallying point; if you get separated from your group (which you undoubtedly will), then just scan the crowd for your group’s work of art on a stick.
One of the cool things about totems is the vibe they bring to shows, almost to the point that looking for and commenting upon totems becomes part of the overall festival experience. Some personal favorites I have seen include a picture of N*Sync’s Lance Bass with the words “Drop the Bass” written across the bottom, and an umbrella adorned with lights to make it resemble a glowing jellyfish.
Rain is a powerful spiritual force.
Mid-July’s Hudson Project festival in upstate New York, held on the same site as Woodstock ’94 — the only reincarnation of the famed festival that can hold a conversation with the original Woodstock — had one of the best and most diverse lineups of the entire summer, but was unfortunately cut short and, shortly after, descended into semi-primitive, quasi-chaos.
While there were certain logistical issues that were within the control of the organizers — Porta Potties shouldn’t be placed on top of a hill if they’re meant to operate for four days straight, and allowing state troopers to ride horses through the campgrounds will invariably lead to more than a few people needing tetanus shots — it was their inaugural year, and I’d love to meet the person who does everything right the first time, every time.
No, good ol’ Mother Nature decided to take a dump in festival organizer MCP’s Cheerios when she unleashed a killer storm on Winston Farm roughly four hours before headliner Bassnectar was set to take the stage for his sonically unopposed Sunday night set. I was standing in the crowd before rapper Isaiah Rashad when the music cut out suddenly and a pre-recorded voice announced that everyone should return to their campsites and that the music was cancelled for the day. About twenty minutes later, the rain came.
Given the financial realities of attending these festivals — entrance alone will run you around $225, plus food, camping supplies, gas, and everything else to fuel your weekend of mayhem — it’s extremely unlikely that any of these so-called hippies are actual hippies. These are people who work regular jobs, whom you pass on the street, and perhaps even hold a door open for. They’re all normal people, and what do normal people do when they find themselves caught in a rainstorm? They strip naked and go mud sliding. I’m not saying everyone did this; some people got naked to just stand in one place and stare in awe at the angry God of the Sky and some people went mud sliding without getting naked — I include myself in the latter category. The naked dude whom I collided with going down the mud hill probably packed up his car the next day and went back to his marketing job, ready to give his weekly report to the boss, and maybe be the nice guy who changes the coffee pot on Monday. He likely doesn’t let all of his glorious, muddy self out for the world to see very often, but it was raining, and the rain (somehow) made everything okay.
Profiling isn’t just a racial thing.
If you’re like me and think that America’s deep-seated issues with institutionalized racism are a dark spot in our culture, then I’m sure reading the news this summer also made you upset. From Eric Garner suffocating after being put in a chokehold for selling untaxed cigarettes, to the recent shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., this summer was ablaze with instances of racial profiling influencing the actions of law enforcement officials.
While not on the same scale or influenced by forces anywhere near the legacy of slavery, the society of a summer music festival also has its own persecuted and profiled group: the person who looks like the kind of person who we always see portrayed in movies as the person who does a lot of drugs. Like profiled people at an airport, this person will often encounter some issues at the security check, whether it be a more thorough pat down, the third degree of questioning from a state trooper over an EpiPen for their allergies, or to simply have their bags and person sniffed at by a K9.
The astounding thing is that some of those people who choose to dress like a cross between Tommy Chong after a week in Mexico and the Unabomber actually do end up arrested. See, when festival security performs their contraband search, their main targets are people intending to sell drugs at the festival and not necessarily the nervous looking college student who brought a joint for when Pretty Lights plays at midnight.
This helps prevent stupid people from doing stupid things like buying Schedule I narcotics from a guy they just met standing in line for the Porta Pottie and becoming the subject of a Monday morning news headline.
I just can’t help but wonder why so many of these drug dealers try to make it through security looking like a stereotypical drug dealer, and then act completely flabbergasted when the cops pull them out of line, bring over their nice little puppy, and calmly explain to them that the life they’d once known is over and their new life as a convicted felon is about to begin. Isn’t it drug-dealing 101 to not attract attention to one’s self, especially by looking like a drug dealer? Perhaps I’m sitting on some revolutionary, industry-changing knowledge here.
People will seemingly say anything if it’s in sing-a-long fashion.
Note: I am not condoning the use of racist, misogynistic, or any other demeaning language in any context, but merely commenting upon an existing phenomenon.
One constant critique of rap music is its general complete disregard for political correctness. Due to rap’s popularity, songs that contain messages of sexism, racism, homophobia — to varying degrees of severity, of course — often find their way onto the Top 40 chart, and therefore into the ears of nearly all participants in our entertainment culture. One doesn’t necessarily need to buy into these messages in order to enjoy the music — I can still enjoy a Lil’ Wayne song despite finding his misogynistic imagery and promotion of opiate use unnecessary for an artist of his ability — for they are simply unalterable aspects of songs that are enjoyable for many other reasons.
That being said, seeing a rapper live can often create a deep crisis of conscience for fans torn between singing along to every word they know, and not wanting to vocalize phrases that perpetuate cultural cycles of oppression and disrespect. At least that’s what I thought would happen, but it appears that no one actually cares at all.
Kanye West had 12,000 Governor’s Ball attendees — of all skin colors — screaming the response to “M.J. gone” from “All of the Lights” back to him in complete confidence; Kendrick Lamar had the ladies shouting about “what she wants” when he performed his verse off “Problems” at Hudson Project; Eminem at Osheaga had 40,000 Canadians singing along to “Kill You,” the lyrics of which would probably give a 100 percent purely socially-progressive and pacifist brain an aneurysm.
Similar to the power of the falling water from the sky, there’s just something about being part of a huge crowd, with everyone participating and sharing in the music, that causes people to abandon their constructed sense of social and cultural decency. I wonder what Freud would’ve had to say about the crowd at a Flatbush ZOMBiES performance.
Good music is the cure for all of life’s ills, aches, and pains.
A single day at a music festival is truly a test of endurance probably on par with a triathlon (Editor’s Note: I have never done a triathlon). You’re out in the hot sun, with very little shade or places to sit, for an entire day. Once the sun goes down, you’re offered some relief from the heat, but there’s still the headliners, late night acts, and a whole day’s worth of built-up tiredness to power through. Then you get up the next day and do it all over again, and then you do it all over again one more time.
While there are many ways to boost your stamina during the day — plenty of water and keeping granola bars on hand are pretty great — nothing replenishes spent vitality quite like a great set. Once the opening notes of the artist you came to see start roaring out of those speakers, it’s as if you suddenly took a shower in the Fountain of Youth. That stinging sunburn? Gone. Those rocks rolling around in your left sneaker? Disappeared. Lotus at Moonrise wiped away painful experiences of a lost phone, a lost mind, and a stomach angry with me for only feeding it greasy Vietnamese food for two days.

What do you get when you put a thief, assassin, warrior, raccoon, and a tree in an intergalactic prison together? Apparently, superheroes. At least, that’s what happened in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, released earlier this month.
It would be easy to write off the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as just another film in a long line of superhero movies, but to do so would ignore the departure in tone Guardians brings to the table.
The film focuses on Peter “Star-Lord” Quill (Chris Pratt), who was abducted by the Ravagers, a group of alien thieves, as a young child in 1988. In the present time, Peter is a roguish thief and smuggler, who has little regard for anybody but himself.
Armed with a few large guns, a face mask, and the Walkman he had on him when he was abducted, a grown-up Quill is introduced to the audience through a mission to steal an orb from a deserted planet.
The film’s score lends a dark and serious tone to the scene as space technology beeps and whirs in the background. The planet is empty, but a hologram from Quill’s gear reveals the life he once lived there. The music stops and everything is quiet as Peter gets ready to go after the orb.
He puts headphones over his ears, attaches the Walkman to his belt, and presses play. And the mood is shattered as the upbeat sounds of 1974’s “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone fill your ears. Quill dances his way through the ruins, kicking and shaking to the beat, even at one point using a small animal as a microphone.
This is how you know Guardians is different from previous Marvel films. Although it covers the same ground as all superhero stories, it never takes itself too seriously. The humor is more mature than that of, say, The Avengers, but also more basic, filled with inappropriate hand gestures and crude references.
Although Quill is the main focus, the titular guardians are rounded out by Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who is sent after Quill by her adoptive father, Thanos, to retrieve the orb, but ends up trying to keep it out of his hands; Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), a warrior who is bent on getting revenge on Ronan (Lee Pace), a pawn of Thanos, for murdering his family; and the bounty hunter team consisting of Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered raccoon, and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a humanoid tree.
When they first get together, this ragtag team seems more like the villains of a movie than the heroes, but they eventually work out the kinks and find their groove together.
The plot centers on the orb, which turns out to be a very powerful Infinity Stone. It’s not complicated, but puts the heroes in enough situations to make their end transition from enemies to a team believable.
Pratt pulled off a performance that was kind of unexpected, if you’re familiar with his previous work on Parks and Recreation. Quill is like an older brother who can be kind of a jerk, but comes through in the end and shows his compassion when it’s really needed.
Space veteran Saldana, who has also held roles in the recent Star Trek films and in Avatar, brings much of the same to Gamora; a good performance, but one we’ve seen before.
The real props go to Bautista and Diesel, who have taken characters that could have been fairly one-dimensional but ended up being two of the most compelling personalities throughout the film..
Bautista’s Drax looks and acts fearsome, thanks to his substantial scars and threats of violence. He is also incapable of understanding sarcasm or colloquialisms, leading to a few comical moments. Bautista’s sincere performance makes his naiveté in language endearing, rather than annoying, and his use of brute strength shows his compassion for his friends rather than his violent character. 
Meanwhile, Diesel’s Groot is a large tree who can walk and talk like a human, except he can only say the phrase, “I am Groot.” Diesel manages to infuse his vocal performance of the phrase with inflection and feeling, so that each time actually sounds like he’s saying something different. Groot is the only purely noble character, as he chooses throughout the film to only use his incredible strength to help his friends and only through violence when absolutely necessary.
Despite the banality of the humor at points, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most heartfelt Marvel films to date. Here, the heroes seek to do good not because they think it’s their duty, but because it’s the right thing to do. Personal goals are pushed aside in favor of the group, and civilization ends up winning.
Filled with music from the 1970s and 1980s and pop culture references from the same, the film still manages to feel lighthearted. For a superhero movie that will make you laugh out loud and make you leave the theater with a smile, Guardians of the Galaxy is a must-see.

Each summer brings new styles that we enjoy wearing for the few months of warmth we get before it becomes too cold to wear them.
This summer saw the revival of the kimono, a traditional Japanese robe, which was slightly altered, embellished, and modernized to appeal to the contemporary fashionista. Thrown over a tank top and some denim shorts, it made for the perfect summer outfit. Celebrities such as Rita Ora and Vanessa Hudgens were seen giving this trend a try. Ora was seen wearing a dark floral kimono jacket with a simple short black dress in the airport while Hudgens chose to pair a long tie-dyed and fringed kimono with a loosely fitted dress.
Kimonos even look great with dresses and sandals for a casual evening look. To transition this trend into the fall, wear it as you would a normal jacket while the weather is still relatively warm. One of the biggest trends this summer, the kimono is here to stay for the next few months and could even reappear next summer. Keep wearing it if you have one, and if you don’t, it isn’t too late to get one!
Maxi dresses have been a summer staple for the past couple of years and they reappeared this summer with new details. While the high-low hemline for dresses and skirts has been more or less phased out, many maxi dresses now have a sheer overlay and a shorter layer underneath. Maxi dresses and skirts with one or, especially this summer, two slits were common. While the maxi dress is mostly a summer item, maxi skirts can sometimes be transitioned into the fall if the material is thicker and a darker color. In the fall, wear your maxi skirt with a light, cropped sweater to keep that summery vibe.
The daisy pattern is a recently growing trend that was huge this summer, too. Daisies may seem like a childish pattern, but they can now be found on nearly everything, from tops to skirts to dresses. Though floral patterns are more characteristic of summer, simply layer a cardigan over your daisy-patterned dress and pair it with boots for fall.
Rompers are yet another staple for the ideal summer closet and, like the maxi dress, showed up in a variety of new designs this summer. For some reason, many clothing pieces this summer had mini embellishments similar to pom-poms lining the hemline, and rompers were no exception. In addition to mini pom-poms, other embellishments commonly seen on rompers this summer included crochet hemlines and flouncy top layers over the bottom. Rompers are clothing pieces that are difficult to transition into the fall, and should just be kept in your closet until next summer.
Though they’re quite similar to rompers, matching top-and-bottom sets could be found at many stores this summer. Fashion-forward retailers, such as Topshop, carried tops that were usually cropped with a high-waisted skirt or a pair of shorts in a matching pattern that were meant to be worn together. Celebrities sporting this trend included Taylor Swift, who wore a red textured crop top and matching skirt from the brand Aqua, as well as Kaley Cuoco, who opted for a floral crop top and matching loosely-fitted pants. It is difficult to predict whether this trend will also reappear next summer, but overall, these matching top-and-bottom sets are strictly a summer piece that, like rompers, should be stored in your closet until the following summer.
While denim shorts are a dependable summer piece, they were overshadowed by the presence of more comfortable fabric shorts this summer. The detailed fabric shorts may have replaced denim shorts this summer not only due to the comfort they provide, but also because of their versatility. They can easily be made the center of any outfit. It is highly likely that these will continue to be in style next summer, so go grab yourself a pair if you don’t have them already. Match them with a plain top, loose sweater, and some boots for slightly cooler September days.
Another clothing trend that was prevalent this summer was the asymmetrical hem skort. The skirt-and-shorts combination that most of us thought we left behind in elementary school reappeared with a revamped design this summer that was less childish. An asymmetric, pointed hem could be found in the front of these skorts, making for a unique design that was very trendy. Usually these should be saved for more formal occasions. They look amazing with a dressy top and heels and can still be worn for nicer occasions in the upcoming months.
Gladiator sandals reappeared this summer — as they have for the past few years — and again could be found in an assortment of heights. The tall gladiator sandal trend that I had thought would come to an end last summer returned even trendier this summer. They look great with sundresses, shorts, and basically anything! Before it’s time to start wearing boots, gladiator sandals make for a great alternative. If you don’t have a pair, now’s the time to get one, especially since gladiator sandals will be on sale at the end of the summer. They’re a style that you can depend on staying in fashion for a while.

Dear Evan,
I’m having trouble keeping up with the number of acronyms this school keeps giving everything, and with the new buildings and names and majors and whatnot, I don’t think I’m going to know what anything is anymore. I think I’m in the UC, but is it really the UC?
Please advise,
Adverse Reaction to Multitudinous Yet Oddly Fetching Nicknames, Amnesia Manifests Every Say What?
Dear ARMY OF NAMES?
I doubt you’re actually sitting inside the body of Jared L. Cohon, and everyone’s going to keep calling it the UC, anyway. There are too many acronyms and colloquial names for places on campus.
I doubt anyone else remembers all of this school’s acronyms, either, since they change more often than Nicki Minaj’s hair.
So instead, make some up in everyday conversation. “Where are you headed?” “The SWID.” “Oh. Where’s that?” “How the heck could you not know where the SWID is?”
TL;DR; no one cares about this school’s acronyms, so don’t waste your time unless you want to screw with someone.
Except when they’re useful,
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
I’m living in Hamerschlag, and the people here are nuts. In the rooms to my right, every day is Thirsty Thursday. Down the hall to my left, it’s a never-ending League of Legends tournament, where everyone screams at each other from across the hall. My roommate jacks off at least three times a night. Where can I find some peace and quiet? And why is everyone bonkers?
Pleadingly,
Normal, Ordinary Fellow, Upset with Noise
Dear NO FUN,
It’s not just you — Schlag has enough testosterone floating around to make one whole Clint Eastwood, and not many people can withstand that terrifying glory. 
Really, though, the place is disgusting. I’d say go to Hunt, but the renovations have made it more of an embarrassment than it already was. The RAs actually do their jobs in Stever, so you should plan to have sleepovers there as much as you can.
Or just wait it out (it’s only for a year),
Evan Kahn

Determined to start the semester off strong by staying focused on your studies? Not if Netflix has anything to say about it.
Find yourself with free time, and the streaming service becomes your best friend.
Find yourself close to missing a deadline, and you’ll wish you could exit out of the show on your screen. Even if you manage to barricade yourself on Hunt Library’s quiet floor, there’s still opportunity for distraction if your laptop is connected to the Internet. Behind social media, Netflix may be a college student’s biggest foe when it comes to academics.
Going beyond Netflix’s popular originals like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black, here are five shows on Netflix to watch when you should be doing something else.
Lost
Seasons on Netflix: 6
Number of Episodes: 120
Time Wasted: 3 days, 14 hours, 52 minutes
Number of round trips you could have driven to Pittsburgh International Airport: 58
Take the plunge down the hatch with Jack and Kate to find a way off of this show’s mysterious island. Sometimes more baffling than The Island itself are its seemingly hostile inhabitants, The Others. The show will no doubt keep you wanting to know more about these elusive people and their origins in the most remote spot on Earth. From smoke monsters to secret codes and hydrogen bombs, Lost’s creator, J..J. Abrams, puts his characters through it all. Although the show raises many questions about the island, its finale, which aired in 2010, may leave you asking even more. Nevertheless, Lost’s unpredictable storyline and well-rounded characters will force you to move on to the next episode even when you know your project group mates can’t afford you to.
Dexter
Seasons on Netflix: 8
Number of Episodes: 96
Time Wasted: 3 days, 12 hours, 18 minutes
Number of times you could have watched Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture on YouTube: 66
Bloodstain pattern analyst by day; serial killer by night. Indulge with Dexter Morgan as he punishes criminals who have managed to sidestep the law. Adopted as a child, Dexter learned from his father to suppress his violent tendencies and only kill when his victims deserve it. Set in sunny Miami, Dexter’s daytime activities with the Miami Metro Police Department often starkly contrast with his gory nighttime hobby. From murderers known as the Ice Truck Killer to The Skinner, the people that Dexter tracks down in his spare time are often more twisted than him. First aired on Showtime in 2006, the series ended its critically-acclaimed run in the fall of 2013. All episodes are currently available for streaming on Netflix.
How I Met Your Mother
Seasons on Netflix: 8
Number of Episodes: 184
Time Wasted: 2 days, 16 hours, 49 minutes
Number of sandwiches you could have ordered at The Exchange during lunch rush: 259
This show’s story, true to its title, recounts to Ted Mosby’s children how he met their mother. Throughout the series, Ted’s four best friends, Robin, Marshall, Lily, and Barney make ridiculous bets, hide secrets, and pull stunts that are integral to the ultimate meeting and subsequent events, which viewers waited more than eight years to see. Barney – with his bro code, a tie decorated with ducks, and witty remarks – prevails as the sitcom’s standout character, although every character has their own charm within this close-knit group of friends. If you stream season nine from other services, How I Met Your Mother will take well over three days to watch and add an additional 44 sandwiches to your lunch runs at the Exchange.
The League
Seasons on Netflix: 4
Number of Episodes: 45
Time Wasted: 16 hours, 4 minutes
Number of times you could have walked to the Cathedral of Learning and back: 48
Whether you’re a sports fan or not, try to contain your laughter as you watch a group of buddies become overly invested in their fantasy football league. The show touches on many of the characteristics central to all fantasy leagues, including overly-competitive wives and questionable trades, as well as things you’d never imagine seeing in a fantasy football show, like Mr. McGibblets, a giant Barney-like costume that one cast member wears. Over the top and filled with plenty of one-liners, the show was originally on Fox Entertainment Group’s FX, but was moved to sister channel FXX for its fifth season, which aired in September 2013. Including season five, the show clocks in at more than 21 hours to date. The League’s sixth season is set to premiere on Sept. 6 at 10 p.m.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
Seasons on Netflix: 6
Number of Episodes: 121
Time Wasted: 1 day, 20 hours, 18 minutes
Number of minutes you could have studied in Club Hunt: 2,658
The force may not be with your grades, but it will be with you when you watch Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Try out this show if you’re looking for a cartoon with a light-hearted tone, but serious source material. Not only is the show clever and the animation slick, but the main characters are some of the most iconic sci-fi characters ever created. Along with classic figures like Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda, there are also newcomers, most notably Anakin’s padawan, Ahsoka Tano, who first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie that kicked off the television series. The show’s first five seasons aired on Cartoon Network, while Netflix picked up the final season as original material.
“Time Wasted” category calculated from episode times on Netflix; *How I Met Your Mother season nine and The League season five times calculated from iTunes episode times. Airport travel determined with a 45-minute travel time estimated by Carnegie Mellon. Exchange sandwiches estimated with a 15-minute wait time. Travel time to the Cathedral of Learning estimated by Google Maps. Last Lecture YouTube video time from Carnegie Mellon’s YouTube channel.*

If you’ve ever wondered how much sugar is in that smoothie you just ordered or wished you could buy fresh produce right on campus, you’re in luck this semester.
Carnegie Mellon Dining Services will offer extended hours, expanded menu options, furniture additions, new events, and other changes at numerous dining locations this semester.
According to Director of Dining Services Pascal Petter, the changes have been in the works since last September. While some alterations were vendor-driven, the vast majority of changes are the direct result of student feedback gathered online, in person, and at Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meetings.
Highlights include a campus nutrition app, strict kosher dining options, weekly farmers markets in Resnik eatery, late-night hours at Carnegie Mellon Café, and now-available breakfast blocks at Tazza D’Oro.
Extended Hours
According to Petter, previous semesters have seen “a need for campus to have some more locations open.”
Some locations will open earlier to provide options for earlier risers, while some will stay open later or open on the weekends to further accommodate student demand.
The Carnegie Mellon Café is now open until 2 a.m. every day of the week, and starting at 8 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
After discussions between Dining Services and the vendor, the Exchange will be 8 a.m.–8:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 8 a.m.–6 p.m on Friday. 
The Exchange will also be open 9:30 a.m.–2:30 p.m. on Saturday, when previously there were no weekend hours.
In the Marketplace on the second floor of the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC), Petter responded to student demand to see the more dinner-friendly eating options open later. 
The City Grill, Pasta Villagio, Evgefstos, and Spinning Salads will stay open until 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, while the remaining locations will close at the original 4 p.m. time.
The Underground is now open at 8:30 a.m. daily, including weekends, and stays open until midnight.
Expanded Menu Options
Petter also introduced a series of changes to expand students’ eating choices, accommodate dietary restrictions, and help vendors better adapt their dining options to student meal plans.
In the CUC Marketplace, Dining Services will introduce a new rice bowl concept, which will be among the locations open until 8 p.m. on weekdays.
Meanwhile, The Spice It Up Grill in Resnik will offer yakisoba noodles to appeal to the significant proportion of the student body that comes to campus from Asia, Petter said.
Tazza D’Oro now offers breakfast blocks to accommodate students on meal plans. “I think that will be very popular,” Petter said.
Vegetarian station Evgestos will offer new flatbread pizzas and superfood smoothies, which are both fruit- and vegetable-based. Finally, La Prima Espresso in Wean Hall will add new desserts, pastries, and chocolates to the menu.
Strict Kosher Options
Petter also collaborated with students from Hillel and the Jewish Community Center to accommodate orthodox Jewish students with strict dietary restrictions. The process underwent a pilot test in the spring and is launching now.
Dining Services had previously introduced kosher eatery The Pomegranate in the CUC, but even those food items are not prepared according to the strictest guidelines.
As an alternative for students who keep a strict kosher diet, students can order their meals online using their meal blocks at https://web.campusservices.cmu.edu/dining/kosher/. Those meals will be prepared offsite at Murray Avenue Grill and transported to campus for pickup.
Green Food Waste Practices
In order to institute green practices in food waste management, Dining Services has partnered with a web-based food waste tracking system.
According to Petter, CulinArt employees will weigh discarded food before disposing of it to track food waste. 
The system will take pictures of food waste for CulinArt and Dining Services to analyze.
Through this analysis, Petter hopes to better understand what students aren’t eating and how to cut back on their food waste.
Nutrition Information
Dining Services has also introduced a nutrition app to grant students easy access to complete nutrition information. The website version is available at cmu.mynutritioncalculator.net.
The app provides the same comprehensive information as a nutrition label on a food item, including potential allergens.  According to Petter, the process is “as simple as clicking on a meal period or a food group.”
The app also features a search tool that allows students to navigate campus dining options according to their dietary restrictions or preferences. Students looking for low-sodium meals or avoiding certain allergens can evaluate their options via the app.
Events
Another new dining option will be monthly bistro nights at Schatz Dining Room, which will offer full-service table linens and give students a taste of a fine dining experience. Petter also worked to bring the highly popular farmer’s markets to campus more frequently. 
While previous farmers markets were held in the CUC lobby on a monthly basis, they will now occur weekly in the Worlds of Flavor section of the Resnik eatery.
Furniture Additions
Dining Services has also introduced all new furniture in the Carnegie Mellon Café and the Cruciform and Doha rooms in the Resnik eatery.
The renovations are designed to facilitate student learning and collaboration, according to Petter. The larger seating options will allow students to study or work in groups while they eat.
Reception and Future Changes
Petter presented a summary of the changes to a group of resident assistants and orientation counselors on Aug. 15 and received instantaneous student feedback.
“It was well received,” Petter said. “I wouldn’t say standing ovation, but there was a lot of cheering and a lot of clapping.”
While this semester’s changes are numerous, Petter said, “It doesn’t mean that more changes are not coming.”
Petter and other dining services staff members will be tabling in the CUC lobby today, tomorrow, and Wednesday to answer questions and receive feedback about the modifications. 
Petter will also continue holding meetings with Student Senate and the GSA, where much of the initial feedback originated, and hearing from students at monthly Dining Services Advisory Council sessions.
“A big part of my role is to continuously look for ways to improve and evolve our dining program,” Petter said. “I anticipate more changes to come.”

Carnegie Mellon recently appointed James Duesing, professor of art, to director of Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences’s Center for Arts and Society (CAS).
The CAS, a joint effort between Carnegie Mellon’s College of Fine Arts and Dietrich College, “aims to explore and impact the workings of social power and in processes of social change,” according to its website.
The CAS was founded in spring 2000 with the help of a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and additional support from the university, the College of Fine Arts, and what is now Dietrich College.
Between its founding and 2007, the CAS provided postdoctoral and senior residential fellowships, and also offered classes and established an undergraduate minor in arts in society.
In 2008, the CAS changed its focus “toward supporting multi-year collaborative artistic and scholarly projects undertaken by Center members,” according to its website.
James Duesing, who has been a Carnegie Mellon faculty member since 1997, comes into the position of the director of CAS after co-organizing, along with professor of English Kathy Newman, the CAS Media Initiative from 2011-14.
The Media Initiative, according to a university press release, “reflected on media studies as a field and considered new artistic and theoretical issues that have emerged in response to the rise of new and digitally networked media.”
The Initiative consisted of a series of events, conferences, courses, and performances, and supported several major projects such as Occupy Facebook, which used art to examine the relationship between social media and nonviolent protest.
“CAS is at an exciting place,” Duesing said in the press release. “The initiative format has been effective at challenging faculty to think in long-term interdisciplinary ways about their work and research. I especially value the ground up approach the center takes in developing the multifaceted aspects of faculty research to work in the university and with external communities. I look forward to the innovations the new Performance Initiative will reveal and hope everyone in the university will join in and be part of the thought-provoking events and dialogue.”
Duesing is known for his work as an animator; he has worked in both traditional hand-drawn animation and digital animation. Since he began his Carnegie Mellon career in 1997, Duesing has taught courses for the College of Fine Arts on electronic time-based art and, from 1999–2003, he served as co-director of Carnegie Mellon’s STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, an interdisciplinary research institution in the arts, science, technology, and culture.
In the press release, Dean of the College of Fine Arts Dan Martin and Dean of Dietrich College Richard Scheines said jointly, “We are excited to see how James, with his considerable expertise and experience, will build on the achievements of Paul’s directorship and lead CAS in its unique interdisciplinary approach to research and education.”

The university announced at the end of the summer that the 2014 session of the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Talented Elementary and Secondary Students (C-MITES) program will be its last.
A letter on the C-MITES home page announced, “As the 2014 summer workshop session ends, we are writing to inform you that the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Talented Elementary and Secondary Students (C-MITES) program at Carnegie Mellon University will not be continuing after July 31, 2014.”
C-MITES, which had just finished its 22nd year, offered summer programs for gifted elementary and middle school students across Pennsylvania. The program was founded in 1992 by Ann Lupkowski-Shoplik, who also served as its director.
The letter on the C-MITES website continues to say that C-MITES “offered challenging weekend and summer programs in mathematics, sciences and the humanities for thousands of academically talented students as well as professional development activities for educators.”
C-MITES, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, cost between $255 and $500 for a one- to two-week half-day program, with limited financial aid available.
In the article Alex Gray, western region coordinator of the Pennsylvania Association for Gifted Education, said that C-MITES was a “staple” among local opportunities for academically gifted youth.
C-MITES also administered the EXPLORE test, a standardized exam used to measure college readiness that students typically take around 8th or 9th grade. The EXPLORE test is designed to prepare students for PLAN, typically taken in 10th grade, and the ACT, typically taken in 11th or 12th grade.
The ACT announced at the beginning of the summer, however, that they will no longer offer the EXPLORE test, and will support “ACT Explore testing after June 13, 2014 only where pre-existing contractual obligations necessitate.”
The ACT is replacing EXPLORE and PLAN with the ACT Aspire test, which assesses students in “grade 3 through early high school” for college and career readiness.
According to Carnegie Mellon’s press release on the subject, C-MITES was discontinued because of “declining testing and program enrollments and an increase in similar program offerings through traditional and digital formats.”
A university representative declined to comment outside of the released statements.
Although C-MITES is no longer offered, the press release notes that the university still offers “more than 75 challenging programs for K-12 students and teachers each year,” including “Architecture Explorations, the Tech Nights program in the School of Computer Science, the Pennsylvania Governor’s School for the Sciences and a Chemistry Carnival in late September.”
Carnegie Mellon offers many programs for gifted youth through the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach, which, according to its website, “work[s] with faculty, students and staff through on-campus and community-based activities that improve educational opportunities, especially in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics education for youth.”

This semester, students looking for a place to work with their peers will have a new private space in which to collaborate in the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC).
The Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) announced that, with the relocation of its student advising operations to West Wing, it is opening 30 rooms in its lower-level CUC space for employer recruitment interviews during the day and group work spaces at night.
The CPDC’s CUC spaces will be used as group study or meeting rooms for students from 7 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. every Sunday through Thursday.
Kevin Monahan, associate dean of students affairs for the CPDC, said the majority of the space’s rooms can hold at least four people, although some rooms may hold fewer. A conference room in the space will be able to accommodate more than 10 students, as well as feature a large-screen TV.
Monahan said the rooms can be used for anything from group projects to organizational or leadership meetings. Students will be able to book the rooms through 25Live, a room reservation website used by Carnegie Mellon. 
Usually, students and other campus members must wait for an approval email to confirm that they have booked rooms in the CUC, such as the Dowd, McKenna, Peter, and Wright rooms, through the reservation system. However, students do not have to wait for confirmation emails to book the CPDC’s evening study spaces, according to Marcia Gerwig, director of the CUC. Students will be able to book the rooms as early as a week in advance and as late as 24 hours prior to needing the rooms, Gerwig said.
In addition to booking study rooms, students are able to secure rooms through drop-in visits by stopping at the location to check if there are unbooked rooms at the time they arrive. A student CUC employee will be on duty to assist drop-in students in finding and unlocking unbooked rooms, according to Monahan.
To initially gauge how the space could serve student needs, Student Affairs discussed the evening uses of the rooms with executive members of Student Government, according to Monahan. It was determined that, while there were many individual and large group study spaces on campus, there was a need for small- to medium-sized group work spaces.
“These are not individual study carrels,” Monahan said, speaking of the space’s evening function. “These are great interactive group meeting spaces that are very flexible in their makeup and ... allow groups of students to get together to tackle team projects.... It will allow students hopefully more flexible space to explore their academics.”
Student Affairs and Student Government have continued conversations to determine various details of the rooms, such as how students will most likely use the rooms and what amenities they may need, according to Elizabeth Vaughan, director of student activities.
“We want to be able to create more spaces where the intended usage is not as narrowly defined as some other spaces on campus are,” Vaughan said. “These spaces aren’t for one specific purpose, but rather will hopefully meet a wide variety of needs including study space for small groups, meeting locations for student organizations, collaborative project workspace, and gathering spaces for groups. We wanted there to be consistency in timing and [the] reservation process as well as availability for long periods of time on prime study nights.”
During regular business hours, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., the CPDC will use the rooms to facilitate employer relations and house recruitment activities, according to Monahan. Monahan said the CPDC rooms will allow employers to meet with students in an “open house” format, and with CPDC staff, as well as allow students to practice interviewing. The rooms can be used for phone and Skype interviews, as well.
Additionally, recruiters will be able to conduct interviews throughout the on-campus recruiting season, which typically begins in September and runs through November. During this time, recruiters not associated with a particular career fair conduct interviews on campus. Monahan said the rooms will allow the CPDC to conduct a greater number of interviews in conjunction with the university’s career fairs, such as the Business, Technical, Employment, and Creative Arts Opportunities Conferences. Monahan said the CPDC is also “exploring more ways to maximize the use of the CUC-lower level space.”
Vaughan said that, with the inception of the interview rooms, it was important to Student Affairs to “maximize the opportunities possible” for students and to create multi-functional rooms in light of the university’s limited space within a bustling city.
The CPDC moved to its new main location on the second floor of West Wing on Aug. 15. To make the move possible, the university replaced student housing on the floor with CPDC consulting spaces and offices. This semester, the university is opening a new housing facility on Clyde Street, off of Fifth Avenue, which houses 31 students, including a resident assistant, according to floor plans of the facility on the Office of the Dean’s website. The new center occupies about three-quarters of West Wing’s second floor, while the remaining quarter now houses athletics offices, according to Monahan, who said that the CPDC moved 16 staff offices to West Wing, while keeping five offices in the CUC’s lower level for staff coordinating employer recruitment opportunities.

Unless you have been living in a cave for the last few weeks, you are likely very familiar with the viral ice-bucket challenge that has taken Facebook by storm. Chances are you’ve watched videos of people who have dumped large buckets of ice water onto their heads with little idea of why they were doing it besides impressing a few friends. Everyone from Bill Gates to former President George W. Bush has taken part in the challenge. I myself took the plunge.
Along with the $10,000 worth of cash that Charlie Sheen dumped over his head, the ALS Association (ASLA) has managed to raise over $41.8 million as of Aug. 21. However, while significant, it is only 0.01 percent of the total $416.5 billion that Americans donated to charitable organizations last year.
This low donation rate shows one of the major flaws with viral social media campaigns. As Malcolm Gladwell acknowledges in the The New Yorker, “the platforms of social media are built around weak ties.” Weak ties are created with those that you follow on Facebook, but would not otherwise stay in touch with. A network of weak ties is extremely effective in spreading information or, in this case, videos of people pouring ice over their heads. As of Aug. 15, 1.2 million ice bucket challenge videos have been uploaded and 15 million people have talked about it. In addition to these numbers, we can assume that a large portion of the 757 million daily users that Facebook reports have in some way been exposed to the challenge.
However, according to The New York Times, only 739,000 new donors have emerged as a result of the challenge. This shows a less fortunate effect of the weak-tie network. While members are usually willing to join a Facebook page or post a status about a cause, they are often not willing to give a significant contribution to that cause. People invest themselves very little in most of the things they see on social media networks.
Prior to taking the ice bucket challenge, a friend that I asked to record me asked if I knew anything about the ALSA, at which time I realized I had little idea about it and was about to take part in a challenge supporting it. He then wisely forced me to prepare a paragraph at the beginning of my video explaining what ALS was, so I did not join the thousands, if not millions, of people that took part in this challenge that were completely clueless about ALS.
The ice bucket challenge has brought people from around the world together to raise funding and fight against a disease that no one should have to experience. Overall, it has been a successful campaign. However, we must accept it for what it is: a viral campaign. Viral campaigns are an amazing way to spread information in the virtual world, but if one wants to make a real difference, it is necessary to spread information in the real world.

In the midst of multiple foreign policy crises and racially motivated shootings, it’s difficult to take a step back and look at the larger picture of President Obama’s stewardship of the country. However, six years into his presidency, it’s time to start examining the legacy our president will leave behind.
As many of us remember, when President Obama was ushered into office on a tide of hope, change, and most importantly, bipartisan support, it seemed like our country had turned a corner and another Era of Good Feelings was upon us. We’d finally found a charismatic leader who represented the antidote to everything we’d hated about his predecessor and offered us the post-partisan, post-racial future that Americans yearned for. President Obama promised to restore foreign policy sanity, safeguard individual freedoms, reform health care and immigration, and make the economy a fair place to earn a living after the recession.
Six years from then, it’s apparent that none of that happened. The Middle East is a mess, we’re still not sure if the Affordable Care Act has helped more people than it’s hurt, and 25 percent of college graduates are unemployed with a further 25 percent underemployed, many with crushing student debt. Perhaps most alarming, however, is that partisanship is at an all-time high, congressional approval at an all-time low, and a plurality of Americans now believe that race relations have worsened  under Obama.
By nearly any measure, the country is in worse shape than when President Obama took office in January 2009. Worst of all, even Democrats in Congress call Obama disengaged and uninterested in governing. It’s gone so far that The New York Times published an article defending the president’s golfing habits in times of crisis last Friday. With Republicans favored to win control of the Senate, the president isn’t likely to regain his interest in governance, which is just about to get harder for him.
With this in mind, let’s examine the question of Obama’s legacy. A lot of his foreign policy legacy will be determined by how the current situation in Iraq resolves itself, so let’s focus on domestic policy. President Obama’s two primary domestic achievements were the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (The Stimulus) and the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
With the lowest percentage of Americans working full time since the Depression, college looking like an increasingly bad investment, and companies relocating overseas to avoid our oppressive corporate tax structure, the economy is doing very poorly. Median household income is still lower than it was before the Recession, and income inequality is worsening at an increasingly rapid pace. Perhaps the Stimulus mitigated the effects of the Recession, but seven years after the start of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and six years into the weakest postwar economic recovery in United States history, the president’s economic stewardship can only be credited with mediocrity at best, and abject failure at worst.
The troubled legacy of the Affordable Care Act, from the failed rollout to the Hobby Lobby Case, isn’t worth rehashing, but it’s important to note that throughout its entire life, the act has always had more Americans opposed to it than in favor of it. Millions of Americans have lost their insurance, and millions more will continue to lose their insurance as corporate mandates kick in over the next few years. Health insurance rates have continued to rise much more quickly than inflation and many are finding that the new networks they have been given access to by their exchange-based insurance plans are severely limited to the point of inefficacy. In addition to this, even by the most generous estimates, the United States will still have at least 30 million uninsured when it’s fully rolled out, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
None of this is likely to matter soon, because two pending court cases threaten to cripple or at least derail the entire act. Speaker John Boehner’s case against the president will likely overturn Obama’s executive orders that keep the most potentially damaging parts of the act at bay until the 2014 midterms, reinforcing limits on executive powers. Finally, another lawsuit is making its way through the courts, one that could possibly stop the majority of states from being able to give subsidies to its citizens. If either of these lawsuits win, then the Affordable Care Act will be fatally undermined, and possibly thrown out altogether.
If this happens, then President Obama will have no major accomplishments to tout when building his legacy, and he will be remembered by his string of second-term scandals and incompetence, if not detachment, when dealing with domestic crises, such as the current ones at the border and in Ferguson. The president has yet to visit the sites of either issue.
This type of thing has happened in history before. Stagnant economic growth, domestic crises, and incompetent leadership are not unique to our country or our time. Japan experienced similar conditions in the 1990s, and historians have remembered the period as “The Lost Decade.” When historians look back on President Obama’s tenure as president, they won’t remember the lofty rhetoric that got him elected, but instead, they’ll remember the very real and very negative consequences of his policies, which very well may usher in our own Lost Decade.

Journalism is born on caring. Sure, narcissism and attention-seeking play their role, from the sensationalist headlines that regularly hit newsstands to our current epidemic of bait-and-click pseudo-news sources. There’s probably a bit of greed thrown in the mix as well, but let’s be honest — whoever thinks there’s money in the newspaper business is kidding themselves.
By and large, though, journalism is the product of pure, unadulterated caring. If apathy vanquished empathy once and for all in a battle of the sensibilities, well, then journalism as we know it would cease to exist.
The Tartan, like any newspaper, is a vehicle for caring. What does the paper care about? The obvious — and true — answer is Carnegie Mellon and the well-being of its students. Beyond that, the paper cares about producing unbiased content, keeping the student body informed, and encouraging important dialogues and engagement on campus.
Journalism, in this respect, is so terribly important, not only because it is the result of caring, but because it facilitates it.
Let’s face it. Carnegie Mellon is not a campus particularly charged with political zeal. The university is a research institution known for excelling in everything science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Consequently, it attracts many practical-minded and levelheaded students with their eyes not only on technical innovation, but also largely on pretty diplomas or a prettier six-figure salary. There’s nothing wrong with such goals, of course, but they can contribute to one rather insidious side effect: indifference.
Walk past the Cut, and you’re more likely to see robots being built than a rally being staged. Aspiring scientists easily outnumber aspiring activists. Ask your average student, and they are more likely to know three coding languages than the latest happenings in Russia or Israel. At the upcoming Activities Fair, expect to see more than a dozen engineering and robotics organizations before you come across our one-of-each organizations for environmentalism, feminism, and LGBTQ issues. At Carnegie Mellon, the STEM, and even social, clubs thrive. The sizable number of community service clubs is adequate, and sports certainly exist with members who participate in clubs and on competitive teams with enthusiasm.
However, the handful of organizations dedicated to the discussion of ideas and to the implementation of large-scale, positive social change — to actively addressing issues outside the world of Carnegie Mellon and our personal aspirations — are often understaffed and underappreciated.
Technology and science are harbingers of the future, and students at this university make discoveries and build tools to better humanity every day. Every little bit of practical change brought about by community service is valuable. Pragmatism and calm in the face of controversy are positive traits not to be scoffed at.
However, there is still something to be said for advocating — wholeheartedly and unashamedly — for the various national and global social issues that affect the world outside of Carnegie Mellon. This advocacy must come in the form of organized, highly visible groups of campus members.
They call millennials the “me” generation. They call us entitled and dependent and apathetic. Why not prove them wrong?
Make Carnegie Mellon as much a bed for social change as it already is for technological innovation.

As excited as we may be to welcome our friends back to campus, we know what lies ahead: long nights, busy days, and stressful interactions. Rest is one of the first things to disappear from our routines, but even before sleep there is one more thing we sacrifice: our connection to the outside world.
“The CMU Bubble,” as it is known occurs when we shroud ourselves in the campus community. The news is something many of us get notifications about on our smartphones, and which we only acknowledge for a moment before continuing to scroll, checking our Facebook notifications and replying to emails.
There are two current stories in particular which I believe merit further consideration and discussion. First, the recent events in Ferguson, Mo. feel brutally anachronistic. Law enforcement officers in riot gear and protesters assaulted with tear gas seem too outrageous to be real, particularly in the American Midwest of 2014. The militaristic, racially charged reaction of local officials has led to national controversy and outrage. The situation in Ferguson must be watched closely, as it connotes a complicated and troubling historical precedent.
A second news item of note is Brandon Stanton’s world tour with the United Nations. Stanton, the photographer behind popular blog and best-selling book Humans of New York, is taking his work outside of the city, conducting interviews and telling stories through his pictures globally. Stanton shows the human element of places like Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose people are so often skewed and simplified in Western media portrayals.
Stanton is known for pairing stunning portraits with funny, poignant, or deeply personal quotes from his subjects. The use of personal narratives puts these events into context, such as the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine since May, or the nearby threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — which has been classified as a terrorist organization by the United Nations — in Iraq, Lebanon, and Israel. Interviews with Syrian refugees in Jordan or Iraqi residents fleeing ISIS offer a starker and more developed picture of these conflicts than typical media coverage.
Both Ferguson and the HONY tour relate to such significant issues in the world today, yet neither is being discussed enough on campus. Who can blame us? Our lives are hectic. The world beyond campus is a distant place, usually unrelated to our stresses and fears. Will another failed cease-fire along the Gaza Strip have any effect on my calculus final? Not particularly. Still, nonchalance is troubling. If we attend Carnegie Mellon to pursue our passions — to put our hearts in the work — then we should be equally passionate about applying our education to real-world issues.

The Tartan was curious about what people are saying about the university these days. So we asked first-years, "What stereotypes about Carnegie Mellon have turned out to be true?"

Google is sponsoring research into massive open online courses (or MOOCs) here at Carnegie Mellon. While The Tartan recognizes the potential that this new style of teaching holds, MOOCs provide a learning experience of ambiguous quality, and should not replace real classroom learning.
MOOCs are increasingly popular on college campuses across the nation and have been for a few years now. In September 2013, Google partnered with edX — an online education nonprofit jointly created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — to design a website that will provide MOOC videos, according to Slate magazine. However, scant evidence exists that MOOCs are effective. According to Time magazine, current research into the subject — as limited as it is — suggests that online education offers inadequate success rates.
At first glance, MOOCs seem like a good way to offer education to a greater number of students at a reduced price. Upon further consideration, however, more issues come to light. Almost 90 percent of people who sign up for MOOCs do not actually complete them, partially because the courses are free and don’t count for credits in most universities, according to Time. Part of the problem is that many students do not feel compelled to complete the MOOCs because they don’t receive college credit, and many universities will not offer credit for MOOCs until more comprehensive research on their effectiveness becomes available.
MOOCs simply do not offer the same level of engagement that a classroom learning experience does. Online classes are more akin to huge lecture classes, where a professor tries to teach 100 students or more. The professor can’t possibly engage with all students, and most students will potentially have difficulty forging connections with their teacher. Though some students may excel in such an environment, many students would have great difficulty adapting.
Online education is a fast-developing field, with plenty of potential for expansion. However, until more of that potential is realized, online education should not be considered the equal of, or a replacement for, classroom learning.

Due to delays in construction of the Tepper Quadrangle, the 101st Spring Carnival will remain in the Morewood parking lot, Spring Carnival Committee said in June via their website. The committee’s announcement was clearly communicated almost a full academic year before Carnival, a move that shows considerable and transparent thought for students.
Last year, the committee maintained a Spring Carnival 100 website to release information. Announcements on the website for the 100th year informed students about the possible relocation for the following Carnival.
The site discussed potential locations for hosting Carnival’s main events, such as Booth and rides, after the start of the Tepper Quadrangle’s construction.
Tasked with running an event that elicits significant student interest and anticipation, the committee has been consistent in providing students with as much information as it can, even when unsure of final outcomes during deliberations. 
The committee, in tandem with university faculty heading the event, has been candid about this uncertainty and hosted a town hall about the relocation to collect campus members’ input.
Arguably the largest campus-wide event, Spring Carnival connects a variety of individuals and organizations that need to collaboratively plan months in advance.
Having an organization at the forefront that is communicative with the other involved organizations, and with the student population, is appreciated and a necessity.
As the committee continues outreach, The Tartan hopes it will continue to use its various channels of communication, like its website and  public meetings, to gather student input and release the latest information pertaining to Spring Carnival.
Spring Carnival is meant to provide students with a few days of relaxation, and the committee has  shown that it strives to serve those students by effectively reducing the guess work and anxiety about the future of this campus tradition.

At the beginning of this 2014–15 academic year, The Tartan looks back at President Suresh’s inaugural year and looks ahead at the impact we expect our new president will have during the rest of his tenure.
Last year, President Suresh made a conspicuous effort to connect with the student body and reflect students’ concerns, and we hope to see the follow-up changes that will help confirm Suresh’s position as an advocate of the student body.
Below are two important issues that we hope Suresh continues to address during his term. 
The University Health Services’ day-long event “Exploring Health, Discovering Wellness,” along with the creation of the Mindfulness Room, was intended to address discussions of stress culture that have been ongoing since December 2012.
While the initiative drew attention across campus and showed an administrative response to student concerns, the university’s approach seems a temporary fix when one considers the root of students’ concerns, which is largely academic in nature. 
The existing changes are welcome gestures, but will they solve the institutionalized problem of students enduring strings of sleepless nights to turn in assignments and finish projects, or taking on overwhelming course loads?
Second among this administration’s efforts, the Simon Initiative promises to pursue educational innovation by globally sharing data. 
Upon close inspection, the model is a fascinating and promising one, but its details must be more clearly communicated to the campus community.
President Suresh’s inaugural year was characterized by gestures of goodwill. We expected our new president’s first year to be filled with pomp and circumstance, but The Tartan now hopes President Suresh will continue to work actively behind the scenes to ensure the student body is healthy and well informed. 
The Tartan commends Suresh for establishing himself as a community listener and forming an open dialogue with students, but we expect that the coming year will prompt a serious consideration of what concrete steps canmove our community forward.
