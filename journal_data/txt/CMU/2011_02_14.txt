While many people will be celebrating a Hallmark holiday with their loved ones this Valentine's Day, baseball fans worldwide are also celebrating the official start to spring training. Today is the reporting date for most teams' pitchers and catchers, and by the end of the week, spring training will officially be underway. While we at Carnegie Mellon certainly don't have the time to be traveling frivolously, the start of baseball's preseason serves as an excuse for diehard fans to pack their bags for Florida and/or Arizona for some warm weather and, finally, some Major League Baseball.
Spring training is important because it provides preseason excitement and intrigue. It allows for position battles, it gives prospects a chance to strut their stuff, and, most importantly, it provides optimism for every baseball fan. Fans have every reason to be happy and optimistic — not much can go wrong (barring an injury), actual games are being played, successful springs can only leave high hopes for the regular season, and if a player or team has a bad spring, who cares? It's only spring training. Not to mention that baseball has ushered spring in five weeks before it actually begins.
The 2011 season marks the first year at the helm of their respective teams for five managers and the first full season for five more, and a good spring training will no doubt instill much-needed confidence in each for the regular season. Even without a good spring training record, signs of leadership, control, and an understanding of the game and his players will leave a good impression for each new manager. Terry Collins of the Mets will no doubt be under the most scrutiny if spring training goes poorly; Clint Hurdle of the Pirates, however, has nowhere to go but up; and anything positive out of Bradenton, Fla. will be a good thing for that franchise.
Mike Quade will be entering his first full season as manager of the Cubs after an abbreviated interim stint at the end of the 2010 campaign. Quade's team has certainly upgraded its starting lineup this offseason, and spring training will allow Quade to quickly get on the same page as his new stars Matt Garza, Carlos Penam and Kerry Wood. On the other hand, Florida's Edwin Rodriguez will enter his first full season with a Marlins team that, while certainly chock full of future talent, does not look nearly as well-equipped as the group he managed in 2010. However, Rodriguez is in full control of the Marlins' potential in 2011, and his ability to nurture the talents of youngsters Chris Coghlan, Gaby Sanchez, Logan Morrison, and Mike Stanton will dictate how successful this Florida team can be. Keep in mind that on paper, Bud Black's young Padres were not expected to do much last year, but, well... Black's 2010 Manager of the Year award more than tells that story.
On a sadder note, this past weekend brought the death of an old manager: Chuck Tanner, who managed the Pirates from 1977–85 and led the 1979 team to a World Series title. Pirates fans — and all other baseball fans — mourn his passing and no doubt fondly recall the "We Are Fam-a-lee" Pirates that came back to win the Series after trailing, three games to one. Hopefully, 32 years after that triumphant season, Hurdle will be able to foster this year's young, talented Pirates team into something that would have made Tanner proud, and — finally — return winning baseball to Pittsburgh.

Any huge NBA fan surely has heard that Denver Nuggets small forward Carmelo Anthony wants out of Denver before his contract expires after the 2010–11 season. It is also well known that Anthony, otherwise known by his nickname, “Melo,” has specifically said that he would only sign an all-important contract extension with the New York Knicks, ensuring that other teams would not be willing to pay Denver’s asking price to acquire Anthony for only half a season. Throughout the season there has been so much speculation as to where Carmelo would be traded that we do not even know where the most likely destination is for the young superstar. 
So, what is going to happen to Carmelo Anthony? Most experts seem to think that he will inevitably be traded to the Knicks, as the Nuggets do not want “Melo” to hit free agency and potentially sign with any team he wants. If Carmelo does hit free agency, he will most certainly sign with the Knicks and Denver will get absolutely no value for letting him go. This is why it is imperative that Denver trade him before the Feb. 24 trade deadline, or they will risk Melo not signing with them and leaving them empty-handed. Denver has a very tough decision on its hands, as they do have a very solid team that could potentially make a few upsets in an extremely competitive Western Conference. Another option that has been announced in the past week is a potential trade that would bring “Melo” to the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most successful franchises in history. Los Angeles would send their starting and promising center, Andrew Bynum, to the Nuggets in exchange for Carmelo in order to even out salaries. Not only would this make Los Angeles an even stronger contender than they already are, but it would also give Denver a new centerpiece to build their franchise around. Bynum, who is considered one of the best centers in the Western Conference, would be a huge upgrade for the Nuggets, who are relying on old veterans and journeymen to fill out their starting five.
However, the strongest rumors are coming out of New York. At first, it seemed almost impossible for the Knicks to make a deal with Denver, given their unwillingness to part with their young talent. Luckily for the Knicks, Minnesota is highly interested in a young New York player named Anthony Randolph, who has fallen out of favor with Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni and Knicks general manager Donnie Walsh. This would allow the Knicks to get another first round pick, making a potential Knicks offer a bit more enticing. If the Knicks can get a first round pick out of the Timberwolves, you can count on seeing Carmelo in a Knicks uniform this year. 
But, would Carmelo improve the team by that much? It is well known to the rest of the NBA that the Knicks could possibly be the worst defending team that anyone has ever faced. If there is one thing that Carmelo doesn’t provide, it’s good defense. The Knicks also seem to struggle in defensive rebounding rate. Advanced statistics show that Anthony only gives a slight upgrade in both of those areas, and the only major upgrade he gives the Knicks is in points per game. The thing is, the Knicks already are in the top five in scoring offense, mitigating the effect a superstar like Anthony would bring. Although many suggest that this is the case, I believe that acquiring a player of Anthony’s character is a once in a lifetime chance for a franchise like New York, which is still trying to leave the past six to seven seasons behind. Anthony would create a massive amount of buzz in New York, and the Knicks play in one of the most famous arenas in all of sports, Madison Square Garden. If anything, at least Melo would bring all the fans out to the Garden, giving the Knicks the home-court advantage they once utilized so well.
As of right now we are still waiting on any word from the Nuggets about where to trade their superstar. We have heard that almost every team has gotten involved, whether it be to help another team out in a three way trade, and sometimes even four way trades. Yet, no one has been able to reach the asking price of the Nuggets, especially when Anthony is refusing to negotiate contract extensions with many of the teams. All we do know is that the melodrama has gotten old, and every NBA fan wants this all to end. Being from New York, I’m definitely hoping it's with the Knicks.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team has once again proven why it finished No. 8 in the nation last year, this time by defeating the Division I Colonials of Robert Morris University, 5–4. After adding another win to their belts, the Tartans move to 6–2 for the year. 
“Our only goal is to take care of business in every match. We have several first-years and lots of different doubles teams to work with, so playing non-league teams is a good warm-up for our regular season,” sophomoreHarsha Rao said.
Despite successful results against the Colonials in previous years, the Tartans got off to a bumpy start Saturday morning on the courts of Oxford Athletic Club. The usual duo of  junior Jeremy King and sophomore Jooho Yu was not able to pull off a win at No. 3 doubles, and neither was the No. 2 team of senior Alex Nemerov and sophomore Harsha Rao. Pulling in the lone doubles win were senior Bobby MacTaggart and sophomore Duke Miller, who topped the Colonials’ Ricardo Horlie and Aaron Haas handily, 8–2. 
The Tartans found themselves down 2–1 heading into singles play.For singles, Yu exited the court first with a 6–2, 6–1 win, followed by King on the next court, who won 6–3, 6–1. Nemerov topped his opponent in straight sets, and MacTaggart claimed victory in three sets to add the final two points. 
“This year’s match against RMU was a lot closer than we expected. I think this shows we need to step up our game during practice and really solidify our strategies before we play UAA teams,” co-captain MacTaggart said. “Otherwise, I’m confident that we can hit last year’s ranking of eight, and with a bit of luck and hard work, hopefully break the top five.”
The Tartans will travel to Fredericksburg, Va., next weekend to compete in the National ITA Indoor Championships.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team continued its season this week with two new matches. The team emerged victorious against Slippery Rock University on Friday at the Oxford Club with an 8–1 win. On Saturday, California University of Pennsylvania hosted the women’s team at Glenn Creek Tennis Club, and the Tartans fell 8–1 against the Division I team. This puts the women’s team match record at 3–1.
During the doubles matches against the Rock, the No. 2 doubles team of senior Jennifer Chui and junior Cze-Ja Tam finished first against Jannelle Krantz and Lauren Coggins of Slippery Rock, 8–2. Juniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin defeated Sarah Lynch and Duja Drmac 8–2, followed by the No. 3 duo of first-year Maddie Rabson and sophomore Alex Tapak, who beat Lizzy Yetiskul and Sam Bruggermen 8–3.
The Tartans continued their momentum into singles play, taking five of the six singles matches with brute force. Tam finished first against Krantz, 6–1, 6–3. Tam said, “We haven’t played for a couple months since our fall season, so it’s good that we play some [Division II] teams to practice different lineups and doubles strategies. There’s a big difference between practice and actual match play, so this is essential for us to get back into shape.”
At first singles, Chen defeated Sarah Lynch and exited the court second with a decisive score of 6–3, 6–1. “I think the match against Slippery Rock went well,” Chen said. “Courtney and I were able to play really well in our doubles match, and I just used that momentum in my singles match. I think that if the team continues to work hard in practice and gets used to playing matches on a regular basis again, then we will definitely have a good season.”  
At No. 5 singles, Chui won her match against Slippery Rock’s Lauren Coggins, 6–3, 6–3. “Even though it’s the start of [the] season and we’re all a little bit rusty in match play, the team played really well in both singles and doubles,” Chui said. “Hopefully we can keep up this performance in the upcoming matches.”
At No. 6 singles, Rabson defeated Melissa McCutcheon, 6–1, 6–3. 
At Saturday’s match, Carnegie Mellon lost to the California University of Pennsylvania, 8–1. Chen was able to win her match at No. 1 singles against Annabel Pieschl, 2–6, 6–4, 10–6. The Tartans’ next match will be in two weeks on Saturday, Feb. 26 at Kenyon College.

This past Saturday, Carnegie Mellon’s track and field team continued its season by participating in Bucknell University’s Winter Classic. Teams from all divisions participated, and the Tartans managed to rise to the top. 
On the women’s side, first-year Jacqueline Guevel had a fantastic meet, winning the 60-meter hurdles and taking home fifth in the 60-meter dash, with times of 9.06 and 7.95 seconds, respectively. Fellow first-year Maritina Tsembelis also proved her ability to be a top performer, finishing fourth in the 3,000-meter run in 10:29.56, closely followed by teammate junior Christine Warner, who took sixth in 10:39.93. Continuing the distance success, senior Courtney Baker took fourth in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:20.68.  Baker and senior Laura McKee both went home with career bests in the mile, with times of 5:09.48 and 5:14.41, finishing sixth and eighth in the event, respectively.
On the field, senior Morgan Faer took seventh in the weight throw with a distance of 12.7 meters, a career best.  Senior Melissa Hwang earned fourth in the triple jump with a career best of 10.22 meters.  
As for the men, on the track, sophomore Daniel Ching took sixth in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.46 seconds. Senior Dustin Musselman placed fourth in the 400-meter dash in 50.97.  Senior Nate Bussiere took second in the 3,000-meter run, finishing the race in 8:30.13, winning by a mere 0.2 seconds. 
In addition, sophomore Evan Gates came in seventh in the 3,000 with a time of 8:40.00.  Junior Rob Morhard scored a fourth-place finish in the mile with a time of 4:21.00, while first-year Ken Murphy finished seventh in 4:25.41. Finally, senior J.P.

The Tartan men’s basketball team had a rough week, going 0–2 in its games. Its first game was at home against the University of Chicago Maroons on Sunday, Feb. 6.
It was a game of lead changes, but the Tartans ultimately lost to the Maroons 79–71 after starting out 24–10. Chicago then hit the Tartans with a 17–3 run over the next eight minutes to pull within three.
The Maroons managed another run, this one 10–0, to take a 39–34 lead at halftime. 
Whatever Chicago’s coach Mike McGrath said at halftime worked, because the Maroons were hot after the break. But the Tartans kept fighting back. With a 50–42 Maroons lead, Carnegie Mellon went on a 9–0 run to take a one-point lead.
Over the next seven minutes there were five lead changes. After the Tartans led 61–59 with six minutes in the game, the Maroons scored seven straight, and they did not relinquish the lead after that.
The Tartans outshot the Maroons 46.3 percent to 41.0 percent and connected on eight out of 20 threes, but it wasn’t enough to pull out a victory.
Senior Matthew Pettit led the Tartans with 19 points, and first-year Christian Manoli added 15.
The second game of the week for Carnegie Mellon was against Brandeis University on Friday, in Waltham, Mass. 
This Tartans’ loss was a product of poor shooting. Carnegie Mellon shot just 37.9 percent from the field in the contest.
The Judges started the game with a 16–9 lead and were hot throughout the first half, shooting 60 percent. They led by double digits through most of the half, taking a 44–28 lead on the Tartans into halftime.
Brandeis scored the first four points, after the half before a 10–2 run by the Tartans cut the lead to 12. Pettit pulled the Tartans within 10, but they did not get closer than that. 
The next three minutes consisted of a Judges’ 9–2 run, leading to the 80–63 victory.
Pettit led the Tartans again in scoring, putting 14 points in, and senior Shane Rife had 13 points of his own.
The low shooting percentage has been key in many of the Tartans’ losses this season, with the game against Chicago being an exception. Whether the poor shooting against Brandeis was a product of the Tartans not running the offense effectively or simply missing shots, the Tartans needed to make shots to beat an elite team like the Judges.
Carnegie Mellon played the New York University Violets on Sunday, in New York.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team lost a hard-fought game on Friday night to Brandeis University, 59–54. The Tartans came out firing in the first half, fueled by four three-pointers from junior Nicole Vaccarella, one three a piece from junior Jen Larsen and first-year Gina Tudi. Tudi also ran the show on offense as a distributor, tallying up eight assists before halftime. The women went into the half leading 34–22. It was one of their best first-half performances of the year, as their offense was strong and their defense put the clamps on Brandeis. Unfortunately, the Tartans couldn’t continue their dominance in the second half and ended up losing by five. 
The second half was close throughout, but Brandeis pulled away to win the game, as the Carnegie Mellon women’s offense failed to fire at the same clip as the first half. The loss drops the Tartans to 2–19 on the season and 0–10 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. Even in the disappointing loss, the Tartans saw outstanding performances from Nicole Vaccarella, Gina Tudi, and sophomore Emily Peel. Vaccarella finished the game with five three-pointers and 18 points in all. Tudi finished with nine assists (one shy of the Carnegie Mellon record), and Peel recorded 17 points and nine rebounds. 
After the tough loss at Brandeis, the Tartans dropped another game on Sunday afternoon to New York University (NYU), 72–50. Once again the women kept the game close in the first half, only trailing by six at halftime, but struggled in the second half as NYU pulled away. Junior Jacki Cortese led the Tartans in scoring on Sunday with 13, and Peel registered another solid performance with 12 points. The Violets of NYU were just too much for the Tartans on Sunday, however, and Carnegie Mellon looks forward to two home games this upcoming weekend.
The Tartans host University of Rochester at 6 p.m. this upcoming Friday night and take on Emory University on Sunday at 2 p.m. Following a disappointing weekend in Boston and New York, the women look to turn it around in their final home stand of the season. 
Looking toward the upcoming UAA weekend with a sense of urgency, Jen Larsen commented, "We really need to pick it up this weekend. Our last two losses should motivate us because they showed that we can compete in this league, but we need to improve our consistency. We want to finish the season with some wins, and I think we're capable of doing that.”

First-year Jacqueline Guevel exceeds the pace her predecessors set on the track team.   
As a first-year, she has already broken two Carnegie Mellon track records. One record was in the 55-meter dash, with a time of 7.52 seconds. The second was the 55-meter hurdles, with a time of 8.71 seconds. 
Guevel comes to Carnegie Mellon from the Hockaday School in Dallas, Texas. She chose to attend Carnegie Mellon based on its great engineering program as well as its Division III athletics. “I wanted to be able to focus on my studies and yet still have track as a part of my life,” Guevel said. “It’s the best stress reliever.”
Guevel is planning on majoring in mechanical engineering or civil engineering, but is not quite sure what she wants to do with it yet.
So far this season Guevel has had two favorite memories about the team. The first was breaking the school record in the 55-meter hurdles and the 55-meter dash, while the second was the team bus rides back from Pitt practices. “There is never a dull moment,” Guevel said.The track and field team is more than just a team, she said. 
Guevel loves that the members are all so supportive and fun to hang out with. For instance, this past weekend at the first overnight meet, they played Bananagrams instead of doing homework. “It was great!” said Guevel.
Track and field season has just begun, and the team competes in its next meet against Kent State University. 
There are still a lot of big meets coming up with NCAA Indoor Championships in two weeks. It will be exciting to see what times Guevel puts up next.

Students who have participated in Room Selection in the past may remember Housing Services’ major changes to the process. This year, like last year, there are no noticeable changes in the Room Selection process, except for that the process occurs over a longer period of time and many of the dates are later than usual. For those students still unsure of the process, here is a rundown of the phases of Room Selection.
The Room Selection process is broken down into several phases: Room Retention, “Room with a Retainer” (also known as “Pull-ins”), “Elect to Participate,” and General Room Selection. Room Selection occurs during the next five weeks of classes, so all students returning next year should at least start thinking about their plans.
Room Retention
Room Retention, the first phase, which begins today at 9 a.m., gives students the option to remain in their current living location as long as they are currently part of a building or floor that allows room retention. If you live in an exclusively first-year building or floor, you are unable to retain your room. This retention process ends at 5 p.m. on March 18.
Room with a Retainer
The next main Room Selection event, starting at 9 a.m. on March 21, is the “Room with a Retainer” phase. Each day is designated to certain buildings for retainers to choose their pull-ins. Building schedules will be announced shortly.
Elect to Participate
Following spring break will be the “Elect to Participate” phase. Like last year, this is optional, but is necessary for all students intending to remain in campus housing who haven’t retained, been pulled in, or applied for Block Housing. This process begins March 27 at 9 a.m. and continues until March 31 at 5 p.m. Lottery numbers for General Room Selection will be sent out the following day, April 1, by 5 p.m.
The “Elect to Participate” phase is the period for Oakland Priority and Block Housing Selection. Oakland Priority Selection is for students who are being displaced from their Oakland apartments. Block Housing is for any group of six or more students planning on living in the same building. Areas designated for Block Housing are Fairfax, Shady Oak, and Webster. All Block Housing placements must completely fill their rooms — 
no empty slots are allowed. Oakland Priority Selection is March 25, and Block Housing Selection is March 29 and 30. Additionally, applications for Block Housing are due March 18 by 5 p.m.
General Room Selection
The final phase is “General Room Selection.” All students who elect to participate in General Room Selection are scheduled to choose their room according to their lottery numbers. The selection process will take place on April 4 and 6. Open assignments will take place on April 5 during General Room Selection.
All individuals participating in Room Selection must choose from either a single room, or a room or apartment that has only one space left. Housing rates are expected to increase again this year by about 4 to 6 percent.
There will be no newly added first-year-only housing facilities this year.

FAST FACTS:
Location: Corner of Forbes Avenue and Morewood Avenue
Style(s) of housing: Prime singles, prime doubles, prime triples; one six-person and one 10-person suite reserved for Special-Interest Housing
Size: 455 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: Three, one each on the second, fourth, and sixth floors

Other amenities: TV room, quiet study lounge, computer cluster, workout facility, recreation room, and two laundry facilities at opposite ends of the building
While students of most residences have to pull on their shoes and head to campus to find a hot meal or a working printer, Morewood Gardens residents need not leave the premises. Fully equipped with a computer cluster, a source of convenient (albeit greasy) food at The Underground, large laundry rooms, and a gym, this dorm is completely self-sufficient. And what’s more, it’s smack at the corner of Morewood and Forbes avenues, only a couple of steps away from campus.
The dorm’s proximity to campus gives it a significant edge over other residential areas. This factor maximizes your sleep time before early classes and also allows you to sprint back for your homework when you realize you’ve left it in your room. While both Stever and Mudge Houses are located on Morewood Avenue, both house only first-year students, making Morewood the only choice for students who want to live in this area.
Morewood’s plentiful lounges, including a few on each floor in addition to the larger study rooms and TV lounge on the first floor, allow for frequent group gatherings. While this is a positive attribute for more social students, it means that several rooms on each floor are likely to experience more frequent noise disturbances throughout the day and night.
When choosing a room in Morewood, it’s hit-or-miss. Some rooms are spacious and quiet, and others are small and loud. It’s the luck of the draw, and sometimes you lose. Try to plan out which rooms look best from the floor plans online, and try to visit a room before committing. This will give you a good idea of what you’re getting.
Morewood Gardens could be a great place to live, but before deciding to move in, check out the rooms ahead of time and ask the current residents about the noise situation, as some rooms are better than others.

We all come to college ready for a taste of independence. And we’re granted just that upon arrival and our first day at Carnegie Mellon, even if that independence comes with close living quarters with a roommate — or roommates — that we’ve never met before, and being subjected to the same selection of food day in and day out with the mandatory meal plan. So it’s no wonder that after a year of this monotony, many students are ready to move off campus to gain further independence after living in the first-year dorms. I’m here to tell you, however, that staying on campus isn’t nearly as bad as some say.
After about the first month of classes, the novelty of waking up every day at 8 a.m. quickly wears off, especially with the often-dreary Pittsburgh weather. Knowing this, it is much easier to force yourself to get up for class when you only have a five-minute walk ahead of you to class rather than a 25-minute one. Living on campus allows you the benefit of a few extra pushes of the snooze button, something that all students appreciate. And when you’re finally finished cramming for that big exam and you’re leaving the library at 2 a.m., it’s certainly comforting to know that your bed is mere minutes away and that you don’t have to walk to your apartment quickly while holding your valuables close and keeping an eye out for approaching shadows.
Living on campus also gives you a place to stop back during the day when you have a few hours between classes — you don’t have to be a permanent fixture in the napping pod in the library or the black chairs in the UC when you need a quick nap. Likewise, you don’t have to carry every single book and notebook with you for your entire day’s schedule.
While some may worry about not being able to fully participate in the social life that off-campus living can offer, many would beg to differ. You can certainly still attend all the off-campus parties you want (though you may have a bit of a walk there and back), but you don’t have to worry about being the one to have to clean up the apartment the next day. A win-win situation, in some students’ opinions.
Finally, it gives you a chance to always be near to anything that’s happening on campus, whether it’s a last-minute snowball fight or a spur-of-the-moment decision by your floor to go to half-price in Oakland. While you may not have full independence like your peers dwelling off campus, there’s time for that after college, when real life begins. Until then, take advantage of the snooze button and weekly bathroom cleaning that comes with living on campus.

For those tired of dorm life, moving off campus is an extremely enticing option. While there are a few downsides to the decision, there are a number of benefits as well. Listed below are some pros and cons of living off-campus. You can use this as a guide to decide whether moving off campus is the right decision for you.
To begin with the positives, it’s cheaper than on-campus housing. Although this is not true in all cases (if you choose to live alone in a beautiful studio apartment on the middle of upscale Walnut Street, it’s going to be way more expensive), in most cases, especially if you are sharing an apartment with a roommate, the cost will be quite affordable. Rent for two-bedroom apartments usually ranges from $600 to $800 per month. Adding to that an electricity bill of around a $100 per month during the winter, and an Internet bill of around $50 per month, the total expenditure per month is usually around $750 to $950. Split that between two people and you have to pay $375 to $475 per month. If you do the math, you will realize that for four months you have to pay a maximum of $1,900. A prime double in Morewood costs $3,170 per semester. If you choose apartment-style living offered by the university, it will be even more expensive. In terms of cost, we have a clear winner.
You have your own kitchen. If you were one of those people who hated it when you had to walk all the way across the dorm carrying utensils and food to cook, only to realize that the kitchen was occupied, off-campus living is for you. With your own kitchen you can spend hours cooking, clean up at your leisure, and not have to worry about what that suspicious-looking spill on the stove was.
There’s more space. This is an obvious one. You can have your own bedroom. There’s a living room that you don’t have to share with the 20 people living on your floor. You have more closet space. It is also great for parties — when you invite 10 people over, they actually have space to move around.
It’s closer to good food. If you are bored of cooking and are looking for options to eat out, you have a wide range of choices available once you live off campus. Apartments in Oakland and around Craig Street are near some excellent restaurants, ranging from Indian to Italian to Mexican cuisines — you have it all. Shadyside and Squirrel Hill also have a number of options for eating out.
You don’t need to worry about noise levels. You don’t have to worry about loud music playing at 2 a.m. when you have an exam the next day. Conversely, you don’t have 
to worry about disturbing others when you want to play loud music at night. Apartments aren’t soundproof, but they are reasonably well spaced apart so that you are not disturbed by what is going on in your neighbor’s apartment and vice-versa.
Unfortunately, off-campus living also brings complaints. It’s far from campus. This is perhaps the most widely expressed argument against living off campus. Although this is a problem, it depends on where you live. Oakland and Craig Street really are not too bad a walk from campus, and once you start living there, you will find a number of shortcuts that take you to campus quickly. Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, on the other hand, do pose a problem and are quite a distance from campus, though buses do run through these neighborhoods.
You are away from friends. Unless all of your close friends decide to move off campus, you will be away from them, unable to knock on their doors at crazy hours of the day.
You have a much heavier backpack. There is no way you can run back and forth between your apartment and campus multiple times throughout the day. You end up having to carry your laptop and all the books you want to study out of. This may result in backaches throughout the semester.
Ultimately, though, if you really want to move off campus, there are ways to work around the disadvantages. The university Escort and shuttle are quite reliable and can take you home if you live far away and like studying late on campus. If you are someone who will miss friends, study with them during the day or have them come and stay over with you sometimes. As for the heavier bags, consider using library resources sometimes instead of carrying everything with you. Living off campus can be a great experience and while it does come with a few disadvantages, there are many benefits which can make the experience worthwhile.

FAST FACTS:
Location: The Hill — across the courtyard from Boss, in front of Hamerschlag
Style(s) of housing: Prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 71 residents (female only)
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: One on the first floor
Lounges: One per floor, and one main lounge on the first floor with a study lounge
Other amenities: Laundry room
McGill, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-female dorm, offers residents prime doubles and singles arranged into suites. Each suite connects two doubles, or two doubles and one single. Rooms in McGill are small, meaning residents often are forced to loft their beds and sleep only inches from the ceiling. However, the size of the rooms is offset by the convenience of semi-private bathrooms in each suite.
McGill may be all female, but residents’ social lives are certainly not limited. McGill offers a friendly environment, especially since residents can socialize in any of the individual floor lounges or in the large first-floor television room and study area. Weekly events that bring together residents from both Boss and McGill offer a reliable dose of fun and entertainment. Also, when residents tire of their own building, they are just a few steps away from other Hill residences — including Hamerschlag, Carnegie Mellon’s all-male dorm.
McGill’s location on Margaret Morrison Street also offers unique perks. Residents can catch art exhibitions, shows, and events at The Frame, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run art gallery on the corner of Forbes and Margaret Morrison. After a short walk across the street, residents can take advantage of the nearby campus dining locations, including Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and Resnik Café. And when campus food gets too monotonous, the food trucks parked nearby offer a great alternative to on-campus dining.
McGill certainly has its downfalls. Shared bathrooms with limited hot water, unreliable locks, and tiny showers are certainly a concern — but don’t forget to take into account that the bathrooms, while slightly dysfunctional, are cleaned weekly by housekeeping staff. As for the rooms, size ranks at the top of the list of complaints.
However, despite the less-than-fabulous facilities, McGill offers female students an excellent social experience in a uniquely convenient location.

FAST FACTS:
Location: Adjacent to Gesling Stadium, next to the University Center
Style(s) of housing: Suite — typically five students share a common living space and bathroom. Dorm — prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 296 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: Four (West Wing floors 2 and 4, Resnik floors 2 and 3)
Lounges: Four (West Wing floors 3 and 5, Resnik floors 4 and 5)
Resnik and West Wing are the ideal dormitory choices for students who aren’t ready — or aren’t willing — to move off campus but want a bit more of a grown-up place to live than a typical dorm. While students in these dorms have the chance to be more independent, they also boast a quick walk to any of the academic buildings on campus, a definite benefit for those mornings when you just can’t seem to stop hitting the snooze button.
Both dorms consist primarily of suites, which are made up of two doubles and a single with a common bathroom and lounge for the suite. A limited number of prime singles and doubles do exist in the buildings as well, though they are not as well known.
Resnik and West Wing are optimal for a group of friends who wish to live together but want to maintain their proximity to campus and the other advantages — like free toilet paper and a once-a-week bathroom cleaning — that living on campus offers. Students mostly stay inside their suites, leaving the hallways relatively quiet. The lounges do fill up, however — usually with groups of students either working on homework or hooking up their video game systems to the television.
Both buildings do offer kitchens on certain floors, which is nice when you’ve had your fill of The Exchange and Sí Señor, but if you don’t feel like cooking, Resnik is home to a number of dining options. There is the Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and Resnik Café. In particular, Resnik Café offers a variety of choices, including sushi, Indian cuisine, and comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous amenities that Resnik and West Wing offer, it is not surprising that both of these dorms fill up early in the room selection process. Hopeful residents are advised to find a friend who can pull them in.

FAST FACTS:
Location: On the corner of Forbes Avenue and Beeler Street
Style(s) of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (three students); efficiencies — one-bedroom (two students); a two-bedroom suite for Special Interest Housing
Size: About 150 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency
Lounges: Study lounge, TV lounge
Other amenities: Lounges include a piano, pool table, and ping pong table; laundry facilities include six washers and six dryers; exercise facilities include four cardio machines and dumbbells. 
Deceptively close to campus facilities, Doherty Apartments can be considered one of the best options for on-campus housing. It is a mere three-minute walk to the Resnik Café and a brisk 10 minutes from most classes. Doherty is one of the best options for students who wish to have their own kitchen in an autonomous apartment-esque style of living.
Doherty is divided into four separate towers, each headed by its own RA, who provides his or her residents with the bare essentials: trash bags, paper towels, and, of course, toilet paper. Each tower consists of three floors and a basement.
As a community, there are weekly events to satisfy your sweet tooth and appropriate exercise programs to sweat off the following day’s regret. However, due primarily to the tower layout of the building, making friends in Doherty will make you long for the days of freshman year. Most doors remain closed throughout the day, and the occasional meet-and-greet as you leave the building with your neighbors permeates the school year.
Doherty Apartments provides air-conditioning in its exercise room; however, that is the only room in the building that is so equipped. Most residents purchase personal air-conditioning units during hot weather. Make sure to take them out during the winter, as Doherty’s weak heaters force residents to cling to every bit of warmth they can.
Rooms provide just the right mix of isolation and integration with your roommates. The one-bedroom triples include a bedroom for the three beds, a bathroom, and a living room with kitchenette equipped. The living room also has three study desks, a dining table, a couch, and a small loveseat. Two-person efficiencies are similar, though everything is located in a single room without some of the furniture.
In general, Doherty Apartments provide a decently sized living area for those that seek autonomy in college life.

FAST FACTS:
Location: 4616 Fifth Ave., on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Craig Street
Style(s) of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (two students) and efficiency (two students); the Fairfax Annex has two-bedroom apartments (three students)
Size: 272 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency
Lounges: Community room in basement with limited availability
Other amenities: Laundry room and aerobics room in the basement, community room
The community in Fairfax Apartments is not as strong as the community in on-campus dorms like Morewood, because each floor is home to a mix of Carnegie Mellon and non-Carnegie Mellon residents. Despite this, Fairfax Apartments is the perfect transition for upperclassmen to living in off-campus housing. Once acquainted with back-alley shortcuts, it’s a quick 10- to 15-minute walk to campus, and the building’s proximity to Craig Street, which houses many restaurants that are open late at night, make it appealing to many college students. 
Inside the individual apartments, every room is carpeted, except for the kitchen and bathroom, which have tiling. The walls, conveniently, are solid — a welcome change from the paper-thin dividers that separate rooms in some on-campus housing. Fairfax is also tucked away from loud traffic, although every now and then, a group of happy, shouting people may break the silence. The rooms are furnished and come prepared with beds, tables, and drawers, and the kitchen has a stove and refrigerator. Some units even have dishwashers. Air conditioning and heating are included as well.
Bus stops for the 500, 54C, 71 series, and 75 are also located basically right outside the building’s doors. Pittsburgh is on your doorstep if you live in Fairfax.
Laundry payment may be the largest problem students have with Fairfax. Doing laundry requires that students first buy a $5 card to pay for the machines. The card does not actually come with $5; students must put in money manually, and the machine accepts only bills. In addition, Fairfax’s Internet connection is not Carnegie Mellon Internet, but rather Comcast. Finally, the cost of living is one of the highest at Carnegie Mellon (starting at $7,370 for an efficiency apartment), but with all of Fairfax’s amenities and its prime location, it is understandably so.

FAST FACTS:
Location: Behind Scobell, on Margaret Morrison Street

Size: 83 residents
Building retention: Yes, except for non-single rooms on the first floor
Kitchens: One on the lower level in each building
Lounges: TV lounges and study areas in both buildings
As one of the more recently renovated student dorms on campus, Henderson House is a clean and quiet place to live. This dorm offers students air conditioning and heating, connected bathrooms — which are cleaned once a week — shared with one other room, and the intimacy of a small building, with 20 rooms per floor. The first floor is generally reserved for first-years only. 
Henderson House and Welch House are also labeled “Wellness Houses,” in that they promote green practices, maintain a substance-free lifestyle, and generally encourage healthy living. Each student who lives here is expected to sign an agreement promising to adhere to these standards during the school year. Students can also take advantage of playing for the house’s IM teams or participating in weekly optional community activities set up by the resident assistants. Tickets to special events like plays or shows are subsidized by the dorm, which is a nice perk. Henderson, although placed on the outskirts of Carnegie Mellon, is sheltered from any traffic or noise from campus. The dorm’s residents also respect an unwritten policy of peace and quiet, which makes this dorm ideal for studying. Despite being on a hill, Henderson is very close to the Tepper School of Business, the tennis courts, Gesling Stadium, and the eateries at Resnik House, such as the Carnegie Mellon Café and Taste of India.
Despite all Henderson has to offer students, there are drawbacks. Dorm rooms are not the largest, and on occasion the heating will malfunction, turning each room into a furnace. 
Welch is one of the Hill houses, but it distinguishes itself by having a 24-hour quiet rule. This often means that Welch attracts students who prefer to keep to themselves and are less interested in creating a community atmosphere. However, the atmosphere seems to suit students who want a comfortable home and don’t want to be distracted by noise. The rooms are large and bathrooms are spacious. Welch was renovated in 2001.

FAST FACTS:
Location: On Margaret Morrison Street, behind the sororities
Style(s) of housing: Apartments — two-floor, two-bedroom (four students)
Size: 80 students
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment
Lounges: One on first floor
Margaret Morrison Apartments, located up on the Hill, offers residents arguably the nicest on-campus apartments. Each unit has two floors, with a lounge and kitchen on the first floor and bedrooms and bathrooms either up or down a floor, depending on the apartment. All of the “Maggie Mo” apartments were redone in 2007, when they were refitted with newer furniture, appliances, and counter tops.
Although these apartments technically have a common lounge or living area on the first floor, these aren’t spacious by any means. The bedrooms, however, are exactly the opposite: They are some of the biggest bedrooms that you will find on campus. Each apartment has its own kitchen, which is nice for upperclassmen who are tired of the food on the meal plan.
Each of the Margaret Morrison apartment units is separate from the others, which can be isolating, though this is what upperclassmen are often looking for. Residents also have access to laundry and exercise facilities, which are on the street level of Margaret Morrison Street.
Although the common areas may be a bit tight, “Maggie Mo” can offer residents the chance to have independence while still living on campus.

FAST FACTS:
Location: 617 Neville St., at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Neville Street
Style(s) of housing: Apartments
Size: 22 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment
Lounges: One common basement, four living rooms
The Neville Co-op is a living community through the Carnegie Mellon housing system comprised of eight apartments that feature a mix of double and single bedrooms. Every apartment is connected to one other apartment, which means the four large living rooms in the building are each associated with one pair of apartments. All apartments in the co-op are fully furnished and include a kitchen and bathroom.
Founded by student activists in 2003 as a center for students interested in sustainable living, civil equality, and social progress, the Neville Co-op is a democratic living community. It has no resident assistants, only liaisons to the Housing and Student Life offices who help the Co-op solve housing problems. This independence is a mixed blessing for the co-op’s residents: While they are encouraged to be self-motivated, the lack of cohesiveness that can result leads to a space that is often unkempt and somewhat disorganized.
While the rent for the co-op is comparable to other on-campus apartments, residents are allowed to stay through the summer at no extra cost and can sublet if they are not in Pittsburgh for the summer months. Residents do have to pay a membership fee, which provides each apartment with an Internet connection and free laundry in the basement — with a year-long supply of environmentally friendly laundry detergent, light bulbs, and toilet paper. Additionally, the basement is a common space that students use for dinners, leisure, storage, and meetings.
Residents of the co-op must apply for admission and are encouraged to participate in the varied events hosted by the current members of the co-op that are held during the Room Selection period.
Once students are interviewed and selected to live in the apartment complex, they will find a community of students active in a variety of student organizations. When it was founded in 2003, the co-op was created based on the tenets of sustainability and environmental awareness, activism, and equality in race, gender, and sexuality.

FAST FACTS:
Location: Roselawn Terrace (off Margaret Morrison Street)
Style(s) of housing: Three-bedroom apartments (one single, two doubles)
Size: Five students in each of 12 houses
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each house
Lounges: One in the common Margaret Morrison space and a living space in each house.
Newly-renovated Roselawn Terrace houses, located off Margaret Morrison Street, are now some of the most sought-after housing options on campus. Roselawn is located on the edge of campus, providing students with a feeling of independence while still only having to walk 10 minutes to class. 
Each house, divided into a single-occupancy room and two double-occupancy rooms, holds five students. The bedrooms are quite small — so small, in fact, that one of the doubles can’t hold both residents’ desks. The up-side to this is that the living area on the first floor is spacious.
Living rooms have newly installed hardwood floors and brand-new furniture. Each dining room houses a large table that seats six by a wall of windows. Kitchens have been completely refinished with new cabinets and appliances. All the walls in the houses have been given a fresh coat of paint with vibrant accent colors.
One downside to the remodeling of Roselawn houses is that residents no longer have access to the basement, cutting down on the storage space previously offered. The rooms also have closets that tend to be too small for most people’s wardrobes. 
In addition to the large living spaces offered in Roselawn, residents have access to the Margaret Morrison lounge and exercise room. All Roselawn residents are also on the eSuds network, getting free laundry and access to laundromat-style dryers.
Another good thing about Roselawn houses is that, while there is more than enough living space, the cost of living in said house is less than the cost of living in some Oakland apartments. There has been mention of the price going up due to the renovations that took place last summer, but nothing has been announced by Housing as of yet.
Roselawn houses give the feeling of living on your own while still providing residents with the amenities and assistance of campus housing. If you don’t care about the size of your bedroom, Roselawn is the place to live.

FAST FACTS:
Location: 601 Clyde Street
Style(s) of housing: Apartments — efficiency (two students), two- and three-bedroom apartments (three students), and one five-bedroom apartment (six students)
Size: 82 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each apartment and one in the basement
Lounges: One in the basement with multiple couches and a big-screen TV
Other amenities: Street parking available and a spacious back yard with a grill
Home to only Carnegie Mellon students, Shady Oak is perfect for those students who want a more adult living space. The building follows 24-hour quiet hours, providing a more peaceful living environment than most other dormitories or campus-owned apartments. Each apartment has a full kitchen with an electric stove and oven, as well as a dishwasher. The layouts vary greatly from apartment to apartment, with some having single bedrooms and no common living space, others having shared bedrooms with spacious living rooms, and others having a combination of the two. 
There is a lounge in the basement with numerous couches and a big-screen TV; the space is commonly used for watching sporting events as well as hosting study groups. Basic gym equipment is also located in the basement. For students who want to keep an active lifestyle and don’t get enough of a workout from the 10-minute walk to campus, there are multiple treadmills, an elliptical trainer, and a weight-lifting station. The basement is also home to four washers and four dryers — not on the eSuds network and accepting only quarters — and a large table for folding laundry.
Venture outside and find a picnic table and charcoal grill that is always available. The backyard is large enough to play a game of Frisbee or football with friends. Across the street, there is a bus stop for the 71C, which can be taken to go downtown to watch a show or to East Liberty, home of the Waffle Shop.
There are some drawbacks to living in Shady Oak. The plumbing has a tendency to malfunction, sometimes causing pipes to burst, leading to water shut-offs to fix the problem. The radiators have also been a cause for concern, being set on a building-wide timer that can sometimes shut off in the middle of the night or be set on full blast on warmer days.

FAST FACTS:
Location: 101/103 N. Dithridge St.
Style(s) of housing: Apartment — one-bedroom (two students) and two-bedroom (three students), prime single
Size: 273 residents
Building retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each apartment
Lounges: None, but each apartment has a living area
Other amenities: TV room, quiet study lounge, computer cluster, workout facility, recreation room, and two laundry facilities at opposite ends of the building
Webster Hall, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and North Dithridge Street, is one of the most popular off-campus residences offered by Carnegie Mellon Housing. Webster is located in the heart of Oakland, about a 10-minute walk from campus. One of the first stops on the Carnegie Mellon shuttle line, Webster offers easy access to the numerous restaurants, cafés, grocery stores, and shops located in the Oakland area.
Carnegie Mellon rents out one-bedroom apartments to two students, and two-bedroom apartments to three students. The apartments are spacious and offer many benefits that dorm rooms do not, including a fully furnished living room, two bathrooms, and a kitchen. For many students, this escape from typical dorm life is the basis of Webster’s appeal.
In addition to the spacious apartments, students also benefit from the facilities offered by Webster. The building contains a gym, a homestyle deli, and even an in-house hair and waxing salon. Additionally, each floor has a trash disposal facility as well as a laundry room.
There are, however, some small disadvantages. The laundry facilities can become a hassle for many residents. Using the facilities can become expensive, with a cost of $2.50 to wash and dry one load of clothes. The dryers on most floors are not fully functional, often requiring two full runs to completely dry clothes. For many students, this is one of the biggest complaints about Webster.
An additional point for consideration is the price. Renting a one-bedroom apartment or a double bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment costs $7,620 per year. Renting a single bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment costs $7,930 per year.
Shirley Apartments, located next door to Webster Hall, is small apartment with a floor plan similar to Webster’s. Each apartment has a bedroom, a living area, and a kitchen, while the efficiencies are essentially a room with a bathroom and a kitchen. One of the downsides of Shirley is that it is one of the farthest places from campus. On the upside, the apartments are spacious and well furnished.

FAST FACTS:
Location: At the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street
Style(s) of housing: Apartment — one-bedroom (two students), two-bedroom (four students), and four-bedroom (seven students). There is one double-occupancy apartment in the basement that currently houses first-years.
Size: 35 residents
Building retention: No
Kitchens: One or two full kitchens per apartment
Lounges: A TV lounge and exercise room is shared with Margaret Morrison Apartments. 
Other amenities: Two washers and two dryers are in the basement. The Frame, a small student-run art gallery, is also located on the first floor.
Woodlawn Apartments may be one of the older and more run-down housing options on campus, but it is convenient for walking to class, and it’s right on the Forbes Avenue bus routes that can take you anywhere else that you’d like to go.
The bedrooms and living rooms both boast plenty of space, a definite upgrade for those used to sharing cramped quarters. Some rooms have hardwood floors, and others have thin carpeting. The furniture has been recently updated, as have some of the appliances and bathroom fixtures, which helps combat the run-down stereotype of the building.
This year, there have been repeated plumbing problems in the building, but maintenance has been quick to fix them and get things back in order. Several times per semester, The Frame art gallery, which is housed in the first floor of the apartment building, has loud parties that can be heard throughout the building. 
Woodlawn Apartments is great if you want to live with a big group of friends, since each apartment houses a lot of people. People generally keep to themselves, but this does not mean that residents do not participate in housing activities. There are relatively few students in the building, so you’ll probably get to know many of the other students that live there. Woodlawn is a good choice if you want a small community and are looking for apartment living on campus.

Oakland
Just a 10- to 15-minute walk (or five-minute bus ride) from campus lies the neighborhood of Oakland, the home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up almost entirely of college students. Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including The ‘O,’ Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, Fuel and Fuddle, and Mad Mex. The food is what this neighborhood is known for on our campus. For those over-21s, Oakland has a good group of late-night destinations, such as local bars like Hemingway’s, Mad Mex and its classic half-price margaritas, and an extensive liquor store within walking distance. Another benefit of Oakland is its availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood Avenue are lined with student housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet neighborhood, Oakland may not be it. Starting on Thursday nights — the start of the weekend for University of Pittsburgh students — the neighborhood awakens, filled with groups of college kids out to have a good time. Oakland should be noted for its fun atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for an extended weekend and college-oriented surroundings.
Shadyside
Shadyside is home to upperclassmen from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, graduate students, and young working professionals. It is accessible by Pittsburgh buses. It tends to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most charming of the areas surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The neighborhood is best known for two of its assets: shopping and popular bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide variety of shops from small boutiques to Apple, J. Crew, Ann Taylor, and Banana Republic. Cozy restaurants such as the Walnut Grill are dispersed between the shops.
Just blocks from the restaurants are Shadyside’s bars. William Penn Tavern and Shady Grove are the most popular, known by Carnegie Mellon students to be the closest bar locations outside of Panther Hollow Inn. William Penn Tavern in particular gathers a large number of Carnegie Mellon students. On Tuesdays and Sundays, William Penn Tavern is open to all ages for its wing nights where customers can get 10 wings in a variety of flavors, from traditional BBQ to the flavor mix of the kitchen sink, for only $3.
While the area near these bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, Shadyside in general is a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals who live in the area are sometimes called yuppies, and the college students who live there are very diverse ­— from artists and technical majors to medical students. Shadyside is a great area for anyone looking for either a quiet escape from campus or a bustling shopping and nightlife experience.
Squirrel Hill
Just up the big hill on Forbes Avenue is the start of Squirrel Hill. It is either a 20-minute walk or a three-minute bus ride from campus, and the buses are very frequent — all of the 61 buses serve the route. The cost of living is higher than Oakland but lower than Shadyside. Furthermore, Squirrel Hill is the most residential of all the areas surrounding campus. In addition to upper-level students from Carnegie Mellon, it is also home to faculty and Pittsburgh families not associated with the university. Most Carnegie Mellon students know the neighborhood for its restaurants and Giant Eagle. Squirrel Hill has a vast diversity of restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to Mediterranean food at Mediterranean Grill and the famous desserts at Gullifty’s. The restaurants are dispersed among small shops, including those on the main thoroughfare on Forbes Avenue such as Little’s Shoes, a novelty card shop, and a cheap video shop.
On Murray Avenue, just off of Forbes Avenue, the Giant Eagle is the perfect one-stop shop for all of your food necessities. Squirrel Hill is relatively quiet, with most noise coming from traffic on Forbes and Murray Avenues. It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland or Shadyside and does not have a prominent bar scene. It does have a certain functionality and residential atmosphere, however, that the other two areas lack. For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with all the necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of cuisines, Squirrel Hill may be the place.

Research and development of hybrid electric vehicle technology is quickly accelerating. Many argue that the advantages of transitioning to a more electric, less-polluting automobile industry are numerous, and car makers are running with that motivation to develop more efficient and reliable electric vehicles. Universities can act as a hotbed for research, and Carnegie Mellon in particular has been a significant force behind the technologies empowering hybrid electric vehicles.
Carnegie Mellon’s helping hand became evident when representatives from General Motors (GM) visited campus last week to talk about GM’s recent developments and its relationship with the university, which dates back to 1977 when GM first initiated collaborative research. 
In 2000, GM established a collaborative research lab at Carnegie Mellon, helping develop vehicle information technology. Information technology, specifically in regard to hybrid electric vehicles, refers to the way the different components of the car communicate with each other, as well as with the environment and with the driver and passengers. 
Carnegie Mellon’s research in information technology helped its team win the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2007, an autonomous vehicle contest sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The contest involved  driverless vehicles completing a 60-mile course in less than six hours.
Last Thursday, GM announced that it will be giving Carnegie Mellon a $70,000 scholarship grant supporting a number of different organizations on campus. The research funded by this grant, along with all collaborative research between Carnegie Mellon and GM, remains transparent to the public. 
“Our relationship with GM — and not just with this grant, but the support they’ve given us — is all based on the fact that we are a university that openly publishes results. We stay within the paradigm of what it means to be doing research at a university,” explained Ed Schlesinger, head of the electrical and computer engineering (ECE) department.
As part of their visit, the GM representatives brought along a few of their new Chevrolet Volts for anyone to try out and take for a test drive, giving the public a chance for a real hands-on experience with these new vehicles. The Volt’s lithium-ion battery is optimized for the average commute for a typical American — about 40 miles per day. “[For about 40 miles], you can drive all-electrically. I only use electricity and I can do that for about $1.50 worth of electricity,” said on-site engineer Stephen Marlin. Marlin accompanied those who test-drove the Volt.
The Volt includes various ways of harnessing energy that would normally be allowed to dissipate. One method is the Volt’s regenerative braking, which captures the frictional energy produced when braking and converts it to electrical energy. The Volt also has the ability to harness the heat energy produced by the running engine; batteries optimally work under warm conditions, and the engine heat will help warm up the power source. “Any energy that is being produced is going into the battery. [The engine] is not just wastefully running,” Marlin said. 
The $40,000 price tag on the Volt will hopefully decrease as a result of the ongoing collaborative research efforts between Carnegie Mellon and GM. Their relationship will not only continue to help improve GM products, but will also help pursue a much broader goal. Susan Farrington, director of alumni and student relations in the ECE department, said, “As a member of the community, I think we all have to be thinking and working towards different energy solutions.”

Most of us have probably heard it before: Men are from Mars, and women are from Venus. But how much of this phrase is actually true? Are men and women two worlds apart?
The phrase originated from a book written by John Gray, who argued that men and women have different methods of communication, and understanding these differences may be beneficial to a healthy relationship. 
It is widely believed that Mars and Venus refer to the planets; however, Gray was actually referring to the qualities of the Roman god Mars, who represented peace through power, and the goddess Venus, who represented fertility and beauty. For example, Gray argued that men complain as a method to seek out a solution to a problem, while women complain so that others acknowledge their problems.
While no man or woman falls directly under these distinct categories, many differences between men and women can be explained biologically. While in the womb, males and females produce different hormones that are important for developing gender differentiation. Hormones are chemicals the body produces that affect the way certain cells develop. Male fetuses produce testosterone and have higher levels of addrogens than females. These androgens are chemicals responsible for developing and maintaining male characteristics. 
Females, conversely, produce estradiol, which is an estrogen. It is analogous to androgens in males, but is instead responsible for developing and maintaining female characteristics. The differences in chemicals produce the differences in body structure between males and females, from the reproductive organs to the type of hair that is most widely found on the body.
While physical differences are obvious, differences in the psychology of men and women are harder to pinpoint. Although there are commonly “known” differences between the thought processes of men and women, scientific evidence has not been conclusive of this. It is believed that hormones and genetic factors play a large role in the differences between how men and women think, but the relationship is still being researched.
It has been determined that genes specific to a gender govern the development of a person’s brain, and that men and women have differing brain structures, according to www.nature.com. However, differences in mental capability are not as clear as was once thought. In addition, it is hard to pinpoint how much of a difference in thinking is socially affected, and how much is biological.
Classical views on gender differences are now changing as research is being done on the subject. A classical view of gender difference is that men are less emotional than women. However, a study published by the American Psychological Association states that boys are taught to hide their feelings. It was once believed that men were better at mathematics than women, but once more girls were offered the same mathematics courses as boys, this discrepancy soon disappeared.
So are men and women really poles apart, just as Mars and Venus are? If genes, hormones, culture, upbringing, and development can all contribute to variances in men and women, it can be difficult to determine how different men and women truly are.

While a large portion of our food supply is harvested from the land, there also exists an important underwater component of farming. On Feb. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a suggested procedure to the federal government about the future of American aquaculture, or the farming of aquatic organisms for human consumption and other uses. The NOAA, in a public statement released on its website, said that such practices could improve nationwide food production, advance technological innovations, and create jobs in coastal regions. Neither the argument for aquaculture, nor the resistance it has met by many who favor safer aquatic environmental practices, are new developments.
Modern aquaculture grew out of millennia-old practices of sea harvesting and fishing. After World War II, it became seriously considered as a viable source of food. Aquaculture in the 20th and 21st century took place primarily in Asia — over 70 percent of global aquaculture activity was in China in 2002, following forty years of growing business. In 1970, aquaculture made up 3.9 percent of worldwide fish production, and in thirty years, that number had risen to 27.3 percent. Three of the largest distributors of aquaculture products are Costco Wholesale Corporation, the Kroger Corporation, and Sysco Corporation, one of the largest food distributors in the world. According to an article about genetically engineered salmon in the Washington Post on Aug. 2, the global aquaculture market totaled over $86 billion.
There has been criticism, however, pointing to poor green practices in implementing aquaculture. A common cause of complaints against aquaculture is its effect on the natural populations of fish wildlife. Salmon and shrimp culturing is especially harmful, as reported by a publication on the Providence College website. Fish wastes, antibiotics, and uneaten food involved in this type of aquaculture increase algae and phytoplankton growth, which depletes the water of its oxygen levels.
SeaWeb, a nonprofit organization, suggested that the development of more carnivorous fish creates unsafe ecological conditions for the rest of the ocean, especially since many of these aquaculture farms need to be located directly on the ocean coast. Salmon and shrimp, being carnivorous, require the protein of other fish in their diets, sometimes up to three to five pounds worth of feeder fish. This creates a net loss in protein, since the salmon and shrimp are consuming more meat than they are producing.
There are potential environmental benefits that result from aquaculture. The same Providence College article suggests that catfish, tilapia, and freshwater carp are capable of converting harmful organic waste into fish meat that these fish can use to survive. Mollusks, clams, scallops, and oysters actually help reduce the deleterious effects by consuming the phytoplankton that deprives the water of its oxygen.
Some supporters point to aquaculture as a potential solution to the problem of non-native species, which can cause significant harm if introduced to a foreign environment. Aquaculture has the potential to raise species of marine organisms that find the natural environment uninhabitable in a secure closed system, in which all water and waste are analyzed for pollutants before being released. That way the marine organism, which could be harmful to the natural environment, will be restricted to the closed system and die out if exposed to the environment. 
The debate over the NOAA’s policies will continue as the organization opens up commentary to the public for the next 60 days. However, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco has summarized the ultimate goal of both sides of the argument: “As we rebuild wild fish populations, we recognize the world’s demand for safe, healthy seafood will continue to grow.”

Scientists discover the oldest galaxy yet observed
American and European scientists working on the Hubble Space Telescope discovered the oldest galaxy ever seen, which dates back about 13.7 billion years. This formation would have occurred 480 million years after the Big Bang created the universe, which explains the rapid rate of change observed in the galaxy. 
Estimates of age are based on the red-shifted spectrum emitted by the galaxy, which, when compared to typical emission spectra, can reveal how quickly an astronomical object is moving away from Earth.

Coffee has harmful effects on men under pressure
Psychologists at Bristol University in England have discovered that, although women’s responses to coffee and caffeine occur as expected, men receive an opposite effect when drinking coffee under stress. In a study conducted on 64 men and women, the researchers found that men become less confident and slower at completing tasks after they drank coffee. The scientists theorized that this discrepancy is due to men’s “fight or flight” behavior when under stress, which encourages dropping the task.

Computer virus infects Iranian nuclear complex
The Stuxnet software worm that has infected over 12,000 computers and primarily detected in Iran was designed to hack the system of Iranian uranium-enrichment complexes. The computer security firm Symantec analyzed the worm, discovering that it first appeared in five separate sites in Iran in attempts to attack industrial organizations.  It is believed that the worm first infected a computer through manual transfer from a USB drive. The malware program temporarily disabled the centrifuge arrays at various research facilities.

Unexpected warm weather harms polar bears
Early warm weather in the eastern U.S. and western Europe has been depriving polar bears of their access to sea ice, a resource vital for the adults of the species in hunting and raising offspring.  Scientists have especially observed that in western Hudson Bay in Canada, polar bears are being forced ashore much sooner, which in turn deprives them of precious feeding time. As such, the polar bear females are storing less fat, which prevents them from keeping their children warm and providing food for them.

Models predict possibility of extraterrestrial life 
Models of planet formation have begun predicting that many developing planets could contain the conditions necessary to support life. 
Small planets are found to be regularly thrown out of their solar systems by gravitational slingshots created by neighboring gas giant planets. The small planets are set on paths of unstable orbits, which eject them into much colder space, causing an icy layer to form over possible liquid oceans. Without heat from a nearby star, it is still conceivable that life could survive on such a planet.

Study shows women attracted by mysteriousness
Scientists at the University of Virginia have found that women are more attracted to men when unsure if their feelings will be reciprocated, rather than when both parties openly express feelings of attraction. The psychologists studied the responses of 47 female undergraduates to the viewing of fictional men’s Facebook profiles. The women were informed that they had been “rated” by these fictional men. Those men whom the women believed had rated them highly were less preferred than men whose feelings were uncertain.

Saint Valentine’s Day, or Valentine’s Day as it is generally shortened, is commonly regarded as one of the most divisive of holidays. For some, the day is a bitter reminder of a failed relationship or unwelcomed loneliness. For others, Valentine’s Day is a chance to tell someone how you feel, celebrate a relationship or marriage, or just eat pounds and pounds of chocolate. Regardless of your own circumstances, it’s safe to say that at this time of the year the general population is split between those who anticipate and celebrate the holiday and those who simply abhor it.
Saint Valentine’s Day is a holiday that commemorates love and affection of intimate companions, held every year on Feb. 14. The holiday was originally established by Pope Gelasius I in 500 CE to celebrate Saint Valentine, an early Christian martyr. Although it was deleted from the Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints in 1969 by Pope Paul VI, the holiday is still sometimes religiously observed. For others who view the day as more commercial than religious, Valentine’s Day is merely a day where people celebrate their significant others by giving and receiving flowers, chocolates, holiday cards, and other gifts. 
Over the years, Valentine’s Day has rallied both big fans and big opposition. Those who find the day unbearable usually argue that Valentine’s Day is merely a commercial holiday invented to encourage people to buy copious amounts of themed merchandise. Those who typically enjoy the holiday usually react negatively to how strong the opposition against Valentine’s Day is, arguing that the holiday is a fun and established way to remind a loved one how you feel about them. A large majority of the time, a person’s opinion on the holiday is determined by their own relationship status — and one would be surprised by just how drastically some people can react.
Take Trevor Mcwanda, for example, who in 2005 invented Singles Awareness (or Appreciation) Day (SAD). This humorous holiday, also celebrated annually on Feb. 14, serves as an alternative holiday for those who are single on Valentine’s Day. People who observe SAD often claim that Valentine’s Day in itself is a “Hallmark holiday,” and gather together to celebrate their single status and remind themselves as well as the couples around them that one doesn’t need to be in a relationship to celebrate love or life. The idea behind SAD is fairly simple: If you happen to not be in a relationship, you can still make this Valentine’s Day special for someone else, maybe even a stranger. This is why celebrators of SAD are encouraged to spend the day volunteering or performing community service. Some other ways that observers of SAD commonly celebrate the holiday include attending singles’ events and mixers, gathering together with loved ones, or treating themselves to a gift. More information about this holiday can be found on Mcwanda’s website, www.singlesawareness.com.
Here at Carnegie Mellon, as well as most places, the population is split between those who enjoy Valentine’s Day for what it is and those who simple hate the holiday. “I love Valentine’s Day because it is a day that celebrates love,” said first-year CIT student Whitney Aaronson. “People often forget that you can still celebrate love regardless of if you happen to be in a relationship or not. It’s also a perk that stores stock their shelves with chocolate — I love chocolate.”
It’s safe to say, however, that the majority of students here at Carnegie Mellon don’t see the holiday positively. Out of a total of 50 randomly selected students polled in the UC, only 22 percent said that they actually enjoyed Valentine’s Day. Sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Ryan MacDonald represents the majority. “I feel as though I might feel differently if I were in a relationship,” MacDonald said, “but I think Valentine’s Day is another holiday where you’re pressured into buying things that you don’t need — like Christmas.”
Another aspect of Valentine’s Day that many people take issue with is that the day encourages specialized behavior. Because there is a day that dictates things you should do for a loved one or someone special, people tend to think that this implies giving candy or flowers to a significant other is strange and unwarranted behavior on any other day of the year. “There’s nothing preventing you from doing the things you typically do on Valentine’s Day on any other day of the year, “ MacDonald said. “I don’t see what’s so special about that [particular] day.”
For those students who happen to be in committed relationships, sometimes Valentine’s Day can take on a different light. “I guess my feelings toward Valentine’s Day depend on whether I have someone special to share it with or not,” said sophomore psychology major Arielle Etchells. “Even when I am in a relationship, I still don’t think Valentine’s Day is a big deal, so I guess I’m kind of indifferent to the holiday. While I do love chocolate, and any girl likes getting flowers, I think they’re cute any time of the year, not just on Valentine’s Day, but I would never turn them down.”
If you are one of those people who simply can’t stand it when Valentine’s Day season arrives — grocery stores beginning to stock their aisles with bags of colorful heart shaped candies, red-and-pink decorations filling the windows of almost every storefront, and couples walking around holding hands and mocking you with there unbearable happiness — fear not: There are ways that you can still have fun on Valentine’s Day without getting commercial about it.
Firstly, Valentine’s Day is about celebrating love. Oftentimes people tend to forget that love comes in all shapes and sizes, so naturally, there are plenty of ways to celebrate it. Why not remind your single friends, or even your friends who are in relationships, that you love them? Organize a group event. Go out to eat at an ironically non-romantic chain restaurant like Applebee’s or Subway, host a horror movie night at your house, or throw a singles’ potluck. There are plenty of people that you could celebrate with on Valentine’s Day, however un-obvious or unlikely they may seem. Maybe treat your mother to a trip to the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre or your best friend to the Valentine’s on Ice event at the Schenley Park skate rink to show them how much you care about them.
If you are keen on the idea of volunteering for others on Valentine’s Day, there are plenty of places where you can find work. The Space Gallery on Liberty Avenue is accepting volunteers to help out at its annual Love of Friends event on Feb. 14, during which people come together from the local community to celebrate the artists and musicians who give their time to provide our community with fantastic visuals and music. Maybe you might consider spending your day at Habitat for Humanity, a Pittsburgh soup kitchen, or helping others enjoy their Valentine’s Day at one of Pittsburgh’s many youth community centers.
Too often the message behind Valentine’s Day gets lost in the public disdain for the holiday or veiled in the over-commercialization. This Valentine’s Day, instead of storming around campus with a frown on your face and resentment in your heart, remember that it’s up to you to make the most of this holiday (however commercialized it may be). If you’re single, don’t begrudge Valentine’s Day for its reputation: Reinvent the holiday for yourself and celebrate the love, relationships, and people in your life who make each day of living so special.

Whether you’re single or involved with a main squeeze, even the spoken term “Valentine’s Day” can induce nausea, anxiety, or appendicitis in those who don’t enjoy the holiday. Now that the dreaded day has finally arrived, it’s time to spring into action. Rather than suffering through another year of being labeled a “wet blanket,” here are some tips for those looking to avoid the holiday altogether:
Bunker down
This is a personal favorite among grizzled veterans on the V-Day front. Locate the nearest television or small, dark place and ride out the duration of the day in your makeshift bunker. Do not leave except to locate a nearby food source. Put in some gameplay time on God of War III or watch all of The Bachelorette seasons back-to-back. By feigning ignorance about Valentine’s Day as a whole, you’ll successfully escape it. Just be careful not to turn on your cable; the wave of jewelry and chocolate commercials could thwart your attempts to repress the holiday. 
Be proactively creepy
Are you the kind of person who gets easily annoyed at public displays of affection? The simple solution is to let the world know. Follow your normal daily routine as expected; however, when you witness a couple going in for some mutual salivating, simply walk up and stare. This tactic is most effective at an uncomfortably close distance, such as while staring over the back of your restaurant booth. An alternate method is also easy to perform: Approach the affectionate couple and begin a slow golf clap. These tactics will ensure that holiday cheer gets dampened wherever you are. 
Deny everything
Single? No way. If anyone asks, insist you’ve got a valentine. She just left to use the restroom. She’ll be right back. If your friends question you further, become immediately defensive about the topic. Claim you have to leave or you’ll be late for your couples’ massage. The key here is to make it believable: Have a made-up name prepared and a potential fake identity, too. Pretending that your valentine goes to a different school or is a foreign visitor will be especially helpful in explaining why he or she isn’t present on any other day. 
Seize the day
Valentine’s Day is an opportunity for avoidant types to relish in their... well, avoidance. Make the biggest, greasiest garlic dish you can get your hands on and eat the whole thing without feeling guilty about your breath or appearance. Watch Scarface and feel no regret that you have missed a chance to watch The Notebook instead. Check your bank account and laugh in the face of those shelling out large amounts of money for expensive sushi dinners or chocolate fountains. And when you finally head off to sleep, spread out and take up all of your bed space. Get excited that no one will be hogging the blankets. 
Fabricate
Set your computer clock to Feb. 15, and repeat the process on your phone. It’ll be like the day never happened. If people wish you a happy Valentine’s Day, wish them in turn a happy “15th of February.” Pretend that all the candy and flowers being sold are really day-after sales. If you believe strongly enough in your convictions, they will come true. Other people may find you insane, but hey, that’s a small price to pay. 
Go where people aren’t
On Valentine’s Day evening, everyone is doing the same thing: eating at restaurants or frequenting romantic venues, such as parks and movie theaters. Instead, head to the spots no one wants to visit while you’ve got the chance. Make an appointment with the doctor or dentist — after all, who wants to get his or her teeth drilled on Valentine’s Day? Alternatively, go see a violent movie, head to the mall to enjoy short checkout lines, or go work out at the gym. These places will be deserted; they’re not exactly in vogue on a romantic holiday. 
Above all, keep this fact in mind: There have been many holidays through history which have died out over time. Remember Lucaria, the Roman holiday of grove-clearing? That’s right, you don’t. It’s a defunct celebration; it died out hundreds of years ago. With any luck, Valentine’s Day (more like “Punishment and Public Humiliation of Single People Day”) will also soon be a thing of the past.

While prowling for the wild male or female in the jungle, one’s best bet to initiate a conversation is to begin with a casual “Hi” followed by a sly, “What brings you here?” However, humans just cannot seem to resist the lure of the pick-up line. The pick-up line — the name alone carries with it a rich, illustrious history of drinks being thrown, doors being slammed, and the ever-pervasive silence after an abruptly-ended phone call. 
While pick-up lines do not generally work, they have prevailed throughout the decades as classic rites of passage for young men and women attempting to attract the gender of their preference. Why fight it? It’s practically genetic. This Valentine’s Day, be one of those guys or girls. Pull out a smarmy smile, practice winking, and look at yourself in the mirror and set your eyes to “smolder.” Take the advice of Flynn Rider from the Disney animated movie Tangled: Cock your head back, take on a confident pose, and drawl a charming, “How you doin’?” 
There are pick-up lines for every occasion. You do not have to be courting a princess to use one. In fact, pick-up lines have pervaded every culture and subculture, regardless of gender, major, or even level of hygiene. 
If you want to sound like you know your way around a computer, try some of these lines:
“You had me at ‘Hello World.’ ”
“You must be Windows 95, because you’ve got me so unstable.”
If math is more your subject:
“My love for you is like a concave-up function — it’s always increasing.”
“By looking at you I can tell you’re 36–25–36 — which, by the way, are all perfect squares.”
“How can I know hundreds of digits of pi and not the seven digits of your phone number?
Do you feel like you’re more of a literary type? Why not drop down some Harry Potter references to woo the apple of your eye?
“I must have had some Felix Felicis, because I think I’m about to get lucky.”
“If I were to look into the Mirror of Erised, I’d see the two of us together.”
“Are you using the Confundus charm, or are you just naturally mind-blowing?”
Finally, for those who enjoy the romance of chemicals and the passion of biology, try:
“You’re so hot, you denature my proteins.”
“We fit together like the sticky ends of recombinant DNA.”
“Heisenberg was wrong. I’m certain about what you’re doing tonight.”
This Valentine’s Day, let your inner Romeo shine. Just remember to wear comfortable running shoes in case your object of affection does not react kindly to your words of romance. Do not be deterred by his or her distaste. From a safe distance, just try again. Don’t be scared of the restraining order. As Randy Pausch once said, “Brick walls are there for a reason. They’re not there to keep us out. They are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.”

I Love You Phillip Morris, starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor, takes bromance to the next level in its depiction of the real-life story of Steven Russel, a cop turned con man.
After a life-threatening incident causes him to re-evaluate his life, Russel reveals to his wife that he is homosexual and proceeds to, as he says, “start life over and live it like the real [Russel].” Swept away by his constant lying and money schemes, Russel eventually lands himself in jail because, as he says, “being gay is really expensive.” While in a Texas penitentiary he meets and falls in love with fellow inmate Phillip Morris, a blue-eyed, Southern beauty portrayed by Ewan McGregor.
Although stereotypes abound in this movie, its quirky, dark undertones have a bite to them and make the viewer laugh, cry, and think in turn. The use of the protagonist as a narrator lends a Forrest Gump charm to the film and succeeds at ingratiating Russel with his audience. This, along with Jim Carrey’s unique slapstick humor, makes the movie endearing and removes it from the harsher realities it depicts.
Indeed, the subject matter in this film is heavy: attempted suicide, jail, and AIDS. Yet the irreverence of the actors combined with the soundtrack and camera work make it alternately hilarious and emotional in just the right places. The film asks the viewer to think deeply about different cultural and societal norms through the use of humor and stereotypes. 
Jim Carrey portrays Russel as the ultimate chameleon.  He plays the devoted husband to a tee, then switches with seemingly little trouble into the stereotypical gay man, then slips into the role of chief financial officer, doctor, grocer, and countless others.  While Carrey’s diversity in character is applaudable, the ease with which his character switches roles begs the question: Who is the real Steven Russel?
Russel struggles with his identity throughout the movie, fulfilling different roles and spinning webs of lies in an effort to find out what or whom he really cares about. As he soon discovers, nothing else matters to him but the love of Phillip Morris, whom he goes to extreme lengths to be with.  
For the most part, this romantic comedy, despite the new spin it takes, is comfortingly enough like those before it.  Boy meets girl — or in this case, boy meets boy — they fall in love, go through hardships, and emerge victorious with their love intact.
This is not, however, a typical romantic comedy. It is a true story and the ending reflects upon that truth: Life isn’t always as perfect and cookie-cutter as Pretty Woman or Sleepless in Seattle. Still, this film portrays the struggles and rewards of love in poignant ways and proclaims the power that love has to change and shape a person’s identity and life.

This is one entry from the author's upcoming blog, which will be written in the form of lists and letters about her time while studying abroad in India.
Dear Francesca,
You have been saying that you honestly don’t know what to picture when you think of India. In your last letter, you mentioned Slumdog Millionaire and Eat, Pray, Love as what this place might look like. I had similar images in my head, but now that I am here, in this tiny part of the South, I can try to help you picture India with words. 
When our group of 16 American and Canadian students traveled together throughout Kerala, I put my camera away after a few days. Sure, we visited beautiful historical and cultural points, sailed along the backwaters, toured a spice plantation, and trekked through some of the highlands. But instead of photographing, I had my notebook in hand, making lists, writing letters that may never be sent, and blind-contour sketching the faces of our group. I didn’t think a lens could even capture everything we were seeing. 
But now that we’ve settled into the groove of being university students in India, there is a completely different world that I want to describe to you. It’s small and becomes easier to navigate each day. We have the weekends to explore, but really, the campus and the nearby town of Pondicherry — affectionately known as “Pondy” — are what I want you to be able to picture.
I’m writing this at my desk in my room of the Foreign Students Hostel (what we may call a dorm), and I’m staring out the large window for inspiration. It comes easily — there are palm trees and greenery scattered around a large, easy-to-walk path. 
We walk about 15 minutes to class through the campus, which is 800 acres. Envision similar palm trees and leafiness scattered throughout, with students and professors zipping around on bicycles and motorbikes. I am sweating by the time I get to class, and sometimes the professor doesn’t even show up — just a note on the chalkboard saying that class is canceled, if that. Then there’s an equally sweaty walk or bike ride back to the hostel. 
I’m taking a 19th-century British fiction class with about 60 Indian students. We just read Pride and Prejudice, and talking about marriages formed out of love and compatibility with these students is interesting, as many of their marriages will be arranged. Other classes, like Christianity in India, I just take with people in my program.
Now, try to forget the cold and think of the beach — it is a stone’s throw away from where we live. In the afternoons, I cross the glorified highway that runs alongside campus, called the ECR (East Coast Road) to walk through a small village. 
When you picture crossing a street, don’t picture any street you’ve ever crossed before. It’s British-style, so look to the right first. Check for cattle, stray dogs, large buses with men hanging off the sides, horn-tooting autorickshaws, motorcycles, bicycles, and other pedestrians trying to do the same thing you’re doing. 
When you finally reach the village, I think you’ll get some of the imagery you mentioned, like the barefoot children. Next to the straw huts directly are modern, three-story houses. Closer to the water, women wash their clothes on rocks, chickens squawk, and dark-eyed crows are always pecking at food. 
The beach is small and the waves are rough — but here, it is easiest to forget where you are. It could be a deserted American East Coast beach. The noise fades away, and if you look straight ahead, you can avoid seeing the fishermen squatting in the sand to relieve themselves. 
Do you remember when you were in Chile, with the obvious feeling that you didn’t fit in? That is every day here, walking to class or to the beach or taking the bus into town. We cannot change the color of our skin, no matter how traditionally we dress. The women wear salwar kameez or churidas, as they are known in the South, which is a long tunic top, a scarf, and long pants — light, made of cotton, and in the most fantastic colors.  I have a few of these clothes, but after being here for more than a month, I realize how marked I am by my skin and their assumptions. It is less about being from America than being foreign, Western, and presumably wealthy. 
I’ve mentioned going into “Pondy” before, and that is a series of photographs in itself. Picture this: Wait in the hot sun for a bus that comes chugging up, blaring music. You hop on the back entrance because the front entrance is for men, and then try to find a seat. If it’s around five or six o’clock, every woman is trying to get home, so you will be crushed among a sea of saris and churidas, sweating as usual. 
You press a few coins (4 rupees, about 10 cents) into the conductor’s hand, saying “Pondy,” or wherever you are going. He will inevitably repeat it in a way that sounds the same to you but is different to him. Bobble your head yes, because a nod doesn’t really mean anything here, and he will hand you a waxy piece of paper that counts as a ticket, but is never collected or inspected. 
In town, you can push your way through what now feels like a typical Indian street — no sidewalks, a collection of animals and vehicles moving at random, without the aid of traffic lights or yield signs. Because Pondicherry was colonized by the French, there is the French quarter, with wide, quiet streets, leafy oaks, tiny bakeries and rooftop cafés, and numerous French people speaking actual French. That is the only other place I have found where I can forget, for a moment, that I’m in India. 
But I don’t want to forget that I’m here, really. The time is already careening by, each day a whirlwind of attempting to go to class, sweating, reading about things I’m not taking classes on, and talking — always talking — to figure out what is going on here.  
Miss you always,
Caroline

100 Years Ago:
Feb. 16, 1911
The “Pertinent and Impertinent” section notifies readers that “Scotty” Henderson will attend Prom in “conventional attire.” Man, I wish the entire school cared about what I would be wearing to my next party. Hint: It’s not my birthday suit.
50 Years Ago:
Feb. 15, 1961
On page 4 of this week's paper, the entire page is filled with text. No pictures, just thousands of words. Aren't you glad we don't do that anymore?
25 Years Ago:

The caption for a basketball photo this week read "Lack of fans at a recent basketball game." You'd think they could have thought of anything else to say. I mean, we think of some new combination of words each week. 
10 Years Ago:
Feb. 12, 2001
A Forum writer accused the University of mishandling funds this week, to the detriment of students on campus. Really? An organization that charges $50,000 for 5,000 plus students couldn't figure out how to manage it? Color me shocked.
5 Years Ago:
Feb. 13, 2006
A Pillbox writer wonders whether the Carnegie Mellon sex culture will ever be seen as more than a “cold blooded eunuch.” Considering there’s a legend that Playboy once ranked Carnegie Mellon the ugliest school — no, no it won’t. 
1 Year Ago:

A Health Talk article explains the alcohol flush reaction, commonly known as “Asian glow.” While the disorder increases your odds of getting cancer a bit, it decreases the likelihood of becoming an alcoholic. Seems like a fair tradeoff.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
All my jerk friends seem to be getting internships before me. I’m so much smarter than all of them! Why don’t I have one?
Sincerely,
Needs Any Summer Technology Experience
Dear NAST-E,
You’re right — all your friends are jerks. How dare they get internships before you! Don’t they know that the world actually revolves around you? When they get offered an internship, they need to say, “No, thank you; my friend hasn’t gotten one yet, so I need to wait for him to get one.” This way, if you wind up never getting an internship, you and your friends can hang out all summer complaining about your lack of internships. Hey — if you can’t be happy, they shouldn’t be either. That’s what friends are for.
Or it could be that your friends are actually jerks, and I’ve misjudged you. In that case, you don’t have an internship because you’re not a jerk. Jerks are confident, and recruiters love confidence. So at the next job fair, walk right up to a recruiter and tell him why his company sucks. But don’t forget to give him your résumé! He’ll be thinking, “Wow, only someone really confident in his abilities would act with such total disregard for people’s feelings! I should hire him! Or he’s a sociopath.”
What could possibly go wrong,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m hoping to compete in SWE’s Mr. Engineer contest this year. Do you have any tips on winning?
Sincerely,
Young Engineering Stud
Dear YES,
Luckily for you, I have some experience with Mr. Engineer. Not necessarily in winning, but it’s still good advice. First of all, it’s a beauty pageant. Are you man-gorgeous? If so, you’ll do fine. If not, then you need to work on your talent. Tip: Don’t have your talent be insulting women engineers and scientists. They really don’t like that. Instead, sing a Disney or Taylor Swift song, or do something really nerdy. For extra points, rewrite a Disney song to have nerdy lyrics.
The last big part of the contest is the duct tape costume. This is your chance to show some skin. Really, your costume should just be a codpiece. Try to be a little creative though. Anyone can slap on a duct tape Speedo. Your job is to look good in it and be creative. It’s really hard to make a cute outfit out of duct tape, so instead just go for something overtly sexual. At some point in the contest, they may ask you to do something engineering- related, but you can fake it. That’s what engineering is about, right?
Try not to punch the MC,
Brian Hoskins

Despite what you may think, this is in no way about the adventures of Clark Kent. Waiting for Superman is a 2010 documentary directed by the same person who worked with Al Gore on his environmental smash hit, An Inconvenient Truth. In this film, we follow several students as they make their way through the United States educational system while facing the pitfalls and failures of said system. Although the movie glosses over several important details and reasons for these failings, it is still a revealing look into an educational system that many of us take for granted.

The books are way better than the movies. There, I said it. Okay — I can move on now. In the latest adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s epic series, Harry races against time to destroy Horcruxes, the objects that give Voldemort his power. With Dumbledore gone and Hogwarts under Snape’s control, little hope remains for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who face constant danger in the wizarding world. Fun fact: M. Night Shyamalan reportedly wanted to direct this movie. What, would he have made it so that Dumbledore was actually alive the whole time and that Harry was really a cyborg?

It’s kind of hard to believe that this came out 10 years ago, isn’t it? The first installment of the series is arguably the best, if only because it’s adapted from the shortest book, so the filmmakers left out the least amount of material. The story follows Harry Potter, a sad youngster who lives with his aunt and uncle until it’s discovered he is actually a famous wizard known worldwide by the wizarding community. But an old enemy awaits him as he begins his magical education (edumagication?). Fun fact: Rosie O’Donnell and Robin Williams asked to appear in the movies without pay, but both were denied roles.
Let Me In

Based on the Swedish film Let the Right One In, Let Me In is the tale of a 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his parents and in general lives a somewhat lonely existence. That changes, however, when he develops a friendship with a vampire child. The well-made flick hits on the three genres of drama, romance, and horror quite well, and just about every critic has sung the praises of the film, including the author of the original book on which both movies were based. Fun fact: The word “vampire” is said only once throughout the entire movie.

You’re back at your cramped flat in New York City, bone-tired, a deadline looming heavy over your shoulders. 
You swallow hard and pull back from your desk. Your FM radio pulls at your fingertips and has you turning the knob. Static. Tchaikovsky. Static. Right-wing banter. Hissing. Warm static. Then you hear it.
“Come on man, don’t just stand there....” A police radio flickers and a bass glides through and a beat begins to form. A police squadron patrols the airwaves and on comes the wave of keys. A chorus of stuttered vocals pulses alongside an uptempo rhythm. A guitar chokes on its own feedback and then a high end filter squelches all but the low end. You look out again and it’s there, the chase, the delivery, the redemption. Your city captured in sound: “1987” by Poka. 
Artists like Poka and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros strike a chord in the hearts of many because they induce a nostalgia for imagined pasts. This nostalgia kickstarts an odd process of historical revision. We imagine the ’80s being far more neon and full of oversized sweaters than they were. With the Cold War in full swing, things were real, unpredictable, and dark, And yet, we think of neon oversize sweaters.
The fact that we often search for fictitious pasts and try to revise the emotional tenor of particular eras reveals that there’s a lot going on for us as observers and creators of culture. How do we reconcile the creation of collective imagined pasts and a desire for objective historicity? I’m not sure, but I think it’s because we want exciting stories, and the past doesn’t give them to us. The result? We make fiction into fact with our music.
If you want to delve into a sound that openly claims to replicate a feeling that may or may not have ever existed, visit Poka at www.myspace.com/pokaremixprojects.

Valentine’s Day tends to evoke a variety of reactions and memories. Find out what members of The Tartan think of Valentine’s Day and delve into their romantic lives.
Do you like Valentine’s Day? Why or why not?
I do. But if you’re going to do Valentine’s Day, do it on your own terms. Don’t do the stereotypical stuff. —ED
Yeah, because I think at its core, it’s a holiday that just has good intentions. —DL
No, I don’t like it that much. It’s the most exclusive holiday ever. —CH
No, for a lot of reasons. I hate romance, and I think a holiday dedicated to romance is just a huge issue. And even if I did like romance, it seems silly to expect it one day of the year and not the other 364. —CL
What are your plans for today?
I have no idea. I’m baking my guy s’mores brownies. He’d better do something for me. —ED
I’m probably going to watch a sappy movie and do homework. It’s going to be really exciting. —CH
We’re going ice skating at Schenley, and then we’re going to play God of War. —KC
What’s the most romantic thing someone has ever done for you, or that you have ever done for someone?
I drove for two hours to go and see someone. I tried to surprise them, but it turned out they knew I was coming. They were still excited, though. —DL
Nobody does romantic things for me, just creepy things. One time, in fifth grade, my boyfriend gave me a pack of Gushers. That to me defines the meaning of true love. —KC
What’s your most embarrassing romance-related memory?
I don’t get embarrassed. Seriously. —ED
The second time I went on a date with this guy, I gave him the “we should just be friends” speech. Then he looked he really sad, and told me that he’d already told his friends that I was his girlfriend. And all his friends were coming over to hang out with us. It was the most awkward night ever. —CH
One time, when I was young, my friend’s little brother kicked down my bedroom door, screamed, “Katie, don’t laugh — I love you!” and then ran away. —KC
What would be your ideal way to spend V-Day?
I don’t think I can say in a newspaper. —ED
We would go to the beach and chillax the whole day. —CH
Engaging in a pon farr tournament on Vulcan. —KC
Removal of the holiday altogether, especially without creepy people giving me flowers. That would be nice. —CL
What song best describes your current love life?
“Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley. —ED
“I Need a Break...But I’d Rather Have a Breakthrough” by the Rocket Summer. —DL
“Always” by Erasure. —KC
“I’ll Make a Man Out of You” from Mulan. —CL

Take a leap of faith and ask out the person you’ve been crushing on. Let your heart and love be your sword and shield.
Today a tall blond will walk your way and you will fall madly in love. Play hard-to-get and in no time they will be yours.
You wear your heart on your sleeve, and that’s why people find you so lovable. Make sure this week, and especially today, that you not only take care of your heart, but that you share it with others as well.
Someone has been thinking about you lately, but they are too shy to say anything to you. Be more perceptive and you just might find your true love.
What are you waiting for? Tell them how you truly feel!
So maybe you don’t have a valentine today. That’s okay, because there are many others out there who are just like you. Go find another single partner and be single no more.
You will meet your true love when you least expect it. It may be a bit frightening, but once you see their smile, you will know that it was meant to be.
Write your sweetheart a love song for the day instead of buying candy or other typical Valentine’s gifts. Your originality is more appreciated than anything else.
Mars and Saturn’s current positions are throwing your love life out of balance. By next week, when Venus starts to show, things will be better than ever.
Today the old saying “it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all” will weigh heavily on your day’s events. Though it may not be a comforting idea, your previous battles of love will make you an even better partner.
There are plenty of fish in the sea and today you have the perfect bait. Throw out your line of love and see what you end up catching.
Love is in the air. Take a deep breath and let the magic of it all propel you toward a great week.

“Ernest Green said that he didn’t mean to start a revolution, he was just going to class,” commented Kamal Ibrahim, a senior mathematics major and vice president of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.
Green is the oldest member of the Little Rock Nine, the legendary group of students that broke segregation at Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957. 
The journey that brought Green to campus last Thursday began just as humbly with a conversation between Ibrahim and M. Shernell Smith, the coordinator of Student Development, Multicultural, and Diversity Initiatives on campus.
Ibrahim sought to emphasize that “you can’t move forward without knowing your past” during Black History Month, and the result of their conversation was the “Living Legacies” lecture series. This particular lecture held special memories for Smith, as her mentor was none other than Daisy Bates, a civil rights activist and mentor of the Little Rock Nine.
In the early ’50s, the American school system operated under the “separate but equal” language of the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court case. In 1954, the groundbreaking Brown v. Board of Education decision legally ended racial segregation in education.
However, it took three years for any progress to occur in Little Rock’s Central High School. Segregationists heavily protested the move to desegregation, and Governor Orval Faubus ordered the National Guard to block the students’ entry. 
These nine students made history through their impact on desegregation. Their names were Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Lanier, Minnijean Trickley, Gloria Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed-Wair, and Melba Beals.
In an interview before the lecture, Green discussed his life leading to that school year, implications for the future in education, and civil rights. Before the opportunity to attend Central High School arose, Green attended an all-black high school, Horace Mann.
“Little Rock at that time was segregated buses, movie theaters, [and] restaurants, and Jim Crow activity was prevalent,” Green said.
His mother and aunt were schoolteachers and they, along with his grandfather, played an important role in his childhood. In his educational endeavors, Green was an active student and a member of the marching band.
The opportunity arose after the Brown decision for students to transfer into Central High School. Green volunteered to participate. “When I first told my mother I was considering transferring to Central, she was supportive.... She saw that the old way was something we had to be willing to challenge and change for the future,” Green said.
That change tested the nine students and formed strong bonds between them. According to Green, “name-calling, harassment, abuse, breaking into lockers, wet towels and broken glass in the gym ... telephone calls in the middle of the night, death threats” all occurred in the first year. The few white students that did try to aid the nine students faced harassment from segregationists.
With the support of family, community, and his inner resolve, Green graduated at 16 years old as the first African-American from the school. In attendance at his graduation was Martin Luther King Jr., who at the time was not yet nationally known. Green experienced firsthand how providing educational opportunities and resources is fundamental for securing the future. His response to the ongoing struggle for educational equality was that “this country has to figure their expenditure on education and students is an investment for the future.”
Brittany Claud, the president of the Black Graduate Student Organization, initiated the event, followed by an introduction by Ibrahim.
Green began his lecture by stressing the importance of remembering the past while looking to the future. His first anecdote centered on himself as a child of six years old in Little Rock being denied access to a whites-only water fountain and connected it with the trials African-Americans faced daily. 
Green provided the audience with vivid descriptions of the school year, those who ensured its success, and the importance of education.
“The heroes of the civil rights movement were the thousands demonstrating, voting, leading organizations, and helping students like us with homework,” he said. At the time his father died, only 2 percent of African-Americans typically graduated from college. Today, the number has increased to 20 percent, demonstrating both the progress and the ongoing struggle for educational parity the United States faces.
After the lecture, Green accepted questions from the audience that focused on education, the status of family, and his own life.
A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter asked if Green’s parents were activists. Although Green acknowledged that he did not see it as activism at the time, his mother was part of a support group that helped a woman suing the Arkansas School Board for equal pay for black and white teachers. In a time when African-Americans were not permitted in hotels, Green’s mother provided housing for the attorney, future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.
As he concluded the lecture, Green emphasized that the current generation is the one that “will turn the lights on and make the trains run.”
As part of the focus on inspiring the future generation, Green also attended a dinner honoring African-American student leaders on campus. Attendees, in addition to Ibrahim and Smith, were Billy Snow, Kory McDonald, Brianna Kent, Chris Loncke, Heather Bernard, Brittany Claud, Calvin Mack, Darlene Reid, Joanna Dickert, and Terri Baltimore of the Hill House Association.
It is these types of cultural experiences that Smith seeks to encourage throughout the year, not just during a specific month.
“It’s about every day having these meaningful exchanges that make others aware of culture ... and looking at things not just from a difference but in regards to all the similarities that we all share and how that helps us to be the society and world that we are,” Smith said.

By May 2011, Carnegie Mellon’s civil and environmental engineering (CEE) department will be home to the IBM Smarter Infrastructure Lab. The lab will be comprised of three main components: a high-end analytics and computing center known as the “Cloud,” a videoconference collaboration lab, and the CAVE, a fully immersive, three-dimensional interactive environment. The videoconference lab will enhance already existing connections between Carnegie Mellon researchers and their partners across the country and around the world.
The CAVE is the latest 3-D visualization technology from EON Reality, Inc. This three-dimensional environment, called the ICube, will consist of three rear-projection walls to display images portraying the desired environment. The ICube will provide a new interface for viewing data, including MATLAB or GIS plans for new construction, CAD designs for a jet plane, and even the anatomy of the human body.
The IBM Smarter Infrastructure Lab will primarily be used for CEE researchers and students, but its visualization capabilities can aid other researchers as well. 
Emily Walker, a junior materials science major, said, “If they expanded this technology to model a product, a crystal, or a circuit, it would be good for people in other engineering departments too.”
According to the EON website, users wearing lightweight glasses with infrared tracking will be able to move freely about the ICube as the system monitors their position and orientation within the environment. Then, the technology will stream stereoscopic images of the virtual environment onto the walls taking the user’s changing perspective into account. 
The IBM Smarter Infrastructure Lab CAVE will accept user input via an Xbox controller.
The Smarter Infrastructure Lab will be just one component of a greater initiative: the Pennsylvania Smart Infrastructure Incubator (PSII). The PSII is co-sponsored by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, IBM, and the aircraft manufacturing company Bombardier, Inc. 
These sponsors’ donations will directly enrich Carnegie Mellon’s own research and graduate programs in the smart infrastructure area that spans a number of departments and colleges, especially that of the Advanced Infrastructure Systems (AIS) program in CEE. 
CEE faculty members in the AIS group include the CEE department head, James H. Garrett Jr., along with Burcu Akinci, Mario Bergés, Irving Oppenheim, Lucio Soibelman, Scott Matthews, Chris Hendrickson, and Susan Finger.
According to Garrett and Soibelman, the central focuses of AIS research include infrastructure and facilities design, construction, and operations. 
The research field encompasses both the built environment and the natural environment.
“We’re exploring how sensing, information modeling, information management, data mining, and intelligent-decision support can be applied to the processes of constructing and managing infrastructure,” Garrett said.
Cataloging the existing cracks in the sewer pipeline system, knowing the stress and strain capacities of public bridges, and accurately predicting the costs of future road repairs are all important to city policy-makers and contractors.
“Our infrastructure is in bad shape. There doesn’t seem to be enough money available to truly address all the different demands for replacement of that infrastructure,” Garrett said, while explaining that emergency response costs up to three times as much as planned response and repair. “So information is key. It’s why IBM is very interested in this area.”
Soibelman added that it is a civil engineer’s ability to delay expenditures and optimize repairs. “People think about installing sensors on a bridge to be used as an alarm that the bridge is about to collapse.... But I could add sensors in bridges that the city is planning to destroy ... and by the sensor I can prove that I can use this bridge for several more years in a safe way.”
Both Garrett and Soibelman agreed that collecting, analyzing, and visualizing information are important processes in civil engineering. They believe that the IBM Smarter Infrastructure Lab will help them and their colleagues to present and transmit data in a clear, concise manner. 
“All this information will be integrated and able to be visualized in ways that will help decision-makers make decisions. Because, in the end, our goal is to make sure a decision-maker makes the right decision as soon as possible and spends the least amount of money to have the highest quality operational infrastructure,” Garrett said.
“We can tell the city to fix this pipe or fix that pipe, and they can trust us, or we can find a way of showing them visually in a way that they say, ‘Ah, that makes sense,’ ” Soibelman said. “Visualization has that power.”

In March, Intel will close Intel Labs Pittsburgh at Carnegie Mellon, one of three remaining university lablets and part of the Intel Labs research program. The move is part of the company’s overall transition from lablets to more specialized Intel Science and Technology Centers (ISTCs).
In January, the company announced its plans to invest approximately $100 million into the new ISTCs. “Instead of three university lablets, there [are] envisioned seven ISTCs, for roughly the same investment from Intel,” said Phil Gibbons, a principal research scientist at Intel Labs Pittsburgh and an adjunct professor in the school of computer science. “Each ISTC is a three- to five-year center that Intel plans to fund at $2.5 million per year.”
Continuing its partnership with Carnegie Mellon, Intel will build two ISTCs on the Carnegie Mellon campus: One center will focus on cloud computing, while the other will research embedded computing. “CMU was the only university awarded two centers, which I believe is a testament to the success of the CMU-Intel partnership to date,” Gibbons added. 
“A key aspect of the relationship would be a very open intellectual property model that would reduce the barriers to effective collaboration between university faculty and students and Intel researchers,” explained Mahadev Satyanarayanan, who was previously a professor in the school of computer science.
Gibbons also commented, “Intel and each partner university agreed to an open, collaborative model in which intellectual property is jointly shared, source code is released open source, and research results are published openly in academic conferences.”
“Dr. David Tennenhouse [director of the then newly created Intel Research] approached me about creating a lablet at Carnegie Mellon. This would be a relatively small entity, about 20 researchers in total, who would work very closely with Carnegie Mellon University in extending the frontiers of computer science and creating new opportunities for core Intel technologies,” recounted Satyanarayanan. “The university administration was supportive of this concept, and in May 2001 I accepted the position of founding director of Intel Research [Pittsburgh].”
Opened in May 2001 above the Starbucks on Craig Street, Intel Labs Pittsburgh was one of the first collaborative research centers between universities and major computing technology companies. “The lab was opened ... to fulfill Intel’s vision of essential computing by improving the technologies that we rely on in our daily lives,” according to its website.
“Intel is closing all three remaining university lablets in order to introduce a new framework,” explained Gibbons. Currently, Intel has lablets at Carnegie Mellon, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Washington. Intel also had a lablet at the University of Cambridge until 2007.
“Over a 10-year period since its founding, the Intel lab in Pittsburgh has been phenomenally successful in attracting top computer science talent and in creating high-impact research results,” Satyanarayanan said. “Now Intel wishes to switch to a different model of collaboration with universities, and hence its decision to close the lab.”
During Satyanarayanan’s term as director, both Carnegie Mellon faculty and students worked with Intel researchers in a variety of areas relating to computer science, including virtual computing and image-based searching and querying. 
In 2004, Satyanarayanan stepped down as director to return to a full-time faculty position, and he was succeeded by Todd Mowry.
While the lablets operated as stand-alone research centers, the new ISTCs will be more specialized and work in specific areas of computing technology assigned by Intel. For example, the first ISTC, which will be at Stanford University, will focus on visual computing.
“Many current staff members at Intel Labs Pittsburgh plan to continue their research and projects at one of the two ISTCs. I have accepted the Intel-Principal Investigator position in the CMU ISTC on cloud computing,” Gibbons said. “This is an exciting opportunity, and I look forward to the break through research that will arise from this new partnership with CMU. The faculty and students at CMU are world-class and fun to work with.”

With the spring semester a third of the way done and spring break in a mere three weeks, many students are beginning to plan what they are going to do or where to go during their breaks.
For those who are service-minded and want to be productive during break, Carnegie Mellon offers an alternative break program. Established in 2006, the Alternative Break student organization allows students to “plan, develop, organize, and realize domestic and international alternative break trips, expanding their knowledge through cooperative organization, service learning, workshops, and excursions,” as stated in its constitution.
Many students place great value on community service. “I do community service because I feel that I need to give back to a community that’s done so much for me. It doesn’t take that much to participate in community service; one little action can make a big impact,” said Cora Goldston, a sophomore social and decision sciences major and a member of the co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.
The Alternative Break program offers a different way for students to spend their time off, Goldston said, “It would be a really good use of my time, as opposed to sitting at home and doing nothing. It gives me the chance to do something good.”
The first trip hosted by Alternative Break was to Bay St. Louis in Mississippi with the goal of helping clean up the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Alternative Break focuses on building relationships within its organization and with the other local and international organizations it partners with.
This past year, a group of 15 undergraduates traveled to Monte Cristi in the Dominican Republic in conjunction with the nonprofit organization Orphanage Outreach. The group volunteered at a local orphanage and taught English in Dominican grade schools. Alternative Break participants have also traveled to Peru, Louisiana, and Ecuador. The group will be travelling to Ghana this break.
Alternative Break aims to connect students with different communities and cultures. “I did a food drive in my high school. I really enjoyed giving back to the community, knowing that people would have a better Thanksgiving,” said Anne Dirkes, a sophomore mechanical engineering major. “I also helped Carnegie Mellon’s SafeWalk program, which was also really great. It isn’t as direct as community service, but it still gives back and keeps our campus safe. I would definitely like to keep giving back to the Pittsburgh community throughout my college years.”
The organization is open for all Carnegie Mellon students to join. For those who want to help, but have other plans for spring break, Alternative Break also accepts any donations. For more information, visit the group’s website.

Ilker Baybars, deputy dean and professor of operations management at the Tepper School of Business, was awarded the George Leland Bach Chair for his contributions to his department.
Baybars received both his master’s degree and Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon, and the became part of the faculty in 1978. 
His many awards and achievements include the Tepper School’s Outstanding Achievement Award for Leadership and the Emil Limbach Teaching Award for Excellence in the Classroom at Heinz College. 
Baybars also founded and designed the business school’s “FlexTime” (part-time) and “FlexMode” (distance learning) master’s programs.
“For more than three decades Dr. Baybars has served the university as a distinguished faculty member, researcher and administrator,” said Mark S. Kamlet, university provost and executive vice president, in a recent university press release. 
“In recognition of his long-standing dedication to the Tepper School and his individual contributions to the academic community, it is fitting that he is honored with the professorship named for Lee Bach, who was known as a great teacher and innovator in furthering the knowledge and understanding of economics and business.”

Spring Lecture Series: “On Order and Madness”
Monday at 6 p.m.
Carnegie Museum of Art Theater
In his lecture titled “On Order and Madness,” Dale Clifford will discuss the emergence of new materials in architectural designs and the materials’ reliability. Clifford is an assistant professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon and principal of the Arizona-based firm Binary Design. 
Clifford was a founding member of the Emerging Materials Technology group at the University of Arizona. This group formed a research program that analyzed, tested, and modeled both traditional and new materials. The group further analyzed the performance-based building assemblies used with these materials.
Clifford’s research interests specialize in examining natural forming processes, patterns, and systems to develop building technologies.
Identity Equipment: Technology, Memory, Narrative
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing, Baker Hall 136A
Paul John Eakin, the Ruth N. Halls professor emeritus of English at Indiana University, will be presenting his lecture on identities in conflict. 
He will use the latest research in neurology, cognitive science, memory studies, developmental psychology, and related fields in order to make his audience reevaluate their ideas of self-representation. 
The experience of living in one’s body shapes one’s identity, while exploring relational and narrative modes of being, emphasizing social sources of identity, and demonstrating that humans are constantly evolving in relation to others. 
Eakin plans to conclude by discussing the ethical issues raised by the conflict between the authorial impulse to life writing and a traditional, privacy-based ethics that those writings often violate.
“The Accidental Empire: Israel’s Settlement Dilemma, Past, and Future”
Wednesday at noon
837 William Pitt Union
Carnegie Mellon’s history department and the University of Pittsburgh’s department of Jewish studies will present senior correspondent for The American Prospect Gershom Gorenberg. Gorenberg is the author of The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967–1977.  His lecture will be centered on this book and will discuss the history of Israel and its ongoing territorial issues. He has also written for The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times Magazine, and the New York Review of Books.
Human-Computer Interaction Institute Seminar
Wednesday at 4 p.m.
Newell-Simon Hall 1305
Jeremy Birnholtz, assistant professor at Cornell University and the University of Toronto, will discuss his latest research, titled “Butler Lies: How Media Attributes Shape Deception in Availability Management.”
He will present two exploratory studies of how people use text, IM, and SMS messaging to manage their availability. This study reveals how people use media strategically, sometimes deceptively, to explain and coordinate their behavior. More specifically, he will draw on both the technical properties of media and the social norms of their usage. 
Birnholtz’s research aims to improve the usefulness and usability of communication and collaboration tools, focusing on understanding and exploiting mechanisms of human attention.

Chocolate has a long history. In the fourth century the Mayan civilization worshiped the cocoa plant, while the Aztecs later used cocoa beans as currency and valued it as an aphrodisiac. Christopher Columbus was the first European to discover cocoa beans in 1502, but it wasn’t until 26 years later that Hernán Cortés first brought cocoa beans to Spain from the New World. Here are some other interesting facts about chocolate:
6: milligrams of caffeine in one ounce of milk chocolate
92%: percentage of Americans who prefer milk over dark chocolate
40%: percentage of the world’s almonds used by chocolate manufacturers
20,000,000: Hershey’s kisses produced daily

The 112th United States Congress has been in session for a month now and has already seen its share of controversy.
There has been the standard incident of a Congressman resigning due to risqué Craigslist intrigue (we’re looking at you, Chris Lee), but we find the goings-on inside the chambers to be more concerning. After their vaunted shellacking of the Democrats in November, the Republicans came into their House majority with some explicitly stated goals.
They were going to repeal the federal health care legislation. They were going to cut spending by $100 billion. They were going to implement a conservative agenda that they saw as mandated by the American electorate.
What the Republican Party failed to tell said electorate — and what any student of U.S. politics already knew — was that these promises are impossible to keep with the currently divided Congress. While Speaker John Boehner (R–Ohio) uses his giant gavel to control the House, the Senate still has a Democratic majority, and President Obama still sits in the Oval Office. The Republicans have as much chance of repealing “Obamacare” as the fictional Jed Bartlet of the television drama The West Wing does of being elected president in 2012. Pretending otherwise is a waste of the legislature’s time and taxpayers’ money.
We have at least two years of divided government to look forward to. Two years of parties refusing to compromise — refusing to come to a middle that no longer exists. We will see the passage of no more giant health care acts in the next two years, no more shoving bills through Congress while completely ignoring the minority in each chamber. If laws pass, they will do so via compromise. We do not expect much civility in our civic leaders, but we can still hope.
It may take several months for Republicans and Democrats to decide if they will be able to work together  in this Congress. If they cannot, we will all suffer. Funding for programs will dry up, and states will be forced to make even deeper cuts to satisfy federal demands without federal support. 
Without compromise, it is a bleak outlook. For that reason we demand that all our representatives look outside their own caucuses and become more than ideologues.

President Obama recently announced that his budget proposal would provide relief for states burdened by debt from unemployment benefits. Although this proposal had not officially been released by the White House until today, representatives and employers alike have already made their feelings known. At a time when unity is most needed, partisan differences are keeping government fragmented.
It is obvious that our economy is still in the midst of a recession. Families are still forced to cut back, unemployment levels are still uncomfortably high, and people everywhere are still nervous about putting their faith in the government’s plans. As a result, the Obama administration has been forced to think of creative and resourceful strategies to help businesses and workers survive. This is becoming increasingly difficult with the federal government loaning billions of dollars to state governments to pay for unemployment benefits. According to The Wall Street Journal, “More than 40 states raised their unemployment-insurance payroll taxes last year to boost revenues.”
Obama’s plan is aimed at replenishing the drained state unemployment-insurance trust funds. It stipulates that companies will have to pay $15,000 in unemployment taxes, more than double the amount they are currently paying. However, in a good-hearted attempt to aid businesses as much as possible, the proposal would ideally delay these new tax regulations until 2014, the estimated year of full economic recovery.
I believe it is essential that the federal government and companies work together and form a symbiotic relationship. Without cooperation between the two, our economy will only continue to stagnate.
“The president’s proposal does two things that are most important,” White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a Washington Post article. “It prevents increases in the federal tax that goes to the unemployment insurance fund, and that’s tremendously important given where we are economically. But it prevents future state bailouts, because in the future, states are going to have to rationalize what they offer and how they pay for it.”
Not all feedback on the proposal is so positive and optimistic, however. A majority of Republican representatives have taken a decidedly strong opposition to the plan’s provisions. They are most incensed with the prospect of raising taxes and government intervention on business, as per usual.
“I strongly urge the White House to reconsider this job-destroying proposal,” said Orrin Hatch (R–Utah) in a press release. “Either employers will have less money to hire, or workers will face reduced wages. Neither makes any sense and both run counter to our shared goal of getting the American people back to work.”
Hatch, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has a clear personal stake in the outcome of this budget plan. He, like many Republicans, believes that raising taxes of any sort is a counter-intuitive method of restoring and revitalizing the economy. However, in instances like these, federal and state governments must agree to compromises in order for any sort of progress to be made.
Realistically speaking, what other choice does the federal government have besides raising revenue, especially considering the already-fragile state of our economy?
Although the plan is geared toward helping companies, employers remain skeptical of the possible benefits and pitfalls.
“What’s being proposed by the White House would be very helpful and a big boost in the short term,” said Kevin Brinegar, president of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, whose members start paying higher taxes in April in order to repay the state’s $2 billion loan. However, he commented that the proposal’s additional tax increases in 2014 “would be pretty devastating.”
The budget proposal is being debated during a time when tensions between White House officials and employers are still apparent. Although the federal government is trying to improve its relations with business groups by cutting costs, it is simultaneously pushing for financial help to restore the unemployment insurance fund, which has been severely drained by the prolonged recession.
Obama promised businesses government efforts to simplify the corporate tax code and to lower the corporate tax rate. By demanding even higher unemployment taxes, Obama’s plan could exacerbate that already strained relationship.
It is very easy to be a skeptic and a cynic. It is very easy to criticize and complain. But now is not the time for involved parties, such as Congress, businesses, and the public, to take the easy route; cooperation, although difficult, is necessary for our country to restore itself.
It seems that both members of Congress and the public expect Obama to magically restore the economy without any additional cost to them. They both need to realize that this is a ridiculous stance. Their unrealistic belief that recovery and sacrifice don’t go hand in hand will leave President Obama with some very tough decisions to make.
No one can say with certainty if this proposal will help the economy and businesses. Both sides of support and opposition have valid points, making it difficult to take a definite stance. One thing, however, is certain: The best approach we can take to fixing our economy is to put aside teamwork and partisan biases. We will only dig ourselves into a deeper financial crisis by nit-picking and splitting hairs with one another. There is a famous stereotype associated with split Congressional houses: Partisan gridlock means laws are never passed and nothing gets done. I strongly disagree; if the two houses can keep the goal of restoring the economy a priority and avoid being bogged down by minor details, Congress could produce innovative pieces of legislature.
That being said, it will be interesting to see how far this proposal gets in Congress and if Obama can generate enough support to get it passed.

Aside from Valentine’s Day (Feb. 14) and National Freedom to Marry Day (Feb. 12), the issue of love appeared in the news a third time last week, as both chambers of the Hawaii state legislature passed versions of a bill that would allow same-sex couples in the state to enter into civil unions. Hawaii Senate Bill 232 was passed by large margins in both the state House and Senate, and it also has the support of the state’s governor and attorney general.
In the ongoing debate over the legal nature of same-sex versus opposite-sex partnerships, the bill further expands and redefines civil unions. Hawaii Senate Bill 232 attempts to bridge gaps between the definition of a civil union and a marriage for the benefit of both homosexual and heterosexual couples. Indeed, the bill opens the status of civil union — with all the legal rights, responsibilities, protections, and benefits of traditional marriage — to same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike. This is an important first step in what we see as the best long-term strategy: to get the word “marriage” out of our laws and provide a more neutral term that gives equal status to all couples regardless of sex.
Society has forced the word “marriage” to perform a confusing, two-faced dance between its definition in the law books and its role in our social lives. Pronouncement of a Christian union before God, a solemn Hindu saptapadi, or a sanctification via kiddushin under the Law of Moses means nothing to state law without a properly attested marriage license. Conversely, there is no portion of these religious rites set aside for the veneration of the state’s marriage certificate.
While Hawaii’s civil union bill would leave the term “marriage” on the books for heterosexual couples, its creation of an equivalent status for all couples is a smart move. 
A national debate on couples’ rights that continually mixes 1,138 maritally-sensitive federal statutes with the teachings of independent religious authorities is no way to make calm, level-headed legal decisions. 
We believe it would be wiser for the government to focus on defining one set of civil union rights and responsibilities for all couples, while leaving the different social interpretations and criteria for religious marriages up to other authorities.

“The Dude.” If you don’t know who “The Dude” is or what I’m referring to, you just dug a big hole in our friendship garden that you may never be able to climb out of. The film, of course, is The Big Lebowski, a 1998 movie that has since been named one of the funniest comedies of all time, become a cult classic with legions of fans, and sprouted “Lebowski Fests” across the country.
It has even inspired its very own religion.
Indeed, the “slowest growing religion in the world” is Dudeism. In a recent interview with CNN, Oliver Benjamin, the Dudely Lama of Dudeism who founded this unique religion in 2005, stated that “everyone wishes they had more freedom. Everyone wishes they could be more carefree, to worry less about money and status.” To this end, he emphasizes to followers, “bring a little more ‘Dude’ into your life.”
Honestly, this sounds like a pretty solid setup, especially for those of us at Carnegie Mellon. There are few schools in this country that combine $50,000-per-year tuition, a symbolic “Sex Kills” T-shirt, insomnia, and back-breaking schedules as well as our school does. Think back — when was the last time you set aside some “Dude” time for yourself? Been a while, hasn’t it?
Simple pleasures like bathing by candlelight, bowling, and hanging out with friends are essential to the pursuit of happiness, according to this modern religion — more so than the accumulation of wealth and participation in the rat race of today’s greedy society.
Dudeism is very philosophical in nature, just like the movie was at its heart. Throughout the film, “The Dude” just wants to do what he enjoys in life without interruption from aggressive outside sources. Following Dudeism allows you to concentrate on just that. You keep in mind what makes you happy, like White Russians and bowling, instead of what makes you go insane, like suitcases of money and anarchists.
Now, no one is saying that it’s okay to get stoned and play video games all day. Dudeism is about cultivating your mind, having strong morals, and being creative. It is not about laziness or rebelling for the sake of rebellion. It is possible to live a rich and fulfilling life within the constraints and rules of society. Life is what you make of it. And at Carnegie Mellon, it is strikingly obvious to me that not only are all of us are intellectually strong and creative, but that many of us face difficulty in finding a balance between pleasure and work. All this “dude talk” may sound silly, but I believe we would do ourselves great good if we abided by “The Dude” now and again.

Lately, “rehab” and “celebrity” seem to go hand in hand. Two and a Half Men star Charlie Sheen recently entered a rehab center after he allegedly destroyed a hotel room in an alcohol- and cocaine-induced rage. Lindsay Lohan has been in and out of rehab so many times that it’s become difficult to keep track.
One celebrity whose unexpected admittance to rehab surprised her fans was young Disney star Demi Lovato. The star abruptly checked herself into an Illinois rehab center last October after a reported meltdown while on tour. Her rehabilitation is not for the usual drugs and alcohol abuse, however: Her representatives have said that she entered the facility to deal with physical and emotional issues, and that she has struggled with cutting and eating disorders.
Eating disorders affect an overwhelming amount of the population. The National Eating Disorders Association reports that as many as 11 million people in the United States are struggling with anorexia or bulimia, with 40 percent of newly found cases of anorexia occurring in girls aged 14 to 19. Some may think eating disorders to be relatively harmless, but nothing could be further from the truth — anorexia nervosa has the highest premature fatality rate of any mental illness.
However, despite these disorders’ prevalence, there remains a woefully small amount of research funds directed at treating them. The National Eating Disorders Association says that “reported dollars spent on anorexia averaged $0.70 per affected individual, compared to over $159.00 per affected individual for schizophrenia,” even though schizophrenia only affects about a fifth as many people as eating disorders do.
Why is a serious mental illness that affects so many people not being taken seriously or being sufficiently funded? Perhaps it’s because anorexia and bulimia are thought of merely as “extreme dieting.” After all, American culture is obsessed with being skinny: According to inch-aweigh.com, at any given time, approximately half of American women are on a diet. Americans spend over $40 billion a year on dieting and diet-related products. In our diet-obsessed world, it is easy to dismiss people with eating disorders as girls who merely “took it too far” or “did it wrong.” Contrary to popular belief, an eating disorder is a serious mental illness and should be treated as such.
I applaud Demi Lovato for taking the necessary steps to recover from her issues. Since leaving the Illinois rehabilitation center, she has continued to seek outpatient care, and reports say that she already looks much happier and healthier. I hope her experiences will encourage her to speak out about the seriousness of eating disorders, and inspire other young women suffering from this illness to follow in her footsteps and get the help they need.

Super Bowl commercials, a yearly advertising highlight for many viewers, generally attract a great deal of attention. This year, one particular advertisement made a big splash. Groupon, a U.S.-based company that offers discounts to users from different local restaurants and companies, angered and offended viewers with its ad.
During said ad, actor Timothy Hutton appears to be bringing awareness of an international travesty to light. He looks to the camera and says, “The Tibetan people are in trouble. Their culture is in jeopardy.” Then the camera zooms out to show a Himalayan restaurant in Chicago, and in an enthusiastic tone, Hutton adds, “But they still whip up an amazing fish curry!”
Hutton then talks about a 50 percent discount he and other Groupon users received from the Himalayan restaurant in Chicago. Not only did this ad succeed in bringing American consumerism to a whole new level, but it also trivialized the plight of the Tibetan people. 
We think the ad was shallow and thoughtless, in addition to having little relevance to the purpose of the advertisement: to entice viewers to buy discounted merchandise.
The ad, which originally garnered criticism from Super Bowl viewers, has since become an international issue, as its humor fell flat with Chinese Internet users. Tibet has long been a source of domestic and international conflict for China ever since the country took over the region in 1951. As a result, much of Tibet’s unique Buddhist practices, cultural events, and spiritual traditions have been outlawed. Following an uprising in 1959, the Dalai Lama was forced into exile along with many of his followers.
Groupon claims the ad was created with the intent to generate support for the Tibet Fund, an organization that aims to preserve Tibetan culture. Similarly, Groupon’s other two ads, which featured Cuba Gooding Jr. talking about whales and Elizabeth Hurley talking about Brazil, were also meant to raise money for Greenpeace. All three ads were allegedly created to encourage viewers to give through a donation-accepting website, savethemoney.org. The site, however, was never mentioned in the ads and was taken down on Friday.
An ad that makes light of a country’s 50-year-long struggle against a ruling power is certainly not in best taste for Groupon, a company that has been attempting to enter the Chinese market for some time. Groupon Chief Executive Andrew Mason has apologized, pulled the ads, and promised a less-polarizing approach in future commercials. 
While we at The Tartan certainly cannot support Groupon’s misguided attempt at irony, we are grateful that the company has owned up to its mistakes, and we hope it will make smarter advertising decisions in the future.

I was disappointed in your coverage on Monday, Feb. 7, of Tom Ridge’s appearance on campus (speaking about drilling for natural gas from the Marcellus Shale).
You did report that the audience wasn’t fully persuaded by his speech. But, for anyone who wasn’t there, your write-up doesn’t convey how thoroughly self-serving and condescending Mr. Ridge’s presentation actually was, nor how dismissive his “answers” to those questions which were permitted to be asked.
In particular, you quote Mr. Ridge as saying, “You need to have science drive this, folks.” Now, setting aside the use of “folks” as a put-down, it was clear from his other remarks what this rejoinder clearly meant: “You bring me the science, proving beyond any doubt that drilling is harmful, and I might listen to you. Until then, you have nothing to say. Furthermore, the industry will do nothing to advance the state of knowledge about the impact of drilling, and will obstruct anyone who does.”
Mr. Ridge also touted the gas industry’s “Guiding Principles,” such as “transparency,” but he had no answer when asked why homeowners, whose water supplies have been ruined by drilling, were required to sign gag orders as a condition of remediation (usually, water buffalos or worse).
Finally, you mention Mr. Ridge’s services to the gas industry as “consulting” (the word he used). An accurate description would be “public relations and government lobbying,” for which he receives some $900,000 per year.
If Tartan readers would like to round out their understanding of the issues raised in this presentation, they would do well to check www.marcellusprotest.org.
Thank you,
