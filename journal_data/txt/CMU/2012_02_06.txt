“It’s déjà vu all over again.” That famous quote by the Yankees’ Yogi Berra could not be more appropriate, even if it regards a different sport and a different era.
Almost mirroring the events of Super Bowl XLII, the New York Giants beat the favored New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI in Indianapolis. On the coattails of a terrific fourth quarter drive by quarterback Eli Manning, a defining catch reminiscent of David Tyree’s, and a game-sealing sack, the Giants pulled out the upset.
Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was looking to cement himself into an even higher echelon of great quarterbacks, but instead Manning made his way to Hall of Fame consideration. The Giants stand alone at the top of the NFL, defeating the Patriots with a final score of 21–17.
It seemed like the Patriots had the Giants’ number during the first three quarters. After a good start in the first half by the Giants, their respected defensive line could not stop the short, quick passing plan of Patriots’ offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien and head coach Bill Belichick. It essentially negated the dominant Giants’ pass rush, allowing the Patriots a touchdown at the end of the first half.
In that half, the Giants scored on a questionable safety call via intentional grounding in the end zone by Brady and on a Manning pass to wide receiver Victor Cruz. Regardless, the Patriots appeared to have the edge. 
The third quarter was similar to the first half. An aggressive, quick passing game by New England helped the Patriots score their second touchdown, and sloppy play by New York, including two fumbles, pointed to a Giants collapse.
However, in the fourth quarter, the Giants snapped out of it, and Manning did his best Brady impression. Brady, who has seven career fourth-quarter comebacks in the postseason, is considered one of the greatest clutch quarterbacks ever to play the game. Manning may now be considered in that conversation.
At the 3:46 mark in the fourth quarter, the Giants’ final drive began with the score sitting 17–15, advantage Patriots. A 38-yard pass from Manning down the sideline in double coverage was cradled in by wide receiver Mario Manningham, as he   barely kept his feet in bounds.
After eight plays of pin-point passing by Manning and physical play from the offensive line and wide receivers, running back Ahmad Bradshaw ran up the middle, turned around, and sat hindquarter-first into the end zone. The Patriots allowed the Giants a touchdown, in hopes of preventing them from running down the clock, thereby preventing a Patriots’ final drive.
That last drive ended poorly for New England. A sack by Pro-Bowl defensive end Justin Tuck crushed any remaining momentum for the Patriots. One last heave by Brady ended with the ball hitting the grass of the end zone, as the outstretched arms of the Patriots’ tight end Rob Gronkowski extended about a foot short of winning. 
Manning is now the 11th multi-Super Bowl winning quarterback. This win secures him the elite status that was so heavily questioned by the media earlier this season. It puts him ahead of his brother Peyton, who has received more praise as a quarterback throughout both of their careers.
Brady is already in the realm of greatness. However, a victory in Super Bowl XLVI would have tied him with Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana with four Super Bowl titles. Now people are left questioning if “Spygate,” where Belichick was accused of spying on opposing coaches’ play-calling, was the reason for his three Super Bowl victories. Since “Spygate,” Brady is 0–2 on the biggest stage.
The fact of the matter is that Brady and Manning both played unbelievable games. But it was Manning’s supporting cast that put the Giants over the top. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin runs a tight ship in New York, and it showed in Indianapolis. 
Super Bowl XLVI is over, with the Giants reigning supreme — twice in four years. It could not have been put better than Giants’ running back Brandon Jacobs: “We decapitated them.” Call it what you want, but the Giants are the Super Bowl champions once again.

The Orlando Magic is the NBA’s biggest loser. The team has quit, plain and simple. Not only have they lost six of their past nine games, but they also have problems that go deeper than their record. They have no explanation for putting up only 56 points in one game, and then blowing a 27-point lead five days later. While Magic coach Stan Van Gundy has publicly taken the blame, it doesn’t take much to see that team leader Dwight Howard is at fault. 
Howard has destroyed this team with his selfishness and demands. By requiring a trade at the beginning of the season, he has told his teammates that he wants nothing to do with them. Over the past few weeks, Howard has publicly lashed out at his teammates for their lack of effort, but all it would take is one glance in the mirror to show him the root of the problem. Howard is trying to lead this team with one foot on the court and the other out the door, and is achieving unsurprising results. 
The time has come for the Magic’s front office to put an end to this situation. The NBA has seen several high-profile stars holding their teams hostage with difficult demands. The last thing Orlando wants is for this situation to turn into one like LeBron James caused for the Cleveland Cavaliers two years ago. The Cavaliers’ front office was faced with the choice of accepting the inevitable by trading James to maximize their return, or holding onto their star in vain hopes that he would suddenly change his mind at the end of the season. 
While the choice seems obvious, teams are very hesitant to trade their stars for fear of fans’ backlash. Owners know that, without their star, fan attendance and profits would plummet. Teams hesitate to use the term “rebuilding” because it sounds like a surrender; it is an admission of mediocrity. But trading an all-star isn’t always the same as waving the white flag. Sometimes it’s the best way to turn a losing team into a winning one. 
Look at the Denver Nuggets, who dealt with a similar situation with their star Carmelo Anthony. He demanded to be traded to the New York Knicks, eliminating all leverage for the Nuggets, but the team still managed to get several good players. Now, one season later, the Nuggets are excelling with the second-best record in their conference.
The Orlando Magic’s performance over the past few weeks has done nothing to show that this team, with its current group of players, wants to win. The Eastern Conference is weak, and the team has just as good of a shot as any to make it to the playoffs. But, before they even think about playing in the postseason, their roster needs to change. Howard was once the heart and soul of this team, but now he is the cancer causing its decay. 
Several trade possibilities have been rumored involving the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks — the three teams Howard said he would sign a long-term deal with. Any deal with the Nets would center around Brook Lopez, their young star center. Trades with the Mavericks and Lakers would revolve around players such as Jason Terry and Andrew Bynum, respectively.
Trading Howard allows the Magic to get something for their elite center. If the team waits until the end of the season, the best they can hope for is a nice sign and deal that gets them some expiring contracts and a draft pick. At worst, they let Howard walk away, gaining nothing, a scenario all too familiar to Orlando (Shaquille O’Neal left for Los Angeles after his contract expired). But if the Magic trades Howard right now, the team itself can salvage its season and start to restock its talent.
Howard has made things difficult by publicly stating which teams he would sign long-term deals with, but it’s still possible for the Magic to find a good trade. Their front office just needs to stop dragging its heels and make the most of a bad situation.

Ben Nealy, a junior on the Carnegie Mellon track team, hails from Egg Harbor Township in New Jersey, where he began running in his junior year of high school.
Currently, Nealy runs middle distances — 400 meters and 800 meters. Since joining the team, Nealy has enjoyed being a varsity athlete at Carnegie Mellon. “Having chosen the option of going to an academically competitive school, while also being able to balance being an athlete as well is a great experience,” Nealy said.
Although track is not a team sport in the traditional sense, Nealy spends a lot of time with his teammates. “Ben is a team player who not only likes to push his teammates but be pushed by them,” said track coach Dario Donatelli.
His teammates agree, and value Nealy’s ambitions for the team as a whole. “Ben’s greatest qualities as an athlete are his commitment and ambition,” said junior Evan Gates, one of Nealy’s teammates. “Each year he has trained harder than the previous by logging more miles and workouts. As a result, he continuously improves and entices others to train harder, too. Ben is a great teammate because he leads by example and places a high value on the success of the team.”
“Nealy’s a great teammate to have. He adds a lot to the goofy team personality, works hard, runs fast, and does so with swagger. It’s hard to not get along with Ben; he’s fast, fun, and friendly,” said junior Billy Littlefield, one of Nealy’s teammates.
Unsurprisingly, Nealy has set high expectations and goals for this year’s team. “I think our current team is a lot better than last year’s team,” he said. “We have the talent to place first at UAA’s this year, that should be our goal as a team, and I hope to contribute to that goal.”
Nealy takes pride in his training and competition, and basks in his team’s success. “My proudest moment on the team was coming from behind to beat Case Western Reserve University by a point last year,” Nealy said.
As for when the team is in between training and meets, Nealy described the chemistry among teammates and how they relax. “There are entirely too many [funny moments] to choose from. There are so many great personalities on the team, you’re always in for a good laugh,” he said. After meets, he and his teammates love to indulge in pizza. “Post-meet pizza. There’s nothing like binging on pizza after a long day on the track.”
Since track meets are often long, Nealy loves to play games in between sets to entertain himself. “I enjoy playing board games with the team, like Bananagrams,” he said.
At Carnegie Mellon, Nealy studies economics and public policy. In the future, he hopes to earn enough money to buy Carnegie Mellon an indoor track facility.

Carnegie Mellon’s swimming and diving team participated in its last meet before the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships this past Saturday at the University of Pittsburgh. The women’s team defeated three of its four competitors: Clarion University, Grove City College, and California University of Pennsylvania.
The men’s team emerged victorious against Grove City College and Clarion University. However, both teams fell to Pitt.
Saturday was the swimming and diving team’s first meet since starting “taper” the previous Monday, a new routine that shortens practices during the week so the athletes feel more rested and have more energy for their meet at the end of the week.
Sophomore Megan Garvey, who has been swimming consistently well throughout her second season with Tartan athletics, placed fourth in the 100-yard butterfly on Saturday. 
According to Garvey, she hopes to place within the top eight in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly events at this year’s UAA championships, and eventually go on to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships.
Junior Breanna Stillo, who also competed against Pitt last Saturday, enjoyed racing against the Division I and II schools at the meet.
“As we approach our UAA championship, I’m really looking forward to seeing how well our team can do. It was an awesome experience being part of the first Carnegie Mellon women’s relay team to go to Nationals last year, so it would be great to send an even larger group of people this year,” she said.
Stillo placed third in the 100-yard breaststroke race. Earlier this season, Stillo set the school record for the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:05.96 at the Top Performance meet hosted by Kenyon College.
On the men’s team, junior Brandon Yee came in first in the 200-yard butterfly event with a time of 1:54.04, with junior Daniel Glaser-Garbrick following in third place in 1:57.88. Brandon Yee had a season-best time of 52.31 in the 200-yard backstroke, placing third in the race. He continues to prepare for the upcoming UAA conference meet, and said that he hopes to make it to the NCAA championship.
First-year Andrew Yee placed first in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:42.58, and was second in the 1,000-yard freestyle with his season-best time of 9:46.33. 
As a newcomer to the team this year, Andrew Yee said that he enjoyed the winter training trip in Miami, Fl., where the team not only tested its physical strength with a rigorous practice schedule that lasted nearly two weeks, but also became much closer as teammates.
Overcome with illness during the week, first-year Anton Razanav looks to the upcoming UAA meet as well as Nationals later this year. “With the UAA championship coming up soon, I am hoping to post some good times that place me as a strong opponent in finals. If my times allow me pass to Nationals in March, then I can hope to improve even further,” Razanav said.
The swimming and diving team will be in action again at the UAA championships at Case Western Reserve University. The meet will begin on Feb. 15 and finish on Feb. 18.

Last Friday, the Tartans hosted the New York University Violets in a rematch of their game last month.
The Tartans had previously defeated the Violets 70–68, with dominant performances by sophomore guards Asad Meghani and Rashaun Riley and senior forward John Duhring.
But this week, the Violets came to Pittsburgh for vengeance.
After 12 minutes of neck-and-neck basketball, the Violets exploded on a 10–1 run, as the Tartans’ defense struggled to halt the Violets’ offense. Sophomore forward Christian Manoli shot a three-pointer in the closing seconds of the half, which cut the score to 37–31, but he was relatively quiet during the rest of the night and fouled out later in the game.
Riley led the Tartans with 21 points and Duhring added 16 of his own, but the team still exhibited an inability to effectively run the offense and get openings consistently. In addition to the Violets’ 63 percent shooting, the Tartans could only muster 42 percent shooting during the game.
Behind Riley’s offense, the Tartans tied the game with 49 points six minutes into the second half, but another dominant run by the Violets buried the Tartans for good. After that 12–0 run, the Tartans never got closer than eight points, ending with a final score of 88–76 for the Violets.
In order for the Tartans to end this season with a string of conference victories, they need to clean up their offensive execution.
Despite the defeat, there was a significant amount of fans in attendance. “It was a great Friday night atmosphere, with so many students cheering on both our men and women’s teams. It is always good when the players have [that] kind of support,” said Josh Centor, the Tartan’s  assistant director of athletics.
The men’s basketball team played the Brandeis University Judges yesterday in Skibo Gymnasium. The game ended in another defeat for the Tartans, as the Judges scored a shot at the buzzer in overtime that gave them the 77–76 win.
After back-to-back clutch baskets by Duhring and free throws by sophomore guard Sean Brophy, the Tartans were up three points during overtime. After two missed free throws by the Tartans, the Judges scored a basket that broke the hearts of Carnegie Mellon fans. Brandeis’ senior guard Tyrone Hughes hit a shot against Meghani’s defense.
“Our guys played tremendously hard. We battled back and put ourselves in a positon to win. Unfortunately things didn’t go our way at the end,” Centor said.
Duhring led the Tartans in this game with 21 points, but it was senior forward Joe Kromka whose clutch play sent the game into overtime. After two free throws tied the game in the fourth quarter, Kromka blocked a shot that prevented the Judges from winning the game during regulation time. Manoli and Meghani added 17 and 13 points, respectively.
On Friday, the Tartans will play an away game against Washington University in St. Louis, who is leading the University Athletics Association conference.

Last Friday night, the women’s basketball team had a chance to sweep the New York University Violets after defeating them on Jan. 17.
That January victory was the first time the Tartans had defeated the Violets since 2003. However, the Tartans fell to the Violets last Friday 68–57.
After starting the game off strong, the Tartans’ efforts were stymied by the visiting team, who was ready to return the favor.
The win for the Violets ended their six-game losing streak, while Friday’s loss brought the Tartans’ overall record to 7–12 this season.
Carnegie Mellon matched NYU shot for shot from the field, as the Tartans made 20 of 61 field goal attempts compared to the Violets, who went 21 for 61.
Neither team was able to find much success from behind the arc, as each team made only five three-point shots in 21 attempts.
The deciding factor of the game boiled down to free- throws.
The Violets reached the free throw line 30 times in the contest and made all but nine attempts.
Carnegie Mellon only made 12 out of 16 attempts from the charity stripe.
The lack of trips to the free-throw line is attributed to execution on the offensive end of the floor.
“What we’re missing is a sense of consistency on offense. It’s finding our spots, getting open spots, and making the extra pass,” said first-year guard Gabrielle West.
Junior forward Emily Peel was once again at the forefront of Carnegie Mellon’s offensive attack. Peel scored a record 19 points on 60 percent shooting from the field, and 88 percent from the free-throw line.
Sophomore guard Jacquie Shaw, who scored 11 points, was the only other player for Carnegie Mellon in the double figures.
However, first-year guard Aspen McKeever provided a spark from the bench by hitting three three-pointers to finish the game with nine points.
“We’re working on having a balanced offensive attack from inside out,” said junior guard Tori Baggio.
The Tartans, who have done a great job rebounding this season, lost the battle of the boards 41–48. Peel and senior forward Jennifer Larsen combined for 19 total rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon has five conference games remaining in the season.
Even though the team has been defeated in the past by its remaining opponents, the Tartans are adamant that they should not be overlooked. They hope to use their tenacity to pull off some upsets against teams battling for the conference crown.
“The UAA is a difficult conference, but we are extremely confident that we can beat any team,” Peel said. “We are making a conscious effort to get better every game and every practice.”
The Tartans took on the  Brandeis University Judges yesterday at home. The Tartans topped the Judges 65–56, finally getting revenge for the previous loss the week before.
The women’s basketball team is away this weekend, but will return home on Friday, Feb. 17 to host Emory University.

This past Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team kicked off its spring season with a home match against West Virginia Wesleyan College, a Division II college. 
The Tartans continued to train in their off-season, with increased conditioning and lifting sessions. 
Their season officially started two weeks ago, and the team’s hard work paid off with a 9–0 victory. 
The Tartans came out strong against the West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats, and took the lead 3–0 after doubles. Senior Jeremy King and first-year Thomas Cooper, the No. 2 pair, had the first win with an 8–3 victory. 
The next win came from the No. 1 duo of junior Duke Miller and first-year Will Duncan, with a score of 8–5. Finishing the doubles set at a score of 8–4 was the No. 3 pair, first-years Christian Heaney-Secord and Bryce Beisswanger.
“It was a great way to start off the season,” Cooper said. “Jeremy and I played really well together.”
In singles play, Miller dominated at No. 1 singles and was first off the court with a decisive 6–1, 6–1 victory. Following shortly after Miller was Duncan, the No. 4 singles player, with 6–2 and 6–3 wins. Duncan’s match sealed the Tartans’ victory.
Junior Jooho Yu, at No. 6 singles, added a 6–1, 6–1 win and put the Tartans at a 6–0 lead over the Bobcats. Junior Harsha Rao, No. 3 singles, and King, No. 5 singles, were next off the court. Rao won his match 6–4, 6–3, while King won 6–2, 6–3.
With the Tartans leading 8–0, the last match was Heaney-Secord at No. 2 singles. Heaney-Secord was out for the duration of the Fall 2011 season with a concussion. However, he prevailed in three sets with scores of 2–6, 6–3, and 6–3 and finished the Tartans’ sweep over the Bobcats.
“I’m really happy to be back on the court and a part of the team,” Heaney-Secord said, concerning his break from last season.
“I was really impressed with the quality of our doubles for such an early season match, especially given the fact that we started four freshmen in the doubles lineup,” said head coach Andrew Girard. “Doubles success is going to be a key for us to make the NCAAs this year, so it was great to see us get off to a strong start in that area.”

Employers and students seeking full-time jobs or internship opportunities will take over the University Center this week for the annual Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC). A new networking event focusing on startup companies will also be held in the University Center next week.
This year’s EOC, which will run from noon to 6 p.m. on Wednesday, will include 190 companies with booths set up in Wiegand Gymnasium, Rangos Hall, and the McKenna/Peter/Wright rooms. The event is limited to Carnegie Mellon students and alumni of all majors.
Name tags are required for admittance. Students who register in advance on TartanTrak will have pre-printed tags ready for them at the door.
Expansion into McKenna/Peter/Wright makes the 2012 EOC noticeably larger than last year’s, which drew over 150 employers to campus. In a campuswide email last Tuesday, the Career and Professional Development Center  (CPDC) said that reduced booth fees for small businesses had contributed to the fair’s size and diversity.
“Significant discounts have been offered to organizations with 100 employees or less,” the email stated. “This has attracted an unprecedented number of startups and mid-sized organizations from various sectors, including government and nonprofit.”
In addition to this year’s EOC, the CPDC will be hosting a new event called TechSpark, an initiative to create recruiting opportunities for small startup companies. TechSpark will take place next Monday from 6 to 9 p.m. in Rangos Hall. Students must register on TartanTrak by Sunday in order to participate.
TechSpark is an interactive event that will include three main portions: a keynote address from Carnegie Mellon alumnus and entrepreneur Tony Berkman, presentations from select companies, and a general reception for networking purposes.
Unlike the EOC, there will be no booths for companies at the reception. Each company will instead have a small table, and students and alumni will be encouraged to mingle with the employers in attendance.
“We’re hoping that students won’t queue up in front of a table, but that there will be conversations amongst students, employers, and alumni,” said Wahab Owolabi, assistant director for employer development for the CPDC.
As of Saturday, 23 companies were registered to participate in TechSpark, including software development, web development, social media, and other entrepreneurship-focused companies.
Owolabi said that the companies coming in are “definitely well aware” that students attending TechSpark will not be only computer science or electrical and computer engineering majors. “It’s students who are interested in entrepreneurship, innovation, and working for a startup or an emerging company,” he said.
The new event was created largely in reaction to requests from such smaller companies, which can’t compete with larger companies at events like the EOC and the Technical Opportunities Conference, as well as requests from students. “It’s an interesting dynamic because we’ve heard from these types of companies that this was something that was needed, and we’ve heard from students that this was needed,” Owolabi said.
A résumé book will be handed out to the employers in attendance. Résumés of students who register on TartanTrak in advance will be included in the book, so students will not have to bring copies to the event.
Owolabi thinks the setup will allow for more relaxed and meaningful discussions between students, alumni, and employers. “You’re not going to be in the event like, ‘Here’s my résumé; what do you think?’ And I think that’s going to encourage some deeper conversations,” he said.
Noting that TechSpark was organized “pretty quickly,” Owolabi said that one focus of his office has been publicizing the event. TechSpark’s date was included as a line item in a CPDC email last December, with further details announced in two more emails last week. “We’re doing a big push in terms of letting students know what’s happening and who’s going to be here, and what kind of opportunity this is,” Owolabi said.
Despite the CPDC’s efforts, many students remain unaware of the event or, if they have heard of it, are unsure whether it will be useful. “I’ve heard of it and I’m going ... but I don’t think a lot of students are interested in working for startups,” said Siddhant Sethi, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major.
“I don’t know anything about [TechSpark], but I’ve heard of it,” sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Matthew Baron said. After hearing a description of the event, Baron questioned its usefulness: “I think it serves a certain purpose for certain students; however, I think a lot of CMU students are motivated enough to start their own startups, so why would they want to work for other people’s startups?”
Owolabi feels that students are interested in this type of event. He said, “You have the opportunity for companies to come in here and talk to you in a very meaningful and engaging way about what they’re doing, what they’re trying to accomplish, and how you can be a part of that — I think students are interested in that.”
Around 60 students were registered for TechSpark as of early last week, but Owolabi had high hopes for the event: “From start to finish, I would imagine anywhere between 300 to 400 students will come in and out of Rangos.”

Materials science and engineering assistant professor Chris Bettinger’s innovative approaches in designing materials for implanted medical devices have recently been recognized by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)  with an award for Initiatives in Research. Supported by Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, the award “recognizes innovative young scientists and encourages research likely to lead toward new capabilities for human benefit,” according to its website.
In addition to performing original research on biodegradable polymers for his Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Bettinger was also co-inventor on a number of patents during his time as a graduate student.
Bettinger arrived at Carnegie Mellon in August 2010 to start his own research group, and has since been developing biomedical materials whose physical properties can be altered based on exposure to stimuli such as temperature and electric fields.
Bettinger admitted serendipity as a contributing factor to the inspiration behind his work, but recognized that new ideas often come from making connections among different fields. He noted that it is very easy to get drawn into the specifics of a single problem, especially during undergraduate and graduate studies, and found that there is value to stepping back every once in a while and seeing things from a different perspective.
Whether it is something as simple as reading a new book or attending a seminar in another department, Bettinger believes that the whole process of learning something new is vital to innovation. 
“What happens at the very least is you draw parallels,” he said. “The scientific process is pretty symmetric across different disciplines — they’re different cultures, of course — but the whole process is the same, and you can use that to draw connections to other things.”
Bettinger pointed to his own academic path as an example for making interdisciplinary connections. All three of his degrees from MIT are in different areas, spanning from chemical to biomedical engineering to materials science. The jumps across many disciplines was a result of his broad range of interests. “I find that the interesting things are at the intersection [of fields],” Bettinger said.
Despite working across different departments, the common thread throughout Bettinger’s studies has been polymers. He described his interest in polymeric materials by drawing an analogy to molecular building blocks. With polymer chemistry, he explained, the real potential is in the ability to “synthesize materials from the ground up based on a material property that we’re looking for.” 
Bettinger takes a very specific approach when designing polymers in his lab; one of his research focuses is to tailor materials for endovascular devices.
For example, one of his current projects is directed toward designing a polymer that can help treat aneurysms. People with aneurysms have a weakened area in a blood vessel which, if left untreated, could fatally rupture. Current treatment methods involve injecting embolic agents that fill an aneurysm to prevent it from growing larger. However, some aneurysms can’t be treated that way due to their shape; if the opening is too wide, embolic agents will flow out of the aneurysm as soon as they’re injected into it. One way to circumvent this problem is to use a device that will narrow the opening, thereby allowing the embolic agents enough time to fill the aneurysm.
Bettinger believes that a biodegradable polymer would be suitable for such a device, and is currently designing a material that would be flexible enough for this purpose.
In addition to addressing clinical problems with specially designed polymers, Bettinger’s research group also designs materials for answering some fundamental questions about biology, such as how the human body recognizes implanted devices or how cells detect and respond to surface structures.
One polymer currently under design has the ability to alter its texture based on exposure to light, and will be used to discover how cells respond to changes in surface topography. By knowing how cells interface with materials, it becomes possible to design materials for applications such as therapeutic cellular stimulation.
Whether fundamental or applied, Bettinger’s research seeks to overcome problems with existing materials and make advances in implantable medical devices.

Pedro Moreno, a research scientist at Google and a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, spoke in the Giant Eagle Auditorium last Friday about Google’s current efforts in building speech recognition systems for the top 300 languages on the planet. The project, called “The Speech Internationalization Project,” allows users to give verbal requests to their phones in any language. The textual transcription of the spoken words is used to fulfill the request. 
Moreno obtained his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon in 1996. His thesis, titled “Speech Recognition in Noisy Environments,” proved to be only the first step in his career. After working as a research scientist at HP Labs, Moreno joined Google seven years ago. He currently leads the global speech engineering group in Google’s Android division in New York. His team is in charge of creating speech recognition services in as many languages as possible. 
The development of this speech recognition technology, Moreno explained, has three phases. The first phase involves collecting spoken words for a particular language. To do this, Google employees collect thousands of queries that people type into Google’s search engine and record them being read aloud. These pieces of audio are paired with the textual transcriptions and placed in the Google servers. These audio and text queries represent the training data that the speech recognition technology will use to improve its performance. In the last two years, Google has been able to create training data for as many as 50 languages. 
The next phase is producing acoustic models — mapping each phoneme to how the audio sounds — and producing language models that review the text and create a mechanism that predicts how likely it is that a certain word will appear after a particular sequence of words. Spoken language gradually changes over time, and in order to account for this, the acoustic and language models have to be updated regularly with new spoken queries representing new training data.
The final stage is the formation of the lexicons — how each word in a language is expressed as a sequence of phonemes.
One of the valuable lessons that Moreno learned in the development of the project was that, when faced with a problem in a specific language, the solution should be as general and holistic as possible, so it can be applied to the speech recognition of other languages. 
Presently, users of the system collectively speak about 55,000 hours worth of queries each day, and 40 percent of those users are outside of the U.S., showing that “The Speech Internationalization Project” is becoming popular around the world. 
Thirty-five languages and dialects have been launched (including Latin and Pig-Latin), and 10 more languages are in pre-production.
The speech team at Google is also trying to work out issues in dealing with multilinguality in countries. When there are many different languages used within a single country, issues arise with how to create new recognition systems for similar languages. Capturing the lexicons of those languages becomes difficult.
Despite the challenges of the project, it has continued to advance. As Moreno put it, why create speech recognizers for three languages “when you can do that for 300 with the same effort?”

Planet or no planet? That is the question
Fomalhaut b, one of the first planets outside the solar system to be discovered through direct imaging, is under debate; scientists are beginning to question whether or not it is actually a planet.
The so-called planet does not exhibit light in the infrared range, even though a planet visible through a telescope should be hot enough to emit infrared light. Second, Fomalhaut b’s brightness decreased by half within two years, interpreted as having lost half of its mass.
Paul Kalas, the planet’s discoverer, argued that it may have a large dust ring in orbit that reflects light while still having a mass too low to emit enough detectable infrared light. Markus Janson, who conducted the follow-up experiments, argued that the detected object may be the result of asteroid collisions producing an expanding cloud of light-reflecting dust instead of condensing into a planet.

Cheaper catalyst developed for cheaper goods
Researchers at Princeton University developed an iron-based catalyst for the silylation of organic compounds. Silylation is a widely used procedure for the production of complex compounds, such as adhesives and pharmaceuticals. Industrial catalysts in past decades have been restricted to high-cost precious metals like platinum instead of cheap metals like iron.
While catalysts are not destroyed during chemical reactions, they can still be lost in chemical production on industrial scales. For example, an estimated 5.6 metric tons of platinum was used by the silicone industry and could not be recovered for future use. In addition to its low cost, the new iron catalyst may also increase the purity of products.

Genetic damage in chemotherapy patients’ children
It is not uncommon for cancer survivors to have children, especially with ongoing improvements in chemotherapy. However, cancer patients’ medications may lead to damaged DNA and increased rates of cancer in their children.
Researchers at the University of Leicester in England measured the mutation rates of mice exposed to common chemotherapy agents at an equivalent dosage used for human therapy. They measured for mutations in the sperm of males who were treated and untreated with chemotherapy, as well as in their offspring. Extensive genome-wide damage was found and, for one drug, as many as three times the normal number of mutations were found in the offspring.

Female leadership impacts gender gap and women’s roles
The Indian government set aside leadership positions for women in a number of rural villages in 1993. Collaborating researchers in several top universities have found that these leadership positions have had tremendous impacts on the gender gap and the roles of women in these societies. 
Aspirations were measured with questions pertaining to desire for early marriage, future education, and high-skill jobs. Parents’ aspirations increased 20 percent and children of both genders had a 32 percent increase in aspirations. These changes occurred in addition to an increase in favorability of female leaders. Since increases in favorability occurred alongside the increases in aspirations, researchers suggest that the increase in aspirations reflects the power of role models in society.

Facebook to sell stock publicly, $10 billion expected
Last Wednesday, Facebook filed for an IPO that would allow the company to sell stock publicly. The company is expected to face a flood of prospective buyers and raise almost $10 billion. The announcement was followed by expectations that Facebook users will also benefit in some way from the company going public. 
Many expect Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO and co-founder, to uphold honorable business practices while engaging with Wall Street. Facebook makes its revenue in part from the advertisement opportunities it offers businesses, but it also makes more by developing new technologies. The company spent $388 million last year in research and development, and will likely continue to devote itself to new technologies in the future.

Texas town must have water delivered
The ongoing Texas drought has forced the central Texas community of Spicewood Beach to have its drinking water delivered from out of town. Since last Monday, the water has been delivered several times a day by a 4,000-gallon- capacity truck. 
State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon explained that the drought started over one year ago, and the state received just 15 inches of rain last year, far below the average of 28 inches. The Spicewood Beach community water well is just one of 13 public water systems in the state that are expected to completely run out of water in the next six months.

The School of Drama may seem exclusive to non-majors, but spend five minutes in the sprawling, sensory world of Playground Festival and you realize just how open it is. Playground is a free, creative environment for drama students to explore other mediums for their art and showcase their independent works.
This year marked the ninth annual Playground Festival, which ran from last Thursday through Saturday in the Purnell Center for the Arts. Playground is a massive event that transforms all of Purnell into a spectacular fantasy world, with experimental installations and performances happening all day.
Playground provides students with an opportunity to push themselves and work on interdisciplinary projects. “It’s a sectioned-out time of the year when [drama students] don’t have to worry about classes — because all [drama] classes are canceled — and they can just focus on creating new work, work that they’re interested in,” said sophomore directing major Cameron Margeson.
Playground is one of the highlights of the year for many drama students, and they start thinking about their Playground pieces months in advance. In October, they pitch their ideas and begin writing scripts. Actual rehearsals don’t begin until the Sunday before Playground, however, so students only have three days to prepare.
One of the largest learning components of Playground is the tight time constraint. “You have three days to create anywhere from a 15-minute to 45-minute piece, so you have to learn what’s necessary in order to create something,” Margeson said. “You learn new techniques when you’re so pressed to create something.... You have to sort of work outside of your own habits to get things done.”
While students have just a few days to put together their pieces, their enthusiasm often turns their pieces into extended projects; many continue working on their pieces throughout the festival.
First-year drama student Will Gossett created an installation piece titled “Volumetric Display” for his first Playground this year. Gossett’s piece is a media installation that projects three-dimensional and moving images in its display area — which is made of carefully arranged, clear, vertical strings. Moreover, “Volumetric Display” runs on open source software. “I’m in the process of writing my own content to add to this loop of different shows,” Gossett said on Thursday night. “It took so long to get [the structure] built that I didn’t have time to get that [coding] done before the opening, but tonight I’m going to work on it more.”
Senior directing major Miranda Steege was this year’s installation curator and was in charge of coordinating the installation works with the Playground Festival Committee. “Installations are a great way to do something you don’t normally do,” Steege said.” Because that’s not at all what most of our classwork is like, so it’s sort of a chance to push beyond what we do in class.”
This sentiment seems to be a recurring theme in Playground: It’s a chance for students to push themselves out of their comfort zones and challenge themselves with work they don’t usually have the opportunity to do.
Students took advantage of this opportunity, resulting in a wide range of performances and installations from dance and comedy shows to fully immersive, sensory experience installations and murals.
“It’s absolutely about people challenging themselves,” said Priscila Garcia, a sophomore directing major. “You go back and you realize the things you’ve learned in your semesters at Carnegie Mellon ... and then you try and see how you can incorporate those with things you already really know. It’s an experiment. It either works or it doesn’t, and that’s that.”
The Playground environment is very open to these experiments, however, and it’s all about pushing yourself and trying something new. “I think it’s a very constructive environment,” Garcia said. “It’s just when students are lazy that people become very judgmental, which I think is fair.”
Margeson also praised the festival’s ability to open up creative opportunities for drama students: “We don’t always get to study things that are outside of our option. So Playground is a time when a designer can direct and an actor can design and a director can write. If there’s anything you want to do that you’re not getting from classes, Playground is when you do it.”
While Playground is an incredibly open environment for drama students, it’s not publicized to the campus community and is almost exclusively attended by drama students, drama professors, close friends, and family. “I think we need to settle into it as a community here in Purnell before it can expand elsewhere,” Garcia said. “I do think there’s a reason for that — I think all of us as students want to see each other’s pieces and there really just isn’t space for larger audiences.”
With a limited supply and a huge demand, tickets for the performances are hard to come by. All tickets are free and made available the day of the performance. Some reservations can be made by faculty and drama students, but for the most part, anyone who wants a ticket has to wait in line for a couple of hours before the show. “Tickets are like gold” was a common phrase uttered by drama students throughout the weekend.
Playground is a festival by drama students, for drama students. Despite the event’s somewhat exclusive nature, Playground creates an open and inviting opportunity for drama students to express themselves and experiment with new mediums.
Summing up the goals of Playground, Margeson said, “It’s not so much to show off the work that you want to do, but it’s a time to really stretch yourself.”

Before he even opens his mouth, John Fetterman — the mayor of Braddock, Pa. — is immediately interesting. At 6'8'' tall, with expansive shoulders, a shaved head, goatee, and tattoos running up both arms, the Harvard graduate looks more like a professional wrestler than a politician — a fact he joked about during a presentation he gave Friday evening in McConomy Auditorium.
Sponsored by AB Lectures, Fetterman’s presentation was followed by an appearance from Caledonia Curry, a street artist known as Swoon. Swoon is invested in the ongoing urban development project, Transformazium, which is being instituted in Braddock.
“In a weird way, we wouldn’t be sitting here right now if it wasn’t for Braddock,” Fetterman began, introducing the audience to his town with a series of media slides and pictures. In the last several decades, de-industrialization has transformed the once-prosperous town of 20,000 into a Rust Belt ghost town of less than 3,000. Plagued by severe economic hardship, nearly every business has fled, leaving the buildings to crumble and violence to stake its domain.
“We’ve lost 90 percent of our population. Ninety percent of our buildings and businesses are gone — we are the poorest community in Allegheny County,” Fetterman said, with an air that communicated his resolution to face the town’s problems head on.
But then the mood of his presentation shifted. A bright picture of smiling youth who had taken part in Braddock’s summer program filled the projection screen and the mayor began to speak about the revitalization currently taking place in his community.
The re-purposing of abandoned structures, including the conversion of the town’s First Presbyterian Church into a community center; the creation of an urban garden on a previously vacant lot; and the installation of a 3,000-square-foot playground in place of the dilapidated remains of a JC Penney are among the improvements made since Fetterman took office in 2005.
The mayor, whose dedication to his community is evidenced by the tattoos on his forearms — on one arm the community zip code, and the dates of the five homicides that have taken place in Braddock since he took office on the other — has gone as far as to contribute his own money to the revitalization effort.
“I’m the guy with the best job in the country,” Fetterman said. “I love what I do, but make no mistake, it’s hard.”
In a more recent effort, the town paired up with Levi Strauss Jeans for an advertising campaign that was filmed in Braddock, featuring actual Braddock inhabitants, pumping more than $1 million into the community.
Perhaps the most interesting revitalization approach taken by Fetterman has been through art. “Artists see value in circumstances that other people don’t,” he said.
For this reason, artists like Swoon have started to play an active role in rebuilding Braddock through the Transformazium project. Swoon said that she sees art as serving a very important purpose in communities, and was attracted to Braddock because of her interest in urban farming. The street artist, whose diverse projects range from the construction of weather-resistant earth-bag domes in Haiti to the building of rafts made from New York City trash that she then rode down the Mississippi River, called Braddock a “microcosm of our country.”
Along with other artists and activists, Swoon has turned her efforts to converting Braddock’s abandoned United Brethren Church into an arts-based community center, furthering Fetterman’s art-focused community building efforts.
Carnegie Mellon students with interests ranging from public policy to the arts attended the lecture, and many of them were already aware of the work being done by Swoon and Fetterman.
“I came because I’m a huge fan of Swoon’s artwork and I’m also interested in what’s going on in Braddock,” said Christina Lee, a sophomore art major.
Sophomore in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences Celine Berger became familiar with Swoon through the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art’s Art in the Streets show. “I’m really interested in urban redevelopment and street art. I found out about Braddock from the Levi’s Jeans commercials,” she said.

Unbeknownst to many, Pittsburgh has a vibrant independent comics scene. With over seven comics shops and the ToonSeum, a museum wholly dedicated to animation and comics, Pittsburgh is home to a lot of comics aficionados. With homegrown comics anthologies like Andromeda and Unicorn Mountain alongside comics giants like Jim Rugg, Frank Santoro, and Tom Scioli, there’s a lot of ink hitting the page in this city.
In the midst of this community is Ed Piskor. A workhorse of a cartoonist, Piskor has made great strides in the world of professional comics over the past seven years and has opened up this medium for storytelling. Piskor’s comics tell a range of stories, from the passions and politics of hackers to reflections on life in Cleveland to the borderline biblical history of hip-hop culture.
Piskor was born in the city of Homestead, Pa. in 1982. Piskor said that money was tight growing up, but pencils and paper were easy to come by. Determined to pursue a future in comics after high school, he made his way to the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, where he studied the ins and outs of comics creation.
He has been a professional cartoonist since 2005, having entered the world of publication by collaborating as an illustrator with comic book writer Harvey Pekar for his American Splendor comics. Their collaboration continued as they worked on two subsequent graphic novels: Macedonia, the story about the travels of a peace activist, and The Beats, the story of the generation that opposed mainstream American conformity and conservatism.
After the collaborative work, Piskor began to focus more on working solo — writing, penciling, lettering, and inking his comics himself. As a cartoonist, Piskor has found a writing style that appeals to unique audiences. His recent works include_ Brain Rot_ and Wizzywig, which is the story of Kevin “Boingthump” Phenicle, a young prodigy who becomes fascinated with social engineering, phone phreaking, and computer hacking. Piskor has engaged audiences outside of comics’ traditional demographic by writing about these unusual topics and using the internet to expand his fan base.
While Piskor was creating Wizzywig, he would regularly post the story online for fans to read. The work caught on with technophiles; Piskor was suddenly invited to technology conventions like The Next HOPE (a Hackers on Planet Earth convention) and was given the opportunity to speak at hackerspaces.
More recently, the “Hip Hop Family Tree” segment of the Brain Rot series has been developing a highly interactive online fan base. Little-known figures in the history of hip-hop culture, like DJ Disco Wiz, have been getting in touch with Piskor via Facebook and responding to his historical depictions of the 1970s hip-hop world. When asked about the purpose of the “Hip Hop Family Tree,” which traces the history of hip-hop culture, Piskor laughed and explained that this sprawling project is just an excuse to put the family tree flowchart together.
“If you really get into the old records and the music from the beginning,” Piskor said, “throughout the years you can draw these very clear lines between each generation. It is almost like the Bible. Grandmaster Flash begat Grandmaster Melle Mel, Kool Herc begat DJ Disco Wiz ... and so on.”
Piskor is often asked what kind of research he does for his historical stories. He responds seriously that “to say ‘research’ makes the work seem like a homework assignment.” As he sees it, he has been building on his memory bank of knowledge since he was a kid. If he has to delve further than his own knowledge in order to fully tell a story, he never sees it as researching but rather as “reading for pleasure.”
To keep himself drawing, he incorporates his passions into his current projects, personal or professional. For example, when he became curious about the worlds of verboten information, hacking, and breaking systems, he wanted to delve deep into them so as to understand the nuts and bolts. In order to justify the time and energy needed to reach this level of comprehension, he made Wizzywig, a 300-page comic. “I feel like a slacker if I’m not working constantly,” he said.
Although his approaches to the creative process might seem extreme and obsessive, Piskor’s tireless work in communicating his learnings through comics provide his readers with portals into curious worlds.

Last weekend at Heinz Hall, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) performed Antonin Dvorák’s Biblical Songs and Johannes Brahms’ A German Requiem as part of its Music for the Spirit concert series. The program, which offers two concerts per season, presents music that is meant to “spread a spiritual and universal message,” according to the PSO’s website.
Although Friday night’s program consisted of two works featuring verse from the Bible, Christianity only served as the lens through which the featured composers explored the ideas of life, death, and resurrection. Both composers picked scripture in their native languages (Czech for the Dvorák piece and German for the Brahms piece) that does not dwell in fear and mourning, but rather in celebration and fond remembrance of those who have passed.
The program opened with Dvorák’s Biblical Songs, which were written after the deaths of his two friends, fellow composers Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Hans von Bülow. Internationally renowned baritone Thomas Hampson sang with assurance, and his voice carried effortlessly over the orchestra. His clear diction and tone served the difficulty of the Czech language very well. The PSO, under the baton of artistic director Manfred Honeck, accompanied Hampson beautifully. The orchestra delivered the traditional Czech music within Dvorák’s composition without grandeur, acknowledging the timeless beauty inherent in a simple folk dance.
The highlight of the program, however, was Brahms’ Requiem. The Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh and soprano soloist Chen Reiss joined the symphony, Honeck, and Hampson for this hour-long masterwork. Brahms wrote the piece while mourning the loss of his mother, as well as that of his mentor and dear friend Robert Schumann.
Brahms’ conception of the work was unique in that he avoided the traditional Latin text for his requiem — thus the title A German Requiem. He also refrained from using the standard requiem text; instead, he selected passages from the German Luther Bible that are meant to offer comfort to those in mourning, making this a requiem not for the dead, but for the living.
The composition is a personal one, and the music is distinctly Brahmsian: The polyphonic texture is thick and layered, and the music is deeply affecting and unsettling.
The Brahms piece required much more from the orchestra than did the Dvorák, and the PSO did a wonderful job of supporting the chorus without overpowering it. Although there were a few moments when the chorus and orchestra did not seem to be on the same page, Honeck was quick to reel them in and continue, hardly missing a beat.
Hampson shined in Requiem, especially in the sixth movement, singing with stunning gravity not heard in Dvorák’s Biblical Songs. Reiss’ solo spanned a wide emotional range: sublime and sweet one moment, fierce and dramatic the next. The interplay among the orchestra, choir, and soloists was incredibly warm and well balanced, producing a seamless and organic performance.

The last paradigm shift for the band of Montreal was signaled by the release of Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? in 2007. The album abandoned the escapist neo-psychedelia that had defined of Montreal’s early work in favor of deeply personal songs revolving around lead singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Kevin Barnes’ separation from his wife. These songs explore the less glamorous aspects of human consciousness.
Hissing Fauna also introduced Georgie Fruit — Barnes’ 40-year-old, African-American, transsexual, funk-playing alter-ego — who dominated the latter half of the album and all of the band’s next two albums.
Under Fruit’s musical guidance, of Montreal’s music morphed into a mesh of R&B, cock rock, funk, and pop loaded with self-deprecating hedonistic fantasies that would make Prince blush. While this shift toward hypersexuality was somewhat refreshing in 2007 — when indie bands were polite, prudish, and doe-eyed — times have changed.
In the past five years, indie has grown to be edgier and more rebellious, and the shock value that accompanied of Montreal’s sexy and self-examining musical style has dissipated. But when False Priest was released in 2009, it was clear that Barnes was still strongly attached to the idea of his alter-ego.
Paralytic Stalks, the group’s newest album, was a crossroads for the indie veterans: Would they continue making gimmicky shock music or would they evolve into a band that could distinguish itself in the growing indie community?
Upon listening to Paralytic Stalks, of Montreal’s decision is resoundingly clear: Fruit is dead. The opening track, “Gelid Ascent,” reconfigures expectations with expansive space-rock drenched in an aura of sinister dread. The songs “Spiteful Intervention” and “Wintered Death” both feature arrangements reminiscent of the classically influenced infancy of progressive rock while “Ye, Renew the Plaintiff” begins with the bright, funk-tinged sound of Skeletal Lamping and False Priest before falling into more psychedelic guitar-centered rock.
While it is sometimes difficult to determine the influences of the band’s new sound, it is clear that the group has not lost its sense of musical versatility, nor the preternatural darkness that emerged in Hissing Fauna.
The biggest development on Paralytic Stalks, however, is of Montreal’s newfound fondness for sonic manipulation. The group does not manipulate sound the same way that post-punk and psychedelic rock did by making use of space, but rather by incorporating seemingly random spurts of noise and chopped up samples.
This is most salient on “Exorcismic Breeding Knife” and “Authentic Pyrrhic Remission,” which both feature extended sections of cacophonous noise. If Hissing Fauna was the moment at which of Montreal emerged from the naïve innocence of childhood, then Paralytic Stalks signals the band’s entry into adulthood: It is focused, jaded, ambitious, yet experienced enough to know that there is such a thing as too much sex.
Paralytic Stalks will be released on Tuesday.

Pregnancy, incest, suicide, and rape — every controversial issue was included in the Pittsburgh Musical Theater’s (PMT) performance of Spring Awakening this past Friday at the Byham theater. Spring Awakening is the musical adaptation of a banned 1891 German play, featuring a chilling folk-infused, alternative rock score by composer Duncan Sheik.
The plot focuses on a group of disquieted teenagers living in a small town in Victorian Germany. As the characters’ sexual feelings begin to stir, they find themselves fighting their tyrannous adult superiors and the rigid, conservative belief system of their society. The play — which deals with emerging sexual desires, loss of virginity, homosexuality, teen suicide, botched abortion, masturbation, child abuse, shame, and death — won eight Tony Awards (including Best Musical) after its original Broadway debut in 2006.
Although Spring Awakening is a dark and emotionally demanding show, PMT’s mostly college-aged cast gave a Broadway-caliber performance. Kathlene Queen, a PMT veteran, began the show as Wendla, singing the haunting opening number that pulled the audience in and set the tone for the rest of the show. Logan Williams, a senior at Robert Morris University, played the strong-willed, rebellious Melchior and, hitting each note decisively, had perhaps the most memorable voice of the evening.
As the lead roles, Queen and Williams had remarkable chemistry together. They brought a sense of urgency and honesty to their fragile relationship on stage as two sheltered and confused teenagers in love. This chemistry was demonstrated during the love-making scene at the end of Act I, the most important and powerful scene of the show. The scene is very explicit: Both actors showed some skin and pretended to have sex on stage, and the audience watched as Williams’ character simulated acts of sexual foreplay before he and Wendla made love. Although this scene definitely has the potential to be awkward on stage, Williams and Queen delivered a realistic, raw, and moving performance.
Jameson Corrie played Moritz Stiefel, Melchior’s troubled best friend who struggles with school. In addition to adding some comedy to this otherwise serious production, Corrie did a great job performing the unique choreography of Spring Awakening. During “The Bitch of Living,” a song about boys’ anguish in suppressing their sexual desires, Corrie and the other schoolboys jumped around stage haphazardly, stomping their feet and rocking air guitars.
Another outstanding performance was accomplished by Adrianne Knapp, who played Ilse. She is a societal outcast who ran away from home because her father beat her, only to run into the arms of another abusive man from a Bohemian colony.
Although the majority of the cast was composed of adolescents, two adults were responsible for playing all of the adult roles — including parents, teachers, and the clergy — to symbolically demonstrate the adults as formulaic and identical. Barbara Burgess-Lefebvre, a Robert Morris University theater professor, took on all of the female adult roles, while Brady Patsy, who teaches at PMT’s Richard E. Rauh Conservatory, played the male adults. Both did a terrific job of demonstrating the struggle between youth and adults in society.
PMT’s production of Spring Awakening stood out with its simple and personal style. The show was performed on a rectangular platform with no set or props other than an arrangement of wooden chairs, which were moved around and set up by the cast members themselves. Instead of a traditional orchestra, Spring Awakening boasted a rock band that played onstage behind the platform. The band was led by music director Tim Marquette, and it kept audience members tapping their toes for the entire show. But perhaps the most innovative aspect of Spring Awakening is that there were actually limited seats on the stage, allowing audience members to be a part of the show and experience the story in a whole new way.
When the curtain was drawn, Spring Awakening opened its audience to a world everybody knows. Whether you are currently an adolescent or an adult reminiscing on your past, you will connect with the honest, heartfelt characters fumbling on stage in attempts to find love and a good life. Although Spring Awakening is filled with comical and lighthearted scenes, the show ultimately forces the audience to face a myriad of challenges present in society today.
Most importantly, the production daringly compares our modern society to Puritanical 19th-century Germany, compelling us to be aware of the troubles that continue to haunt our world.
Spring Awakening is a musical everyone should see, and PMT offered an impressive production of the show. The show does contain strong language and explicit content. However, if that notion bothers you, it is perhaps all the more reason to go see it.

When one thinks of the noir genre, it’s usually in the context of cinema. Black and white film, dramatic close shots, and a lone man walking away in the rain come to mind. Akashic Books breaks away from this medium, however, with its series of noir short story collections, each set in a specific city. One of the latest installments in this series is Pittsburgh Noir, a collection of short, Pittsburgh-based noir stories that showcases the darker side of fictional ’Burgh residents.
While many people might think that noir only consists of brooding private detectives dealing with mysterious female clients, the genre is actually a bit more varied than that. Film noir usually includes alienated, morally ambiguous heroes; crime; and a pessimistic outlook, with its characters often placed in unwanted, doomed situations. The 14 contributing authors to Pittsburgh Noir have taken the characteristics of this classic film genre and applied them, with varying degrees of success, to the short story medium.
These stories take the reader through every nook and cranny of Pittsburgh, from the suburbs of Fox Chapel to the bars in South Side to a houseboat on the Allegheny River. There’s something comfortable about reading stories solely set in Pittsburgh — there is a rush of familiarity and associations when the stories mention a place you see or go to all too often, like the apartment on North Craig Street mentioned in Kathleen George’s “Intruder,” or Pamela’s Diner in Squirrel Hill, at which the narrator eats in Aubrey Hirsch’s “Cheater.” Of course, some of that comfort is reduced when that familiar location serves as the setting for a grisly murder.
As one would expect from the noir genre, there are plenty of murders, but every writer interprets those murders differently: Carnegie Mellon professor Terrance Hayes delivers a poetic, introspective reflection upon a murder in East Liberty in his story “Still Air,” while Carnegie Mellon professor Hilary Masters’ “At the Buena Vista” gives a humorous, conversational account of a middle-aged man who is after the fortune of one of his relatives.
Several of the stories stray rather far from noir conventions, which detracts from the book’s overall impact as a noir collection. Carlos Antonio Delgado’s “Far Beneath,” for instance, is a beautifully written — yet disturbing — story from the perspective of a nine-year-old boy who begins exploring sexuality with his brother. Despite the author’s great style, the subject matter doesn’t seem to relate much to noir. Similarly, “Homecoming” by Kathryn Miller Haines gives an account of a World War II soldier coming home to his cheating wife, and the story doesn’t have any identifiable noir characteristics. These stories, while well-written, distract from the book’s focus on the noir genre.
Thankfully, the majority of the stories in the collection remain on point, like Lila Shaara’s ghostly “Atom Smasher,” whose twist ending is guaranteed to surprise. George’s “Intruder” also provides a fresh perspective on the classic crime mystery, complete with a full cast of interesting characters and a modern take on the quintessential femme fatale.

Dear Patrick,
I don’t have a lot of facial hair. All of my friends make fun of me for it, asking when I’m going to go through puberty and if I have alopecia. It’s getting pretty tiresome. How can I get more facial hair?
Thanks,
Shaving Attempts Lacking, Virtually Obsolete
Dear SALVO,
Sadly, you have not gotten the “Gift of the Beard.” It is nothing to be ashamed of. So what if you have less testosterone than other guys? That doesn’t necessarily mean you’re less of a man. So what if you’re not allowed near playgrounds during No-Shave November? A thin, stringy moustache doesn’t make you a creep — it just makes you look like one. 
In fact, beards can be a curse. You wake up every morning looking like a lumberjack. You shave, but five minutes later you’re covered in stubble. You forget to shave a couple days before Halloween, and everyone thinks you’re going as Teen Wolf. It’s a burden. If you must persist in your quest, then you should know there’s no real way (short of gluing hair to your face) to get a beard. Accept it for now, and maybe in a few years you’ll be capable of growing one. Unless your dad can’t either: Then you’re out of luck.
You’ll shave a bundle on razors,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My friend got hit by a car the other day. She’s fine; she has a bruise on her hip, but that’s about it. She was walking across Forbes and got tapped. Is there anything I can do to help her in her hour of need?
Thanks,
Sore Pal Easily Endangered, Delicately Bumped, Usually More Prudent
Dear SPEEDBUMP,
I’m glad to hear your friend’s okay. It’s times like these when we have to remember that jaywalking is a crime for a reason. Your friend is a criminal. Though, admittedly, drivers in Pittsburgh are terrible, which is why pedestrians have to be extra careful. Pittsburghers tend to ignore things like red lights, crosswalks, and turn signals.
When crossing the street, remember these three easy steps: stop, look, and listen. Your friend must have missed that day of first grade, so the best thing you could get her would be an e-card with those tips on it. Perhaps cross-stitch them a kitschy-yet-helpful household knickknack. Try buying her a bright orange vest with reflectors. It’s safe and fashionable! Being hit by a car is no joke, so you definitely shouldn’t make jokes about it to her. She could have been seriously hurt!
Or buy her Bengay,
Patrick Hoskins

Around this time last year, Mirko Azis and I explained in this very column why minimal music is the richest, most compelling form of music. If you read the article, I’m sure you were convinced that we were, in fact, correct, and thus immediately made Gestalt psychology the primary force in your life. For this, dear reader, I raise my glass to you in congratulations.
A year later, I’m here to tell you that while minimal music is the pinnacle of clear, succinct, and meticulously crafted music, there are other types of music that I enjoy.
As a society, we often forget the importance of a little variety in our lives. It changes our routines. It adds that extra element of surprise and wonder. And, most importantly, it’s not perfectly minimal. There are so many wonderfully fantastic things out there, so why should we discard everything but the essential? My writing partner from last year may not agree entirely, but I’m here to tell you that there is no good reason why you only need to listen to one or two types of music.
Have you ever heard the sounds of the ever-so-free jazz composer Sun Ra or the American blues shouter music of Wynonie Harris? How about the rhymes of the lyrically talented hip-hop group Jurassic 5?
My point is simple: Regardless of genre, there are so many great artists and musicians out there to discover.
Fortunately, WRCT makes it easy for you. From Feb. 10 at noon until Feb. 12 at midnight, WRCT will broadcast half-hour segments of music, each dedicated to one particular artist or band. In addition to this, I highly recommend looking into websites like last.fm that track all of the music you consume and allow you to see what your friends are listening to. I sometimes spend hours listening to my friend’s libraries and, through this, my obsession with minimal music is slowly dwindling.

The Ides of March
8 10 12
Is Ryan Gosling becoming anyone else’s favorite actor? The star of three critically acclaimed films this year (Drive; Crazy, Stupid, Love; and The Ides of March), Gosling brings a quiet intensity to every role he plays. In this film, Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, the deputy campaign manager for presidential hopeful Mike Morris (George Clooney). The movie takes you behind the scenes of the primaries, with plenty of intrigue and string pulling to go around. Its release during the current primary season is no accident.
Real Steel
7:30 10 12:30
This movie can be summed up as an adult version of “Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots.” Real Steel tells of a future in which human boxers have been replaced with robot boxers. While this could have been an awesome lead for a story of a robot that breaks free from its programming and starts a war against humanity, the robots just beat each other up the entire movie. Hugh Jackman is the protagonist as a robot owner trying to make it big in the boxing world. While not quite “Rocky with Robots,” as some reviews have stated, this is a well-made film with a bonafide action star.
American Beauty
7:30 10 12:30
American Beauty is, on the surface, a very basic movie. It follows a suburban family consisting of a slightly depressed father, a materialistic wife with monogamy issues, and a daughter looking to explore her sexual side. However, this film is so much more than that. It is about seeing beauty in the world and being happy with the knowledge that you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Oscar-winner for “Best Picture” and “Best Director” in 2000, American Beauty is extraordinarily written — a classic of American cinema. 
[BOLD]Paranormal Activity 3[BOLD]
8 10 12
Possibly the strangest film choice to follow up the first three movies this week, Paranormal Activity 3 is the prequel to the original box-office hit. Set 18 years prior to the first movie, this one also revolves around a husband and wife whose children befriend an invisible entity living in their home. Terrifying, right? The movie is shot in the same homemade footage style as the previous two and, while it may seem like it has been overdone, there’s not much out there that can give genuine, realistic scares like this franchise. Fun Fact: Made on a budget of just $5 million, the flick has grossed over $200 million worldwide.

Jeffrey Zaslow died on Friday at the age of 53 from injuries he suffered in a car crash in northern Michigan. Zaslow was a Wall Street Journal columnist, best-selling author of The Last Lecture, and Carnegie Mellon alumnus (HS'80). While on campus he was a member of fraternity Pi Lambda Phi and editor-in-chief of The Tartan.
The Last Lecture was co-authored by Zaslow and Randy Pausch, the late Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and co-founder of the Entertainment Technology Center. Pausch gained recognition for his motivational lecture, "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams," in which he addressed a packed McConomy Auditorium on his unique life and his optimistic attitude on living with pancreatic cancer. The book spent more than a year on bestseller lists and has been translated into 48 languages.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Zaslow lost control of his car while driving on a snowy road and collided with a truck. He is survived by his wife Sherry Margolis, a television news anchor in Detroit, and by their three daughters, Jordan, Alex, and Eden. 
Other famous works by Zaslow include Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, co-written with Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, who famously landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River on Jan. 15, 2009. The book debuted at the third spot on The New York Times bestsellers list. In 2011, Zaslow collaborated with veteran astronaut Mark Kelly and his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, on their memoir, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope. The book was excerpted as a People magazine cover story, and debuted fifth on The New York Times bestsellers list. Zaslow's last book, The Magic Room, was released last month.

Commerce Secretary John Bryson spoke at Carnegie Mellon last Wednesday. Video provided by Carnegie Mellon University.
In a visit that reinforced the themes of President Barack Obama’s recent State of the Union address, U.S. Secretary of Commerce John Bryson spoke in the Gates Center last Wednesday morning to a room of about 60 invited guests. Bryson’s remarks focused on innovation in manufacturing and restoring America’s manufacturing competitiveness in the world economy.
Much of Bryson’s time was spent describing his goals as commerce secretary. He stressed that, to get results, “you prioritize and prioritize ruthlessly ... you have to be very focused.” 
Bryson laid out his three top priorities: advanced manufacturing, exporting, and encouraging investment in the U.S. These three categories are complementary. 
Bryson said that the U.S. must enforce trade rules in other countries. “When American businesses compete on a level playing field, American businesses almost always win.” 
Entrepreneurship was a central theme of Bryson’s visit. “One of our special traits as Americans that really is in contrast to substantially all the advanced ... countries elsewhere in the world is the extent to which we are entrepreneurs,” he said. “We break the norm and find ways to get to new places, new technologies, new things to be done.” 
Although Bryson’s remarks were the focus of Wednesday’s event, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Carnegie Mellon Vice President for Research Rick McCullough also spoke about the economic opportunities available in Pittsburgh. McCullough highlighted the university’s success in commercializing research projects, calling the Gates Center an “innovation engine.”
“Every day our students and faculty are creating new innovations here that lead to new jobs,” McCullough said. According to the university, Carnegie Mellon faculty and students start 15–20 new companies every year.
The event included a panel of three Pittsburgh entrepreneurs who spoke about their experiences creating and supporting small businesses in western Pennsylvania.
Among the panelists was Scott Pearson, the CEO of Aquion Energy, whose headquarters Bryson had toured earlier Wednesday morning. Aquion Energy is a Carnegie Mellon spinoff that is commercializing battery technology based on research by Jay Whitacre, an assistant professor of engineering and public policy as well as materials science and engineering.
The other panelists were Rich Lunak — president and CEO of Innovation Works, a startup incubator — and Lalit Chordia, the president and founder of Thar Technologies, Inc., which develops supercritical fluid technology.
Bryson’s visit to Carnegie Mellon was part of a larger trip to Pittsburgh. In addition to his time at the university and his visit to Aquion Energy, Bryson met with members of the Pittsburgh District Export Council and other Department of Commerce representatives in the area. 
“A lot of times a Carnegie Mellon visit will be part of a bigger plan and agenda to bring someone to the region,” said Tim McNulty, Carnegie Mellon’s associate vice president for government relations. 
“That was the case with Secretary Bryson. He was in Pittsburgh focusing on manufacturing and focusing on export development.... The Carnegie Mellon component was added to the agenda,” McNulty said.
Although Bryson’s visit is the first in 2012 by a prominent government official, several more are likely to come. In 2008, the last presidential election year, “we were one of the few, if not the only, campus to have both major presidential candidates give a policy address — not just rallies, but policy addresses on campus,” McNulty said. 
The Office of Government Relations has invitations open to all the Republican candidates for the 2012 nomination to come to campus. 
The last few years have “been a great period for having high-profile public visitors,” McNulty said. “That’s all driven by the faculty and the students.”

Computing Services gave Carnegie Mellon’s webmail a new look over winter break. When students and faculty logged into their SquirrelMail accounts after the break, they saw a more modern layout and some changes in functionality.
Computing Services email team manager  Shlomo Balass said via email, “Computing Services heard the feedback from the community that the existing webmail service was not meeting their needs, and frankly rather ugly, especially given how the state of webmail has changed over the past years.”
After hearing this feedback, the email team for Computing Services started a project geared at updating the webmail site. According to Balass, the strongest aspect of the old webmail system was its custom theme selection. The team decided to focus on this part of the site.
“We did some research and found a company that provided a number of modern themes at an affordable price,” Balass said.
When students and faculty returned from break and opened up the webmail site, they were greeted by a brand new interface. “I was surprised. I didn’t know the changes were coming. I opened it up, and ‘Oh! That’s a new look!’ ” said Diane Turnshek, outreach coordinator for the physics department. 
However, students and faculty have noticed more than mere aesthetic changes to the site. 
One new function to Andrew Webmail is the auto-complete feature in the email address bar, which automatically detects who users are trying to email when they type in names or Andrew IDs.
Though faculty and students alike appreciate the changes, they have found a few flaws.
“There are clunky parts and things that are better,” Turnshek said. 
She noted the auto-complete function in the address bar as one occasional source of frustration. “It auto-completes everything, including all the mistakes I’ve made. So I have to figure out which are the incorrect ones I’ve typed,” she said.
Senior electrical and computer engineering major Ninar Nuemah also noticed that SquirrelMail no longer automatically fills out a list of email addresses, or a d-list, that had been typed out in the past. Nuemah said that this was a feature of SquirrelMail she heavily relied on, and that she now has to manually copy and paste lists of addresses.
First-year English major Cassie Geckle said that opening an email in SquirrelMail now causes readability problems. “Whenever you open an email in SquirrelMail, it will change the formatting sometimes, or it will put in weird little things where there are supposed to be symbols instead of the actual symbols. You have to download a document to see the actual symbols. Why are we doing that?” Geckle said.
For the most part, students and faculty agree that the changes made were much needed. John Oddo, assistant professor of rhetoric, said that when he arrived at Carnegie Mellon, he was surprised at the old email system, given the university’s reputation.
“It reminded me of my very first email account. I know that seems odd, but I remember when email was first created,” Oddo said. “[SquirrelMail] was primitive-seeming. Now they made it more contemporary and gave it bells and whistles.”
According to Geckle, a lot of her floormates stopped using SquirrelMail within a week of arriving and moved on to other email clients. 
“I thought that there are better email clients out there. It wasn’t very good at all,” Geckle said. “It’s not much better, it’s a little bit better. I think it’s easier to use now.”
Turnshek even asked her fellow co-workers if they noticed the changes made to Carnegie Mellon’s webmail system. “Not a lot of people use it, so either a) they didn’t notice the changes or b) they didn’t know it even changed,” Turnshek said. “They got frustrated with [the old email] and moved on.” 
“No one mentioned it to me. Technology sometimes becomes invisible unless it gives you issues,” Oddo said. “The visual experience you have colors your interpretation of technology.” 
Balass said that Computing Services welcomes feedback from the community about what should be changed. “Webmail services are never static,” Balass said. “As people become more savvy and as email needs change, the webmail application has to evolve to meet the community’s needs.”

Student Affairs held an open forum last Wednesday to discuss the controversy over one of the winning essays of the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day writing contest.
The essay, written by Winchester Thurston High School junior Jesse Lieberfeld, is titled “Fighting a Forbidden Battle: How I Stopped Covering Up for a Hidden Wrong.” 
The essay tells the story of how Lieberfeld came to believe that Israel is an oppressor in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and of how that belief has affected his life. It draws parallels between the struggle of Palestinians and that of black Americans during the civil rights movement.
Since the winners were announced on Jan. 15, many members of the local and national Jewish community have protested the selection of what they claim is an ill-informed and hate-filled essay as a winner of a contest designed to honor the memory of Martin Luther King Jr.
About two dozen people attended the forum, which was facilitated by Donner housefellow and coordinator of spirituality and meaning-making programs Kenneth Lawson. Among the attendees were Carnegie Mellon students, several members of the Carnegie Mellon English department, and several members of the local community.
Before the forum began, facilitators stressed that the emphasis of the forum was on dialogue, not debate — although little traditional debate actually occurred. Critics of the essay did not provide much evidence to back up their claims about its tone, nor were they officially encouraged to. 
Opponents of the essay argued that it was so filled with hatred against the Jewish people that Carnegie Mellon had a responsibility not to condone it by giving it an award. Eliana Weiner, a sophomore Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in architecture and psychology and member of the Carnegie Mellon group Tartans for Israel, said that she went into the forum looking less to critique the essay, and more to find out why it was chosen as a winner.
“I was more offended by the institution’s choice of the essay — to elevate it — rather than the kid’s writing it,” Weiner said.
According to English professor Yona Harvey, who has served on the selection committee in prior years, the essays are chosen as winners based on several factors.
“Essentially, we’re looking for people who can tie their topic to the legacy of Dr. King. Craft has also been cited — how well it’s actually written. I guess it can be subjective, just like any submission to a national journal,” Harvey said.
The essay does have many supporters. Dr. Naftali Kaminski, an Israeli professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said that he believes Lieberfeld’s essay was, in many ways, true to King’s spirit. 
Kaminski pointed to Lieberfeld’s reference to King’s letter from Birmingham jail, and called the letter a “guiding document for people who want to change reality.”
“When you want to change reality, when you want to fight injustice, you use nonviolent resistance, but it doesn’t mean that you turn the other cheek. It means that you stand, you speak truth to power,” Kaminski said. “And I actually think that Jesse’s essay was reflective of the spirit of the letter from Birmingham.”
Students who attended the forum generally had positive reactions to the event.
“I think it was a very good idea to have this forum in this environment, because I think the discussion was necessary,” Weiner said. “And I think it was successful, but at the same time, I think it veered off from what they wanted a bit, in terms of not trying to attack the writer himself, and using the personal facts about him.”
Some opponents of the essay criticized Lieberfeld himself, calling him disturbed, ill-informed, or pathetic. 
“I sort of cringed when people started to analyze Jesse, a little,” Kaminski said. “I don’t know that it’s fair, when the person is not here.”
“I am happy I went to [the event], as it helped me to get a feel for the pulse of the community that I am part of,” said Chloe Lynn Oxley, a junior double-majoring in decision science and professional writing, in an email. 
Oxley added that while she was glad the Carnegie Mellon community was able to have an open discussion, that was not enough on its own. 
“Let’s not stop at getting our viewpoints off our chests, but instead, let’s consider working towards something greater than ourselves. Respect is crucial and time is of the essence,” Oxley said.
Smith said that if members of the campus community have a problem with the way any aspect of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day festivities are run, there are opportunities for them to do something about it.
“We start planning for MLK the day after MLK happens. If there’s anyone in the room who wants to be involved in that process, to continue to create opportunities for these kinds of meaningful dialogues, or if you have ideas that you’d like to see happen that day — it’s a day for everyone,” Smith said. “If you want to get involved in that process, and you have suggestions, I encourage you to email us, and we’ll present those suggestions for next year.”
Lieberfeld’s essay can be read online at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 's website.

Paul S. Goodman, a professor of organizational psychology and theory at the Tepper School of Business, passed away at his home in Pittsburgh on Jan. 24 after suffering a stroke earlier in the month.
Goodman, who was 74 when he passed away, joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty in 1972 and received the Richard M. Cyert Professorship for teaching excellence in 2000. His research focused on organizational linkages, new forms of groups, and knowledge-sharing in international environments.
Goodman’s expertise made an impact in areas other than academia. “He was very interested in the international activities of Carnegie Mellon,” said Mark S. Kamlet, provost and executive vice president at Carnegie Mellon. “He was an advocate that Carnegie Mellon should try to do things internationally.... He started a number of important relationships for Carnegie Mellon.”
Although Goodman played a vital role in programs from Mexico to Singapore, Kamlet put the most focus on a program in South Africa where Goodman helped the local government to train disadvantaged women to be software engineers. 
“It was one of the first programs of its type,” Kamlet said. “It educated a lot of young women in South Africa in technology, probably more so than any other program in South Africa.”
Goodman’s students said that he was dedicated to teaching and that he tried to offer them his best guidance. Sam Swift, a Ph.D. student in business, said, “He cared a lot that when you did research, you didn’t just rush from an idea to conclusions, and that at every step you thought carefully about what idea you were testing, what that meant, and how you were testing it.” 
Nazli Turan, another Ph.D. student in business, also expressed her respect for Goodman. “He made sure to remind us of larger questions, the motivation behind your research idea, to make sure that it’s impactful, to make sure it’s well thought out,” Turan said. “We expected tough questions, the deeper level questions from Paul every single time in the seminar.”
Beyond academia, Goodman shared his insights and expertise with the public through film. He made three documentaries and several short videos. 
According to Laurie R. Weingart, a professor of organizational behavior and theory, Goodman’s films often allowed his audience to see a wide range of living conditions, especially those of individuals who are often underrepresented.
An informal memorial service was held in the Ph.D. student lounge in the Posner Center by Goodman’s colleagues and students last Monday.

Some tweets are not worth reading, researchers say
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Georgia Institute of Technology found that Twitter users say only about a third of the tweets they receive are worth reading.
According to Twitter’s website, more than 200 million tweets are sent each day. However, most users get little feedback about the messages they send, except when their tweets are retweeted by their followers or when people opt to stop following them. 
“If we understood what is worth reading and why,” said Paul André, a postdoctoral fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute and lead author of the study, in a university press release, “we might design better tools for presenting and filtering content, as well as help people understand the expectations of other users.”
André worked with his colleagues — Michael Bernstein and Kurt Luther, doctoral students at MIT and Georgia Tech, respectively — to create “Who Gives a Tweet?”: a website that collects readers’ evaluations of tweets. 
Those who have visited André and his team’s website were promised feedback on their tweets if they agreed to anonymously rate tweets by the users they were already following. Over a period of 19 days in late 2010 and early 2011, 1,443 visitors to the site rated 43,738 tweets from the accounts of 21,014 Twitter users they followed. 
Overall, the readers liked just 36 percent of the tweets and disliked 25 percent, while another 39 percent elicited no strong opinion.
The researchers will present their work next Monday at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Seattle.
Local journalists to discuss new media in CAS panel
Carnegie Mellon’s Center for the Arts in Society (CAS), a research center within the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the College of Fine Arts, will host a panel of six members of local media outlets who will discuss how technology and social media are changing news.
The panel event is titled “New Media/News Media: How New Media Is Changing The Aesthetics of News,” and will be held Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. in Steinberg Auditorium (Baker Hall A53). The event is free and open to the public.
Topics will include how the panelists’ roles have evolved due to technological innovations, what those changes mean for consumers, and what the future holds for the media industry.
The panelists scheduled are John Allison, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opinion editor; Deanna Garcia, an Essential Pittsburgh Radio reporter; Maria Lupinacci, an award-winning blogger; Tony Norman, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist; Chris Potter, a Pittsburgh City Paper editor; and Martha Rial, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The panel event is part of the recently launched CAS Media Initiative, which explores the role new media plays in social life, cultural politics, and political mobilizations. 
James Duesing, a professor of art, and Kathy Newman, an associate professor of English, are leading the initiative. The CAS initiative will also support three academic projects in addition to sponsoring events on media issues.

The nationwide “Occupy” movements seemed to have died down within the past few months. However, here in Pittsburgh, the movement is flaring up again. The Occupy Pittsburgh group, which has set up camp in the park next to BNY Mellon’s downtown offices, was issued a court-ordered eviction notice to leave the premises by Monday. Here are some quick facts about the court case and the local movement’s history:
$4,200: Occupy Pittsburgh's shared monetary funds, as of Jan. 11
113: approximate number of days the Occupy Pittsburgh protesters have been camped in the park
$100,000: approximate amount BNY Mellon would need to clean up the park
$10,000: bond that BNY Mellon filed with the court last Friday

America began integrating hookah into its social scene in the early 2000s. Approximately 200 to 300 hookah bars opened for business in the U.S. from 2000 to 2004, according to the Smokeshop journal. Unlike cigarettes, hookah has a relatively positive reputation, which caused its popularity to skyrocket among young adults.
I have many friends who proclaim their disgust for cigarettes, yet these same friends do not hesitate to blow some smoke rings from a hookah. Investigations have shown the consequences of hookah may not stray far from those of its more notorious counterpart.
Studies by the World Health Organization show that smoking hookah can be worse for your health than cigarettes — a hard fact to swallow for those deceived by the fun and laid-back atmosphere associated with hookah.
Upon questioning a few of my friends about their reasons for smoking hookah, I found out that many believed smoking hookah was safer than smoking cigarettes. First of all, this is not a reason — this is a comparison. I don’t justify my giving blood on the basis that it hurts less than giving bone marrow.
Secondly, this far too common comparison is a false one. According to a study by the World Health Organization, a person can inhale 100 times more smoke from an hour-long hookah session than from a single cigarette.Though hookah smoke may feel smoother than cigarette smoke, it is just as harsh on the lungs. Kimber Richter, associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of Kansas, said in an article on kansan.com that the water doesn’t filter out chemicals and heavy metals: It only cools the smoke.
I’ll admit that the smell of a hookah session can be quite calming and aromatic — I have smelled quality brands of shisha tobacco that give air fresheners a run for their money. However, this pleasant aroma masks the imminent danger of second-hand hookah smoke. Since the odor still contains tobacco smoke, it exposes people to the same harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, such as hydrogen cyanide, nicotine, and ammonia.
In fact, hookah smoke can be even worse than cigarette smoke. The burning of charcoal used to produce the smoke adds 143 grams of carbon monoxide per gram of shisha — 11 times the amount found in one cigarette — according to a study by the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program.
Keep in mind that an hour-long session requires about 15 grams of shisha. The same study reported that hookah smoke also contains higher levels of lead, nickel, and arsenic than cigarettes, as well as 36 times more tar. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that hookah smoking can lead to heart disease, respiratory disease, and oral cancers. The harms of hookah have remained under the radar for far too long.
Don’t get me wrong — I couldn’t care less about what people choose to smoke, drink, eat, wear, or watch. What bothers me are faulty reasoning and beliefs behind a person’s actions. If people are well aware of the actual effects of their smoking, then I will respect their educated decision. But it is disheartening when someone smokes hookah with a false understanding of its consequences. This smoker is either a victim of society’s ignorance or in denial. In either situation, the truth needs to be acknowledged.
The best thing I can hope my cigarette-hating, shisha-smoking friends receive is enlightenment. Perhaps it was the onset of research that led policymakers to implement hookah bans throughout the U.S.
All of my friends owe it to themselves — and their bodies — to know the myths and facts of smoking hookah. If they choose to continue smoking, I can only hope they will bask in the fruity fragrance and relaxing effects of hookah without the air of ignorance.

Public schools in the U.S. are offering an increasing amount of parental exemptions for certain coursework. Usually these exemptions are used for sexual education and health issues, but parental objections in the classroom have recently been taken to a new level. Last month, the Republican-dominated New Hampshire legislature passed House Bill 542, which allows parents to issue “an exception to specific course material based on ... [their] determination that the material is objectionable.”
New Hampshire parents now possess complete control to object to any program or assignment that arises. 
The bill indicates that school districts can no longer mandate a parent to send his or her child to any school program to which they are “conscientiously opposed.” 
In addition, the law does not require parents to give an explanation for the specific curriculum alteration. In essence, parents can now reject course material on a whim, as long as the student graduates with “state graduation requirements.”
The New Hampshire legislation was a clear attempt by the Republican legislature to continue undermining the public school system. As Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson highlighted in the case McCollum v. Board of Education, “If we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any [person] or is inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave the public schools in shreds.”
Robert Kunzman, education professor at Indiana University in Bloomington, expressed the over-arching question of balancing parental discretion and public school freedom. Earlier this year, in a report on abcnews.go.com, he posed the question, “How wide can we make the circle in our public schools in terms of helping families to feel welcomed and feel their beliefs and perspectives are accommodated?” Although parental discretion in common offensive cases is understandable, this new law funnels an excessive amount of power to the parents and tilts the balance almost to the point of educational obsolescence.
The law transforms public school education from a public good into a private (family-owned) mechanism. It is bound to lead to disagreements between parents and administrators on suitable lesson alternatives, and as a result, with every alternative plan, curricula will become increasingly conflicting. It is beneficial for a school to offer accommodations for students, but there need to be clear limits.
The New Hampshire law, biases and all, is beginning a trend of parental domination within the realm of education. Arizona and Georgia state legislatures are proposing similar legislation.
Although some district agreements should be made, the bill completely rejects the district-parent negotiation process and allows parents to object to school instruction in an ongoing state-wide culture war. The law is demeaning, disrespectful, and dangerous to the future of New Hampshire students, and to students across the nation.

Since Twitter’s creation in 2006, the website has been a hub of unrestricted news. Now, six years later, Twitter has announced a new censorship policy that could once again change freedom of expression on the web.
Simply put, Twitter’s new censorship policy will allow the removal of tweets on a country-by-country basis.
When a government orders that a post be taken down, the post will be replaced by a statement saying, “This tweet from @username has been withheld in: Country.” However, the post will remain visible to users in all other countries where no such order was issued.
Twitter is also partnering with the website chillingeffects.org to announce when a post has been censored. The openness regarding censored material is crucial to positively shaping censorship on the internet.
With the introduction of the new policy, Twitter has indirectly urged other websites to follow suit with transparent censorship policies. Transparent censorship, in terms of Twitter’s policy, means the company in question promises to be honest about removing posts while ensuring minimal censorship. Secretive censorship will occur rarely, if at all, on Twitter due to the openness of censored posts. Additionally, the fact that posts will not be taken down universally will allow a maximal number of users to see a post. Hopefully other web services like Twitter will alter their censorship policies to create an environment of free speech.
Many critics claim this new policy will entail heavy monitoring of tweets; however, the company will only review content if there are requests to take it down.
The lack of monitoring, in addition to censorship notifications, will increase information availability on the web.
Twitter will adjust its censorship policy to accommodate strict laws and, in doing so, revolutionize censorship. 
Both users and governments are accommodated in regards to the removal of posts through this transparent policy.
Twitter is once again pioneering a new trend of unrestricted free speech across the globe with the introduction of its transparent censorship policy.

Jesse Lieberfeld, a junior at Winchester Thurston School, wrote an essay titled “Fighting a Forbidden Battle: How I Stopped Covering up for a Hidden Wrong.” The essay tied for first place in the prose category of Carnegie Mellon’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day Writing Awards. In the essay, Lieberfeld describes how he grappled with his support of Israel as he watched its treatment of Palestinians grow increasingly brutal and inhumane.
The controversial essay provoked backlash from students at Carnegie Mellon and members of local pro-Israel and Zionist organizations. However, by illuminating many unfortunate truths about the lives of Palestinians in Israel and occupied territories, Lieberfeld demonstrated a commitment to human and civil rights as King had.
Lieberfeld’s critics are either unaware of or do not understand the discrimination against the Palestinian minority in Israel, who make up about 20 percent of the Israeli population. While Palestinian citizens in Israel have full voting rights and serve in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, there are still inequities in areas of employment, education, and health care.
A study by Adalah, the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, stated that “more than 30 main laws discriminate, directly or indirectly, against Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the current government coalition has proposed a ﬂood of new racist and discriminatory bills which are at various stages in the legislative process.” In his essay, Lieberfeld rightly compares the treatment of African-Americans in the U.S. to the current treatment of Palestinians.
Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are also subjected to segregation and human rights violations. Their freedom of movement is severely restricted because they are forbidden to travel on certain roads that are exclusively reserved for Israeli citizens.
A 2011 report from the United Nation’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs detailed how this extensive system of roadblocks and checkpoints continues the system of constrained movement. Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem likened road segregation to the  Apartheid in South Africa. Lieberfeld rightly condemned this discrimination, echoing King’s moral outrage expressed in “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”
Home demolitions and land expropriation occur regularly in the West Bank, leaving some Palestinians homeless and forcibly displaced. The separation barrier surrounding the West Bank, constructed in 2004 and declared illegal by the International Court of Justice, uproots farmland essential to the livelihoods of Palestinians and separates members of Palestinian families.
As a result, Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank have practiced nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, holding weekly demonstrations to protest these conditions. Thus, Lieberfeld is justified in drawing historical parallels with civil rights activists in the 1950s who implemented similar methods.
While the Israeli government argues that checkpoints, roadblocks, home demolitions, and other policies have been instituted for security reasons, Israel’s behavior toward Palestinians has grown increasingly discriminatory. 
Lieberfeld’s analysis of the conflict is anchored in international law and universal principles of human rights. By bravely speaking out against the oppression of Palestinians, Lieberfeld embodies a legacy of social justice bequeathed by King.

It’s often said that Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on anything, that their intense hatred for one another makes passing even the most trivial legislation an uphill battle. However, on Jan. 23, both the Democratic and Republican members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives managed to unanimously agree on something. Surely this agreement was a sign that our state leaders were coming together for something important — funding public transit, for instance.
Unfortunately, this faith was misplaced. In its 193–0 vote, the House passed Resolution 535, declaring that 2012 shall be known as the “Year of the Bible” in Pennsylvania. This legislation blatantly disregards the spirit of the First Amendment.
The House laid out its rationale in the resolution. Much of this reasoning is dedicated to explaining the historical importance of the Bible in the development of the United States. While it’s impossible to disregard the impact that Christianity has in American history, it does not explain why 2012 should be any more the Year of the Bible than 1912, or 1860, or 1776, or any year since the Christian Biblical canon was finalized around 400 C.E.
The history is not, of course, the real reason the House passed its resolution. 
The text declares that the Bible is the “word of God,” that “renewing our knowledge of and faith in God through holy scripture” will restore America’s strength, and finally that there is a “national need to study and apply the teachings of the holy scriptures.”
The House doesn’t say which version of the Bible Americans should be studying or which holy scriptures they should be applying. However, we suspect that the vote would not have been unanimous had a representative suggested that Americans read and apply the teachings of the Qur’an — many of which coincide with teachings in the Christian Bible and the lessons of every other major religion for the last few thousand years.
We doubt the House would even pass a resolution in support of one of the principal tenets of these religions by declaring 2012 to be a “Year of Peace.”
The Pennsylvania House opposed the spirit of the First Amendment by passing this bill. Instead of declaring that all Americans need to study the Bible and renew their faith in a specific God, Pennsylvania’s legislators might want to consider studying their oaths of office and applying the Constitution of the United States.

The North Shore Connector, a 1.2-mile-long light rail tunnel under the Allegheny River that connects Downtown and the North Shore, is set to open by the end of March. The $523 million project doesn’t address the pressing needs of Pittsburgh; due to the construction of the connector, the city’s prevalent issues with public transportation are being overlooked.
That is not to say that the North Shore Connector isn’t beneficial to the city. Pittsburgh is spending relatively little for the expensive project. The connector’s primary funding is a federal grant program, with an additional $62 million coming from federal stimulus. The Allegheny County Port Authority also stated the that project supported 4,000 local jobs, according to a report on pittsburghlive.com.
While the economic advantages of the North Shore Connector are substantial, they are temporary, and the project seems to be a misfire. Besides the maintenance and repair that many roads, highways, and bridges in the region need, areas like Downtown and the Squirrel Hill Tunnel constantly deal with traffic congestion issues that are more pressing than the connector.
The Port Authority deals with a significant lack of funding annually and often threatens to cut bus routes important to the city. Numerous communities already have insufficient public transportation support. Important areas in and around Pittsburgh such as Oakland, the airport, and Downtown could be better connected. The funds used for the North Shore Connector could have been used to address, if not solve, these more pressing issues. Expanding a light rail system between Downtown and Oakland would greatly serve the needs of the large population of college students in Oakland who depend on public transportation. The expenditures of college students help support the local economy, and student spending largely depends on how students get around. If Pittsburgh were to improve transit to and from Oakland, it would be beneficial to the city’s economy.
Efforts like the North Shore Connector lack the necessary scope to improve public transportation in the Pittsburgh area. Instead, measures should be taken to improve transit among hubs such as Oakland, Downtown, the Waterfront, and the Pittsburgh International Airport.

This week, Apple was criticized for the poor working conditions in the Chinese factories that manufacture its products.
Charles Duhigg and David Barboza of The New York Times reported that employees at Apple’s manufacturing partner, Foxconn, undergo 12-hour shifts in horrible conditions. An aluminum dust buildup resulted in an explosion in an iPad production facility in May 2011. This in turn resulted in two immediate deaths and dozens of injuries. After threats of mass suicides due to working conditions, nets were installed to catch employees attempting to jump to their deaths.
News of such conditions shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, given that this isn’t the first time Foxconn has been investigated on charges of abuse.
Although Apple CEO Tim Cook recently delivered an internal statement to Apple’s employees stating that the company “will not... stand still or turn a blind eye to problems in our supply chain,” the problems are more widespread than one company can fix.
Foxconn and similar companies support hundreds of American corporations every day, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard.
We should take monetary power in our hands as consumers and investors and pull support from companies that enable this kind of abuse. At a time when Americans have stepped up to the plate against Stop Online Piracy Act, pulling financial support from companies that favored the bill, we consumers should learn that we are not powerless to instigate change with our wallets.
Suggesting we all stop buying Apple products is unrealistic. But what if we could learn to value things differently instead? 
If the real worth of an item were not just a sleek design and a fast processor, but also an ethical manufacturing process, if we made it fashionable to be mindful of a product’s origins, then we could see a real difference.

The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) continues to serve the entire school community every day. Our department representatives and Executive Committee are some of the best and brightest students on this campus.
GSA members are proud of the fact that we are both the most visible and most vibrant piece of student government at Carnegie Mellon. Our school year began with an extensive involvement in Orientation. Every incoming graduate student had the opportunity to meet our executive members personally. GSA visited almost every department during Orientation in an effort to engage our new student population at the first opportunity. Orientation included Ice Cream Day, a great new initiative from our Social Committee, and a barbecue that had nearly 2,000 attendees.
We have spent a significant chunk of our capital reserve over the past two years on campus maps, new weights at Skibo, and a forthcoming sound system in the fitness room of the University Center. We recently extended the opportunity to offer suggestions for further uses of the funds to the entire grad student community. New (possibly covered) bike racks will be a reality on this campus in the near future. GSA pulled off another tremendously successful Beer Tasting event in December at Phipps Conservatory, and we are looking forward to our renowned Wine Tasting at the Aquarium in May. In the meantime, we will pull off events both large and small: ice skating is coming up on Feb. 17, the GSA-sponsored ski trip is on Feb. 26, and tickets to Carnegie Mellon’s own production of Sweeney Todd will be made available soon after skiing.
Finally, GSA has maintained an active role in campus affairs that cover both graduate and undergraduate issues. We worked closely with Computing Services to improve the wireless internet on campus after gathering information on dead zones from our student body. And club sports teams will begin to receive money to pay for coaches out of the Athletics Department budget instead of JFC, freeing up $60,000 for other student organizations.

This unseasonably warm weather is calling to you, tempting you to abandon your books and go for a walk. You can’t fight Mother Nature, so go for it!
You know that Leo doesn’t have the greatest self-control, and if he or she is going to shop, then you might as well reap the benefits. Try to talk them out of it, but when in doubt, make sure you get something nice for yourself too. 
You know how to deal with tough situations and that is great for you, but you would feel even better if you helped others to do the same. So next time you see someone going through a tough time, go out of your way to help.
Feeling a bit close-minded this week? Being so closed off is a necessity at times, but only in moderation. Broaden your perspective, and others’ attitudes toward you will greatly improve.
Put down the credit card and step away from the online shopping. Yes, it is cute, but do you really need it? No. 
You and your phone are close and, while that’s different, it’s okay. Just make sure to lift your head up once in a while and enjoy the people around you.
It’s time to ask for help in the one class that is kicking your behind. Seek help now or suffer later.
Too much campus food can be a bad thing. Stop punishing your taste buds, treat yourself and go out to eat. 
Ask someone else for advice. You will be much better off.
If you don’t like something in your life right now, fix it. Yes, it is going to be hard, and yes, you may not know where to start, but you can do it.
As much as others hate to admit it, you’re pretty awesome; you’re a little annoying at times, but awesome nonetheless.
Adventure awaits, but only if you seek it first. Keep your eyes open and you will be in for a magical surprise.
