As non-conference play came to an end this past week, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team turned their attention to their first University Athletic Association matchup of the season. But all of that paid off as the Tartans shut out the University of Chicago 3–0 at home this past Saturday. 
Having gone 9–1 against non-UAA opponents, the Tartans had no intention of taking their foot off the gas pedal. With the exception of two games this season, the men’s team has beaten their opponents by at least three goals. They now have tallied 39 goals for the year and allowed just six the entire season. The Tartans came out fired up, scoring all three goals of the game in the first 11 minutes. In the first major play, the Tartans were able to attack past an out-of-position Chicago defense. Senior playmaker Keith Haselhoff was able to find fellow senior Jon Simon, who comfortably finished a one-time shot to the near post in the third minute.
The next goal came in the sixth minute as a result of a goaltending blunder. Senior forward Pat Lutz put up a ball into the box, and the Chicago goalie — Chris Giusto — saw the ball bounce into his own net. It was once again the unstoppable goal-scoring duo of Lutz and Ricky Griffin that tore up the opponents’ defense. Griffin slotted the ball to Lutz, who was able to score off a great shot past the keeper for his sixth goal of the year.
With eight of the 11 starters talented seniors, the men’s team is fortunate to have such a strong backbone. Griffin and Lutz have accumulated a combined 19 goals and 12 assists this season. Griffin was last week’s UAA and ECAC Player of the Week, and Lutz won the UAA award in the previous two weeks, also garnering the ECAC honor on Sept. 15. Fellow senior Maks Khurgin as goalkeeper has also been in great form all season, posting eight shutouts (including four in a row after the Chicago game) and allowing only six goals. Credit must also be given to seniors Jon Hall and Austin Good, who lead the backline. But perhaps the most valuable play has been that of senior midfielders Simon, Haselhoff, and Ryan Browne, who control the pace of the match every game. The Tartans are looking to continue to power through UAA teams and into the NCAA tournament later this year, but at the same time, they have made sure not to underestimate their opponents. 
Earlier this week, the Tartans also beat Bethany College 5–0. Goals were scored by Griffin, Haselhoff, and sophomores Mark Lacy and Brad Edelman. The Tartans’ next match is this Sunday at Washington University in St. Louis at 11 a.m.

The Carnegie Mellon women's tennis team traveled to Fredericksburg, Va. to compete in the Wilson ITA Southeast Regional from Sept. 26–28. The Tartans went into the tournament with three top-10 seeds in singles, and the doubles team of sophomore Laura Chen and junior Ashley Herrick seeded first in doubles; they left the tournament with Chen as the singles champion, sophomore Courtney Chin as the runner-up, and the team of Chen and Herrick as the doubles champions.
The Tartans entered the tournament with high hopes, with Chen seeded first overall in singles, Chin seeded fifth, and first-year Alex Tapak seeded ninth. Chen won her first match 6–0, 6–3 over the University of Mary Washington's Jocelyn Lewis before taking down Washington and Lee's Ashley Leinweber 6–1, 6–3. Chin also took her first two matches, defeating Washington College's Brittany Marshall and Swarthmore's Emily Rosenblum, both by scores of 6–1, 6–1.
Tapak's first foray into ITA competition went well, as she also took both of her opening matches, winning 6–3, 7–6 (7–2) over Washington and Lee's Ann Morris before handling Kelly Fahmer of Salisbury University 6–1, 6–2. She would go on to win once more on day two before losing to Carolyn Warren of Johns Hopkins in the quarterfinals.
In doubles on day one, Chen and Herrick defeated Hopkins' Ellen Berlinghof and Courtney Boger 8–3 while junior Jen Chui and Tapak won 8–5 Jackie Burr and Melissa Follet of Salisbury. Senior Alisa Liebowitz and junior Kelly Hart also won their match 8–3, while Chin and sophomore Cze-Ja Tam defeated their opponents 8–2.
Chen and Chin continued to roll in singles on the second day of the tournament. Chen won her round of 16 and quarterfinal matches 6–1, 6–1 and 6–0, 6–1 to make it to the semifinals, while Chin punched her ticket to semis with wins 6–1, 6–1 and 6–2, 6–2. All four wins came against players from Johns Hopkins. The Chen/Herrick duo won both of their matches by 8–2 scores to make it to the semifinals, while the team of Chui/Tapak followed suit with 8–4 and 8–3 victories to set up a semifinal showdown against their teammates. Chin and Tam completed the day two dominance with 8–1 and 8–6 victories.
"Laura and I had a great year last year so we hoped we would have a good tournament to start this year," Herrick said. "There were a lot of great doubles teams this year that made us work extra hard."
Carnegie Mellon continued to showcase its prowess on the final day of the tournament. Chen won her semifinals match over Hopkins' Carolyn Warren, and Chin followed suit and nabbed another win 6–2, 6–2 to reach the finals as well.  The resulting all Carnegie Mellon singles final was a showdown of intensity and skill; Chen triumphed over Chin 6–2, 2–6, 7–6 (4) after a grueling two and a half hour match.
Later that day, Chen teamed up with Herrick, and the duo beat their teammates Chui and Tapak 8–3 to advance to a tough finals match against a team from Johns Hopkins. Chen and Herrick eventually won the marathon match up, 6–2, 4–6, 10–8 to claim Carnegie Mellon's second title of the meet.
"It feels great winning two [ITA] titles," Chen commented. "I'm excited for the [ITA] nationals that are coming up. It was great to see all Carnegie Mellon finals for both singles and doubles. I think it's a good sign that our team is going to have a very good season. Personally, for the spring season, I hope to continue playing well and maybe have a better record than last year. For the team, I would definitely like us to be able to go to the NCAAs again."
"The spring looks hopeful for our team," Herrick added. "We have a lot of great depth, it seems that everyone came back ready to compete and we're all looking forward to seeing what we can do. I think the team as a whole has a great shot at winning the conference and doing some exciting things."
The team will ride their momentum into a dual match at Oberlin on Saturday, Oct. 10 at 9 a.m.

This week, the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team continued to improve their game by first defeating Grove City College on Tuesday, followed by tying with the University of Chicago on Saturday. These results improve their season record to a commendable 4–4–1.
On Tuesday, the Tartans traveled to Grove City to take on the Wolverines. The beginning of the match was a struggle for the Tartans, as the first goal was scored at the 30-minute mark by Grove City. Once the second period started, the ladies boosted their offense. This effort paid off when Tartan sophomore Ava Murphey made a 20-yard pass to sophomore Elsa Wu, who scored 15 minutes into the second half of the game. Wu scored a second goal with less than 10 minutes remaining, bringing the score to 2–1.
Unfortunately, Grove City fired back with a goal of their own in the last few minutes of the game, which brought the score to a nail-biting 2–2, and the game transitioned into overtime. At 3:47 after overtime started, first-year Lissie Arndt kicked the ball to the left corner of the box, where it was received by Wu. With a swift kick in a tension-filled stadium, Wu scored, ending the game at 3–2.
Wu’s performance during this match was exceptional, as this was her first hat trick of her soccer career. With this win, the Tartans’ record rose to 4–4 for the season.
That following Saturday, the Tartans played at home in Gesling Stadium against the Maroons. The first goal of the game was nearly scored by Carnegie Mellon’s own junior Val Corvino, but her shot was blocked at the six-yard line. A minute later, Chicago scored a goal of their own, improving their score to 0–1. The excitement of the game continued during the second half, when Chicago attempted to score again 67 minutes into the game but was intercepted by junior Emily Overstreet. Just two minutes later, Overstreet made a corner kick to first-year Katie Davis, who in turn went for the goal, but that was saved again by Chicago. With 3:37 left in the second half, Overstreet passed a corner kick to junior Alice Mayfield, who scored on a header, tying the game.
The match continued into overtime, where Mayfield took another shot at the goal but was then blocked by the Maroons’ goalie. Next, Chicago attempted to make a goal of their own, which was luckily saved by the Tartans’ junior keeper Anya Rosen. The action continued two minutes later when Tartans sophomore Elsa Wu and — another two minutes following — Mayfield each nearly scored yet another goal, which were once again blocked by Chicago’s goalie. This shutout sent the game into a second overtime period. In the last minute of the game, Chicago attempted to make two corner kicks, but the Tartans’ defenses were too strong, and both were blocked. The game ended in a tie, with a final score of 1–1.
This game was a morale-boosting indicator for the Tartans, and forecasts positive results in the next few weeks. “It was a great performance against Chicago and a much-needed tie,” commented Overstreet. “Playing so well in our first UAA [University Athletic Association] game was extremely important and hopefully leads to a strong UAA season.”
The Tartans will hit the field next on Oct. 7 against Union College in Alliance, Ohio with kickoff set to start at 7 p.m.

Almost everyone was forced to participate in a sport when they were a kid. I was one of those unlucky — or lucky — kids. Whether it was ballet and tap lessons, club basketball, track, water polo, or swim team, my parents always supported my participation in athletics. While I complained about going to practice instead of being able to hang out with friends, participating in sports has had its benefits — namely, developing leadership skills.
As a child, I thought a leader was the loudest one on the field or the one with the best jump shot. But as an older and more mature athlete, I’ve realized that leaders might not be designated as captain; they might not even see playing time. There are different types of leadership, and most of the time, the unassuming go unnoticed.
Carnegie Mellon athletics has taken note of this, and every year athletes attend the Leadership Symposium, led by Greg Shelley, associate professor of exercise and sport sciences at Ithaca College. Shelley has published articles and given presentations that show how to apply sports psychology to athletic performance, team building, and leadership.
At Carnegie Mellon’s Leadership Symposium, Shelley stresses the idea that leaders aren’t always the ones who are being interviewed after the game. Behind-the-scenes leaders are just as effective, usually leading by example.
Anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock for the past two decades has heard of Michael Jordan. He’s known for his ridiculous jumping ability, his shoes, for helping the Looney Toons defeat the aliens in Space Jam, and for leading the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships. But have you ever heard of Josh Pastner? Probably not, because he wasn’t the one on the Wheaties box. Despite the fact that his skills were less than his teammates’ — players who went professional, including Mike Bibby and Miles Simon — it wasn’t for his basketball skills that his teammates called him a leader.
Pastner was a prime example of leading by example: He showed an unrivaled dedication to his team. He was the first one to practice and the last one to leave. He was unselfish and cared less about his own skills, but more about improving the team as a whole.
Pastner didn’t care if his teammates didn’t accept him as a walk-on at first, but he gained their respect with his work ethic, willingness to be a team player, and most importantly, his leadership.
Pastner, like most athletes, didn’t go professional. However, the leadership skills and passion he showed for athletics landed him an assistant coaching job. Similarly, I know that I, like most athletes at Carnegie Mellon, won’t go professional and, when it comes down to it, won’t be remembered for my athletic performance. But what Carnegie Mellon athletes will be remembered for is their leadership on and off of the field. The leadership skills I acquired while participating in athletics translate over to the classroom and probably into my professional life after school as well.
As a kid, I was naive in thinking that the best leaders were the most popular, most talented, and maybe even the most self-righteous athletes. But after 14 years of competitive sports, I have realized that I appreciate the athletes who are selfless, earn their respect, and lead by example. I know that I admire these types of athletes and, in turn, have tried to emulate their good example.

Luck was not on the side of the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team, which last week traveled to local Geneva College but fell in five games 2–3. The Tartans’ record moves to 9–6 after this match.
The Tartans are currently in the midst of their University Athletic Association play, held in Rochester, N.Y.
The match momentum switched back and forth between the Tartans and the Tornadoes, with the Tornadoes grabbing the first game 19–25. The Tartans rebounded and took the second game 25–17 but dropped the third game at 22–25 after a tough back-and-forth battle. The Tartans won the next game by a hair (25–23) before falling in the tiebreak 10–15.
Leading the Tartans with kills were juniors Aislinn McCloskey and Caroline Size with 17 and 15 wins, respectively. Seniors Jess Brackin and Megan Killeen added nine to the total, followed by senior Sam Carter, who, in addition to six kills, added 50 assists and 14 digs. Junior Cameron Griffin kept the ball in play for the Tartans with a match high of 21 digs.
McCloskey, Size, and Killeen are currently the team leaders in kills, while Carter holds the title of most team assists and Griffin the record of most digs across all categories.
Killeen was optimistic about her team’s future performance, and noted some observations for the past games. “The game highlighted some of our weaknesses, and over the next week and the course of the season we will work on remedying those. When playing Mount Union, every aspect of our game broke down slightly — our offense, our defense, even our communication on the court was not where it usually is,” she said. “We have to work on maintaining all of these aspects of play even in high-stress situations.”
The Tartans will host Thomas More College Oct. 11, with serving set to begin at 2:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon football team completed its three-game road trip successfully on Saturday with a 17–14 victory over Kenyon College. The win, the Tartans’ second in a row, put their record at 2–1 for the trip and 4–1 for the season.
Although the Tartans would eventually spoil Kenyon’s homecoming celebrations with the victory, it was the Lords who drew first blood. Carnegie Mellon started the game by returning the opening kickoff for 29 yards and driving another 29 yards before turning the ball over when junior running back Justin Pratt was stripped at the Kenyon 6-yard line. 
The Lords then completed an eight-play drive that ended with a 41-yard touchdown to put Kenyon up 7–0 with 10:25 to go in the quarter.
Carnegie Mellon senior quarterback Socrates Zacharias was intercepted in the second quarter at the Kenyon 8-yard line, but junior linebacker Mike Shedlosky then stripped Kenyon’s Mike Hermanson, and senior Josh Kresge recovered the fumble at the Kenyon’s 28-yard line. The Tartans’ ensuing drive resulted in Pratt scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run to knot the score at 7 with 12:12 to go in the half. Shedlosky wound up with nine tackles in the game.
Carnegie Mellon sophomore Ray Johnson had a 55-yard fumble return later in the quarter, but the team turned the ball over at the Kenyon 30-yard line. The Tartans managed to take the lead in the third quarter after taking advantage of a Kenyon missed field goal. After the Lords’ Harry von Kann’s 23-yard attempt went wide, the Tartans executed a 14-play, 71-yard drive, leading to a 26-yard field goal by junior place kicker Elliot Carnevale and a 10–7 Tartan lead. The lead was short-lived, however, as Kenyon followed with a 75-yard drive of their own and a touchdown to take back the lead, 14–10.
Carnegie Mellon was not to be deterred, and first-year Dave Biersen returned the kickoff for a 65-yard run to Kenyon’s 18-yard line. 
Pratt ended the ensuing six-play drive with a 2-yard run for what would prove to be the winning touchdown, putting the cardinal and gray up 17–14. Pratt finished the day with two touchdowns and 68 yards.
“The team played very inspired and came away with a hard-fought win,” head coach Rich Lackner said. “Our offensive line came up with a very critical drive in the fourth quarter.”
There was still a lot of game left to play after scoring that final touchdown, however, and the Tartans made sure that the Lords didn’t pose any threat to regain the lead. 
After keeping Kenyon contained in two separate minute-long drives, the Tartans came up big time with a 17-play drive that took seven minutes off the game clock, giving Kenyon only 1:06 to garner a comeback.
“We moved the ball well all day,” Lackner said. “But the biggest drive of the game was the last one, which took up about 7 minutes and gave Kenyon the ball back with very little time left.”
The football team will play at home in Gesling Stadium this Saturday against Allegheny College, with kickoff set for 1 p.m.

Welcome to the 21st century. The past 50 years have seen remarkable innovations in technology, medicine, and even physical fitness training. People are starting to understand the health benefits of proper daily physical activity. This could be due to the increase in lifestyle-related illness and pathologies. The latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control in 2008 showed that every state but Colorado had a 20 percent or higher obesity rate. However, it’s easier than one might think to achieve a healthy lifestyle through physical activity.
The previous installment of “Fiber Content” emphasized static stretching — specifically, the increased health and performance that results. This article will focus on slightly more complex methods of stretching. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching has been a staple for high-level athletes for the past 30 years and has finally trickled down to the general fitness enthusiast. 
Many experts consider PNF superior to other forms of stretching because it facilitates muscular inhibition. One of the main drawbacks to static stretching is the possibility of stretching an overactive muscle. When performing static stretching, opposing muscles (agonist and antagonist) may sometimes co-contract, not allowing for full relaxation of the muscle being stretched and yielding a less than optimal result. If done correctly, PNF stretching eliminates this possibility.
During PNF stretching, three specific muscle actions are used to create the relaxed state and passive stretch. Concentric — active shortening of the muscle — and isometric actions — preventing the muscle from changing length — are performed on the antagonist muscle (the muscle being stretched) followed by a concentric contraction of the agonist (the muscle being trained, opposite the antagonist) to cause reciprocal inhibition.
Reciprocal inhibition is the body’s ability to allow one muscle group to relax so the other can contract fluidly. If this did not happen during normal movement, both the agonist and antagonist would contract simultaneously, causing jerky, almost robot-like movements. During the stretching, the terms contract and hold are used to describe the concentric and isometric contractions, respectively. During the contraction of the agonist muscle, there is a passive static stretch applied, referred to as relax.
There are three basic techniques of PNF stretching used: hold-relax, contract-relax, and hold-relax with agonist contraction. In performing all these exercises on the hamstring, for example, a long piece of sturdy rope or a lengthy belt will be needed. In all three examples, the rope or belt will be looped around the arch of the foot of the leg being stretched, and the person should be lying on the ground with enough rope or belt remaining to hold on to during the stretch. It is imperative during the stretch that the leg remains as straight as possible to ensure proper stretching of the full muscle. Each stretch has a starting position when the belt is used to apply just enough pressure that there is mild discomfort, and this position is held for 10 seconds — this static stretch allows the muscle to be relaxed.
Hold-Relax: Begin with the aforementioned starting position. While maintaining a stretch, begin to pull slowly on the rope to cause an increase in tension while trying to hold the position of the leg, causing an isometric contraction of the antagonist (hamstring) muscle for six seconds. Lastly, relax and statically stretch the hamstring muscle group for 30 seconds, increasing the range of motion of the leg.
Contract-Relax: Begin once again with the starting stretch. While maintaining tension in the band, concentrically extend the leg down to the ground or through a full range of motion. Relax and passively bring the leg up to an increased range of motion by pulling on the belt and holding the hamstring in a relaxed and statically stretched state for 30 seconds.
Hold-Relax with Agonist Contraction: This technique is identical to the hold-relax method mentioned above in the first two phases (relaxed and contract). Following the isometric contraction of the hamstring muscles group, contract the quadriceps and hip flexor muscle groups by bringing the thigh closer to the body. Simultaneously pull on the belt to increase the active range of motion.
With all three techniques, each subsequent relaxed static stretch should be at an increased range of motion. These techniques can be repeated anywhere from 2–3 times on each limb. Perform only one of the three stretches per session and try to vary the techniques weekly to stay interested. 
Like static stretching, these stretches can be performed before, during, and after training sessions to promote increased flexibility, increased strength performance, and increased recovery time.
For pictures and further inquiries regarding both static and PNF stretching, the Internet is a great place to start. If you have questions or comments, please e-mail me (schultzk@).

Coming off of a victorious weekend at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Southeast Regional tournament, Carnegie Mellon’s women’s tennis team is on track from their strong showing last season. Most notably, sophomore Laura Chen and junior Ashley Herrick brought back the doubles title and earned a trip to the ITA National Tournament later this month. Chen also garnered the singles title at the regional tournament, although it was over sophomore teammate Courtney Chin. 
Despite this, Chen, Herrick, and the rest of her fellow tennis players are extremely team-oriented and display a positive relationship with one another, which is prevalent in their athletic, collegiate, and social endeavors.
A sophomore from Port Washington, N.Y., Chen is majoring  in information systems. Last season, Chen was named ITA National Rookie of the Year, and she seems to be living up to the title admirably. Chen chose Carnegie Mellon for its strong academics that accompany her chance to play tennis, and she says, “A student athlete is a student first.” An avid fan of the Food Network, Chen concedes that one of the team’s favorite traditions is to eat their favorite foods together, whether it be to fuel up for a match or just to spend time together.
Herrick, a junior from Amherst, Ohio majoring in psychology and biology, follows suit with the notion that both academics and athletics were driving factors for her to attend Carnegie Mellon. The daughter of a tennis instructor, Herrick was inspired by her mother to start tennis at the age of 6. She loves that the team is close-knit, citing their trip to Minnesota last season where they took the ITA Indoors National title as her most memorable event with the Tartans. Herrick emphasizes the value of the team’s relationship: “The closeness of our team is what makes me love tennis so much.”
By maintaining these tight friendships off the court, the Tartans tennis team is sure to continue their success on the clay.

After much debate and with some degree of disbelief, scientists have announced in Science that they have conclusive proof that there is water on the moon. While the current findings speak of minuscule amounts, the authors are cautiously optimistic that more will be found on succeeding missions.
The actual discovery was made by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, or M3, built and operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The M3 was fitted on the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe launched and operated by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Many of the scientists involved were suspicious of the results and sought corroboratory data, which they found in the information collected by NASA’s Deep Impact (2005) and Cassini (1997) missions. These two missions had previously directed sensors similar to the M3 toward the moon. However, their findings had not been fully analyzed due to the fact that their primary missions did not involve the moon. They had merely used the moon to configure their sensors. The data was further corroborated by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (2009 and still active). Indeed, rocks brought back to Earth by the Apollo missions had also shown evidence of water, but this was written off as contamination by the humid Houston air.
According to an interview with one of the co-authors of the paper, Lawrence Taylor, director of the Planetary Geosciences Institute at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, the most popular hypothesis for the formation of water is that it is “due to the reaction of solar wind protons with a highly reactive soil.” The moon is subjected to intense ultraviolet radiation and other influences, which cause the particles in its soil to become highly unstable and reactive. 
This is because the radiation breaks the bonds between atoms in the molecules. Many of these unstable particles are oxygen atoms. When an atom attached to another atom is knocked away by ultraviolet radiation, it leaves a sort of void which renders the remaining atom unstable. 
These voids are what Taylor calls “dangling bonds,” which need particles like protons to stabilize them. The sun ejects a constant stream of such protons (the solar wind), some of which are captured by the lunar soil, forming OH and H2O molecules. According to Taylor, “When sunlight hits a substance, it reflects certain wavelengths which are signatures of its composition.” The M3 was looking for the signature associated with OH and H2O with a device called a reflecting spectrometer, which measures wavelengths that are just a bit longer than those that are visible to us.
Comets, often called “dirty icebergs,” may also be a possible contributor to water resources. They occasionally strike the moon and may leave significant deposits of water when they do.
One important thing to note is that the distribution of water changes constantly as it evaporates — the moon has no atmosphere, and water can evaporate at the extremely low temperatures found there. This evaporation is much more pronounced closer to the equator, where there is more sunlight and higher temperatures. Less water was found in the equatorial regions than closer to the poles. 
The authors theorize that much of the water accumulates in regions that Taylor calls “cold traps,” permanently shadowed craters where evaporation is less likely to occur and where temperatures never rise above -380 degrees Fahrenheit. As Taylor explains, “Sit down with a glass of iced tea in front of you, wait about two minutes, and you’ll see it starts to perspire. It’s gathering moisture out of the air.” This is an example of a cold trap, a region that is colder than its surroundings, attracting and collecting moisture. These may provide usable sources of water for future lunar missions.
Serendipitously, NASA actually has a mission in progress to find water in such “cold traps.” Called LCROSS (Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite), it will — at around 7:30 a.m., Oct. 9 — launch its own spent rocket engine at a crater in order to generate a plume of debris. If there is indeed water ice present in the shadowed areas of the crater, the plume could be as high as 70 kilometers. The probe itself will then fly through the plume and see if it can find any evidence of water. Spectroscopes and telescopes on Earth will also be directed toward the plume.
While the authors of the paper are certain that there is water, they are not yet sure if it is actually usable and are being cautious as to the ways in which the water might be employed. It is easy to see, however, that if the water is usable, it would make a big difference for NASA’s plan to build a base on the moon (to be set up by 2024, according to National Geographic). With the presence of water, oxygen and fuel in the form of hydrogen would be available, simplifying the process and reducing the amount of both elements that will have to be carried there. 
The discovery of water on the moon is significant not just because of the technical skill involved or the direct results, but also because it implies greater possibilities and allows humanity to hope that the moon is not as harsh a mistress as she seems.

It has eluded scientists for nearly half a century. It has been one of the biggest issues in the medical field. And now, in a Thailand laboratory, a significant step has been taken in prevention of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS): Scientists have developed a vaccination that shows more potential in preventing AIDS than ever before. The experimental process was the largest and most expensive AIDS research project ever conducted. With 16,000 participants, the entire process cost a total of $105 million. The study began six years ago, and only now has it reached a palpable conclusion.
According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the organizations that conducted the study, the experiment tested a new type of vaccination known as RV144. In the two experimental groups — one of which received the vaccination while the other received a placebo — the vaccinated participants contracted AIDS at almost one-third the rate of the control group. The participants consisted of individuals aged 18–30 from several provinces near Bangkok and they were recruited from the general population, rather than from sex workers, drug injectors, or any other high-risk groups.
Gordon Rule, a biochemistry and immunology professor in the biological sciences department of the Mellon College of Science, expressed his pleasure at the discovery. “It’s a big step forward,” Rule said. The RV144 vaccination itself consisted of two separate vaccinations, neither of which worked effectively by itself. “The two different vaccines were directed at two different immune responses,” Rule said. When the immune response recognizes proteins on the surface of the virus as foreign, the body produces antibodies (known as “neutralizing” antibodies). The antibodies attach to the viral proteins and induce the destruction of the cell by macrophages, which engulf and digest the viruses. One of the vaccinations was an injection of proteins found on the surface of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). With the injection, more antibodies would be produced, reducing the likelihood of contracting AIDS. Unfortunately, on its own, the protein vaccination did not produce a sufficient number of antibodies.
The second vaccine involves the white blood cell response in the body. There are two types of T cells involved in immune response: helper T cells (Th cells) and cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells.) The Th cells are involved in all aspects of the immune system, including the production of antibodies. 
Individuals develop AIDS when the Th cells are infected by HIV. The Tc cell specifically recognizes proteins on HIV and kills them. The second vaccination increases the population of Tc cells in the body, allowing more foreign cells to be identified and killed. This method did not work on its own, however, and researchers speculate that the body’s resources would deplete in the production of Tc cells and cause even more harmful effects. It is important to note that RV144 is not completely protective. The methods involved in vaccinations only offer partially preventive measures, since the vaccination does nothing to lower the level of HIV in the bloodstream after infection. Rule advised, “People shouldn’t be careless.”
Of the future for AIDS research, Rule said, “The first thing I would try to do would be to see if you could boost or enhance the immune response, especially with the Tc cell activation, to see if you could put different HIV proteins on there that would lead to more responsive Tc cells.” He also discussed changing how the vaccinations were applied. “Varying the schedule of when people were vaccinated may improve the response.”

Human memory is not without faults, and forgetfulness is one such characteristic fault of memory. The idea of storing and implanting memories has existed in science fiction for decades. Philip K. Dick, in his novelette We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, describes a procedure for implanting prefabricated memories in a patient’s mind. While creating and implanting memories today seems a far-fetched concept, recording memories is not new. Man has recorded scenes from his life on cave walls, canvas, celluloid, and, of late, even on silicon.
An average photographer would take a series of time-disconnected pictures or videos while not recording any particular event in its entirety. Therefore, as a recording of memories, this system yields an incomplete documentation of the particular scene. A team at Microsoft Research has attempted to overcome this problem by devising a camera with certain built-in sensors that automatically take pictures of the user’s environment. 
This provides a constant stream of pictures, similar to those in a movie reel, only separated by a few seconds in time. The team christened the camera Sensecam.
This is the main input device for MyLifeBits, a project run by Microsoft Research. The goal of this project is to provide a means by which a user can document and browse through his memories using pictures, videos, and other media. In 1945, the American engineer Vannevar Bush proposed a system that would allow the user to sift through media using hyperlinks. He called it Memex, a portmanteau of memory and index. This system was vaguely similar to the World Wide Web as we know it today, and the idea has been adopted for the MyLifeBits project.
According to a paper published by the Microsoft Research team, the Sensecam is fitted with a number of sensors that measure such parameters as body heat and motion, among others. An onboard microcontroller monitors the status of the different sensors and makes decisions regarding the capturing of images. The camera can be set to take pictures every 30 seconds, though it also automatically takes pictures if any of the sensors detect interesting occurrences. For example, a camera around the user’s neck will take pictures every 30 seconds and will also capture on film any person who steps in front of the user. 
Existing models are provided with 1GB of memory, allowing the device to store up to 30,000 images captured by its VGA camera. The fish-eye lens allows for a much wider area to be photographed, making the pictures more faithful to images captured by the human eye. The rechargeable battery attached allows the camera to operate for periods longer than 24 hours, assuming it captures an image every 30 seconds.
Capturing memories is only half the objective. The team has also created an application to navigate through the many photos that the camera takes. This software can smooth out pictures that are distorted by the fish-eye lens, edit poor quality pictures, and rapidly display pictures as a time-compressed slide show in a method known as rapid serial visual presentation.
The Sensecam was initially meant to be a camera to help patients suffering from memory ailments. It was meant to be worn by the patient or clipped onto a belt or pocket, from where it can take pictures. The pictures are then stored and reviewed by the patient to recall various memories.
The Sensecam is not currently available for personal use, and only a handful have been made — only for research purposes. The biggest user of the Sensecam is Gordon Bell, a researcher working with Microsoft Research. He has volunteered to be the first test user of the MyLifeBits. Bell carries a Sensecam with him most days, makes a copy of all his bills, and even documents the different sites he visits online. 
To date, his “e-memories” exceed 350GB of stored data, and he constantly adds to his bank of memories. When CNN asked Bell if he felt this kind of technology would make humans mentally sluggish, he stated that it was one of the general concerns, but he did not believe that would be the case. 
“To me, I feel a lot freer. In a way, I feel like I still remember all that stuff, but I generally remember that [the computer is] remembering something for me so I can find it,” he said.

On his first visit to the Carnegie Mellon Café, electrical and computer engineering master’s student Isaac Jones got an unexpected surprise. His chocolate shake hid a toxin-laden garnish in the form of a rolled wafer cookie — Jones is allergic to the hazelnut contained in the cookie’s filling. Nuts are common irritants for those who suffer oral allergy syndrome — a fancy name for allergies that originate from the mouth, or food allergies. Along with nuts, many fruits and vegetables also set off allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. 
For Jones, the list includes not only a variety of tree nuts (not peanuts or pine nuts — they are not technically nuts, as the former is a bean and the latter a seed) but also some vegetables like carrots and celery.
When Jones eats an estimated four or five baby carrots, he begins to experience what he describes as a tingling in his mouth and uncomfortable restriction in his throat. Allergy symptoms are caused by mistakes in the immune system. According to Discovery Health’s website, the body produces antibodies to anything it perceives as a foreign invader. In the case of allergens, the immune system incorrectly identifies certain chemicals as toxic. This is what creates the allergic response.
In vegetables, the body is reacting to specific proteins in the cell walls. These proteins are important in the structure of the cell wall. One such protein, called an extensin, ties together the outer and inner layers of the cell wall. Similarly, Jones’ allergy to tree nuts is also set off by a protein. However, there is no evidence that the two allergies are related. Jones explained that while he experiences very similar symptoms when he eats nuts, he also begins to salivate uncontrollably. When Jones was a sophomore in high school, he had his first encounter with nut allergy. At a Super Bowl party, he was eating from a bowl of mixed nuts — mostly cashews and hazelnuts — when he found his mouth was tingling. His mother, an emergency room doctor, advised him to avoid nuts in the future.
Later on, Jones began to feel a similar reaction when eating carrots. While he did not commonly eat many nuts as a child, he said, “it was reasonably common to have a package of raw carrots in lunches. They were very often an after-school snack.”
While it is more common for allergies to be lost during puberty, an article by the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology explained that the chemical changes the body undergoes during puberty may cause allergies to either worsen or even develop during adolescence. 
Allergies that develop in later life are most commonly airborne allergies, however. Allergist Clifford Bassett, M.D., explained that many times, oral allergy syndrome is connected to seasonal airborne allergies — one out of every three people who suffer seasonal allergies may experience oral allergy symptoms.
Specific kinds of pollen that set off seasonal allergies relate to foods that are genetically similar. For example, people who find their nose running when they encounter ragweed pollen are more likely to be allergic to bananas or melons. In the case of Jones’ allergy, carrots and celery are related — both are part of the parsley family, including not only parsley, but also dill, anise, cumin, coriander, and mugwort. However, Jones said, “I’ve never knowingly consumed raw mugwort or dill in quantities that would be large enough to trigger a reaction.”
One important element of that statement is the word “raw”: in those who suffer oral allergy syndrome, the food irritant is no longer effective when the food has been cooked. The website of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia explains why: “The cooking process changes the protein enough that the immune system does not recognize [the allergen] anymore.” Like anyone with allergies, Jones must pay close attention to what he eats to ensure he does not react negatively to the food. Though he can no longer eat “ants on a log” — a raw celery stick with peanut butter and raisins he used to enjoy as a child — he is aware of his limitations. Now he knows not to eat the wafer cookie in his next Carnegie Mellon Café milkshake; he can give it to his friend instead.

Scientists find old fossil of skeleton
A fossil of the skeleton of a human ancestor, nearly 4.4 million years old, was found in Africa recently. The skeleton belongs to the species Ardipithecus ramidus and has replaced the famous skeleton Lucy as the oldest known human ancestor.
The fossil was of an adult female weighing around 120 pounds and standing four feet tall. The feet of the specimen had not developed the curved arch found in humans, and the length of the arms and legs resembled that of primitive apes or even monkeys. Scientists believe that this new Ardipithecus genus has helped clarify many doubts regarding the evolution of humans.

Telescope uses infrared light 
The Herschel Space Telescope, launched by the European Space Agency, has captured images of the Milky Way galaxy using infrared light. The telescope was able to sense the small amount of heat radiating from some of the coldest objects in the galaxy, using infrared light.
The telescope was able to obtain images from a region of the galaxy that is usually obscured in normal light. The images revealed that a number of stars are being born in this region and that this region contains a large amount of cold and unstable material. The images have shown that gas is constantly condensing in this region and that young stars in all stages of development are interspersed throughout the region.

Scientists find dinosaur eggs 
Scientists have found fossils of dinosaur eggs in a village in Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India. The eggs have been estimated to be around 65 million years old. Many layers containing clusters of eggs and dinosaur body parts were found by the researchers. The eggs have a diameter of around five to eight inches and were found in a four-foot-wide nest. 
The nest was found in a sandy region along the banks of the river Cauvery.
Scientists believe that this finding reveals that the dinosaurs came back to the same nesting ground frequently to lay eggs. The study was conducted by researchers from Periyar University.

Fungus may have wiped out forests
Recent findings published in the journal Geology have shown that an ancient fungus that lived off of dead wood covered most of the planet nearly 250 million years ago. Scientists believe that the fungus, known as Reduviasporonites, thrived during this period because most of the world’s forests had been destroyed.
During this period, the Earth had only one continent, known as Pangaea, and the findings reveal that there was little or no vegetation across the continent during this period. Basalt lava flowed across the region in that period, causing up to 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land species to become extinct.

H1N1 vaccine to arrive on Tuesday
The vaccine against the H1N1 virus is scheduled to arrive in 21 states and the cities of Washington D.C., New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles by this Tuesday. Around 600,000 doses will arrive at these places. 
Additionally, 300,000 doses of the antiviral Tamiflu are expected to arrive at various locations over the coming week. The initial doses of the vaccine will be in the form of a nasal spray. Health officials will be given the first available doses of the H1N1 vaccine.
Health officials do not recommend the vaccine for pregnant women, those with other health issues, and children below the age of 2.

Vitamin D reduces risk of falling 
According to research published in the British Medical Journal, a dose of 700–1000 international units (IU) of vitamin D can reduce the risk of falling in those over 65 years of age. IU is the international unit for measuring vitamins. 
The research has also shown that doses below 700 IU are not effective in preventing falls.
Yearly, one in three persons over the age of 65 experiences a fall and 6 percent of those falls can result in fractures. 
Thus, vitamin D, which increases the strength of the elderly and also improves their balance, could help prevent such falls.

Obesity shown to cause cancer
Researchers have shown that obesity could be a leading cause of cancer in women. Obesity is responsible for 8 percent of all the cancers in Europe. 
Some studies have shown that in the United States, obesity was responsible for almost 20 percent of all cancers. 
Scientists believe that with more people quitting smoking, obesity may soon become the leading cause of cancer within the next decade or so.
Of all the cancers linked to being overweight, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer accounted for 65 percent. 
Although scientists are unsure of why obesity can cause cancer, they believe that it has to do with the fact that more hormones are released with obesity. Hormones like estrogen, secreted in excess, could help tumors grow.

Anti-smoking drug may not cause suicide
In July, the United States ordered black box warnings on anti-smoking drugs like Chantix and Zyban following reports of depression and suicidal thoughts following the use of these drugs. 
However, recent research published in the British Medical Journal shows that there is no strong evidence indicating that Chantix is linked to suicide.
The findings were based off of data obtained from 80,660 people who used such drugs from Sept. 2006 to May 2008. Researchers did not find any reports of serious mental health problems in these users while they were using these drugs or even three months after they stopped using them.

This past week, Carnegie Mellon witnessed a plethora of cultural holidays from all over the globe. Students were able to celebrate the start of a new, colder season in their own traditional ways.
Mid-Autumn Festival
Last weekend, students gathered together to celebrate the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, in the University Center. 
The Mid-Autumn Festival is usually held in late September or early October, on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean cultures all celebrate this popular harvest festival in their own ways. It is one of the most important holidays on the Chinese calendar and marks the end of the summer harvesting season. 
Apart from being a harvest festival, this celebration also has a history of legend and myth surrounding it. The Chinese relate this day to the one on which a young girl, Chang’e, was lifted from the Earth and placed onto the moon. This story of how her fate came to be has many different versions and is a favorite among Chinese poets. Another legend associated with the moon is that of the Jade Rabbit. The Jade Rabbit is supposed to reside on the moon with Chang’e, and this myth seems to have sprung from the fact that the dark spots on the moon resemble the form of a rabbit.
Some traditional practices are used when celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival. Festival-goers indulge in delicious mooncakes — called yuebing in Mandarin — and pomelos, citrus fruits native to Southeast Asia. Popular Chinese mooncakes are small, rectangular, or circular, mildly sweet pastries that are filled with a moist lotus seed paste and surrounded by a thin crust that is made from the yolks of salted duck eggs. Parties are decorated with floating sky lanterns, autumn flowers, and traditional Asian dragon displays. People come together to celebrate the spring equinox and witness the moon at its biggest and brightest. While there are many ways of celebrating, the Asian communities are unified in their recognition of the holiday. 
“In Korea,” Jeongyoon Yu, an undecided first-year in H&SS, said, “the concept of the Mid-Autumn Festival is much like the American Thanksgiving. Instead of the Chinese and Japanese mooncake, however, [Koreans] all gather together in our traditional clothes and make a large honey rice cake to be shared by the entire family.”
Last Friday, students at Carnegie Mellon University also celebrated the end of the summer harvest season in their own special way. Students gathered at the University Center for music, dancing, traditional Asian cuisine, and socializing. The party acted not only as a traditional Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, but also signified the start of a new academic season: fall.
“What I liked best about the festival,” Jing Jing Li, an undecided first year in H&SS, said, “was how inclusive it was. I didn’t feel as if any culture was excluded. It really was an all-Asian celebration.”
Oktoberfest
Students were also given a glimpse into the German Oktoberfest in the Schatz Dining Room on Sept. 24 when the kitchen staff served up some traditional German cuisine. 
Oktoberfest is a 16-day festival held in Munich, Germany every year. It is one of the largest world celebrations, attracting some six million people every year. 
It is safe to say that food and drink are huge components of Oktoberfest. During celebration, visitors dress up in traditional garb and eat vast amounts of traditional German food, including pork, sausage, chicken, pretzels, potatoes, pancakes, and dumplings.  
But more than food, this German festival is about the great German beer. Oktoberfest is known for its giant beer mugs — steins — and almost endless supply of beer, and people from all over the country and world flock to Munich to enjoy some of the alcohol during this time.
The original Oktoberfest began in 1810 when the Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen celebrated their marriage. In 1819, Munich took responsibility for the festival and agreed that it would be celebrated every year without exception. 
Reviews of the quality of food at the Schatz Oktoberfest varied, but overall students found the idea of a traditional German celebration on campus to be exciting and internationally interesting. 
“I love it when campus recognizes international holidays,” Li
said. “It allows students to experience the world right here on 
campus.”
Dussehra and Diwali
Celebrations during this time are not restricted to East Asia and Germany; they extend to the country of India, as well. Diwali, the biggest Hindu festival, and also celebrated by Sikhs and Jains, falls during this time of the year. The dates vary every year according to the Hindu lunar calendar, and this year Diwali will be celebrated with its usual pomp and show on Oct. 17. 
The reasoning behind celebrating Diwali, also called Deepavali, which literally means “festival of lights,” draws from an ancient Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The Ramayana tells the story of a young prince — Ram — who is exiled from his kingdom along with his beautiful wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshman, and is condemned to roam the forests for 14 years. 
During their exile, Ravana, a 10-headed demon and the ruler of an island called Lanka — analogous to present day Sri Lanka — hears about Sita’s wondrous beauty and decides to kidnap her for himself. Once he succeeds, he brings Sita back with him to Lanka and keeps her prisoner in his vast palace gardens. 
Overcome with grief, Ram summons all the help he can get, builds a bridge of stones to Lanka, and succeeds in defeating Ravana in a final battle. This day, on which good triumphed over evil, is a special one in Hindu mythology and is celebrated as Dussehra. This year, Dussehra was celebrated on Sept. 28, and roughly two weeks later, when Ram came home with his rescued wife, Diwali is celebrated to rejoice in his return. 
The night of Ram’s return to his kingdom was a new moon night, causing the entire city to be cloaked in darkness. In order to brighten up the city, all the citizens of the kingdom lit lamps in their homes and lined their courtyards and windows with lights, making the city bright and beautiful. To this day, on Diwali, Hindus light lamps and celebrate Ram’s homecoming. They also burst firecrackers and set off fireworks — the Indian sky on Diwali night is a sight to behold.
The Sri Venkateswara temple in Pittsburgh has an annual Diwali celebration that is open for everyone to attend. They have delicious Indian food, sweets, dance performances, and firework displays — all the components of an enjoyable Diwali. OM, the spiritual organization for Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs, usually organizes a bus to transport students to the temple. Check their website at www.cmu-om.org/ for more information.
The legend of Ram and his journey is of such great importance to Hindus because Ram is considered to be a reincarnation of one of the three most important Hindu gods: Vishnu. Hinduism mainly worships three gods: Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the sustainer; and Shiva, the destroyer. Vishnu is the people’s god and solves their problems and soothes their miseries. From time to time, he takes the form of a human or animal and comes to the Earth to directly influence the people. Ram is one of Vishnu’s most popular reincarnations. 
Due to the vast number of gods in Hindu mythology, the festival of Dussehra has more than story behind its celebration. Like most cultures, the change of seasons has a significant impact on the festivals in Hinduism, and Hindus celebrate Navaratri, literally meaning “nine-day festival,” at the beginning of autumn every year. This festival, which culminates on a 10th day — Dussehra — celebrates the female goddess Durga, because she finally slays a demon she has been battling for nine days. Thus, in both traditions, Dussehra represents the triumph of good over evil.
Apart from the usual forms of celebration like visiting temples and distributing sweets, Navaratri is characterized by a popular form of Indian dance called garba. Garba originated in the western state of Gujarat, and during this festival, people get together and dance to catchy music.
The colorful dance forms of garba are not just seen in India, but here on our campus as well. Last Friday, OM organized their annual Navaratri Garba, giving a chance for the student body to take part in Hindu traditions.
Carnegie Mellon has a truly diverse population, and it is great to see a facet of every culture being celebrated here on campus. If you want to learn more about other countries and their customs, try to attend the events happening around campus — people are more than welcoming and are happy you want to learn about their traditions.

Last summer, I traveled to Rabat, Morocco to take part in the SIT Morocco Intensive Language and Culture Program. The program consisted of several parts: cultural experiences, excursions, lectures, Arabic class, and home stay. The goal of the study abroad program was to provide an eight-week introduction to Moroccan culture and standard Arabic, and this was achieved through cultural immersion and weekend trips intended to explore Morocco’s vibrant culture. The language component of the program was rigorous and consisted of an introductory language class. The cultural component also had an introductory cultural class, and all these classes had a course load of nine to 13 units. Both classes included participatory roles and field trips to help enhance the learning experience. In addition to learning Arabic in the classrooms, the program also offered eight weeks of language and cultural practice in the city of Rabat.
Classes were held every day (including Saturday during the first two weeks) for three hours. I learned the alphabet in one day and spent more time practicing it and learning how to write the script and the exceptions in connecting Arabic letters. The instructor of the course did not speak English, so body language and the translations from the two French speakers in the class were my only form of communication. But as the class progressed, she began to communicate with me using simple grammar and vocabulary words with which I was familiar.
The streets of Rabat proved to be my biggest learning ground during my time there, and I saw, heard, and learned how life in Morocco operated. For instance, crossing the streets is a gradual process, and one does not typically wait for the lights to change. Shortly after arrival, I had difficulty crossing the streets and walking in the streets due to my fear of bumping into people. As my stay progressed, I noticed that the natives stopped in the middle of the street and even bumped into each other, and this made me begin to feel more and more comfortable walking.
The program included an introduction to bargaining in which I was given 10 dirhams and asked to shop in the market. In an effort to make up for my lack of language ability, I motioned to the shopkeepers to write the price. As I became more conversational in Arabic, I would greet the shopkeepers in Arabic and have conversations with them. I learned the games that they play as well: The first price is always a teaser price, which they do not expect to be paid. I remember an instance when I went with a friend to buy a soccer jersey. The shopkeeper said the price was 100 dirhams, but before I began serious negotiations, he lowered the price to 90 dirhams. Not all shopkeepers bargain, however: Shopkeepers that sell toiletries are very friendly but have fixed prices.
The objective of the excursions during the program was to show different parts of Morocco to the participants in order to allow them to develop a better understanding of the culture. There were two excursions: the first was to Marrakesh and Essaouira in the south, and the second was to Fez and a village called Briksha in the north.
At Marrakesh, I visited the mansion of a former slave built by his previous master. The temperature during my stay was quite high at around 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Overall, Marrakesh was not a very welcoming city, and having lived in Rabat, the amount of tourism and the way locals were primed to sell to foreigners was not appealing to me. When I arrived at Essaouira, the annual Gunawa music festival was in session. The music festival included various genres of music and gave me a view into the music of southern Morocco, which is similar to sub-Saharan African music. At Essaouira, I got a chance to see how woodworks are crafted and was even able to try and make part of a piece.
The northern excursion to Fez included a visit to the medina, which is Arabic for city, specifically the walled parts of the city. Being in the medina was like being transported in time. There were no bikes or cars, and only donkeys and horses were used to transport goods. As part of the tour, I visited a tannery that used traditional methods of dying leather.
During my time in Morocco, I had the opportunity to live with a family in the medina of Rabat. The houses are built in an Andalusian style — a square design with a large open hole in the center. My family was made up of six members: a father, mother, two sisters, and two brothers. Dinners were eaten late — around 11 p.m. or midnight — and the family always ate together. The family ate from a single large plate and bread was used as a spoon. On Friday, we always ate couscous for lunch, and in an attempt to make me eat more, food would always be pushed to my side of the plate and I would be told to “*kull*” — meaning “eat” in Darija, Morrocco’s dialect of Arabic.
Unfortunately, my home stay mother was very sick, and I believed it would be best if the family focused on her rather than on me. After much contemplation, I went through with a switch and moved into a new family’s house. The first night with my new family was rough, as I kept thinking about the decision and its possible impacts. After the change, I visited my first home stay mother often to see how she was doing, and I would typically meet members of her family on the streets.
My new family was made up of a father, a mother, and three sons. The new family gave me an opportunity to validate some of my cultural observations. I noticed that shay — Moroccan tea, which is mint tea with a lot of sugar — is a staple and is served in all homes. Based on the activities of my previous family, I had assumed that most Moroccans did not pray frequently, but my new family prayed a lot and were a lot more religious in general. This realization gave me a better understanding of Islam and its various levels of participation.
The power of language became apparent to me during my time in Morocco. Though I entered the country with practically no French or Arabic experience, I was able to communicate within the first three weeks of my stay. Using body language and the words I had learned, I was able to confidently order coffee from a coffee shop and communicate where I was going to my host family.
Apart from the language skills, cultural awareness, and understanding, I also learned that other ways of life are possible and do exist. After living in the same British-dominated systems for such a long time, it becomes easy for one to forget that other ways of living are viable. This reawakening enabled me to expand and challenge myself to think in new and different ways.

There are different types of recipes — some that train us on specific techniques, some that take us on exotic adventures, and others that inspire us to put a new spin on the recipe. For me, making this cheesecake lets me take a break from whatever is going on. The recipe requires minimal preparation with a good balance of technique, but it is not so complicated that I am overwhelmed when I am making it on a bad day.
Generously butter a 9-inch Springform pan. It helps to cut a piece of parchment paper for the bottom of the pan for easier pan-to-plate transfer when serving. If you try this, make sure you also butter the parchment paper. In the case that you do not have a Springform pan, you can use a regular baking pan, but definitely line your pan with parchment paper.
Ingredients for the crust (measure everything out and chill it in the fridge while you make other preparations):
Three-fourths cup all-purpose flour
One-fourth cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, chilled
3 teaspoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ice-cold water
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
For the crust, put all the ingredients, except for water, together in a bowl. Every ingredient must be cold, because you don’t want to melt the butter in the process. With a fork, or a pastry knife if you have one, mash in the butter and the other ingredients until the mix resembles moist sand.
Add half a tablespoon of ice-cold water at a time and keep mashing the crust mixture. You are looking for a large lump that still retains a moist, sandy resemblance, not a paste.
Dump the crust mixture into the pan, and with a glass covered from the outside in cling wrap, pat the mixture evenly over the pan. I find that it’s best to start with the glass and then finish patting with your hand. You don’t have to worry about making the crust perfectly even, as it will be covered with cheesecake mixture.
Once the crust is even, use a fork to poke the crust all over, leaving around a quarter inch to an inch between each poke.
Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove.
Cool the pan on a rack, or by the window if the weather is cool, before starting to mix the cheesecake batter. You want the batter and the crust to be at the same temperature so that the batter will be cooked evenly and gently. If you use a Springform pan, wrap the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil, as the pan tends to leak.
Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Ingredients for the cheesecake:
2 packs of regular cream cheese, room temperature
1.5 cups granulated sugar
1 cup yogurt, the regular packaged cup
5 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
One-half cup of raisins, cranberry, or any dried fruit of preference. Chocolate chips are optional.
Soften the cream cheese with an electric mixer at medium speed; then cream it with sugar. Creaming is a process in which sugar is slowly added to softened cream cheese or butter. The two are then mixed together for about five to seven minutes at medium speed until light and fluffy. This process incorporates little air bubbles into the batter, and as the cake is baked, the air bubbles expand and elevate the cake.
Add the yogurt. I have never tried flavored yogurt, but attempt it if you dare. Make sure you mix it thoroughly.
Add one egg at a time while beating the mixture at medium speed. Mix well before adding another egg. After the third egg, I usually stop and use a rubber spatula to scrape down the entire bowl to ensure the ingredients have mixed well. I repeat this process again after the fifth egg. Add the vanilla extract and mix for another five to 10 seconds.
Pour the cheesecake mixture into the pan. If you want to put in any dried fruit or chocolate, drop them into the cake after you’ve poured the mix in. As a safety precaution, I generally put the cake pan over a larger rimmed baking pan. This makes sure that if there’s any leaking, the oven is protected.
After 50 minutes of baking, gently tap the pan with a wooden spoon. The middle of the cake should still jiggle a little bit like uncooked egg. With the center slightly uncooked, turn off the oven and leave the oven door partially open. This way, the cake cools slowly and continues to cook even after the oven is turned off. Slowly cooling the cake prevents cracking of the cake and, hopefully, you’ll get a smooth cheesecake.
You can also bake cheesecake in a warm water bath by placing the cheesecake pan in water in another bigger pan. Cover the cake pan with several sheets of aluminum foil to ensure no leaks. The water bath allows the cheesecake to cook at a gentler temperature.
Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least four hours before serving or keep it in the fridge overnight.
If you don’t have a Springform pan, run a small knife under hot water, pat it dry, and gently run it around the perimeter of the pan. Using a plate that is slightly smaller than the pan and covered in cling wrap, invert the cheesecake out of the pan; be careful, as the cake is very soft.
This is a cook-friendly recipe, as the ingredients require a minimum amount of measuring. The cream cheese, eggs, and yogurt already come in fixed quantities, and all that needs to be measured is the sugar and a little bit of flour. After all, you can practically eyeball the amount of vanilla extract and raisins. With cooler weather and closed windows, baking this cake will fill your room with the delicious smell of sugar, vanilla, and cheesecake.

Imagination, utopian societies, and waffles made last Saturday night an excellent creative combination. Visionary Ideas for this World or Another, an event sponsored by the Waffle Shop, a Carnegie Mellon art project, was a satellite event for the Miller Gallery’s current exhibit 29 Chains to the Moon. 
In the gallery exhibit, artists display innovative design ideas that envision a better future for humanity. The Visionary Ideas event used this same concept, but the contestants displayed their ideas for the future through presentations, and the person who presented the best idea was awarded a year’s supply of waffles and a $250 cash prize, as well as the opportunity to have his or her vision “broadcast to the cosmos.”
At 9 p.m. at the East Liberty Presbyterian Church, eight contestants with very different outlooks on life gathered to present their perspectives on how to better the future of humanity. Each had five minutes to explain their vision and then two minutes to answer questions from the three judges. An impressive-looking organ provided atmospheric music, playing a series of intimidating chords when a contestant’s time was up.
Ken Binsley and Less Jangley also addressed the issue of communication in their presentation, which embodied many a music-lover’s most cherished dream: to replace normal speech with song. This, they claimed, would reduce the spending of individuals and government on health care and would advance the cause of interspecies and extraterrestrial communication. Plus, making every day “42nd Street Day” would undoubtedly brighten the lives of many.
Oscar Peters described his theory of Accelerated De-evolution, in which people, though keeping their minds intact, would devolve more and more with each generation, so that a family portrait five generations from now would include some Homo sapiens, but also some chimps, a Neanderthal, amphibians, and other members of our inauspicious beginnings.
Vanessa German drew upon the power of the human mind in her vision of the future, which was titled “The Power of Imagination.” Pointing out that it is scientifically proven that human minds are at their most energetic when creating something, she proposed a society in which imagination is literally used to power life — listening to Mozart would power a toaster and dancing in the kitchen would turn on the lights.
Contestants had varying beliefs as to why their own innovations were the best. Contestant Gregg Pangle, who sported a Salvador Dali-esque mustache that disappeared by the end of his performance, explained why he wanted to fill the world with clones of himself in simple terms: “Because I’m a genius.”
The youngest innovators were Alex Korzeniwsky and Avalon Perdriel-Arons, fifth graders at the Waldorf School of Pittsburgh who presented their idea for a “Gel House.” Together, they described a house that would build itself, growing in size until it was told to stop. It would supply its own heat and lights and decorate itself according to its inhabitants’ moods.
After the presentations were completed, audience members voted for the winner. The runners-up were Pangle, Korzeniwsky and Perdriel-Arons, and the winner was German, who mamboed her way to the stage to be wreathed in two flowering laurels and carried out of the church in a chair, heralded by organ music and cheers from the audience. 
When asked how she felt about her victory, German poetically referred to both her personal experience and to her ride out of the church on a chair. “You will rise, not on your own, but on the shoulders of others,” she said. After the event, judges, contestants, and audience members met at the Waffle Shop to partake in some delicious midnight waffles.
The judging table was composed of Janera Solomon, the executive director of the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater; Bill Peduto, a Pittsburgh City Councilman; and Renee Piechocki, an artist and the director of the Office for Public Arts of Pittsburgh. 
“Well, I knew it would be diverse and creative and compelling, and that’s what happened tonight. [The Waffle Shop is] a wonderful example of the artist being a civic engagement instigator,” Piechocki responded after some thought. 
The event was filled with creative and mind-blowing ideas, which kept the audience laughing and caused them to truly think. All in all, it showed newcomers and reminded old customers what the Waffle Shop project is all about.

Wall Street. Whitehall. Bourbon Street. Sunset Boulevard. Pennsylvania Avenue.
Property magnates like Donald Trump can only dream of owning all of these iconic spaces. Of course, the same property magnates probably wouldn’t choose to construct a sewage treatment plant on the National Mall or a power plant at 10 Downing St., but with the new Monopoly City Streets (www.monopolycitystreets.com), all these things, and many more, have already happened on properties worldwide.
Monopoly City Streets, which went live on Sept. 9, brings the greed and scheming of the classic Monopoly to a new level. In order to promote the newest edition of this board game, the producer of the game, Hasbro, has leveraged the scalability of Web 2.0. Anybody who has wasted hours exploring the world using Google Maps can understand the appeal of being able to own property on any street on Earth.
The few weeks since Monopoly City Streets launched have not been without the usual problems faced by online services, however. According to the official blog, the site recorded over 1.7 million unique visitors on its first day, which quickly overloaded the servers. Since then, the game has expanded its capacity and is now operating more smoothly. The first few weeks of service were rife with glitches and bugs, but Hasbro engineers have now addressed most of these issues. A complete game reset took place a week after the release to prevent unfair advantages due to early bugs. As with the classic game of Monopoly, though, cheating players have been a problem since the game’s launch.
While cheaters in a board game are fairly obvious and easily dealt with, cheaters online can be more difficult to catch and have far-reaching consequences. Players using multiple accounts can take advantage of more starting funds, which allows them to control more property — imagine being able to start with $30,000 instead of the usual $1500 in the board game. More money in the game also causes inflation, which means normal players have a harder time finding property at reasonable prices.
Game play in Monopoly City Streets is straightforward. Starting with $3 million, players try to find streets to buy. According to the official FAQ, all streets in the OpenStreetMap database are available, which allows for a lot of choices. After buying streets, players have the option of using their remaining funds to build on those streets. Possible options include the frugal “Green House,” costing $50,000 and giving $8000 daily rent, all the way up to the “Monopoly Tower,” which costs an impressive $100 million and yields $850,000 in daily rent. Earning money in City Streets is deterministic: A certain rent is paid daily based on the number and type of buildings owned, provided a player logs in on that day. After two weeks of inactivity, the bank repossesses all properties. As with any Monopoly game, Chance cards appear from time to time, in this case at random intervals. These cards might add or detract from a player’s balance, or they might allow the construction of a special building, such as a stadium or power plant. Other Chance cards contain codes for discounted purchases on Hasbro’s online store.
At its heart, Monopoly City Streets is still a marketing tool, and is not enough to displace the popular World of Warcraft. The initial appeal of being able to buy the street where one grew up does not last for more than a few days, and most major streets are already taken and require a large sum to buy, so owning Forbes Avenue will be out of most people’s price range. The deterministic nature of rent payments detracts from the game’s excitement. The Monopoly board game is fun because of the luck involved; one can win or lose on a single roll of the dice. In the online version, players can try to buy properties from other players and use special buildings to sabotage their opponents, but often the people on each side of this transaction will only know the other’s username.
While Monopoly City Streets will not replace the classic fun of the board game or the city-building strategy of games like SimCity, it displays great creativity on the part of its designers. The breadth of information freely available on the Internet means that this will not be the last attempt at integrating classic games with novel technology.

If John Mayer was at the top of your music list or held a sacred place in your iTunes memory, worry no more, because Mayer is resurfacing with his new album, Battle Studies, which will be released Nov. 17, 2009 on Columbia Records. This fourth studio album is co-produced by John Mayer and Steve Jordan, and includes sounds from ’70s and ’80s California rock and pop. Battle Studies was recorded in a private home in California where Mayer lived for six months before heading to Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. The album has some great new songs, including the first single “Who Says,” in which Mayer questions conventional society norms, along with “Heartbreak Warfare,” “Assassin,” and “War of My Life,” which feature universal themes. “Rock Song” and a reinterpretation of “Crossroads” give us a chance to hear the famous guitar playing we know Mayer for.
A John Mayer tour is currently being planned to begin in early 2010, following the release of Battle Studies. Until then, fans can see Mayer in concert in two performances with the John Mayer Trio, composed of Mayer, Jordan, and Pino Palladino. The first performance is on Dec. 29 in San Diego at the Copley Symphony Hall and a New Year’s Eve show on Dec. 31 at the Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The first concert is replacing Mayer’s annual Holiday Revue performance, and both events will be raising money for Military Outreach Ministry Camp Pendleton (MOM) and the Veterans Health Research Institute (NCIRE), two veterans’ charities.
Battle Studies can be expected to be a great album, considering Mayer’s notable history. Aside from the seven Grammys (one of which he won in 2003 for the Best Male Pop Vocal) that he has under his belt and the 12.5 million albums he has sold worldwide, Mayer was placed on Time magazine’s Time 100 list of the most influential contemporary thinkers, leaders, artists, and entertainers in May 2007. He was also featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine’s annual “Guitar” issue. Mayer achieved multi-platinum status with his first two studio albums, Room for Squares and Heavier Things, and his music has been featured in hit movies such as The Bucket List. He has even written pieces for magazines, including the likes of Esquire, a men’s magazine.
Mayer’s 2006 album, Continuum, was also produced by Mayer and Jordan. The first single on this album, “Waiting on the World to Change,” is a song that almost everyone knows and loves, and it became popular very quickly. Within a week of its release on July 11, 2006, it was the third-most downloaded song of the week on the iTunes Music Store.
On the performance side, Mayer has collaborated with a wide variety of artists across the genres, including hip-hop, rock, and the blues. He has performed or recorded with BB King, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and The Dixie Chicks, and his upcoming album features new teen sensation Taylor Swift in the song “Half of My Heart.”
Fans take Mayer very seriously as an artist, but he shows himself to be another person. “Here it is. Gibberish. Lyrics that mean nothing. Arrangements set in sand. But a vibe. Maybe it grows into a full song, maybe it just informs another. But being my own producer, as all songwriters are, means saying to myself, ‘just write it,’ ” Mayer said on his website johnmayer.com. “Judging a song while writing it is like grounding a toddler. I don’t know how, but trust me.” And from words like these, we get the John Mayer we know and love today.
Follow Mayer on Twitter to hear about new album releases and listen to his new single “Who Says,” which was released on Sept. 24.

A couple weeks back, I was hyping Eugene Onegin, a performance that showed at the Pittsburgh Opera House through Oct. 4. 
I was lucky enough to catch it last Tuesday (no small feat considering my schedule nowadays), and watching it, I realized just how far Pittsburgh has come. Pittsburgh was — and still is — thought of as a working-class, hard-times town, complete with bad air, broken factories, and the like; not necessarily the place you’d expect to find great opera, dance, classical music, or other “high culture” things. 
But with the Pittsburgh Symphony, Pittsburgh Opera, and other world-class cultural institutions, it’s a great time for the arts in Pittsburgh.
With the economic rebound comes a greater rebound in culture, and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, along with smaller arts institutions, has been a major part of this rebound. 
Not only do we get the popular musicians of the day, but we have a wide variety of international artists coming through. Just this past March, Portuguese superstar Mariza was at the Benedum Center, part of a line of artists brought to the Byham Theater. 
Starring in Onegin was Anna Samuil, a rising Russian opera star, along with Dwayne Croft and Suzanne Mentzer, both mainstays at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. 
The Pittsburgh Symphony has a world-renowned conductor in Austrian Manfred Honeck, and its Pops wing has the great Marvin Hamlisch, one of only two people to have won an Emmy, an Oscar, a Grammy, a Tony, a Golden Globe Award, and a Pulitzer Prize. 
Broadway musicals routinely come through Pittsburgh on tour, with performances of Rent and Fiddler on the Roof featuring original cast members headlining shows in recent months. 
Pittsburgh has also been the host of a dancing explosion, with many new experimental and modern dance troupes springing up.
So go out, see a show, catch a concert, or watch a dance performance, and remind yourself how lucky you are to be going to school in a city that is blossoming culturally.

According to an article in this week’s issue, 50 people showed up for the first glee club meeting of the year, which the writer notes is a harbinger of what could be the best year ever for the group. Honestly, this just reminded me that the new television series Glee, shown on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Fox, is pretty solid and you should consider watching it. Also, “Did you know?” will now be sponsored by the Fox Network.

The Tartan announces that its “Coed of the Week” feature is having a new contest for men wherein male admirers of the aforementioned coeds can send in names of whom they’d like to see selected by the photography staff. I wonder if this sounded as creepy and stalker-esque to students back then as it does now.

“Four Students Injured in MMA Brawl” is the headline this week after a fight broke out involving more than 40 students outside the Margaret Morrison Apartments. Someone even brought nunchakus to the altercation and caused another student serious facial injuries. Boy, for at least one day, Carnegie Mellon’s campus actually did turn into an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) ring.

In an article entitled “Executive Privilege,” the editor-in-chief apologizes following the printing of an incomplete page in the previous week’s issue with unfinished captions, dummy headlines, etc. He follows with a long description of The Tartan’s production process that probably prompted the dozen or so people who actually read his article to doze off.

A review of the novel Breaking Dawn, the final book of the Twilight series, states that the book lacks good role models with characters dissuading others from college, marrying young, and having children at a young age. Darn, I just knew I shouldn’t have been basing my life decisions off a book about attractive vampires and emo chicks.

Dear Prerna,
I am a first-year computer science major and I have a lot of work to do, but, like every other student, I want to do well in school and still have a great time. For my programming class, I had an assignment that I knew would take me a while to crack. I had initially intended to stay in that night while my friends went out, but while I was about to begin, I happened to see that my roommate had left his homework assignment finished and open on his computer. I sneakily e-mailed his assignment to my computer and used his solution as an outline for mine, and so I was able to finish my homework quickly and go out with my friends. However, now I feel guilty about my actions. What should I do?
— Guilty Roommate
Dear Guilty Roommate,
College is a place where you will make several choices — some good, others bad. However, you need to be aware of the repercussions of your actions at all times. Parties and other fun opportunities will come and go, but it is up to you to make the better choice. Sometimes, people forget that they are in college to study and build a future for themselves, yet each one of us has our weak moments, so don’t beat yourself up over it.
My suggestion would be to speak to your roommate and own up to your mistake. Since he is your roommate, chances are that he might help you understand the homework better the next time, not get you into trouble, and be supportive — of course, this depends on your relationship with your roommate. There are other places on campus where you can find help, too, like Academic Development, which offers tutoring services. Start working on your own homework assignments early; it will only benefit you.
Good Luck,
— Prerna
Dear Prerna,
I am starting to develop feelings for this girl I just got to know. She’s great, funny, and gorgeous. However, there is a slight problem — her football-playing boyfriend. In my defense, she flirts with me and treats me specially. I don’t know what to do. Should I confess my feelings to her and sabotage her relationship or simply suppress my growing feelings?
— The Better Bet
Dear Better,
Wow, you’ve gotten yourself into quite the situation here, and with a footballer’s girlfriend. Firstly, I suggest you find out whether her feelings toward you are romantic or if she’s just being a great friend. Some girls also have the tendency to be extra friendly with boys just to make their boyfriend jealous.
My recommendation would be to awaken that tough football player-like attitude within you and go speak to her. Tell her how you feel and ask her how she feels. If she says she likes you or is interested, I think your road is pretty easy from there. If she is confused, then be there for her, and support her decision. If she is using you, or is simply not interested, then you’re just wasting your time — there are many other fish in the sea. Speak to her directly and confidently, and if you’re afraid her boyfriend might beat you up, come to me, and I’ll teach you how to throw a couple of solid punches.
Man it up!
— Prerna

On Sept. 26, several Carnegie Mellon students, along with other Pittsburgh community members, were arrested by Pittsburgh police and charged with disturbing the peace.
Junior art major Casey Li Brander was walking across the lawn of the Cathedral of Learning when riot police came onto the scene. She stated in an e-mail that the police used smoke bombs and pepper spray on the crowds on the lawn.
According to Brander, she was not aware of any organized protests happening at the Cathedral of Learning, and was crossing the lawn to get from Fifth Avenue to Forbes Avenue.
According to another Carnegie Mellon student, who wished not to be identified due to his pending trial, there was an organized protest occurring downtown at the Allegheny County Jail.
He said that he was downtown when a friend sent him a text message about the protest, and so he joined a group of Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students, as well as individuals he identified as “anarchists.”
He referred to the protest as “quiet,” and said that some of the protesters who grew bored decided to run a few blocks away to “confuse the police.” The police followed them down a block, but otherwise did nothing else threatening, unlike Brander’s encounter.
He said that it was not until after he was leaving the protest that he and the others were arrested. While some of the protesters left on buses, he was among a group who walked from Downtown on Forbes. After passing Duquesne University, he said, the group noticed that they were being trailed by a group of police. They were also being approached by police in front of them.
The officers in front of the group told them they could not continue up Forbes and needed to turn around. It was at this point that he said the group was trapped, and the police came through the crowd to begin arresting some of the people.
The student was charged with disturbing the peace, and he said it was because they had assembled too large of a crowd. He was detained for several hours at Allegheny County Jail and will go to trial on Oct. 21.
A Facebook event titled “SOLIDARITY AGAINST BARBARITY: Support Casey Li Brander at trial on Wednesday” created by a Carnegie Mellon senior and social and decision sciences major Stuti Pandey urges support for Brander along with the other Carnegie Mellon students involved in the arrests. According to the group’s information, students’ trials will be held on Oct. 21 and 23, but Brander’s court date was set earlier, on Sept. 30. Brander was unavailable for comment on the results of her trial.
In a Facebook message sent to members of “Carnegie Mellon Students for Barack Obama (Official Chapter),” Brander urged action on the part of Carnegie Mellon students for her and other students who were involved in the arrests. In the message, she noted that eight Carnegie Mellon students, along with at least 100 Pittsburgh community members, were arrested that night.

The changes that have been made to dining services at Carnegie Mellon have been obvious to anyone who has a meal plan, but recently, it has been revealed that there might be some things about the new company that students can’t see.
A flyer was circulating the campus last week that suggested CulinArt is treating its employees unfairly. The flyer states that workers are accusing CulinArt of eliminating their salary contributions to their health care and pension plans and that CulinArt is refusing to honor worker seniority.
The flyer also stated that Culin-Art is proposing more contract changes that would be detrimental to employees. These changes include no first year wage increases, a dramatic increase in health care costs, and elimination of long- and short-term disability coverage and benefits.
CulinArt management was either unable or unwilling to comment on these accusations when questioned by The Tartan.
CulinArt workers refused to comment on their feelings about the situation. Many said they were worried that their jobs would be threatened if they publicly gave their opinion.
The director of Housing and Dining Services, Kim Abel, was limited in what she could discuss, although the proceedings and negotiations between CulinArt and its employees are continuing. She was able to comment on who these negotiations are affecting, however: “CulinArt employs both union and non-union staff. They are currently in negotiation with the union staff. 
Union negotiations are confidential, and therefore, CulinArt is not able to provide information about any concerns being addressed during the negotiations.”
Abel added, “Housing and Dining Services has explained the negotiation process as students or staff have asked. We also continue to support the negotiating that is occurring between union employees and CulinArt.”
At this point, the campus community cannot be made aware of what is happening in these negotiations, but a concern for many students is that they are going to lose some of the food workers that they have built relationships with. 
Senior directing major Tina Robinson said, “I hate to think that we could lose some of the workers. I’ve been here for a full three years, and the best part of getting a meal [is] the interaction that I get to have with the workers. They are more than workers. They have become my friends. I want to help them fight against this injustice.”
Abel said that student opinion matters in all areas of Housing and Dining Services, but “given the confidential nature of the labor negotiations, it would be difficult for a student to generate an informed opinion.”
However, the workers are calling for student support during this negotiation process. There will be a meeting for students who want to get involved. The date and location of this meeting have yet to be announced. They have also asked students to call (412) 471-0690 or to e-mail rgray@seiu32bj.org and leave a message with their name and contact information to show their support for the workers.

Carnegie Mellon has recently welcomed   computational biology as an official department in the School of Computer Science. 
Along with this new expansion and future possibility comes a unique prestige, as the Lane Center for Computational Biology is “the first computational biology department in the country to be part of a computer science school.”
“Carnegie Mellon has strong traditions of interdisciplinary research and of pioneering new fields, such as computational biology, [which] occur at the intersections of those disciplines,” said Randal Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science, in an interview for the School of Computer Science website.
Daryl Yeo, a sophomore computer science major, also spoke highly of the addition to the university, and said he could not deny the proposed success. “It is a new and emerging field ... and combines two groundbreaking fields together for the betterment of mankind. Biology will go far with the marriage of a renowned CS school.” He also went on to say that by having a research center for computational biology readily available, prospective students will definitely be attracted to Carnegie Mellon, and it could not have come at a better time.
One practice that the Lane Center employs is active learning. This process, in basic terminology as explained in a separate interview by Robert Murphy, director of the Lane Center, involves “using computational models [to] determine which experiments are best.” This will reduce the amount and frequency of physical experimentation as countless trials can be tested virtually.
Murphy also brought up the Expeditions Grant, whose computational biology focus is model checking. This is, as Murphy describes, a “complimentary method to active learning” that “potentially allows us to decide whether or not a model is internally consistent.” So, as evident from both active learning and model checking, computational biology can definitely help us out as humans.
When discussing specific uses, Yeo brought up genomics and mentioned that “the mapping of the human genome” might be one of the many expected applications of computational biology. 
As those in the world of technology know, trying to successfully map human beings’ DNA has been an ongoing quest for quite some time. 
“Our DNA contains a large amount of information that needs to be processed,” Yeo says, “and computers and certain algorithms can aid in that.”
Murphy hints that not all professionals in this specific field need to be experts with computers, as there are many different talents that people can contribute to the whole. “In some cases, the hard part is figuring out how to do efficient computation ... but in other cases, the hard part is thinking about what it is or how it is you should do the calculation ... and it may not be all that complex.”
However, there is a time when computer specialists are just the ones needed for the job: “Because, typically, computation biologists are dealing with either large data sets or systems of large numbers ... often computing becomes a limiting factor.”
Some reporting contributed by Abhay Buch and Byron Spice.

The study was based on data reported to the federal government, and it illustrated that the percentage of a college or university’s budget spent on actual instruction has declined, while the amount allocated to administrative costs has escalated, according to a New York Times report.
The Delta Project is a nonprofit aiming to enhance the quality of American higher education while focusing on monitoring and lowering costs.
Jane Wellman, the executive director of the Delta Project on Post-secondary Education Costs, Productivity and Accountability, said, “The institutions ... are slowly disinvesting in the teaching function.... Students are paying more, and a greater share of the costs, but are arguably getting less.”
In 1995, public research institutions spent 64.4 percent of students’ tuition on instruction, yet in 2006 — when the study was done — it had declined to 63 percent. At public community colleges, the budget went from 52.8 percent to 50.2 percent, but private research universities, on average, suffered the most.
Instruction at private research colleges went from being allocated a 62.3 percent share in 1995 down to 57.9 percent in 2006. Essentially, education shares declined everywhere.
Additionally, the portion universities allocated to administration and support rose everywhere. 
However, at private research institutions, tuition increased to match spending on educational instruction, meaning that the amount spent on instruction rose.
At public research universities, had tuition increased just to match educational instruction spending, prices would have increased only 2.5 percent, as opposed to 29.8 percent. 
Similarly, state and community college tuition would have declined by 2.1 percent and 5.8 percent instead of rising by 29 percent and 18.1 percent, respectively — in large part due to decreases in government spending.
“I find it somewhat a portrait of society. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle, well, they get poorer too,” said R.F. Culbertson III, Carnegie Mellon professor of entrepreneurship.
Some students do qualify for aid, though, because of their exceptional intelligence or financial circumstances.
“I heard once that tuition has an element of progressive taxation. 
“Something like 70 cents of every dollar of tuition increase is returned to students with greater financial need,” said Baruch Fischhoff, head of the decision science major at Carnegie Mellon.
“Students in the American middle class are in a tough position,” said Sarah Strano, a senior civil engineering student at Carnegie Mellon. “Often, their parents can’t afford to write a check for their tuition, but they don’t necessarily qualify for a lot of aid either. Having to worry about paying back student loans can significantly decrease the opportunities students are willing or able to take.”
The Delta Project’s study does suggest that students at Carnegie Mellon and other elite private research institutions are getting an advantageous return on their investment.
“A reasonable question for any institution is whether it provides something valuable that students can’t get elsewhere. I’d like to think that discussions — both class and individual — project work, and participation in research projects here fit that bill,” Fischoff said.
Culbertson said that the best students go “to good schools that attract the best professors and the best-paying jobs — so the vicious cycle begins. I actually see CMU — and all the top 10 institutions — being huge beneficiaries of this cycle, and I suspect the brand will continue to improve because of it.”

Title: The Humanities Center Lectures — Global Connections, Global Responsibilities
The Basics: Sponsored by the university’s Humanities Center and the Center for the Advancement of Applied Ethics and Political Philosophy, this lecture series focuses on the diversity among affluent and economically challenged countries and their influence on one another. 
James Ferguson, professor and chair of the department of anthropology at Stanford University, will talk about political and social issues in South Africa. South Africa has in recent decades gone through a wrenching transformation from a labor-scarce society to a labor-surplus one. 
Labor scarcity through most of the 19th and 20th centuries led to forms of social solidarity and social identity that had significant continuities with the pre-colonial past. In recent decades, however, economic restructuring has radically reduced demand for low-skilled, manual labor, and mass unemployment has become a durable structural feature of South African society.
When:  Today at 4:30 p.m.
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Title: University Lecture Series — The Global Environmental Impact of the United States, in Peacetime and Wartime
The Basics: Richard Tucker, adjunct professor of environmental history in the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, will discuss the influences of the United States on the global environment throughout history.
In the 20th century, a major driving force for global environmental deterioration was the vast reach of the American economy in its worldwide search for natural resources. We are only beginning to recognize the global ecological consequences of corporate enterprise and consumer culture. 
This lecture will allow the audience to understand the changes in our environment due to the United States’ decisions and how the present global environment came to be.
When: Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Title: Listening to Students: Using Survey Data to Improve the Student Experience
The Basics: This lecture will focus on how Carnegie Mellon utilizes student survey responses to understand students’ experiences. Speakers will include Janel Sutkus, the director of Institutional Research and Analysis; Indira Nair, vice provost for education; and Karen Boyd, dean of Student Affairs. 
Sutkus is responsible for the analysis of both administrative and academic functions throughout Carnegie Mellon’s campus and especially within the colleges. Her Ph.D. is in education organizational behavior and management from the Center for the Study of Higher and Post-secondary Education at the University of Michigan. 
In the first part of the lecture, Sutkus will discuss the standards used to analyze the students of Carnegie Mellon, such as self-assessment, time spent on academic versus non-academic activities, opinions of the promotion of the university’s values, and meaningful interaction with others, among several other topics. 
When she concludes, Nair and Boyd will explain how these methods are used to create student opportunities, to make campus resources and programs more accessible, and to develop academic and “meta-curricular” programming.
When: Monday, Oct. 12 at 4:30 p.m.
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)

Wrath playing this week in Purnell
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama will perform John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath every day this week, with the last showing occurring on Oct. 10. Directed by professor of acting Barbara Mackenzie-Wood, the performances are at 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, with an additional matinee performance at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
“*The Grapes of Wrath* is one of America’s favorite novels, and, due to the work of the adapter Frank Galati, now one of its greatest theatrical inventions,” said Peter Cooke, head of the School of Drama. 
“I chose the work to open our season, in collaboration with director Mackenzie-Wood, as I believe the play holds a mirror up to a contemporary fiscal and environmental landscape that is truly alarming. The theater at its best should provoke, move, question, and engage, and I hope the audience attending the production experiences all of these actions.”
A story of courage and endurance in the face of overwhelming hardship, Steinbeck’s Nobel Prize-winning novel examines a family of sharecroppers who strive for the American dream in an environment that raises, then shatters, their hopes, dreams, and aspirations.
Ticket prices begin at $23 for adults, $14 for senior citizens, and $10 for students with valid Carnegie Mellon identification. For complete ticket prices, call the School of Drama Box Office at (412) 268-2407 or visit www.drama.cmu.edu.
CMU hosts 19th annual festival
Carnegie Mellon University’s 19th annual International Festival, “What’s Happening to Diplomacy?” is scheduled for Oct. 8–10. All events will take place in Carnegie Mellon’s University Center and are free and open to the public. A full schedule of events is available at www.cmu.edu/internationalfestival. Here are a few festival highlights.
Professor Jendavi Frazer will be the speaker at the keynote lecture on Friday, Oct. 9 at 12:30 p.m. Frazer served as the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Her current research focuses on strengthening regional security cooperation and economic and political integration in Africa. She is also co-director of Carnegie Mellon’s new Center for International Politics and Innovation (CIPI), where she is particularly interested in utilizing technology and applying innovative solutions to core issues of development and governance in Africa. 
On Saturday, Oct. 10, global service organizations such as the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, Building New Hope, Unite for Sight, and the American Red Cross will provide opportunities for visitors to engage in a variety of impact projects at the event “Global Volunteerism: Becoming a Global Citizen,” beginning at 10 a.m.

A car accident on Forbes Avenue in front of the Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) fraternity house on the Fraternity Quadrangle a little bit before 5 p.m. Tuesday caused traffic to go down to one lane. At press time, no apparent injuries had been reported. Motorist Kelan Nixon reported that he took a “left turn from Morewood and got hit from the side by a cab that was coming from the far left lane.”
Both cars sustained visible damage. The cab was missing its front bumper and the front headlights were shattered. The driver of the cab was unavailable to respond. 
University Police were at the scene of the accident to direct traffic and record a police report. Officer Hendershot said, “The accident appeared to be just an accident and the insurance companies would take over from here.”

On Sept. 30 of this year, the United States Department of Transportation met to discuss ways to reduce driver distraction, a growing peril according to the Obama administration. Eighteen states have laws banning texting while driving, and Senator Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) is advocating legislation to make states ban texting or forfeit 25 percent of their federal highway funding. Here are some statistics related to distracted driving:
Fatalities last year due to driver distraction:  5870
People injured last year in which at least one form of driver distraction was reported: 515,000
Percentage of all fatal crashes that involved driver distraction in 2008: 16
Percentage of crashes and near-crashes in 2009 involving distracted drivers: 22 
Age group with greatest proportion of distracted drivers: under 20

I try not to use my knowledge for evil purposes. With that being said, fMRImatch.com is probably the best unethical idea I’ve had, ever. Not that there have been many. fMRImatch.com is a dating website where one is matched via the most important component of compatibility: the brain. Ignoring the fact that I have morals, and the fact that I know little about brain imaging, absolutely nothing about online dating, and next to zilch about business and entrepreneurship, I decided to take my brainchild and run with it.
It seems that most dating websites suck. You take some quiz, and wait and see which losers have similar answers on said quiz. I would imagine it feels like you’re being psycho-evaluated, clicking through “strongly agree” to “neutral” to “strongly disagree” buttons. I strongly agree that these quizzes suck.
On the other hand, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) doesn’t suck. It’s 2009, people! Matchmaking has got to get more scientific. If you really think about it, public opinion is largely driven by fanatical crowds with little regard to scientific underpinnings (read: those miracle pill e-mails in your spam folder). They just have to be told that it’s scientific. And “functional magnetic resonance imaging” sounds pretty damn scientific.
Without sounding like a textbook, you should know that fMRI is a spiffy new form of neuroimaging that measures the hemodynamic response in the brain. I could tell you more about hemoglobin-dependent measures, cerebral blood flow, magnetic susceptibility, glucose, oxygen, etc., but those are just fancy words for the fact that we stick people’s heads in giant magnets and watch the blood flow through their brain, allowing scientists to get a glimpse inside. Like God. Or McDreamy from Grey’s Anatomy.
What I’m proposing is a remarkably high-resolution way to look at neural structures in the brain for a humanitarian purpose. (There’s nothing more humanitarian than helping people find love.) Experimental subjects — I mean valued customers — would come in for a short scanning session to acquire their neural images. This would be most ideal since fMRI has been noted for its low invasiveness and lack of radiation exposure, which means that unlike other dating sites’ deep probing questions, you will come out unscathed.
In science and medicine — a.k.a. normal, non-sketchy — fields this technology is usually used in, one can take advantage of the fact that fMRI is amenable to event-related design. This means that in addition to getting a structural image of your brain, we can tell you to look at or think about certain things and see which parts of the brain get activated at that point in time. So if the amygdala, the structure responsible for emotion and arousal, gets activated in males, we’re going to assume it’s sex. If the amygdala in women gets activated, we’re going to assume it’s about shoes. Again, very high-tech, very scientifically accurate.
I haven’t yet worked out exactly how we’re going to determine if two brains are compatible. The best I’ve got is to go by some arbitrary standard, pull out a number from midair, and tell people that they are x percent compatible. No need to hire neuroscientists and statisticians to analyze voxel patterns or run ANCOVAs. Like I said, the public is susceptible to being airheadedly swayed.
Since my brilliant brainchild obviously has a lot of kinks, I consulted the best in the field to find out how to make it better. I asked the opinion of a trusted friend who knows a lot about relationships. She glossed over my blood-oxygen-level-dependent explanation of how fMRI works, being more concerned whether pictures of people’s faces were going to be on their profile. I said that this would defeat the purpose of the site, since compatibility is going to be based on scientifically driven neural structure and activation, not how hot people think their peers are, like on sub-par sites such as eHarmony and match.com. She said I was being too dry and should work on the “fuzzy” feeling other sites have.
So in response to that, I remembered that fMRI has a high spatial resolution of 2 to 3 millimeters. This would allow you and your mate to admire the sheer beauty of your brains. This is possible, of course: A business major friend informed me of the business tactic that people feel better when you throw in freebies. Easy — I’ll throw in a couple of free neural images. Successful couples can frame them side-by-side or whatever. You’ll get the love of your life and a free framed picture of your brain! There’s your fuzzy feeling for you.
Lastly, I consulted a fellow neuroimaging colleague whom I dearly trust. He fired questions at me, including what magnitude scanner would produce the best results, the effects of poor temporal resolution and non-localized causality, and the process of backing up data with electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography — basically things I failed to consider, don’t really care for, and am too lazy to figure out.
But we’re not going to accredit the lack of progress on this idea to my laziness. When it comes down to it, I have morals. Like I said, I try not to use my knowledge for evil.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@) is a third-year psychology major. She is actually still secretly interested in pursuing her corrupted, unethical idea. Please forward all résumés to above email.

Welcome to the unlawful assembly. Please fasten your seat belts tightly around your waists, note we have riot troops surrounding all the exits, whose guns are loaded with rubber bullets. In the event of tear gassing, oxygen masks will not be provided, so be prepared to cry. Please relax as you begin your final dispersal while several of your fellow passengers are arrested. Thank you for flying G20 Pittsburgh Air.
This is, of course, the scene at Schenley Plaza late last week recast as a particularly bad airplane trip. Why? Because we have all heard this story told and re-told since the G20 ended; we have seen the videos; we have heard the official reports and the news coverage. Yet we are still trying to put together the events in our own heads; we are still trying to make sense of the events in Oakland.
Why are students showing up with bruises on their bodies? Why were Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students held overnight in Allegheny County Jail? Why is YouTube filled with videos of students trapped in stairwells and shoved to the ground? How did this happen in our city; what did we do wrong? How could the police here have possibly been that cruel, that brutal?
These questions will not all be answered to our and your satisfaction, but we can now begin to reflect on what occurred. The G20 came like a whirlwind and inconvenienced people across Pittsburgh. It shut down parks, streets, and institutions of higher education so that the most powerful rulers of our modern world could have dinner and shape our futures. Not everything went according to plan, and we wish some events would have unfolded differently.
We could wish a bit more common sense into the college kids who believe that by simply standing and gawking at what seemed to be a scene from a movie, they were innocent. Simply by being present at the protest, they were taking part in an assembly, a non-registered, after-hours gathering of protesters and passersby that was deemed unacceptable. And some got caught up in events that they could certainly have avoided by staying in their homes and rooms.
And while they could have stayed home, they didn’t. Many behaved like it was a normal Friday night in Oakland, which to the police lining the streets was most certainly an unfamiliar sight. We do wish the police would have used less force; it was not necessary. They could have been kinder to the “protesters” who by all accounts were mostly college kids with cell phones and a bit too much curiosity. But even as our city and our students may feel beaten, the trip is over, the plane is landed, and we won’t be flying with that airline again.

The word “abortion” immediately draws up powerful feelings in many people; the topic shows up almost daily in one news source or another. Its most recent hot-button reference is its connection to the major debate in Washington: the health care issue. If not center stage, abortion has certainly taken a spotlight in the health care debates.
What it amounts to is that abortion opponents in the Senate and the House are fighting to block women who are receiving federal subsidies for their health insurance from selecting plans that may cover abortions.
There are many private insurance companies from which free Americans have the right to select. One of the effects of the bill going through Congress is to help lower- and middle-income Americans afford insurance by subsidizing that cost. Pro-life advocates are attempting to block any insurance company that might cover abortions from that choice.
Health insurance covers a lot of things — depending on the company. Regardless of anyone’s opinions on abortions, the free market can only thrive if consumers are able to make informed choices among many alternatives.
Abortion has now overshadowed the myriad implications that this health care reform could carry. Hospitals are suffering because patients can’t afford procedures that insurance won’t cover. Many people go without insurance because the premiums are too high. And now the bill that could alleviate some of these problems is being delayed further because some pro-life pundits are afraid that government money might be funding abortions.
The literal meaning of that phrase would suggest that the government is paying for women to have abortions performed. Since this is clearly not happening, the reasoning stands at this: The government would be helping to subsidize the cost of insurance for lower- and middle-class individuals to put Americans on more equal footing in terms of their health care. Some of the health plans that women might choose might cover them if they ever opted to have an abortion. Ergo, the government would be funding their abortions. Or not.
Federal restrictions on financing abortions have been in place since 1976, according to the Chicago Tribune, when Medicaid was banned from funding abortions unless the woman in question either would have her life threatened by carrying to full term or became pregnant as a result of rape or incest.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus (D–Mont.) authored a bill that would force insurance companies that allowed abortions to separate money to be used for abortions from the consumers’ premiums. This was a clear move to take the question of government funds’ being put toward abortions out of discussion so that the bill could be sent through the proper channels and dealt with in a timely manner.
As expected, however, the move was not strong enough for the pro-life side of the equation. Republicans in the Senate were not satisfied with having mere accounting technicalities determine the difference between individuals’ paying for their own abortions and taxpayers’ doing so.
In response, Republican Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah proposed an amendment that would essentially blacklist any health plan that included coverage of abortions. No money from the health care legislation would be offered to any insurance plan if that plan might cover abortions.
Such an idea would force insurance companies to either change their policies so they would be able to compete or else die in a market where socially conservative companies get the upper hand. Fortunately for the insurance market, the finance committee voted down the amendment.
It would seem social conservatives are trying to press their opinions on all Americans — critics of the idea to have insurance companies separate the money cite that the government subsidies would still help people to afford health coverage that would include abortions.
Another New York Times article cited a Kaiser Family Foundation survey showing that half of American women covered by an employer-sponsored health plan have policies that would cover abortions. If forced to choose between paying more for a plan that would cover abortions and having the government help pay for one that wouldn’t, most people would opt for the latter.
Another option brought up by conservatives is that women could opt to purchase supplemental insurance to cover abortions. The problem with this is that most women will not anticipate having an unwanted pregnancy. 
The power of “abortion” is allowing an only marginally related issue to overshadow the concern on the table: Health care in America needs to see some changes, because the current state of affairs benefits no one.

The discussion about illegal immigration in the United States — and what to do about it — has taken a new turn with the Obama administration. This week, American Apparel’s Los Angeles factory was forced to fire nearly 2000 workers, all of whom were illegal immigrants. In the past, the workers would have been deported back to their home countries, but now they are just being told that they are not allowed to work in the United States.
Supposedly, this is being done in order to preserve families and cause the least amount of trouble. While this may be true, it still is not right. If a person breaks the law, in this country or anywhere else, and they are caught, they must face the consequences. If the consequences of people coming into and living in the United States illegally are only that they lose their jobs, what kind of message are we sending?
People who are in this country illegally should not be permitted to stay, regardless of whether they are working for American businesses or whether they are unemployed. It isn’t about whether they are paying taxes or whether they are taking jobs that Americans should have, because, let’s face it: Most of the jobs illegal immigrants have are jobs that the majority of Americans wouldn’t want to work.
Rather, it is about respect for the law. Immigration laws are in place for a reason, and even if people disagree with them, until they are changed, they should be respected. It is incredibly frustrating that people who seem to want to be in this country are disobeying its laws from the very start.
I understand that it is often difficult to get into this country legally, but that does not justify breaking the law. Anything worth doing is worth waiting for, and if someone really wants to be an American citizen, they will wait as long as necessary to do it through legal means.
In many cases, illegal immigrants in the United States are looking for ways to earn money, not citizenship. They are here to work, and they then send the money back to their families. If this is what they want, they should apply for work visas and come legally; this will be better not only for the United States, but also for the immigrants. Work conditions will be better monitored and minimum pay will be enforced — benefits that illegal immigrants generally do not currently receive.
A common argument in favor of changing immigration laws and granting amnesty to those illegal immigrants already in this country is that people are unable to afford to immigrate legally, emphasizing that it is expensive and time consuming to become a legal citizen of the United States. Perhaps this argument comes from a growing need to have instant gratification. Throughout history, when immigrants came to this country in great surges, they saved their money, often for years and years, to be able to afford to do so. For the most part, people came legally. They went through the appropriate steps to become citizens, even if that was a long and painful process. Today’s immigrants should be no different; they should also have to follow the legal guidelines for immigration.
Everyone should have the opportunity to make a better life, but this opportunity should be seized through legal means and not through breaking the laws of the country to which one desires entry.

In the past, violence against women in South Asia and the Middle East was largely taken as an inevitable part of life. Eastern women were often not just victims of abuse at home, but also criticized by their Western counterparts for being passive and poor portraits of feminism.
However, when specific cases of forced marriage and gang rape in those regions sprung to international attention, it became apparent that this violence was not an inherent ingredient of any culture. While the Western media was quick to transform the victims into heroes, the celebrity status came with a price — prolonged scrutiny of these women’s lives.
Without realizing that the “reality television culture” is not the preferred ticket to fame in many cultures, Western media does more harm than good by putting these women under the spotlight. Two examples that illustrate this are the stories of Mukhtar Mai and Nujood Ali.
In 2002, Mai took the media by storm when she pressed charges against her rapists in a country where society demands silence from rape victims. Mai was gang raped by six men on the orders of a council of tribal elders, which is akin to legal authority in the impoverished village of Meerwala where Mai resides.
Despite her circumstances, Mai did not commit suicide, which is often the chosen course of action for raped women in Pakistan, as it signifies cleansing the tainted reputation of the victim’s family.
She took her rapists to court, only to discover that five of the six men were released. Mai was awarded about $8000 from the government, which she used to establish the Mukhtar Mai Women’s Welfare Organization, a center for education, rehabilitation, and refuge for rural women. Mai became a symbol of courage and hope for oppressed women.
However, Mai’s image as a brave and progressive woman seemed to pale when she married a police constable who was responsible for her security. Mai’s marriage was conditional; she married her husband in order to prevent him from divorcing his first wife — a threat he repeatedly gave her along with suicide if she turned down his proposal. However, Mai’s personal decisions should be viewed in the context of her own culture and should not be a point of disapproval.
Similarly, 10-year-old Ali set an example for victims of child marriages. When Ali was beaten and raped by her husband, she hailed a cab and took it to the courthouse, where she demanded a divorce. 
Ali vehemently avoids any media attention; she unwillingly sat with CNN for a recent interview because the news channel had earned permission from her parents in advance. At this point, the media needs to leave the child alone instead of trailing an already tortured individual.
Acknowledgment of these heroic women by the West is highly appreciated. But the constant scrutiny of their personal lives is unfair and detrimental to their emotional well-being. In the name of empowering these women, the Western media claims ownership of these “heroes” and builds certain expectations of them, which if not met, portray these women as  symbols of continued passivity.

When a child has not been vaccinated and has the potential to spread highly contagious diseases — or cannot prove that they were vaccinated with a viable shot record — the child should not go to school. We don’t need any scares like that of the swine flu in colleges in elementary, middle, or high schools.
But there are always extenuating circumstances — what if your family just moved to the area and the shot records are still being sent? According to Allegheny County regulations, that student shall not attend school if there is no present documentation proving that he or she has been properly vaccinated.
As of last Thursday, at least 4000 students were barred from attending school if they had not received the proper vaccinations, or if they could not provide proof. We understand the school officials’ concerns over the health and safety of everyone in the Allegheny school district, but applying such a broad standard may not be the best remedy.
In the case of the 4000 students, many of their shot records are missing. Missing documents of a shot, especially since in many cases, the shots were administered, shouldn’t keep a child out of school.
And by being so willing to keep students from attending school on the off chance that they might spread uncommon illnesses, the schools are creating problems for themselves in the future. Often, it is not possible to get a doctor’s appointment for the very next day, taking up time in which the students could be learning and time that will have to be made up. In addition, for the students who already have been vaccinated but have missing records, they are missing school for absolutely no reason. This means more work for the students and staff — work that could have been avoided.
Keeping students out of school for health concerns is valid, but perhaps the administration should come up with a compromise, and provide on-site after-school clinics where students could easily and quickly get vaccinations. 
We hope the county is as cooperative as possible with the students.

By now, almost every American is aware of President Obama’s push for health care reform. One of the most progressive ideas involved has been the creation of a government-run public health insurance option that would compete with private insurance companies.
On Tuesday, the Senate’s finance committee turned down two amendments to include this option on what CNN.com refers to as “the only compromise health care bill so far.”
In an expected party divide, all of the Republican senators on the committee rejected the amendments proposed by Democratic senators Jay Rockefeller and Charles Schumer. However, the amendment also lacked the support of committee chair Senator Max Baucus (D–Mont.) because he was afraid the Republicans on the Senate would filibuster the bill to death if such an option were included, as reported by The New York Times.
The inclusion of a more affordable government-run insurance plan would force private companies to reconsider rates to remain competitive.
Senator Charles Grassley (R–Iowa) argued that such competition would ultimately drive private companies out of business, effectively creating a government-run health care system.
This government-run health care system Republican senators are so frightened of operates successfully in Canada. The idea that a public insurance option would lead to “socialized medicine” —  a system like that of many industrialized nations — is considered nothing more than hot air by 59 percent of Americans.
At the moment, the health care bill offers only small nonprofit cooperatives as an alternative to expensive private insurance plans. At some point, America needs to hop on the bandwagon being ridden by the rest of the world, because our stubborn resistance is crippling America — literally and figuratively.

It would be a lie if I were to say that during my time here at Carnegie Mellon I have become less involved. It would also be a lie if I said I didn’t embrace Carnegie Mellon’s crowning attribute — diversity. One of the ways I like to balance my many roles and keep my sanity is either to make lists or to make riddles. Here, I have made a riddle:
We were part of the first competitive blitz booth experience. There is one day a year when all (or most) of our members remain silent.
If you guessed the Graduate Student Assembly, you’re close but no cigar. Hello, my name is Joe Eliot DeGolia, vice president of ALLIES, and I’m here to recruit you.
This year has been an exciting one to plan with October Pride Month events trickling into the calendar and organizing our upcoming events for Spirituality Month (November) and World AIDS Day on Dec. 1.
This Sunday, we are traveling to Washington D.C. for the National Equality March, where people from all over the country will be gathering to march in support of LGBT rights. Members of the Carnegie Mellon community will be joined by other Pittsburgh students and residents on our long bus trip. Tickets are still available, so contact allies@ if you are interested in participating.
The day after, we are hosting events for Coming Out Day at the Fence and in Rangos. From 12–3 p.m. at the Fence, ALLIES members will be discussing coming out stories and connecting with the campus. Then, beginning at 6:30 p.m. in Rangos 2, we will be joined by GLENDA for a coming out social, where more members of Pittsburgh’s LGBT community will connect and show each other support.
October’s keynote event is a screening of the local documentary Out in the Silence, a story about how newspapers, like this one, can change the way people think. One of our newest initiatives this year has been a collaborative effort with several Pittsburgh organizations to endorse and utilize local LGBT resources.
In my third year of contributing to campus organizations, I am always reminded of the necessity for a student organization to be multifaceted. Whenever I think of Carnegie Mellon, I think of diversity. And often when I think of diversity, I think of many different kinds of people and organizations. But it is also true that one individual or organization can be diverse in that it has many interests and qualities. This is what I believe makes someone a member of Carnegie Mellon’s geekdom. And with my juggling act, I embrace it.
