Fresh off a successful Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Regional Tournament, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team hosted Oberlin College in its first and only dual match of the fall. The team got things off on the right foot and deftly handled Oberlin in an 8–1 win.
Senior Jennifer Chui and junior Cze-Ja Tam, competing at third doubles, finished off their opponents first, taking an 8–3 decision from Oberlin’s Ariel Lewis and Julie Christensen. At second doubles, Tartan first-year Madison Rabson and senior Ashley Herrick also defeated their Yeowoman counterparts 8–3, before juniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin kept a good thing going with an 8–3 win of their own.
In singles competition, Rabson, competing at sixth singles, finished off her opponent quickly, 6–0, 6–2. Tam followed shortly thereafter with a 6–1, 6–0 win over Oberlin’s Preeya Shah, and Chen handed Lewis a 6–0, 6–3 defeat at first singles. Chin took her opponent in a 6–2, 6–1 win before Oberlin’s Carolyn Ball handed the Tartans their only defeat of the afternoon, beating first-year Sonya Subramaniam 7–6, 6–0. The Tartans wrapped up their victory with a marathon battle between Chui and Yeowoman Finley Gates that finally ended with Chui winning, 5–7, 6–2, 12–10.
“I would say it’s an improvement from my last match at ITAs,” Rabson said. “I love being on the team, especially doubles, and I’m really glad I’m playing for Carnegie Mellon. This has been such a fun experience so far.”
Although this semester’s competition may be over for most of the Tartans, Chen will cap off her fall season by traveling to Mobile, Ala., to compete at the ITA National Championships this week. The tournament lasts Thursday through Sunday. Chen, who finished second at nationals two years ago, will be looking to improve on her fourth-place finish at last year’s tournament.

After last week’s break from competition, the cross country team is back, yielding impressive results. Last Saturday, it hosted the Carnegie Mellon Invitational in local Schenley Park. The women’s team took on a 5k, and triumphed with a second-place finish out of 24 teams. The men also turned out a second-place finish in an 8k run, defeating 22 teams.
The women’s 5k was packed with great competition, with over 260 participants. Sophomore Emily Wobb led the charge for the ladies once again, grabbing second place in the 5k with a time of 18:52.21. Senior Courtney Baker joined her teammate in the top 10 finishers, snagging ninth place in 19:17.89. Coming in 17th place, junior Laura McKee finished with a time of 20:05.70. McKee was followed by teammate sophomore Lisa Rising, who ran a 20:11.30, earning her 19th place overall. Coming in fifth for the women’s team was senior Danielle Morse, who grabbed 34th place by less than a second with a time of 20:34.15.
“Our team enjoyed hosting the meet,” said senior Justin Kurp, who finished 13th in the men’s 8k in 26:34.62. “The weather was really nice, and the track guys who ran the show were very enthusiastic. It was also exciting to benchmark our performances from previous years and run with the [cross country alumni who competed in the race] again. I hope everyone comes back next year.”
On the men’s side, the 8k was equally loaded with challengers, with over 230 men competing. Leading the Tartans as usual, senior teammates Dan Addis and Nate Bussiere took second and third place in the event, respectively. Addis finished in 25:41.72, while Bussiere managed 26:00.84. Sophomore Evan Gates closely followed Kurp, coming in 16th with a time of 26:39.69. Rounding out the top 20 was senior J.P. Allera, scoring 19th with a time of 26:50.23. In the end, the men lost to Wayne State University by only four points. With five men in the top 20, Carnegie Mellon has great depth.
“I think our team did well as a whole, and I am impressed with many of the guys’ performances,” Kurp said. “We still have lots of work to do if we’re going to place high at nationals, though. Our goal is to be among the top five teams in the nation. This race has shown us that we have a group of solid runners, as plenty of guys ran great races on such a tough course. We’re hoping we can get a few guys racing closer to Nate and Dan, though.  We’ll need that if we are going to compete with the best.”
The Tartans hope to use their second-place finishes as fuel for a successful championship. The Tartans will compete against Oberlin College in Ohio on Saturday, and in three weeks, they will compete in the UAA championship in New York City.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams kicked off their season with an intersquad meet last Saturday. The teams have been training since the beginning of the school year, but the season officially started Sept. 20. With high expectations for the season, the Tartans hope to not only meet but exceed the high standards of previous years.
The men’s team placed second in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference last year, falling only to the first-ranked Emory University Eagles. “This year, we’re expecting to take a big step forward. We’re going to work on narrowing the gap between us and Emory to get closer to first place,” said senior Josh Plotnik. The men will work on improving their times individually and as a whole throughout the season.
The women also expect their biggest rival to be Emory this season, as they, too, have consistently fallen behind the Eagles in past years. However, they also expect to improve their status against the Eagles this year, especially in relays. “We’re hoping to get relay teams to qualify for National Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA], and at conference we want to get as many people scoring in finals as possible,” said senior Rebecca Ussai.
The Tartans are also working to keep up their academic prestige. In August, both the men’s and women’s teams were honored by the College Swim Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) for their academic success during the 2009–2010 school year. The women had the 12th-highest GPA for the year, out of 121 schools honored, with a 3.48 team GPA; the men, with their 3.52 average, ranked second in the nation. The women also had four Scholar All-American swimmers, while the men’s team had nine recipients of the honor. To achieve this, an individual must qualify for NCAA Championships and have a GPA of 3.5 or higher.
Both the men and women hope to maintain the high standards that the team set last season. “We want to keep our academics up this season while also swimming faster,” said sophomore Karl Weisling.
In an effort to reach those goals, the swimming and diving team puts in numerous hours of practice per week. As a result of the time spent together, members of the team also get closer to one another, establishing a greater team community. “Being around people who make the sport fun gives it a great atmosphere and helps push you because you’re giving it so much,” first-year Kathleen Dolan said.
With the start of their first meet schedule quickly approaching, the Tartans will continue training to improve their performance to beat University Athletic Association rival Emory at the conference meet in February. Saturday’s intersquad meet served to help the team transition into competition, helping the swimmers “get our feet wet,” as Plotnik put it, since most members had not competed since February or March.
The swimming and diving team will host Clarion University for its first official dual meet on Oct. 30 at the University Center pool. The meet begins at 11 a.m.

You know, the one where Joe Boyd sells his soul to the devil so that the Washington Senators can start winning?
Here’s a hint: It rhymes with Bamn Bankees.
The Bronx Bombers, the team that many love and many more love to hate, became the first team this postseason to win a division series on Saturday. With a win at Yankee Stadium, the Yanks punched their ticket to the American League Championship Series (ALCS) for the second year in a row, completing a sweep of the seemingly punchless Minnesota Twins. New York has now taken nine straight postseason games from Minnesota, tying the longest active streak in baseball.
Coincidentally, the other nine-game postseason winning streak against any one team is also owned by the Yankees, as they took nine straight playoff games from the Rangers in the mid- to late ’90s. The Rangers hadn’t been in the postseason again until this season, and they have taken full advantage of their newfound freedom from the Yankees, taking the first two games of their division series battle with the Rays to put themselves on the brink of winning their first ever postseason series. If they succeed, they’ll have to face their old tormentors in the ALCS.
Despite the fact that the Yankees were World Series champions last year, expectations were not as high for 2010 among fans and analysts alike. “I’ll be shocked if the Yanks get past the Twins, since our starting pitching is nonexistent except for CC,” lifelong Yankees fan and 2006 Brooklyn College graduate Ian Levenstein commented before the American League Division Series began. Levenstein, like many others, felt that the Yankees’ rotation was a huge question mark after 21-game winner CC Sabathia, who pitched game one of the series and won. Andy Pettitte, who started and won game two, ended the regular season with two mediocre efforts following a groin injury, and Phil Hughes, the eventual game three winner, was winding down his first full season as a starter and, after going 11-2 with a 3.65 ERA before the All-Star break, went 7–6 with a 4.90 ERA in the ensuing 15 games. Coupled with the fact that the once-dominant, still-expensive A.J. Burnett was having a horrendous year and Javier Vazquez was taking lessons from Oliver Perez on how to disappoint even the harshest naysayers, the Yanks’ pitching corps seemed questionable at best.
But somehow, they pulled it out and nailed down the sweep.
The Yankees beat the Mets in 2000 to win their third consecutive World Series and fourth in five years. However, they then lost the 2001 World Series to the Diamondbacks in seven games to jump-start a string of eight straight years of not winning a World Series, with the low point coming when they failed to even reach the postseason in 2008. They then returned to glory by winning the whole shebang against the Phillies last year, and in 2010, it looks like the Evil Empire is back to its postseason winning ways again.
As much as it pains me to say it, the Yankees are the team to beat right now in this postseason. Sabathia may not have had the best overall stats to go with his 21 wins, but that’s exactly the reason that the Yanks have no reason to worry: He still got 21 wins. What does that mean? It means that even if Sabathia gives up four or five runs, his offense will back him up with six or seven, as they did in Sabathia’s 6–4 win in game one. Pettitte, injury concerns aside, showed already that he is still one of the best playoff pitchers in history when he dominated in his 19th career postseason victory in game two. Hughes is only partially a question mark at this point after seven scoreless innings in the clincher, and in a best-of-seven series, there’s a little more breathing room in that department. What will happen with a fourth starter is yet to be seen; if the Yanks are confident enough, they can tweak their rotation enough to eliminate any need for a fourth starter. Sabathia has been historically dominant on short rest, especially in big games, and if the Yankees are on the verge of winning in four or five games, there’s a high chance that their starters will get plenty of rest before the NLCS ends and the World Series begins.
“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” baseball fan Franklin D. Roosevelt famously said in his first inaugural address. Similarly, the only thing that may threaten the Yankees’ dominance is, well, their own dominance. They have already won their division series, meaning they will have to wait six days for the start of the ALCS. Likewise, if they do then win that series in four or five, they will once again sit dormant for at least a week before the World Series. In 2006, the Detroit Tigers rocked the American League postseason only to wait till the bitter end of the NLCS to play the Cardinals in the World Series; St. Louis then steamrolled the Tigers to easily take the World Series. The 2007 Colorado Rockies similarly destroyed anything in their path in the NLDS and NLCS before waiting a week and looking cold, confused, and uncollected while getting convincingly swept by the Red Sox in the World Series. Were the Yanks to end up dominating their ALCS opponent as they are poised to do, would the same fate befall them?
Most likely not. Unlike the Tigers in 2006 or the Rockies in 2007, the Yankees are no strangers to the postseason and the World Series. Most of their army of highly paid veterans and youngsters alike have been on the big stage before and know what it takes to win a championship. Love ’em or hate ’em, the Yankees look poised to win it all once more. Besides, the late George Steinbrenner would have accepted nothing less than a world championship, and whatever George wants, George gets!

This fall has been a busy season for the cricket club, with the team recently competing in two competitions. The Carnegie Mellon Cricket Club (CMCC) team placed third in the first ever American College Cricket Midwest (ACCM) Championship held at Ohio State University during the weekend of Sept. 25–26. Seven teams competed in the championship for the E. Gordon Gee Trophy. Also, just last weekend, the CMCC hosted the first ever CIT vs. Tepper cricket exhibition match in Gesling Stadium.
Cricket is a sport from which baseball evolved. It consists of a “batsman,” the equivalent of a batter, facing a “bowler,” equivalent to a pitcher, who sends down, or “bowls” the ball. Each team is allocated a certain number of “overs,” off which they have to score runs. An over is a series of six balls bowled by the same bowler. CMCC organizes cricket workshops, pick-up games on the Cut, and fall and spring cricket tournaments. 
In the Tartans’ first match against the University of Iowa, Carnegie Mellon lost the coin toss and the team was asked to bowl first. Information systems master’s student Ankit Kothari took four wickets as Iowa was dismissed for 81 runs in the 18th over, failing to bat out their allocated 20 overs. However, the Tartans lost the match by 19 runs, deterred from a win by a strong Hawkeyes bowling effort.
The Tartans then faced the College of Wooster, their cricketing rivals, in the second match. After winning the coin toss and electing to bat, the Tartans were given a quick start by their opening batsman. Mechanical engineering graduate student Madhur Kaushik was the top scorer with 76, as the team finished with a strong 134 runs off its20 overs. Carnegie Mellon bowlers threw aggressively, as Wooster was dismissed for 95 runs, giving the Tartans a victory by 39 runs and earning them a bonus point.
When the dust settled, Carnegie Mellon finished in third place at the tournament. Purdue University won, while local favorite Ohio State finished in second place. 
“Participating in this tournament was a great opportunity for the team to establish our presence as a strong team in the Midwest region,” said team captain and junior Sahil Jolly. “It was an excellent opportunity to play some quality cricket and develop plans ahead of the national championship to be held in Florida later this year. With a few of our regulars injured, it was great to see new players step up and take responsibility,” he added.
The inaugural CIT vs. Tepper cricket match was held at Gesling Stadium last Saturday. The game was played under a modified set of rules, with 13 players on each side instead of the standard 11, and the teams were allotted 12 overs each. Before the game began, a moment of silence was held to remember Raghuvendra Singh, a CIT alumnus, who had passed away the previous night in a car accident in California.
Tepper won the coin toss and elected to bat. CIT bowlers obtained significant swing in the air as Tepper lost wickets at regular intervals. In particular, several Tepper batsmen were caught trying to hit down to the ground rather than aiming for the shorter square boundaries. The CIT captain, senior Sagar Shah, took three wickets in his allotted two overs and only conceded 15 runs, an effort for which he was later named best bowler. Carnegie Mellon alumnus Parag Shah took two wickets in the one over that he bowled with some good swing bowling. Tepper was bowled out in the 10th over and scored 67 runs in total.
CIT, confident after its disciplined bowling effort, got off to a slow start as the team lost two wickets in the second over of its innings, bowled by Tepper captain junior Nakul Bagla. However, the batsman that followed consolidated the innings with some solid batting. Halfway through the CIT innings, the match looked like it would head to an exciting finish, with CIT needing 30 runs off their six remaining overs with six wickets in hand. Tepper’s efforts were halted by excellent batting by seniors Raghav Todi and Sagar Shah and undisciplined bowling by Bagla in his second over, which turned the game CIT’s way, as 16 runs were conceded in this over. Though Todi, later named best batsman, had to retire after scoring 26 runs, Sagar Shah completed the formalities, hitting a six over the square boundary to seal victory for CIT.

Two weeks ago, the men’s tennis team traveled to Fredericksburg, Va., for the annual ITA Regional Championships. Sophomore Duke Miller and senior Bobby MacTaggart paired to take home the doubles title. The duo quickly shut down a Swarthmore College duo 8–1, followed by an 8–3 win over a team from Haverford College. MacTaggart and Miller only dropped three games in their next match to reach the semifinals, where they topped Johns Hopkins University’s Casey Blythe and Andrew Wang 8–6. 
In a heated final match, the Tartans defeated another top-ranked team from Hopkins, Andy Hersh and Jeff Kamei, 7–5, 6–4, to take home the title. This is the first ITA win for both MacTaggart and Miller. The duo will travel to Mobile, Ala. next week to compete in the ITA National Championships. 
“It was lots of eye formation, lots of coach coaching, lots of same-side playing, and slice serving,” Miller said, reflecting back on his matches. “I just try to sleep well and eat well and be ready for each match,” MacTaggart added.
The men’s team also hosted three tough teams last weekend, topping Division I Robert Morris University before falling to Division I Duquesne University and No. 2 Amherst College. 
The morning match against Robert Morris University was quick and decisive. The Tartans took the early advantage by sweeping doubles. Miller and MacTaggart joined forces again to defeat the No. 1 team 8–2, followed by an 8–4 win at No. 2 doubles by sophomore Felix Hong and first-year Mason Radford. Doubles specialist junior Forrest Grinstead teamed with sophomore Civan Orhan to squeeze by with a 9–7 win for the third point. 
Carnegie Mellon handled singles play with ease, with Miller, Orhan, and first-year Julian Pearlman winning their matches with four or less games dropped. 
The Tartans, fresh from their quick 7–2 victory over the Colonials, found themselves struggling against Duquesne University later in the afternoon. 
Duquesne overpowered the Tartans after the first round of doubles matches to enter singles play up 3–0. King and Miller came the closest to victory, shaving six games off of the Dukes’ first doubles team of Steve Herchko and Max Rubin. 
The lone singles win for the Tartans came from sophomore Civan Orhan, who finished first with a 6–1, 6–1 win at No. 4 singles. Sophomore Jooho Yu almost earned a second point for the Tartans at No. 5 singles, splitting sets with the Dukes’ Jason Berry before falling 10–7 in the third-set tiebreak.
The men faced No. 2 Amherst College yesterday and fell 9–0. With this upsetting loss, the Tartans move to 2–2 for the season. This concludes the fall season for the Tartans; play will start again in February.

Last week at the ITA Regional Championships in Fredricksburg, Va., the fifth-seeded tandem of senior Bobby MacTaggart and sophomore Duke Miller took home the doubles title, upsetting the second-seed duo of Casey Blythe and Andrew Wang from Johns Hopkins University along the way. This is the first ITA title for both of the players, and the two will travel to Mobile, Ala. next week to compete in the ITA National Championships.
MacTaggart is a senior business major from Boonton, N.J. He chose to continue tennis in college because he liked the schedule of a Division III athletics program, and the Division I school he received a scholarship from was composed of all foreign-born players. The best part about the team, he said, is the dynamic between the players. “We give each other a hard time and rip on everyone a little, but at the end of the day we are all really close.” As co-captain, MacTaggart has plans to improve the tennis team even further — aiming to win two out of three doubles matches against each team, up the team’s concentration during important doubles drills, and rid his teammates of their fear of closing the net. 
But outside of his duties to school and the team, MacTaggart just likes to kick back and enjoy life. In his spare time, he enjoys playing video games and researching stocks or the current financial markets. In the long term, MacTaggart hopes to one day do research for a large hedge fund.
The second half of the duo hails from Poway, Ca. Miller is a sophomore chemical and biomedical engineering major and was initially drawn to Carnegie Mellon because of the strong engineering and athletics programs. In his spare time, Miller enjoys “music production and kickin’ it with friends.” In the future, Miller hopes to find a job related to biomedical engineering. 
Currently, Miller plays No. 1 doubles and No. 3 singles and has high expectations for the team. “I think our team has a lot of potential to do well, especially if we stay strong in the off-season and continue to play tennis almost as much as we do now,” he said. Miller also enjoys playing doubles. “It’s always fresh,” Miller said, commenting on his doubles experiences with MacTaggart. “I never know what’s going to happen. We could lose the serve love–40, or we could win ITAs. We just go out there and play, and hope for the best.”

After a successful start to the season, the Carnegie Mellon golf team faltered last Sunday and Monday at the Vulcan Invitational tournament, hosted by California University of Pennsylvania. The tournament, which featured some of the best teams in the state, was a tough test for the Tartans, who finished 10th out of 13 teams. This is their lowest finish of the season, compared to last week’s first-place finish at the Ohio Wesleyan Invitational in Delaware, Ohio, and second-place finish at the Guy Kuhn Invitational in Meadville, Pa.
During the Vulcan Invitational, the cold and rainy weather tested the Tartans’ physical and mental abilities as they struggled to get through each round. Their performances were strong on the first day, highlighted by scores of 72 and 74 by junior Terence Einhorn and first-year Ian Bangor, respectively. However, the team slipped up on the second day of the tournament and dropped a few spots for a 10th place finish. Still, Einhorn and Bangor continued their stellar play, finishing 10th and 12th in the invitational as individuals, respectively. Senior Brent Driscoll and sophomore Jisoo Park also had strong weekends for the Tartans, as they were the lowest scorers for the team, placing third and fourth, respectively. 
Even with a disappointing performance in the Vulcan Invitational, the golf team had early success this season and has much more to look forward to. Einhorn summarized the season thus far: “We got off to statistically the best start in CMU history.... [The Vulcan Invitational] wasn’t our best golf, but we have one more tournament this weekend to validate our great fall season.” With two strong finishes under their belt, the Tartans are strong enough to not be set back by their performance at Cal. U. However, they realize they must improve their play at this weekend’s tournament to consider this season successful.
The men’s team plays its final tournament of the season today, at the Peter Rossin Memorial tournament in Canonsburg, Pa. Since this tournament concludes their fall season, the Tartans must focus on having an excellent finish to cap their string of wins in the past few months. The memorial tournament will feature formidable teams such as McDaniel College, St. John Fisher College, and Washington and Jefferson College. 
Bangor stressed the importance of being ready to play on this last weekend of the season. “The team has been playing solidly, and I think we have great potential to shoot a low number if everyone comes together and plays well at the same time for this last tournament,” he said.

Now that we’re through with the first quarter of the NFL season, it’s almost time to start determining whether teams are contenders or pretenders. The Steelers have started off the year 3-1, even without their suspended star quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Now that Big Ben is coming back in Week 6 after the team's bye week, many experts, including a majority from ESPN, have picked the Steelers as the top team in their most recent Power Rankings. But the Steelers aren’t as good as everyone says they are, even with an exponentially better quaterback returning to the field.
First off, the myth that the Steelers have had a tough schedule to date couldn’t be further from the truth. They have faced two elite teams this year in the Falcons and the Ravens, and have come away with one win and one loss. Their other two wins were against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Tennessee Titans, two matchups in which any decent team should come out victorious. In their first game against the Falcons, the Steelers' famous defense showed why they are feared year in and year out, as Pittsburgh held Atlanta for a mere nine points and won the game in overtime. However, the Pittsburgh offense couldn’t get anything going against division rival Baltimore, as the Steelers lost on a last-second drive, which accentuates a big issue: The inconsistency of their powerful defense.
The Steelers’ defense often fails in the clutch. This past weekend, the Ravens went four plays and 40 yards for a touchdown in less than a minute to seal the victory for Baltimore in a very important divisional game. Forty yards in less than a minute? This is what happens when you blow a coverage late in the game: Good teams make you pay for it, and that is what the Ravens did. Now flash back to last year when the Steelers were fighting for a playoff spot in a very competitive conference. During their Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, they had a 20-9 fourth-quarter lead against the eventual AFC North champions. They proceeded to lose that game by giving up two huge touchdowns in that final quarter. Furthermore, the Steelers had an even more devastating loss to the Oakland Raiders in Week 13 of last season. Many Steelers fans remember this game, as the Raiders scored a touchdown with nine seconds left to beat Pittsburgh and put a damper on the team's playoff hopes. To be a championship team, your vaunted defense has to perform in the clutch, which hasn't been the case the past two years.
The main reason why the defense struggles in the clutch is due to the weak play of the team's secondary. It starts with the two cornerbacks, Bryant McFadden and Ike Taylor. McFadden, who was brought in from Arizona to try and solve this problem, was repeatedly burned by Ravens receiver Anquan Boldin. In fact, McFadden was the culprit on the 18-yard touchdown pass that won the game for the Ravens. On the other side of the field, Taylor hasn’t been much better. Add this to nickelback William Gay, who is most known for getting trucked by Adrian Peterson in the Steelers' game against the Vikings last year, and you get a mediocre secondary playing for a good team. With the NFL becoming a passing league, the weak secondary will pose a problem for a team that looks to return to the Super Bowl. When you have Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Philip Rivers, and many other premiere quarterbacks in your conference, you better be ready to stop the pass, especially in clutch situations. I’m not convinced the Steelers can do that.
The Steelers are still one of the top teams in the AFC and potentially the league. One thing they must be careful of is leaning too much on the passing game on the offensive side of the ball, especially when Big Ben comes back. Last year, the Steelers were too much of a pass-happy offense, even though they have a premiere running back in Rashard Mendenhall. Last year, Mendenhall averaged a very solid 4.6 yards per carry, yet only had 1108 yards on the year. This just shows that the Steelers threw the ball way too much, and for them to reach their highest potential they will have to run the ball enough to keep the opposing defense honest. If they can do this, they will be able to hang with the best in the AFC.
Fans in Pittsburgh expect the best out of their Steelers team, but they have to understand that the Steelers' playing style has glaring holes that need to be fixed. Polamalu can’t blitz and be a ball-hawk on the same play, meaning McFadden and Taylor will have to step up for the Steelers to become Super Bowl favorites. I wouldn’t get my hopes up.

For many years, neuroscientists have believed that the characteristics differentiating neurons from one another were just biological flaws, but this concept may actually be false. Nathan N. Urban, the head of the department of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon, has focused his research on neuronal processes within the olfactory system in animal models — specifically mice. Urban’s current research involves testing whether or not diversity within neuron networks is significant to complex brain computations.
Urban completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Pittsburgh in neuroscience, mathematics, and philosophy. Upon graduation, he received a Rhodes Scholarship and spent two years at the University of Oxford studying math and philosophy. Urban then completed his Ph.D. in neuroscience at Pitt and a postdoctoral appointment at the Max Planck Institute, a scientific research-based society in Germany, for three and a half years. He has been with the Mellon College of Science faculty since January 2002.
Urban and his team, which includes postdoctoral student Krishnan Padmanabhan, published a paper about neuronal diversity, titled “Intrinsic biophysical diversity decorrelates neuronal firing while increasing information content,” in Nature Neuroscience last August. The team found that groups of diverse neurons were able to transmit twice as much information as groups of relatively similar neurons.
The research project, funded by the National Institutes of Health, began when Padmanabhan observed slight differences between the responses of seemingly identical neurons to electrical stimuli. When groups of identical neurons were subjected to a constant computer-generated electrical current, Padmanabhan found that no two responses were the same. This prompted the question: Would the brain be better if all neurons were identical, as the team originally thought they were, akin to parts in an assembly line, or is there a natural advantage to neuronal diversity?
When a mouse’s brain first detects a smell, receptors in the olfactory system of the animal send a signal to an initial group of neurons in the brain. These 10 million neurons then pass on the signal to a second group of neurons, one synapse deeper in the brain’s neural network. The second group of neurons, which only number 50,000, are the focus of Urban’s experiments. Urban is already hypothesizing how the brain compensates for this decrease in connections. “You are going to have ... all this information that is available in these 10 million neurons, and now you are going to reduce it to 50,000 neurons. In order to do that well, you have to be really efficient and make sure there is not any redundancy or overlap in terms of what those neurons are doing. There is no room for redundancy when you have this huge reduction.”
To perform experiments, Urban and his team manipulated glass capillary tubing to a fine point and ruptured a neuronal membrane in a specific area of a single neuron. Using a method called whole-cell recording, Urban used computer equipment to generate electrical currents of varying wavelengths to stimulate the cell. A response from a neuron was categorized as a reaction from the neuron’s ion channels. Ion channels allow molecules to move in and out of the cell, so differences in the amount of movement between different neurons can be recorded. According to Padmanabhan and Urban’s paper, “In these regions and populations of neurons, differences in the expression of ion channels and morphology result in the marked heterogeneity of the intrinsic properties of [inhibitory and excitatory] cells, and the responses are therefore diverse even when similar inputs are delivered.” In short, identical electric currents passed through neurons thought to be identical resulted in different reactions within each neuron’s ion channels, suggesting neural diversity.
“We think we have some evidence of a particular ion channel, which is one of the reasons why we see the heterogeneity in this particular population,” Urban said. “Some neurons express more of this channel; some express less of this channel — that’s an important component in why they may be responding differently to these stimuli.”
Urban also saw plans for future experimentation: “The ultimate prediction for us would be if this diversity was helpful, we would like to find ways of testing that by either making different populations of neurons more homogeneous or more heterogeneous. If I can make populations more homogeneous, then that would have a behavioral effect, and animals would be less able to perform some task that depended on that group of neurons.” For Urban, understanding the key differences in these neuron ion channels would allow him to manipulate different mechanisms to find out more information.
One question Urban and his team are trying to solve is how homogeneous groups of neurons affect memory. If neuronal connections were to degrade over time, would this affect your mental abilities or just your mental capacity? Heterogeneous neurons, if damaged or severed, could have different consequences on memory than homogeneous ones, which could help scientists understand how “robust” the brain is, or how it deals with different types of injuries.
For Urban, this new research is just the beginning to uncovering the intricacies of neuronal processes. His ideal five-year plan would include developing a better understanding of mechanistic properties of neurons and what chemical properties or reactions distinguishes one neuron from the next. Although this research is still in early stages, information garnered can shed light on brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parksinson’s disease.
“At this point, we just want to find out mechanistic things,” Urban said.

The prospect of rising temperatures and global climate change has been a burden on the shoulders of scientists for many years. Whether humans are the dominant cause or not, the problem is still present, and scientists and engineers are searching for a solution. One Carnegie Mellon graduate student is studying the possibilities of geo-engineering — perturbing the Earth’s climate system — in order to combat rising temperatures.
Kate Ricke, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student who started studying the climate during her undergraduate years at MIT, has been working with faculty in the department of engineering and public policy, looking at the possible outcomes of a geo-engineering technique known as solar-radiation management (SRM). This technique entails injecting suspended particles, or aerosols, into the stratosphere to increase the reflectivity of the Earth. As more solar radiation would be reflected back into space by these particles, less of it would reach the surface, which would result in a cooling effect on global temperatures.
A source of the SRM idea was the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. Volcanic ash and other aerosols were thrust into the stratosphere and remained there for up to three years as atmospheric circulation transported them across the globe. According to www.sciencemag.org, scientists detected a short-term cooling effect on global temperatures as a result of the eruption. This event was naturally born, but it provided an interesting insight into the role of stratospheric particles on global surface temperatures.
“With the way things have been going with legislating emissions and the progress we’ve made towards abatement [of greenhouse gases], we need to at least know about geo-engineering — whether it’ll be useful in the future,” Ricke said.
The abatement of greenhouse gas emissions, Ricke further explained, would have to involve many countries taking action and reducing their emissions. However, with SRM, the Earth’s atmospheric circulation would take particles injected in any one spot and spread them out across the entire globe.
“Basically you’re all in if you do this type of geo-engineering. One person, if they have the means to put that stuff up there, could control the climate for everyone,” Ricke said. Potential effects on climate might be quite different for different regions around the world.
The study she worked on, which was recently published in Nature Geoscience, used computer models to simulate the effects of 54 different SRM scenarios on global temperature and precipitation. These simulations were then compared against the current projections on temperature and precipitation if no changes were made to greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers found that SRM could indeed prevent an increase in global temperatures, but it would also cause a global decrease in precipitation due to a reduction in water evaporation.
The major findings of the study, however, were the varying effects of SRM in different parts of the world. “If you set a criterion for what any given region would want to achieve using geo-engineering, you find that different regions prefer different things,” Ricke said. Different regions of the Earth have experienced temperature increase by different amounts and would therefore need different levels of SRM to compensate. Unfortunately, because of the global nature of SRM, it is extremely difficult to appease many different regions simultaneously. In addition, temperature effects cannot be easily localized because the atmosphere is always moving and mixing.
“It’s definitely an interesting thing to work on because there are a lot of open questions and not a whole lot of answers right now,” Ricke said. In general, the results of this study explore the possible benefits of SRM, but they also expose the complexities and uncertainties in this type of geo-engineering. SRM may result in a number of unexpected and unintended consequences, many of which would need much more experimental work and research to clarify before anyone can consider applying the technique in the real world.

Wind power is not a new invention. Windmills have been around for centuries, grinding grain and pumping water. However, for just over a century, the energy of wind has been transformed into usable electrical energy. It has become one of the most widely discussed energy topics in the scientific field today. As a viable source of energy in the future, learning the details behind wind turbine technology is important. How do wind turbines work, and how have they impacted the availability of usable energy?
Industrialization played a huge role in the development of wind turbines. According to the U.S. Department of Energy website, wind turbines appeared in Denmark as early as the 1890s. However, interest in wind power did not significantly increase until the 1970s, when oil embargos raised the price of fossil fuels greatly and people sought a less expensive form of energy. Wind power has become so widely used that the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory, part of the Department of Energy, predicts that 20 percent of American energy could eventually be provided by wind power.
Modern forms of federal legislation have also encouraged the growth of directed wind power. According to www.realclearpolitics.com, through President Barack Obama’s stimulus plan, $2 billion was directed toward the wind power sector, which made companies involved with wind turbine production eligible for tax credits. An energy bill, drafted by Congress in the wake of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, aims to reduce greenhouse gases and place more emphasis on green technology.
The basic structure of a wind turbine, according to www.HowStuffWorks.com, resembles that of any household fan. However, instead of using mechanical and electrical energy to create wind energy, a wind turbine uses wind energy to create mechanical and electrical energy. Typically two to three blades are attached to a rotor, and when the wind hits the blades, the fans spin a cylindrical, low-speed shaft inside the rotor. Blades start spinning when wind speeds reach eight to 16 miles per hour. On the other end of the shaft is a gear box, which increases the rotational speed to about 1,000 to 1,800 revolutions per minute on another shaft. This high-speed shaft drives the generator, located at the back end of the rotor. The rotations of the shaft in the presence of several electromagnets surrounding a coiled wire induce a voltage. The voltage then transfers an electrical current out of the turbine and into power lines.
Some wind turbine structures follow the vertical-axis wind turbine, or VAWT, structure, in which the shaft is mounted on a vertical axis so that the now-vertical rotors are aligned with the wind. Unfortunately, the VAWT structure requires an initial jolt of energy to begin rotation, and the close proximity to the ground reduces the amount of wind available for it to use.
Almost all of the turbines currently in use are the horizontal-axis wind turbine, or HAWT, which allows the blades of the turbine to clear the ground and maximizes the amount of wind that it may use.
It’s easy to see the allure of these turbines. They generate, for the most part, almost no pollution or atmospheric emissions, unlike fossil fuels that require a combustion reaction in order to extract their energy. Wind is an unlimited resource, so there’s no danger of running out of available power for the turbines to harness. The economic benefits are also attractive to researchers, since each kilowatt-hour of energy only costs between four and six cents, and the turbines can be constructed in rural areas to boost their economies.
Wind energy is not without its drawbacks, however. The turbines often require an isolated location, so more transmission lines must be built in order to send the electricity to cities and towns. The technology, furthermore, requires a greater startup investment than fossil fuel generators do.
Although the economic viability of wind turbines is up for debate, wind turbines have become one of the prominent ways to tap into a natural form of energy and use it to power 21st-century technologies.

The Nobel Prize is one of the most coveted awards in science. Earlier this month, on Oct. 4, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Robert Edwards for his work with in vitro fertilization.
In vitro fertilization, or IVF, was postulated in the early 1950s as a method to treat infertility. According to www.emedicinehealth.com, infertility is when a couple cannot conceive after one year, a condition that affects 6.1 million Americans and 10 percent of couples worldwide. It can be caused by many health ailments, including decreased sperm quality or physiological problems with the reproductive system. In females, the Fallopian tubes can be damaged, which prevents the egg from passing from the ovaries into the uterus, thus preventing sperm from reaching the egg.
In general, IVF is performed by removing an egg from the woman and fertilizing it outside of the body. The fertilized egg is then placed back inside the woman’s uterus, and pregnancy can occur. According to www.howthingswork.com, before the procedure can be performed, the woman must take fertility drugs to incite the production of many eggs. Usually, a woman will only produce one egg per menstrual cycle. When an egg is ready for fertilization, it is removed from the uterus with a needle and suction. If this fails, laproscopic surgery may be used, which is when an incision is made and the eggs are removed directly from the uterus.
After many eggs have been removed, doctors select the one that will hold the best chance for fertilization. The best sperm are also chosen from the father on the basis of swimming speed. The egg and sperm are mixed, and the following day, if fertilization was successful, the egg should start to divide and form an embryo. After two or three days, the embryo is placed back in the woman’s uterus.
IVF is not without its risks. According to www.howthingswork.com, nearly 30 percent of women experience some degree of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which is when the ovaries swell, causing pain. This may be treated with over-the-counter medications for some women, but others require hospitalization. In addition, the surgery involved in removing eggs can cause damage to the uterus and the surrounding organs, like the bladder. Some embryos develop in the wrong spot in the uterus and must be killed; others become fetuses that are born prematurely.
While IVF can be a successful way to conceive a child, the success rate for women under 35 years old is only 30 to 35 percent, and it continues to decrease with age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A woman might have to undergo many IVF treatments before a successful pregnancy occurs. In addition, the cost may be prohibitive to many couples, as treatments usually cost around $12,000, according to www.babycenter.com.
Before IVF was successful, many concepts in biology had to be put together, and technological advances in biological methods had to be improved. In 1971, the UK’s Medical Research Council stopped Edwards’ funding in the midst of his research. However, private funding allowed him to resume his work, and in 1978, the first “test tube” baby was born. Since then, more than 4 million “test tube” babies have been born. According to www.nobelprize.org, Edwards had worked with fertilization in other mammals in previous research and was extremely knowledgeable in his field. In selecting Edwards for the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Committee noted that babies conceived through IVF are as healthy as other children.

Facebook unveils ‘groups’ feature
Facebook introduced a host of features this past week that will give users more control over personal data. “The changes today are about giving people more control over how they share in a lot of different contexts,” Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said. “There are some things you are comfortable saying to all your friends at once but a lot of things you only want to share with your close co-workers or your family, and there just hasn’t been a great way to do that until now.”
A Groups feature will allow users to specify groups of friends with whom they want to share data. Users will also be able to download the data they upload on Facebook on any computer. Privacy, however, has been a constant thorn in the side of the world’s biggest social network whenever it introduces new products or changes settings on the site. The new Groups feature can also create concerning privacy issues because users can be added to groups unknowingly, and would have to know which groups they have been added to, in addition to who else is in the group.

Machine learns by scouring Internet
If you give a computer a well-defined task, such as winning a chess game or predicting tomorrow’s weather, it will beat any human in efficiency and accuracy. But if the task is ambiguous or abstract, the computer is no match for human intelligence. Tom Mitchell, chairman of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon, is the head of a team trying to make machines think more like humans. “For all the advances in computer science, we still don’t have a computer that can learn as humans do, cumulatively, over the long term,” Mitchell said.
However, a machine is being developed to change this. The Never-Ending Language Learning computer system, or NELL, scans hundreds of millions of pages for text patterns, which it uses to learn facts. These facts are then grouped into categories and added to the “knowledge base,” the name given to the database. According to Mitchell, a larger pool of facts will help refine NELL’s learning algorithms so that it finds facts on the Web more accurately and more efficiently over time. NELL is one project in a widening field of research and investment aimed at enabling computers to better understand the meaning of language.

Nobel Prize awarded for graphene
Professors Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Oct. 5 for successfully isolating graphene from graphite and identifying its behavior. Graphene is the thinnest, strongest material known to us today. It is so dense that even helium cannot pass through it. The Swedish Academy of Sciences said in the Nobel Prize announcement, “Carbon, the basis of all known life on earth, has surprised us once again.”
Graphene is already being used in many products, such as batteries. When added to a lithium-ion battery, graphene makes the batteries have a longer life and quicker charging capabilities. Also, electrons travel through graphene faster than silicon, which makes it a likely candidate to one day replace silicon in computer processors.

Eavesdrop on enough conversations in the University Center, and chances are you’ll eventually come across one in a language other than English. With 20 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s student body coming from countries outside the United States and with a sister campus in Qatar, Carnegie Mellon is truly a global community. Last week, the campus celebrated this diversity with the International Festival, held Thursday through Saturday. Throughout the latter half of the week, flags from countries all around the world were displayed in the University Center in honor of the festival. The theme for this year’s International Festival was “Borders: Crossings, Conflicts, Connections,” and the events throughout the three-day festival all exemplified this theme.
The Study Abroad Fair is a hub for international information. With over 20 different independent study abroad programs present, one could find a program for almost anywhere in the world, from Japan or South America to a voyage around the Atlantic Ocean. External companies were not the only ones represented at the fair, though; representatives from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the Tepper School of Business, and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences each had their own table and spoke to students about study abroad options that best fit the majors of Carnegie Mellon students.
Studying abroad, whether for a summer, a semester, or a year, can be an enriching experience that allows you to immerse yourself in another culture. The Study Abroad Fair had several vendors whose programs boasted multi-country excursions, including Semester at Sea, a 104-day academic sailing voyage that stops in 11 countries, and the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, whose program features week-long field trips to countries across Europe.
Most study abroad programs represented at the fair on Thursday boasted price tags of less than $15,000 a semester, with several programs that were less than $10,000 a semester. Through the study abroad company CIS, for example, you could spend a semester in Prague in the Czech Republic for about $8,500 a semester. With such low tuition, many parents are willing to send their students across the world for a semester. There are also plenty of options to apply for financial aid toward programs abroad.
The Study Abroad Fair also provided testimonies as to what a positive experience studying abroad can be, displayed in the hallways of the University Center. Winners of the Tartans Abroad Scholarship had poster displays recounting tales of their trips abroad, with experiences ranging from the highest governmental agencies of South Korea to the poorer neighborhoods of South Africa, and everywhere in between.
After the Study Abroad Fair, the International Festival hosted a screening of the award-winning documentary Crossing Borders. According to the documentary’s website, crossingbordersfilm.org, Crossing Borders follows four Moroccan and four American university students as they travel together through Morocco and, in the process of discovering “the other,” discover themselves. With group travels and frank discussions, the students confront the complex implications of the supposed clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. A panel discussion, featuring Carnegie Mellon students from both the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses, followed the screening to discuss the major questions and themes brought up in the documentary.
The keynote lecture and lunch took place last Friday, featuring human rights activist Enrique Morones. Morones is the founder of the humanitarian group Border Angels, which provides water and other essential supplies to people traveling through the treacherous desert areas of Mexicowhile attempting to reach the United States border. Migrants travel through these harsh environments because of Operation Gatekeeper, an American high-budget project that makes it nearly impossible for migrants to travel across safer areas of the border. According to Morones, “10,000 human beings have died as a result of Operation Gatekeeper.”
During his lecture, Morones explained how he had first gotten involved with aiding migrant workers, and recounted some of the events and campaigns he had planned to fight against racism and to encourage humane immigration reform. According to Morones, one of his earliest projects had been a convention in Los Angeles, after the Rodney King riots, that worked to promote diversity and to emphasize that “we are all members of the human race, not different races.” He also talked about his success organizing nationwide marches and protests that blocked the passing of House Resolution 4437, which would have built a wall along the entire border between the United States and Mexico. More recently, Morones delivered 40,000 letters to President Barack Obama, explaining why humane immigration reform is necessary in the United States. “This is an issue about civil rights and human rights, what’s happening with immigration,” Morones said. He also emphasized the importance of getting involved and told the audience, “It’s important that we do the right thing and speak out [against injustice].”
For those interested less in politics and more in partying, there was “Cultural Fusion: A Multicultural Late Night Event” last Friday evening in the University Center. The show-cased international food, music, and dancing, starting off with the Pittsburgh-based band Global Beats, whose music featured sounds from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Caribbean. After performing for about an hour, Global Beats was followed by a DJ and dancers who performed dance sets from Brazil, India, the Middle East, and Latin America. Carnegie Mellon’s International Student Union also contributed to the evening with artifacts from different nations and dessert and drinks from around the world.
After an evening of multicultural dancing, Saturday morning featured the “Traveling Tartans Showcase — Highlights from Student Groups’ Short-Term Trips Abroad” at the University Center. The showcase featured presentations from groups of Carnegie Mellon students who had received funding from the Tartans Abroad Scholarship to study abroad during academic break periods. If spending your summer, spring, or winter break abroad sounds appealing, then go to Carnegie Mellon’s study abroad website at 
www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/sab/gettingstarted/index.html and click on “Funding” to check out the requirements for the Tartans Abroad Scholarship.
The International Festival’s final program of the weekend was “Traveling Tartans — Study Abroad Options at Carnegie Mellon,” an information session about studying abroad that was presented in conjunction with Family Weekend. Parents and students learned about all the benefits of studying abroad, including the academic, cultural, and economic benefits. 
Even if you missed the events of the International Festival, that doesn’t mean you can’t continue to investigate and celebrate Carnegie Mellon’s international community. Ask an international friend to tell you about his or her home country’s culture. Eat dinner at Resnik Café on Tuesday for some French cuisine. Attend the “Seeking Employment Opportunities Abroad” information session on Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. in the McKenna/Peter/Wright Rooms of the University Center. And, if all else fails, you can always wait for next year’s International Festival.

The Art of Structure exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art is located in an enclosed hall of the Heinz Architectural Center. Heavy glass doors with “The Art of Structure” scrawled across them face visitors as they enter a hallway of yellow walls and high ceiling arches. After walking through the entire space, visitors may realize that the curves of the interior structure match the concepts behind the two projects on display.
The show is meant to demonstrate the innate connection between architects and engineers. Such collaborations have created stunning engineering feats, such as the Brooklyn Bridge and the Eiffel Tower, which are also sources of artistic inspiration.
According to the Art of Structure press release, professor David Billington of Princeton University stated that, in the 19th and 20th centuries, “structural forms came exclusively from the engineering imagination,” and that “aesthetic sensitivity was central” to the thinking of engineers. Such structures not only stand up or connect point A to point B, but they do so with such economy, elegance, and sensibility as to construct an original art form.
The exhibit features The Swiss Legacy, a representation of the work of four engineers and Felix Candela, an architect. The Swiss Legacy showcases two projects from the collection of each of the four engineers exhibited.
Each engineer’s work is displayed through models of structures under glass cases and through pictures on the walls. There is also a stereoscopic display of one project from each engineer’s body of work. This type of display involves a large print of a structure, with another copy, flipped laterally, next to it. A mirror is positioned in between the original image and its reverse so that an observer can look straight ahead at the original image with one eye and at the reflection of the reverse with the other eye. The result is a three-dimensional view of the structure. This kind of display is an excellent addition to the exhibit because the work of the engineers is meant to be viewed and enjoyed three-dimensionally.
Robert Maillart, Othwar Ammann, Heinz Isler, and Christian Menn are all engineers that created beautiful bridges or — in Isler’s case — vault-like shells that stretch concrete to cover maximum area with minimum material.
Félix Candela is the architect of the exhibit. He trained in Spain and is most famous for his work with curved surfaces — specifically hyperbolic paraboloids, which are generated from sets of straight lines. This means that unorthodox shapes can be created through the use of simple boards as formwork. There are pictures and little models of his “umbrella” structure, which he used to create the Chiclayo Market in Peru.
“It’s a source of inspiration,” said Jae Han Bae, a second-year architecture student. “I am here for an assignment as well,” he said, but mostly the work he saw was “interesting.”
The work displayed serves as testimony to the ingenuity, as well as the beauty, in the structures created, forever utilized and admired by all.
The Art of Structure is open during regular museum hours at the Carnegie Museum of Art through Sept. 17, 2011.

While some may say that eating is the worst possible way to deal with stress, for some students, escaping the pressure of the Carnegie Mellon campus for a leisurely night out with friends is actually a great way to relax. For most, a visit to South Craig Street or a walk down to Shadyside is satisfactory, but if you’re looking for a change of atmosphere, or possibly planning for that special first date, why not take a trip to bustling downtown?
While one can always find restaurants with pub-like atmospheres in Shadyside and Oakland, a restaurant of a similar impression is a rare find in urban downtown. That’s why visitors were excited by the cozy dining atmosphere and unique eating experience when Tavern 245 opened this July in a tucked-away location on Fourth Avenue.
Owner Chip Hamilton, in an interview with Pam Starr of The Pittsburgh Tribune, said that when it comes to dining downtown, there is a large gap between the multiple fast-food restaurants and the up-scale dining establishments. “We are trying to create a niche that’s not being met downtown,” Hamilton said. “My vision was of an affordable lunch menu with good food. The most expensive thing here is $12.”
There are certain aspects about this restaurant that are uniquely tavern-like, yet the ambiance is still incredibly modern. The restaurant, like your typical pub, serves several locally brewed beers on tap. Similarly, with a smoker-friendly bar area and a downstairs lounge furnished with classic leather seating, this downstairs restaurant gives off a classic ’50s feel.
The upstairs dining area gives off a completely different impression with tall ceilings, large windows, and contrastingly avant-garde decor. The bar upstairs channels the atmosphere of a Manhattan social hub with its racks of various liquors and expansive cocktail menu.
Atmosphere aside, the Tavern 245 menu is an interesting take on American cuisine. Along with classic salads and sandwiches, the menu also features an assortment of entrees that draw from European and Latin American flavors.
Several international foods are represented within the Tavern 245 menu. From Italian classics like bruschetta and caprese chicken to Asian-influenced dishes like the seared orange ahi, it truly feels as if there is a world of options in front of you. Aside from popular American dishes like the downtown burger and classic reuben, Tavern 245 also offers several Pittsburgh-inspired dishes like the steel city quesadillas, the penguin wingers, and the Pittsburgher angus beef entree.
The menu of Tavern 245 was put together by executive chef Jay Lewis, a 35-year-old Californian native who previously worked at the Palomino restaurant on Liberty Avenue before it closed last May. Lewis, a self-taught chef who never attended culinary school, is known to pay close attention to his dishes. Because of this attention to detail, Lewis’ appetizers and sandwiches go a long way in taste.
Already, Lewis’ food has made quite an impression on food critics. A critic from www.foodburgh.com wrote that “[Tavern 245] serves up a casual atmosphere, friendly staff, and a menu that I could enjoy,” naming the Fourth Avenue Tacos as his favorite dish. Writers from both the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Pittsburgh Tribune also had only positive things to say.
Despite the somewhat mature atmosphere, the Tavern 245 menu has also largely appealed to the student population. “I loved eating at Tavern 245,” said Lauren Milisits, a sophomore mechanical engineering major. “My friends and I went to the upstairs dining room over parents’ visiting weekend. The caesar salad was incredible and my chicken sandwich was layered with the most delicious combination of fresh ingredients. I love how the chef took an assortment of classic American dishes and spiced them up with healthy toppings and alternatives.”
Vegetarian diners need not be fooled by the restaurant’s apparent meat-centered menu. Tavern 245 has a plethora of options, including guacamole dishes, hummus dishes, and various soups and salads. Also, any entree featured on the menu can also be re-created as a vegetarian option.
Tavern 245 also boasts several homemade desserts for diners with a sweet tooth. The menu includes several healthy options including fruit plates and sorbets, plus more decadent treats like strawberry shortcake, Dave and Andy’s ice cream, and black and gold chocolate mousse.
If you’re in the mood for some delicious food and a trendy, fresh atmosphere, take a trip downtown to Tavern 245. Chances are you’ll find yourself refreshed and your tummy satisfied.
Tavern 245, located at 245 Fourth Ave., is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday. The lounge stays open until 2 a.m.

No Age has returned from its two-year break to release its latest album, Everything In Between. Nouns, the duo’s debut, was a heavy mix of distortion and fuzz. It seemed to blur the lines between a duo and a four- or even five-member band, as a lot of action happened in each of the album’s tracks. 
From the first few seconds of thumping bass in Everything In Between, it is clear that No Age is determined to not just release the same album again. In Everything In Between, No Age builds and expands on the initial pallet of fuzz, but also throws in tracks that could easily have been in Nouns. With their sophomore effort, guitarist Randy Randall and drummer/vocalist Dean Spunt have released their most consistent group of songs to date.
On the track “Common Heat,” Spunt utters, “I try to make myself seem vague.” He seems to have spoken No Age’s slogan. While the group is lyrically subpar, No Age has an unnatural ability to craft near-perfect fuzz-pop. Nouns primarily consisted of tracks that were technically two and a half minutes, but were truly only a minute long since they were padded with lots of fuzzy introductions. Everything In Between has a couple of lengthy introductions, but they are no longer filler. As a result, the album has much more substance, more killer riffs, and less filler fuzz.
No Age is representative of tomorrow’s punk scene. Much as Blink-182 introduced pop-punk to the masses, No Age attempts to define a new era of punk — one that embraces the fuzz and squeals of indie rock. It admires Pavement’s sloppiness, the White Stripes’ do-it-yourself vibe, and Sonic Youth’s punk. It isn’t trying to be avant-garde; rather, it is simply crafting songs that urge you to yell and scream — without whining about your life. No Age isn’t emo. It’s punk, and it isn’t afraid to name its songs “Shred and Transcend,” mixing both its indie and punk roots.
Nouns represents the band during its adolescence. It sought to unleash the band’s youthful nature onto the public. Instead of transcending its baser instincts, the band seemed unable to handle being in its mid-20s. Everything In Between lays its late teens and mid-20s to rest. “Glitter” most evidently portrays the album’s theme. Guitars sprawl without venom, vocals drone without feeling, and drums beat without any anger. Spunt continually repeats, “I’ve been wondering when is it my time to get away, and you feel like everyone is out to get you again. I want you back underneath my skin.”
Despite the song’s apparently depressed state, Everything In Between is still a punk album. “Shred and Transcend” is a killer track that seems to be over before it begins despite its 3:21 track length. “Fever Dreaming” is a straightforward romp.  
Toward the latter half of the album, there are a couple of tracks that lack their killer instinct.  However, this seems intentional, especially as each song is juxtaposed against the other. “Positive Amputation” is a beautifully sprawling track that is a perfect follow-up to the hazy “Dusted.”  
Everything In Between is an album that lives up to its name. It marks No Age as a band that is willing to evolve past its initial success. It isn’t relying on its original sound, but it recognizes that it shouldn’t completely alter its successful formula. The album is punk with fuzz, stuck equally between the two. It looks at years between youth and adulthood with regret.  No Age is now ready to look toward its future — a bright future.

With the first music blogs came the exponential growth of options for discovering artists and learning about new music. It can easily become overwhelming to sort through all the different Tumblr, Wordpress, and Blogspot music sites. Here are a few essential blogs to start off with. This is not a comprehensive list, but rather a beginning foray into the ever-expanding world of music blogging:
Pitchfork Media (pitchfork.com)
It is difficult to talk about music blogs without mentioning the behemoth that is Pitchfork Media.  The site focuses on music news, reviews, and interviews rather than music downloads. Few sites are respected (and criticized) as much as Pitchfork. Established in 1995, this blog has become highly influential in the music world, with reviews that can often make or break an aspiring artist’s career. Pitchfork focuses on independent music, but is often criticized for its limited view and skewed album ratings.
Hype Machine (hypem.com)
The Hype Machine is an MP3 blog aggregator, and it keeps track of what music bloggers write about. It conveniently compiles the music of the blogosphere for easy discovery and consumption. Hype Machine shows the latest music that other blogs are posting, popular songs, and trending artists. This site is great for stumbling upon great new music and music blogs.  
Gorilla vs. Bear (gorillavsbear.net)
Gorilla vs. Bear is an influential music blog that features both established and up-and-coming artists.  Showcasing an eclectic taste, Gorilla vs. Bear only posts about music it absolutely loves. It has been called the New Yorker of hipster blogs and was named one of the best music blogs by Rolling Stone and URB Magazine. Often at the forefront of new music, Gorilla vs. Bear is usually the first media outlet to mention rising bands. In the past, these have included El Guincho, Girls, Neon Indian, and Wavves.
Said the Gramophone (saidthegramophone.com)
Launched in 2003, Said the Gramophone is one of the first MP3 blogs. The site, named one of the 25 best blogs of 2009 by Time magazine, is written by three Canadian music fans who provide a daily sampler of music. The rise to fame of such bands as Beirut, Arcade Fire, Yeasayer, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is often attributed to this blog. Music is free to download, but all songs are removed from the blog within a week or two of posting.
Daytrotter (daytrotter.com)
Rather than posting or reposting songs being circulated among music blogs, Daytrotter contributes re-worked, alternate versions of songs by well-known, obscure, or rising artists. Artists on tour stop by The Horseshack, the website’s recording studio in Rock Island, Ill., to record old songs and unreleased tracks live. Artists and groups who have recorded for the site include Phantom Planet, Carly Simon, Daniel Johnston, Of Montreal, Fleet Foxes, and Toro Y Moi.
La Blogothèque (blogotheque.net)
Each week Vincent Moon films sessions with artists or groups as part of Les Concerts à Emporter, or The Take-Away Shows. The sessions follow musicians around city streets, parks, apartments, public transit, and bars. With little preparation, the artists can showcase their talents without studio production. Sessions have featured bands including Bon Iver, R.E.M., Stephen Malkmus, The Shins, and Phoenix.
Other blogs to check out: 
I Guess I’m Floating (iguessimfloating.net), The Perfect Five (theperfectfive.com), Brooklyn Vegan (brooklynvegan.com), Tiny Mix Tapes (tinymixtapes.com), and Aquarium Drunkard (aquariumdrunkard.com).

When I first realized I wanted to be a scientist of some sort, I knew I had to go through a very important rite of passage: I had to travel to the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador to pay tribute to one of the fathers of evolutionary theory, Charles Darwin. Darwin used his exploration of the famous archipelago during his journey on the H.M.S. Beagle to conceive his theory. Like many of my peers, I considered walking in his footsteps a crucial step in my career.  
To explore the islands, it was necessary to travel via boat. Our boating staff was composed of a small family: a chef, a captain, a guide, and a few other hands to make the voyage smooth sailing, though we were by no means traveling on a cruise ship. It was actually a very cultural experience because, while our guide did speak English fairly well, the rest of the crew mostly spoke Spanish and Quechua, the native language of Ecuador. We were able to communicate with the crew between our broken Spanish and their broken English, and it made for some very amusing conversations. The cramped quarters and the language barriers were worth it once we stepped off the boat and began exploring the first island. 
The diversity of animals on the islands was more impressive than I had expected, even though I was armed with personal accounts from my teachers and hours of studious preparation. Not only did we get to see blue-footed boobies, giant tortoises (pictured), marine iguanas, land iguanas, penguins, and finches, but we got to see the rare albatross, an amazing variety of fish, and much more. Unexpectedly, we also saw a huge population of California sea lions. These mammals tended to lie on the beach while tourists stomped through their home. There was one time, though, where we got a little bit of a fright from an animal’s aggression: A sea lion alpha male must have decided to put the adolescents in their place, because he began chasing them and they all started running straight at our group. Of course, our guide, Jorge, was unfazed and told us not to worry. As it turned out, the sea lions stopped before they got too close, and I got my best picture of the trip (where it looks like the sea lions are kissing) because of it. 
On the trip, we tried to structure our days to see at least one, maybe two islands. When we remained at an island for only one day, we would generally hike the island in the morning to learn about the animals and the geography. We’d return to the boat for lunch, where the chef served us Ecuadorian cuisine. Our guide would then take us snorkeling for the afternoon. The marine population was surprisingly much less diverse than the land population. Rather, I should say that it was much less colorful than the land population. This is due to the water temperature — despite being located near the equator, the archipelago is subject to a very cold current, which snakes under the ocean and is then forced up toward the surface when it hits the rising geography of the islands. The cold water means that the fauna and flora underwater are a much more conservative population. It also means that I had to wear a wetsuit for all my snorkeling experiences, which defied my expectation for the tropical climate. The cold water was not all bad, however; it is also the reason we were able to see penguins at the equator. We even got to swim with sea turtles and play with sea lions. 
The trip was partly so much fun because we were able to make observations of the animals up close. None of the animals are afraid of humans because the activity of tourists on the islands is severely limited. Only a amall number of visitors are allowed to travel through the islands at a given time. Additionally, to try to prevent contamination between islands, guides are asked to ensure that tourists brush sand off themselves before re-entering the boat and that no creatures, rocks, or plants are brought with them. The conservation effort is actually very admirable and, I think, successful so far. 
As a separate part of our trip, we visited the capital of Ecuador, Quito. There we spent a day volunteering at a local school, working side by side with the students and community members to repaint the one-room  schoolhouse. Everyone was extremely friendly and sympathetic despite our butchered Spanish. I was really impressed with the compassion of the society. Occasionally, we came across blue hearts painted in the streets of the city; it turns out these blue hearts are painted to honor victims of car accidents. It was one of the most moving aspects of the trip. 
The scientist in me must also point out how enjoyable it was to visit the equator. Though it was over an hour’s drive into the mountains, visiting the equator was extremely fun. A number of very interesting phenomena occur directly on the equator, which we all got to test by balancing an egg on a nail and watching water swirl in different directions, depending on which side of the equator the drain was on. 
Although visiting Ecuador was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I would love to go back again and spend more time observing, discovering, and exploring.

The Social Network, hailed by a number of prominent reviewers as the movie of our generation, is often smart and consistently entertaining. However, let’s not be so quick to let it define our generation.
The movie chronicles Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, as he develops Facebook and (sort of) deals with the ensuing litigation. Dumped by his girlfriend and obsessed with the exclusive Final Club at Harvard University, Zuckerberg’s first foray into social networking sites and our second glimpse into his shocking lack of tact involves him hacking university computers to create a website for visitors to rank their female classmates based on appearance.
The film spends most of its 121 minutes recounting the early stages of Facebook, using flashbacks framed by the testimony from two lawsuits against the site’s founder. Eduardo Saverin (played by new Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield), who is from all evidence Zuckerberg’s sole friend, spends his screen time mostly whining about the increasing role of super-sleaze Sean Parker. (Kudos to Justin Timberlake for his performance in this role.) The Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer) are wealthy Final Club members who recount their contributions to the multi-billion-dollar enterprise and provide the majority of the film’s comic relief.
Surprisingly funny at points and terribly engrossing, The Social Network presents a story that most Carnegie Mellon students will, in many respects, undoubtedly relate to — or envy. Most of Zuckerberg’s lines showcase his unfailing wit, most often used to undermine the few adults in the film. The smart-ass remarks and too-clever comments, nonetheless, quickly become trite.
Again, most Carnegie Mellon students will relate. As The Social Network follows Zuckerberg, its focus is a narrow one, and women are relegated to marginal roles. Although there was a pair of female lawyers, the rest of the women are cast as being jealous and bad at video games. The film is not necessarily chauvinistic — just the characters. Since women account for less than 10 percent of tech start-up founders — according to Astia, a venture capital organization dedicated to increasing this percentage — a different depiction would most likely not have been accurate. This is especially true of the girl-obsessed Zuckerberg, who spends the final scene of the film trying to “friend” the ex-girlfriend whose rebuke kicks off the film (“You’re going to go through life thinking girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd. It’ll be because you’re an asshole”). No worries, though. Marylin Delpy (played by The Office’s Rashida Jones) redeems Zuckerberg, telling him: “You’re not an asshole, Mark. You’re just trying so hard to be one.” 
With a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and direction by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), The Social Network provides a compelling, if not entirely fact-based, look into a hugely influential phenomenon and how a socially incompetent person redefined how we socialize.

One day on the Cut this autumn I was scritchin’ and scratchin’ — you know, you know, professionally beat matchin’ some vinyl — when a shadowy figure loomed before me. I squinted my eyes and saw what appeared to be an android bearing an anthracite guitar and a glowing red 2001 iMac monitor on his head. He said no words; rather, he tilted his head, and white buzzing squares on the screen began to race. Slowly he spit out two CDs from his palms and handed them to me. 
He turned and began to leave without saying a word. I couldn’t allow myself to see him leave without knowing his name, so I quickly slipped, “Wh— Who are you?” In a bitcrushed tone he crunched back, “Robot Cowboy.”
Robot Cowboy — Dan Wilcox: a futuristic, expatriate American space ranger who combines wearable computing, MIDI guitar, and live energy to wander the digi-range playing for dying astronauts. This is a low-fi guitar show with algorithmic balls from a devospud, laptop-stomping idiot wearing exposed electronics.
His mission, you ask? 
“You are unwittingly controlled by your machines; I feel obligated to return the favor through sonic variations in time and booty shaking. I will protect you from the arcane sonic forces which threaten your very existence.” 
He’s roaming on campus somewhere. You should find him and ask him for a demo on how to masterfully use PureData.
Want to hear what he’s got in store for you, cosmonaut? Type this universal resource locator into your Internet browser: www.robotcowboy.com/category/media/
Bisous,

**Dear Hoskins Brothers, **
I’ve recently been slighted in a widely read and popular periodical on campus (which will go unnamed). I was shocked to discover that a shameless impersonator characterized me as a spineless sycophant! How do I deal with such surreptitiously public libel!
Sincerely,
Somewhat angry Stan
Dear SAS,
Textual combat is a deadly game, and, when the ink starts flowing, you’ve got to break out your best ballpoint pen and strike back. The first thing you have to do is clear your good name. Let people know your identity has been hijacked. Facebook, Twitter, and mass e-mails to your friends are all ways to let the world know the real you. Do you have a blog? If not, then get one — blogs are awesome.
Now that the people are onto the shenanigans, it’s time to lay on the written abuse. Did he call you a bad name (say, an arthritic woman)? Then make a funny word outta his (example: Patty = Fatty). Did he make fun of the way you look (say, a dumb buzz cut)? Then mock the dumb way he talks (nice lisp). Are his insults blunt? Then make yours sharp. Did he write a paragraph of insults? Then break out a whole novel. That’s the Carnegie way.
Word smart is word tough,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Last week I publicly hurt someone close to me. I can’t say what I did because it’s too horrible, but needless to say I was irresponsible and in the wrong. How do I make it up to him? I can’t undo a public embarrassment!
**Sincerely, 
All too sorry **
Dear ATS,
It sounds like you’re a real jerk. A lot of scum write to this advice column, but you’re definitely the lowest of the low. How could you stab your own friend or close relative (brother?) in the back? My own personal shock aside, what you need to do is clear. You must publicly acknowledge the wrongdoing, apologize to the injured parties, and, ideally, bake them a cake.
Healing broken friendships can be difficult, but baked confections are the easiest way to patch up a schism. Batter is thicker than water, so the sooner you make a real gesture of regret, the sooner you can get on with your life. If you can muster up the backbone to say you’re sorry, then the least you can do is open up a box of confetti cake. Oh, and don’t overcook it. You have enough to be sorry about.
**Patrick definitely didn’t write this response, **
Patrick Hoskins

Apparently, Carnegie Mellon was part of a consortium of Pittsburgh businesses that owned the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1985 to 1996. Well, at least Carnegie Mellon was only partially responsible for the first five of 18 consecutive losing seasons.

With only three weeks until the 2010 congressional elections, signs have cropped up all over the city to remind voters of this upcoming event. The advent of television attack ads, red and blue campaign posters, and daily poll results in every form of media reinforce the importance of voting, especially for voters aged 18–25, who historically have had the lowest percentage turnout. Last Saturday, Hamburg Hall 1000 was crowded with students eager to hear several politicians voice their support for Dan Onorato and Joe Sestak, the Democratic candidates for Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial and Senatorial races, respectively. The highlight of the event, however, was the arrival of actor Matthew Morrison, a renowned Broadway performer and current star of Fox’s hit show Glee.
The rally started with the introduction of Richard Fitzgerald, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus (’81) and an Allegheny County Council member. Fitzgerald’s strong demeanor and passionate speech emphasized Onorato’s accomplishments to date and also expressed his opinion that the Republican Party’s agenda to “turn back the clock” on issues such as health care, green technologies, and women’s rights. The GOP, associated with “big money” and Senatorial candidate Pat Toomey, would also abolish the middle class, Fitzgerald claimed. Young people, he added, are the key to winning this election. “We’re a blue state. There are 1.2 million more Democrats than Republicans. The only way we can lose,” he said, speaking to the students in the crowd, “is if you don’t vote.”
Next on the lineup was Congressman Mike Doyle, who represents the 14th District of Pennsylvania. Doyle stressed that the GOP was a stubborn party that refused to find middle ground with “seemingly sensible Democratic policies” regarding health care, tax cuts for small businesses, tax incentives for companies, and green energy jobs. “Let’s create some clean-energy jobs in the country; let’s be a leader in the energy revolution taking place; let’s not follow China.... Republicans said no,” Doyle said, pacing the stage. 
Doyle also compared the two candidates’ track records: Sestak was an admiral in the navy; Toomey was a derivatives trader on Wall Street and has ties to China. 
According to Doyle, the GOP is outspending the Democrats 8:1 in this campaign. “The way we beat money is with people,” he said. “If we show up, we win. It’s that simple.” But like in Fitzgerald’s speech, just 10 minutes before, his main message was clear: A large voter turnout among young citizens is the key to winning the election.
The final speaker of the rally, Matthew Morrison, entered the room to standing applause and enthusiastic responses from the audience members. Morrison, who flew on a red-eye from California to campaign for the Democratic candidates, stressed the importance of voting and injected seemingly Glee-inspired words of wisdom regarding LGBT hate crimes and personal empowerment into his speech. “I’m here to speak to you as a young voter,” Morrison said. “As young Americans, we can speak louder than any one individual voice. We, the youth of America, can shape the future of this state and this country.... We need to find ways to work together.” 
Among the topics Morrison touched upon, education, respect, and tolerance were his focal points. Morrison chose to help campaign for Onorato and Sestak because he is a supporter of the Democratic Party and its policies, and he feels electing such officials is “important to the grand scheme of things.” 
Election Day, Nov. 2., is quickly approaching. According to www.politico.com, the most recent polls (Oct. 5, Muhlenberg College/_The Morning Call_) show that Onorato is currently trailing Republican Tom Corbett in the polls 47 to 36 percent. The same poll shows Sestak trailing Toomey 45 to 38 percent.

Charles Mastervich is studying humanities at Mount Aloysius College. Having contacted the institution’s admissions office, he recently enrolled as a transfer student. The university allowed Mastervich to receive transfer credits on the basis of his previous educational history at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and Carnegie Mellon University. However, Mastervich, unlike any ordinary transfer student, turns 80 years old this November.
After graduating from Johnstown High School in 1948, Mastervich committed to playing professional baseball in a now-defunct league. In a disappointing turn of events, though, the league collapsed while Mastervich was still on spring break in Arkansas. He was not even afforded the opportunity to play one game. He decided then to work at the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat and was involved in presswork to make ends meet. Mastervich had a long career at the Tribune and held various positions until his retirement in 1989. He did, however, take time off from the newspaper from 1952 to 1955 in order to serve the army during the Korean War. He subsequently attended university on the G.I. Bill on a part-time basis from 1955 to 1958 and was able to concurrently continue his job at the newspaper. Mastervich studied business at the University of Pittsburgh before enrolling at Carnegie Mellon (known as Carnegie Tech in those days) to study printing management. Unfortunately, he had to focus his attention on his work to support his family and was unable to complete the program.
In an interview with Altoona Mirror reporter Scott Muska, Mastervich explained that a combination of factors led him to reach his decision to return to school now. Above all, he describes the decision as something of a “task completion.” “It was for me,” Mastervich said. “My wife passed away six years ago, and I’m in my 22nd year of retirement, so I asked myself ‘What does one do?’ ” A thoughtful man, Mastervich went on to say he’d often wondered what he would have done if he had been able to graduate from college.
“Basically, I just walked him through the enrollment and scheduling process just like I would any other transfer student coming in who already had a lot of credits,” said Heather Low, the Mount Aloysius associate director of admissions, in an interview with Altoona Mirror. Low works with Mastervich as his advisor and will continue to do so until Mastervich graduates in May 2011. “It has been a real delight to work with him, because he appreciates what he’s going through so much and he has a very different perspective than most students,” Low said. “He’s not going to school for some sort of career obligation, but specifically for the love of learning.”
Muska met and talked to Mastervich and relayed the experience to The Tartan. “He is a pretty nice smart guy and he’s really with it for being almost 80 years old. He liked to talk a lot. We talked about how respectful people were to him and how surprised he was about it,” Muska said. “His teachers all mentioned that he does every little bit of work assigned. His history teacher also said that class is interesting because Charlie was alive during a lot of the periods the class is studying and offers unique insights.”
“I have a lot of time to get my work done, and I really admire the younger students’ time-management skills, because they have to be acute,” said Mastervich, who commutes to school from a senior center in Johnstown, in the same interview with Muska.
When he began classes last spring, Mastervich didn’t expect to last two weeks. Since then, he has started to appreciate and enjoy the college experience in a way he thinks many of his peers don’t. He especially appreciates the small classes Mount Aloysius offers. “The youngsters don’t always realize what they have here, that it’s a gem,” Mastervich said. “I’ve been in classes with hundreds of students where you’re basically just a number, and that never happens here.”
“Just wow. [His story] makes you appreciate learning and makes me feel like I should value the experience more,” said Aderin Akintilo, a sophomore information systems major. “It’s such a remarkable and inspirational story. It would make a great script for a film.”
“The people always ask me why I do this, and my response is always, ‘Why not?’ ” Mastervich said. “I’ve always been an active person, and I really enjoy this, and the more I get involved the more I want to do.”

In the next few months, the Carnegie Mellon bookstore will play host to 21st-century hardware in the form of interactive touchscreens that will help shoppers gain information about products, coupons, and sales. The trial run of these signs will not only help make products more accessible for bookstore shoppers, but will also test the feasibility and productivity of the technology in the context of an actual store. The specific details of the hardware have not been fully disclosed, though at the annual Intel Corporation Open House at Intel Labs Pittsburgh, located on campus, two large interactive panels were on display and were demonstrated.
Working on the notions of innovation and efficiency, the presentation of the interactive panels centered on customer liberation from the strictures of conventional retailer procedures. “What if you could discover the store on your own?” said Priya Narasimhan, the operational director at Intel Labs Pittsburgh. Being able to locate items in-store and have a route to them mapped on screen, look up information concerning a certain product, and have coupons sent to mobile telephones are all within the reach. Features such as a camera to read facial expressions and track what catches a customer’s eye are not far behind, either.
These potential capabilities impact not only the way in which consumers go about their shopping, but also offer retailers previously inaccessible data. “Kiosks are great, in the sense that they can collect information that you’re willing to provide while notifying customers about deals, specials, and the like,” said Ari Lightman, a professor in the Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon.
First introduced in 1974, touchscreen technology is admittedly mature, far from anything radical. It has contemporaneously become the selling point for some of today’s most popular consumer good—mobile telephones, ultraportable laptop computers, and photo frames, to name a few.
The domain of retail, however, mandates a more creative approach to application of the technology. In 2006, Ralph Lauren covered much of a window at its Madison Avenue flagship location with a 67-inch touchscreen, which gave passersby the opportunity to browse and order apparel without walking through the front doors. Until the integration of digital convenience and instantaneity with the in-store experience, the retail sector had seen a very limited share of recent technology.
The slow uptake in these sorts of human-computer interfacing systems may be due to generational norms, said Aaron Brauser, vice president of product management at the locally based First Insight, a consumer analysis firm. “I think it’s a generational thing, where it takes a while for people to get comfortable with technology and it incrementally grows.” 
Therefore, a college bookstore may be the ideal location to test such an application, as college students are, according to Brauser, “much more apt to be comfortable” with this sort of openly accessible device.
There are high hopes for the proposed interface panels to improve store economics as well as the shoppers’ individual experiences.
“I wish that more stores had this. I can’t wait for the day when you can walk into a Target or Best Buy and know where everything is,” said Brian Humbarger, a first-year CIT student.

For Tepper first-years, an etiquette dinner is a delicious four-course meal in the University Club on the University of Pittsburgh campus, as well as a chance to network with faculty and student leaders. The catch is that they must exhibit and learn proper table manners.
“The majority of freshmen, while they do not have awful table manners, do not necessarily know some of the more subtle nuances,” said Meghan Durbiano, a senior in business administration and the current president of Carnegie Mellon Business Association (CMBA), the organization that runs the etiquette dinner. “Some of them may have had exposure at weddings or formal events, but that does not necessarily mean that they know to turn their cell phones off or which fork to use.”
“Etiquette is a means to an end,” said Milton Cofield, the executive director of the undergraduate business administration program. “We use manners and appropriate social behavior … to properly represent oneself in situations where these behaviors are expected or required.”
Cofield and Kristen Carew, a senior in business administration, led the event and directed students on how to properly eat and behave during each course of the meal. “I first experienced any type of etiquette training when I went to the etiquette dinner myself as a freshman,” said Carew. “Since then, I’ve been to a lot of interviews, corporate events, and other dinner events … and it has definitely been important even if it hasn’t been at the front of my mind…. Now it’s not something I actually have to think about anymore.”
The rules of etiquette range from obvious to esoteric. “The interview dinner is not the time to order that $75 steak on the menu,” said Cofield. “Wait until the host orders, and then order something less expensive.”
Cofield stressed that etiquette dinner is about something broader than just table manners. “It’s about what are appropriate social behaviors, not just for formal dining, but for all kinds of situations where people need to understand what the protocols are, what the proper behaviors are, and, perhaps most importantly, what the negative consequences of inappropriate social behavior are,” Cofield said. “If you don’t have good manners, that’s going to hinder your ability to make a good impression,” Durbiano said.
Cofield also explained that it is crucial for first-years to learn these sorts of manner-related lessons now, rather than expecting to learn them later in situations where opportunities are at stake. For incoming students, the etiquette dinner offers a rare chance to make social mistakes and learn from them, an opportunity not likely to be available in real-life business situations.
Cofield also added, “The sins of the system are that people will not tell you if your behavior is not appropriate, but they will enact a penalty against you in their minds.... That penalty could cost you a job, a date, or some other type of relationship.”
The etiquette dinner may include seemingly tedious instruction on topics like table setting or social courtesies, but upperclassmen insist that the dinner is more about learning to navigate the social guidelines and expectations of the business world.
“The whole idea is really to not only give freshmen the opportunity to practice etiquette, meet other students and upperclassmen, but also to expose them to the social side of business,” said Durbiano. “Just in general in life, you should know these things.”

Carnegie Mellon to receive grant from Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs Gives made a $2 million grant to Carnegie Mellon, announced last Friday, to assist students whose families have been exceptionally affected by America’s recent economic recession. 
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund created by the financial investment bank Goldman Sachs. The program is led by managing directors of the firm who recommend grants to qualified charitable organizations and aim to combine the collective philanthropic efforts of the employees. 
Established in 2007, the main purpose of Goldman Sachs Gives has been to increase the firm’s support of charitable organizations around the world.
In a university press release, President Jared L. Cohon said, “Today’s economic climate has caused an increased need for financial support among many of our students. In fact, over the next three years we are expecting that need to increase, both for those already enrolled and those planning to attend our university.”
The $2 million gift will be used to create scholarships based on financial need and academic performance beginning this semester. The grant will fund both endowed and expendable scholarships for students. 
The contribution was made at the recommendation of Paul M. Russo (S ’86), managing director at Goldman Sachs.
School of Music recognizes alumnus, pianist Earl Wild
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music honored the life and accomplishments of alumnus Earl Wild (1915–2010) in a “Celebration of Life” event held last Saturday in the College of Fine Arts’ Kresge Theatre. The event featured performances by artist lecturer Enrique Graf; alumni Mark Carver and Ciro Fodore; and guest pianists David Korevaar, Slade Trammell, and Anne Taffel. The program showcased famous pieces beloved by Wild in addition to his original compositions. 
Wild was a legendary concert pianist, composer, and educator. By the time he enrolled at Carnegie Mellon, known as Carnegie Tech at that time, he was already an accomplished concert pianist. He was the first pianist to give a recital via live broadcast on American television, as well as the first to give a performance streamed live over the Internet. 
In addition to his famous performances, Wild has taught at prestigious universities and conservatories, including Carnegie Mellon. In 1986, he was awarded the Liszt Medal by the Hungarian government in recognition of his long association with the music of composer Franz Liszt. 
At his last concert performance in 2008, Wild was awarded the President’s Merit Award by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

Film Screening: Dabbawallas
Monday at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Paul Goodman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business, will present the documentary Dabbawallas. 
In India, a unique food delivery business functions and thrives without the aid of technology that is taken for granted in America. The “dabbawallas,” named from the word dabba, for “box,” and walla, for “person,” transfer lunches from people’s homes to their workplaces between 8:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. every day. 
For example, in the city of Mumbai, India, there are 1 million deliveries a week with a 98 percent success rate. The workforce consists of 4,000 dabbawallas that transport more than 100,000 lunches a day. This documentary will investigate this intriguing workforce that relies on human perseverance and creativity, in conjunction with the seminar India Today: Economics, Technology, and People.

A number of Republican primaries this year have been won, not by mainstream GOP-supported candidates, but by so-called Tea Party candidates supported by that organization. While a number of opinions exist in the Tea Party establishment, there are several particularly radical candidates who have made it into the national spotlight. We find these politicians’ popularity disturbing, and so we have catalogued some of their bizarre quotes, opinions, and actions. After all, no argument we can make will be more damaging to these candidates than their own words.
Urquhart wants Americans to believe that Hitler invented the separation of church and state. He said while campaigning: “So the next time your liberal friends talk about the separation of church and state, ask them why they’re Nazis.” So, why are many Americans Nazis? Probably because of Thomas Jefferson’s letter to the Danbury Baptists, which says, “The whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.” 
“Hi, I’m Carl, and I’m angry. I want to be your governor.” Truly an inspiring way to begin a speech.
Yes, Paladino is angry. He is angry at the New York Post for sending “goons” to photograph his daughter. He is angry with his “despicable opponent,” who he claims has been unfaithful to his wife. He is angry with President Obama, so he has forwarded e-mails of the Obamas Photoshopped as a pimp and a prostitute and distributed a video of an African tribal dance titled “Obama inauguration rehersal.”
Paladino reported that he was able to negotiate the freedom of Syracuse University’s chancellor during student protests after the 1970 Kent State shootings. Friends have said this event has been exaggerated; one called it “an urban legend in his mind,” and a Syracuse history professor said that the entire story was completely fabricated and that no hostages were ever held. 
On his website, Paladino advocates that, if he were elected, “any able-bodied New Yorker on unemployment or welfare will join the Dignity Corps” — the Dignity Corps being a new program where prisons would be converted into “work centers.” Here they will learn “how to earn their checks, and personal hygiene.”
Angle’s angle so far has been to not settle on any issues. She tried to block adding fluoride to water, but then stopped. In a 2006 interview, Angle was against alcohol (or any drug) being legal, but she took that viewpoint back recently. She of course wants to repeal the federal “Obama-care” health program, but she also either wants to shut down, “transition out,” or “personalize” Social Security, depending on the day. She has said that the United States should withdraw from the United Nations because it “continually threatens U.S. sovereignty.” The UN does, after all, have crazy ideas about the “fraudulent science” that is global warming. 
On the note of science and education, Angle stated in a radio interview that she wanted to shut down the U.S. Department of Education, asserting that it was unconstitutional. Furthermore, she has continued to be a champion of “Second Amendment remedies” — that is, the right to bear arms — as a response to losing at the ballot box. 
O’Donnell’s latest ad begins with the statement “I am not a witch.” We appreciate this clarification, as she makes clear she never joined a coven, just dabbled in witchcraft. But this perennial candidate has more strange statements in the closet than the media seems to be able to cover. She has stated that condoms spread AIDS, that masturbation is committing adultery, and that evolution is a myth. In 2006, she said she was privy to classified information about China’s strategic plans to take over America. 
For O’Donnell, there seem to be no limits: Possibly her craziest statement uncovered so far is, “American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans with animals and coming up ... with mice with fully functioning human brains.” 
While also following party lines being of being opposed to “Obama-care” and abortion in all instances, Paul holds the less-common view of not supporting the entire Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Had he been given the chance to vote for it, the Senate candidate confirmed he would have done so anyway, but he does believe that “a free society will abide unofficial, private discrimination, even when that means allowing hate-filled groups to exclude people based on the color of their skin.” 
Evidently discrimination is fine with Paul, provided the government looks the other way.

As I was watching the newest episode of The Big Bang Theory last Thursday night, I found myself both entertained and dismayed. This was not a result of that amusing show, but of a commercial — specifically, an attack ad vilifying Republican Senatorial candidate Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. The ad is unbelievable in the way that only political propaganda can be. Somehow, political strategists believe that appealing to the basest instincts of the American electorate will help candidates be elected. And though it pains me to say it, they are probably right. Yet, this anything-goes, ends-justify-the-means philosophy is embarrassing. It demeans politicians, and it demeans the electorate. We should demand a higher standard from those who want to lead us.
For any of you who have not yet seen the attack ad targeting Toomey, here are some highlights of that xenophobic diatribe. A Photoshop cutout of Pat Toomey is framed against a background of the Chinese flag. Soon, he’s joined by an equally incongruous-looking cutout of an unnamed “Hong Kong businessman” who has the unforgivable goal of “growing the Chinese economy.” The ad moves on to its logical conclusion, suggesting that “maybe [Toomey] oughta run for Senate... in China.”
I am not sure if that last one is even supposed to be funny. But then again, I also don’t understand why the entire ad is supposed to be persuasive. Go to YouTube, search for “moved pat toomey,” and see for yourself.
To give a brief background on the ad in question, it was sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which is the quasi-official organization that supports all such candidates. It is operated by the national Democratic Party but has no official ties to the government. In this capacity, the DSCC funds campaigns nationwide, including that of Joe Sestak, who is running against Toomey. This attack ad is called “Moved,” referencing the fact that, according to the Washington Post, Toomey lived and worked in Hong Kong for a year.
What puzzles me most about this ad is who its intended audience is and why they would be convinced by such a bizarre argument. Political campaigns have two goals: convincing the electorate to want to vote for their candidate, and then actually getting supporters to the polls. The electorate is often split into three groups: liberals, moderates, and conservatives. And while all of these definitions are simplifications, they still don’t explain this ad. Conservatives are not going to vote for Sestak over Toomey because of an over-the-top attack ad. Liberals are already voting for Sestak. And moderates, the swing voters, are as often repelled by an attack ad as attracted to it.
It seems as if the only reasonable purpose for the ad is to get liberal voters angry at Toomey and ready to go cast their votes for Sestak. Clearly, the Sestak campaign and the DSCC don’t think that Sestak can inspire voters on his own merits. I’m not expecting a Barack Obama-style “Change We Can Believe In” groundswell, but a candidate should be more than just the least bad alternative.
I wish that the “Moved” ad was an anomaly, that it was the last resort of a failing campaign or a fringe group. But it isn’t. Attack ads are a staple of election years, and hardly any candidates will run a campaign without them. Although the anti-Toomey ad was the most recent outrageous example that I saw, there is no shortage of anti-Sestak ads on the other side that are just as bad.
What is most absurd in this whole situation is that there are plenty of legitimate arguments against Pat Toomey. Despite defending him from misguided character assassination, I disagree with him on virtually every issue and fervently hope he does not win Arlen Specter’s current Senate seat. But I do not believe that appealing to xenophobia is the best way to defeat Toomey’s campaign. Instead of saying that he should run for Senate in China, explain how his voting record shows his radical conservative views — even more so than Rick Santorum. Explain how he has a 13 percent rating on civil rights issues from the ACLU. Explain how he has a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. Explain how he has voted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and how he has opposed measures to promote conservation and alternative energy. And explain how he supports an amendment to the United States Constitution banning same-sex marriage.
Given Toomey’s radically conservative views, the Sestak campaign should not have to resort to such laughable arguments. With politics in America as viciously partisan as they are, reasonable people should support those candidates who prize their achievements over their opponents’ faults. They should not be taken in by cheap attacks. They should examine the issues and vote for the candidate that will support their beliefs.
Michael Kahn (mkahn@) is Forum editor for The Tartan. He considers himself politically moderate, if such a thing still even exists.

No, really. I like it against stacks of past issues of The Tartan, next to an open window, where the occasional Pittsburgh sun illuminates it ever so clearly, wedged next to a slim copy of Andrew Carnegie’s Gospel of Wealth.
For starters, I don’t like it in one place consistently. One place gets boring. I like to switch it up a bit, too. Depending on my mood and specific function, I like it big at some times and smaller at others. The thing is, I need different sizes for my different needs. Sometimes, I have a lot to do in a day, so I’ll definitely need a big one. Other times, it’s just a quickie, so a small one will do. I also like to try out different textures. I value diversity and believe every woman should have a variety in her arsenal.
Sometimes, my friends and I will go looking for one and admire the range that some stores carry. I’ll always ask the saleswoman questions, because for me personally, how it functions matters to me a lot. I go for ones that work swiftly and aren’t a hassle to take with me everywhere. How it’s shaped matters a lot, too. A nicely shaped one can make or break the experience. I need one whose shape complements my body. And yes, when I come home, I like it on The Tartan. But sometimes I like it on the first flat surface I can find.
A lot of stuff that goes viral doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, and this one made the least sense. I mean, some women said they like it on the washing machine. Who puts their purse on the washing machine? Makes no sense. Not the most stellar example of getting things done efficiently. I like it fast and efficient.
So you’ve just read a bunch of useless double entendres. Are you more aware of breast cancer? How much more have you learned about breast cancer causes, prevention, research, and general awareness than you knew five minutes ago? My point exactly. You could use the aforementioned double entendres to spur you into action against breast cancer. 
More likely, though, the buck stops right there after you’ve figured it all out and had a cringe-worthy moment reading some people’s statuses, and then the fuss dies down as October — Breast Cancer Awareness Month, in case you weren’t aware — carries on, and general “awareness” dissipates. Yes, it stops there. But hey, at least a handful of men figured out some new settings on their washing machines. You know, just in case.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@) updates her statuses accordingly.

Pittsburgh, like many cities, is in the midst of a protracted budgetary crisis. A $700 million deficit in the city’s pension fund has led to proposals like last year’s tuition tax and this year’s parking lease, which would allow a private operator to control parking meters and garages. In short, the city is desperate to raise money wherever it can. 
It thus came as an unwelcome surprise to Pittsburgh residents when it was revealed that the Steelers and their corporate partners bought a prime piece of land on the North Side from the city’s Stadium Authority for about 8 percent of its market value. With the city’s current financial situation, such a deal was irresponsible both for Pittsburgh and for the Steelers.
The land in question, between Heinz Field and PNC Park, was purchased from the Stadium Authority in late 2008 for the purpose of building a new amphitheater. The 172,454-square-foot parcel sold for $1.38 million, according to research by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. That is about $8 per square foot, as opposed to the $75 to $119 per square foot that other North Shore properties sold for at that time. If the Steelers had bought the area at market rates, the city could have received an additional $19 million. While that would not have solved Pittsburgh’s financial woes, it would have been a step in the right direction.
Instead, the Steelers managed to buy this prime real estate for about 10 percent of what they pay Ben Roethlisberger in a season. All they had to do was promise the city that the new amphitheater wouldn’t be commercially sponsored. So when Stage AE — which does, in fact, stand for American Eagle — opens for its first show, we hope a $19 million check to Pittsburgh will be coming soon after.

As many of us have probably heard recently, there has been a disturbing rise in suicides among high school and college students this fall. These suicides have been largely attributed to bullying, mostly due to the perceived or actual homosexuality of the target. Though suicide is a prevalent problem, this recent surge has gotten significant news coverage and prompted a response on the national level.
In particular, the death of Tyler Clementi prompted a significant response from the media and supporters of LGBT students. The “It Gets Better” campaign, launched by famous — or perhaps infamous — blogger Dan Savage, implores people to post videos to YouTube explaining why life will get better and showing LGBT adults living happy, successful lives despite terrible experiences at school.
The campaign has been very successful in terms of responses. Hundreds of people from across the country have posted videos to YouTube supporting the project. This also includes many notable celebrities: Among others, Neil Patrick Harris, Ellen DeGeneres, Sarah Silverman, Lance Bass, and members of the cast of Wicked have contributed videos.
The project is certainly a step in the right direction, but it does not address the root problem, no matter how many celebrities post videos. Although it is impossible to completely eliminate bullying, students can easily be equipped with the tools necessary to deal with the resulting stress. However, this requires schools and even universities to admit that bullying is a problem, which some are unwilling to do. Rutgers University, which Clementi attended, rushed to absolve itself of any wrongdoing in Clementi’s death. The university president, Richard McCormick, claimed that “based on everything I know, I believe that we did all we could and we did the right thing.”
For those who do not know the details, Clementi’s roommate, Dharun Ravi, allegedly set up a webcam to record Clementi during an intimate encounter, and then broadcast this encounter over the Internet, which prompted Clementi’s suicide. Even though Clementi had filed a complaint with his resident assistant about a previous incident where Ravi used the same setup but failed to catch an intimate encounter, Rutgers failed to enact preventative measures sufficient to prevent the second incident.
It is important to note here that this voyeurism is illegal, and Ravi and an accomplice have had charges laid against them for the act. If Rutgers had been truly concerned with doing “the right thing,” it would have made appropriate arrangements after the first illegal act by the roommate, instead of allowing the county prosecutor to settle the matter after Clementi’s death.
The “It Gets Better” project is not the only outcome from the recent spate of student suicides. Support lines have cropped up all over the country for bullied youth, including the Trevor Project www.thetrevorproject.org which runs both a telephone hotline at (866) 488-7386 and a secure instant messaging service for teens to reach out to supportive individuals.

Once a year, as is my way, I use these pages to once again remind the Carnegie Mellon community that it should read. I time my monologue to immediately follow the release of the Nobel Prize in literature, largely because it falls somewhat early in the academic year and also allows me to obsess for a week over the lives, politics, and bets surrounding a number of authors whose names you have probably never heard.
This year was widely (if you are reading in the literary betting circles) heralded as the “year of the poet,” a trend picked up by The Guardian and NPR, and seemingly started by David Williams, who sets the Nobel odds at Ladbrokes — yes, you can bet on who you believe will win the Nobel Prize in literature. Poets dominated the list: Tranströmer, Adonis, Ko Un, Zagajewski. I would have been quite pleased with a poet winning, which would have been the first since the 1995–96 double-header of Seamus Heaney and Wislawa Szymborska. The 14 years in between have been too long without. However, the year of the poet was not to be.
The prize was also not to be for Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o. Born in Kenya, he began writing in English, but later abandoned English, changed his name (from James), and decided to write in Gikuyu so that his mother and his people could read his work. Yes, he really had everything going for him. As an African, the Swedish Academy could not (again) be lambasted for being too Euro-centric; as an activist writer he had been imprisoned and wrote his novel Devil on the Cross on sheets of toilet paper; he has leftist, Marxist leanings; he is highly regarded by critics; and he has been actively writing for over 40 years. He’s perfect. Had you asked me last Wednesday, I would have been confident that Ngũgĩ had it.
But the thing about the Swedish Academy is that its decision process is much less than transparent, and the writers who you might believe fit the perfect model of a laureate, let alone the best writers across generations, may not be awarded the prize. So while the academy did decide last Thursday to choose a candidate who would grant it a year’s reprieve from being decried as Euro-centric, it was not an African, but a South American.
Mario Vargas Llosa took the 2010 Nobel Prize in literature “for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual’s resistance, revolt, and defeat.” Big words from the Swedish Academy, as always. If you aren’t sure how to begin delving into Vargas Llosa’s cartographies of power structures, let me direct you to his 1977 novel Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, a novel about an aspiring writer named Mario who becomes smitten with his uncle’s sister-in-law, Julia. The novel is based on Vargas Llosa’s own life — he did actually marry his uncle’s sister-in-law Julia when he was 19 and she was 32. The novel itself is smart, poignant, and at times funny, capturing life in Peru through Mario’s own experiences and the serials that are being written and broadcast over the radio. (Think precursors to daytime soaps.) And the radio serials used throughout the book are useful not only as plot devices but as a reminder of a time when literature, through these radio plays, was admired both as creative art and as entertainment. And since I understand that books are difficult these days, you could watch the (what I have to imagine is terrible) 1990 Hollywood adaptation of Mario’s life, our aspiring future Nobel laureate played by a young Keanu Reeves.
But apart from his novels, Vargas Llosa has written a few plays and a number of non-fiction and critical works. The Perpetual Orgy is an in-depth and actually fascinating study on Madame Bovary. A Writer’s Reality is a series of critical essays on a number of his novels, providing us the details of his creative process for Aunt Julia... and showing us how much of that is based on his own life. In A Writer’s Reality, he also details his process: where he has difficulties, what takes more re-writes, and where he sees his greatest successes. It is a compelling book for aspiring writers.
Of course another way to understand his methods would be to attend Princeton, where Vargas Llosa is teaching as the 2010 Distinguished Visitor in the university’s Latin American Studies Program. (He is also teaching a course on Jorge Luis Borges, one of the Nobel-misses who very much deserved to win, but never did.) Princeton, of course, was quick to announce his prize and point out his long history with the university, as the new laureate visited in 1992 and has a series of his papers housed in one of its libraries.
But not just familiar to Princeton, Vargas Llosa is certainly a writer much more known to Americans, especially compared to recent winners Le Clezio and Müller — and while they may not have gotten fanfare and signage in bookstores in America, expect displays for Vargas Llosa. The author’s publisher has already announced, “We are so proud to publish Mario Vargas Llosa. As of this morning we are reprinting all 10 of our paperback titles and we already have in place major bookseller promotions, and no doubt we will be reprinting many more times in the months to come.”
Yet for all his work, Vargas Llosa is a relatively safe pick; he is a known quantity — a respected writer, but not revolutionary. As M.A. Orthofer, founder of The Complete Review and one of the most qualified and diverse Nobel critics, expressed it, “Too much of his work has been too workmanlike and conservative.” And maybe, for the academy and for Americans, this is for the best. He isn’t difficult to read; he isn’t abstract; he isn’t a poet. He is eminently approachable, evenly written, and will be broadly available. So in terms of my quest to remind us all to pick up literature to read for fun, to learn about the world, to take an imaginative vacation, Vargas Llosa is the ideal laureate.

Your previously good week comes to a crashing halt on Tuesday when a jet crashes into your apartment, destroying your Pokémon card collection.
Your life collapses when you abruptly dematerialize on Wednesday, rendering you incapable of interacting with physical objects on anything above the subatomic level.
Despite your ego’s assertions to the contrary, you have not evolved into a higher form of being than your peers; you have merely discovered the benefits of a hearty breakfast.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news — strike that, no I don’t. Your best friend will come down with smallpox. On the bright side, you get a killer book deal.
You are about to come into a very large sum of money. Don’t spend it on silly things like tuition and books; drop out of college and live on the interest for the rest of your life. Remember: Gym, tanning, then laundry.
Your last-minute sprint to finish your homework will be for nothing when the professor decides that he would rather surf in Maui and gives everyone As. Just kidding. You fail the class.
Allow your physical fitness to lapse to levels at which you can barely ascend one flight of steps without becoming winded. This will make you attractive to your favorite subset of the population.
Two words, kid: renegade paramecium.
The position of Venus in the ninth house and Mars in the 12th means absolutely nothing, but your Friday will be wonderful.
You will come down with a case of smallpox. However, your best friend will be there for you the entire time you slip slowly into oblivion, and will cash in big on your terminal illness.
Come up with a sarcastic response for everything anyone says, even compliments. This way, no one has to know that you are friendless and will die alone.
The mail carrier will bring you 150 pounds of mail over the course of the week. This is because you ordered paperweights in bulk online when you got drunk last weekend.
