This is an exciting year for Pittsburgh hockey. The Pittsburgh Penguins recently completed their preseason games, ending with a 4–0 record. But these were no ordinary games, especially on the night of Sept. 28, when the Pens faced the 2009-10 Stanley Cup Champions, the Chicago Blackhawks. The Hawks took to the ice in an arena filled with eager Pens fans thunderously cheering for their team — 18,087 fans, to be exact, though a couple of red jerseys speckled the crowd. The energy and passion emanating from these Pittsburghers (at a sold-out preseason game, no less) was infectious, and every time the Pens got one into the Hawks’ net, air horns, clapping, and cheering combined into a monstrous sound wave that was overwhelming even at the highest level of the arena. Both teams played their big guns alongside fresh talent: The Pens lined up veterans Evgeni Malkin, Maxime Talbot, and Craig Adams, while the Hawks brought out Patrick Kane and Brent Seabrook. Whether it was due to sharp playing or home-court advantage, the Pens completely dominated the Blackhawks with a 4–1 victory, including a scoreless second half on the Hawks’ part.
The Pens flew out of the gate when the puck dropped, going up 1–0 with 12:21 on the clock after a goal by center Malkin, assisted by left wing Eric Tangradi. In the second quarter, the Hawks’ Kyle Beach broke the Pens’ defenses and added a goal to tie the game, the evening’s quietest moment. Five minutes later, left wing Dustin Jeffery shot for goal while knocked down by a Hawk; he scored to put the Pens up 2–1. To add more drama to the game, the ice rink became a temporary boxing ring when Pens defenseman Deryk Engelland got into a fist fight with Hawks’ center Jake Dowell, resulting in penalties for both. After halftime, the Pens stepped up their game and scored two with assists by the Hawks. The first was with 8:25 in the third period, when right wing Nick Johnson aimed the puck at goal, and Hawks’ defenseman Brent Seabrook accidentally knocked the puck into his own net. The second also came in the third period, with 8:47 on the clock, when Pens’ center Mark Letestu went for the goal and shot the puck in off the Hawks’ goalie. The Pens kept a strong defense throughout the remainder of the period and fended off several goal attempts with deft saves by goalie Brent Johnson.
“I certainly like the fact that we’ve won the games in here, I like the fact that we went into the third period with a 2–1 lead and that they came out of there with one goal,” head coach Dan Bylsma stated during the press conference after the game. “We got three, four, and we kept it at one goal — that’s something we’ve talked about and something we’re trying to identify with their team. To win a one- goal game, and when we have a lead in the third, we know how we’re going to play it and how we are going to hold that lead to win games, and it is certainly something we’d like to build on.”
In addition to playing host to prestigious professional sporting events, the new Consol Energy Center arena is also a budding cultural center for Pittsburgh. Paul McCartney, a former Beatle and legendary musician, opened the Consol Center with a concert on Aug. 18, and Pittsburgh is set to host the 2013 NCAA Frozen Four, the semifinals and finals of the Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Championships. Just last month, pop icon Lady Gaga filled the stadium with her catchy songs and eccentric dance routines. The center will feature over 100 non-hockey events in the coming year.
For Tom McMillan, vice president of communications, the Consol Energy Center is more than just a new home for the Pens. “Every city needs an entertainment center, and this one is a 21st-century entertainment center; and God bless Mellon Arena, but it was designed in the late 1950s, so it was well past its prime. We were really starting to lose a lot of events, and that’s not good for the city.” He added, “Even before we opened the doors, the arena started to deliver on its promise about the types of events we were missing in Pittsburgh, events that we are going to get in addition to Penguins hockey. It’s really more of a community center than a football or basketball stadium. It’s going to become what an arena really should be and what we’ve been missing for a while.”
The Pens begin their regular season with a home game on Oct. 7 against the Philadelphia Flyers.

After going 8–0 in non-league play to start off the 2010 season, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team suffered an unexpected loss to University Athletic Association (UAA) conference rival the University of Chicago this past Saturday. The Tartans had just moved up to No. 2 in the NSCAA/HendrickCars.com Division III rankings last Tuesday, the highest ranking in the team's history. Unfortunately, mid-season knocks and a tough road schedule wore down the Tartans last weekend.
Carnegie Mellon was supposed to play earlier last week, but bad weather forced Bethany College (W.Va.) to postpone the mid-week game. The men instead directed their attention to beginning conference play. Circumstances kept sophomores Zach Staal and John Crawshaw, goalkeeper and midfielder respectively, from playing, resulting in a slightly different lineup against the University of Chicago Maroons. 
The first half saw little action, and neither team made the most of its opportunities, resulting in a scoreless game at the break. Ten minutes into the second half, the Tartans were able to pull ahead after the upperclassman duo of senior Max Betzig and junior Kyle Young connected and got Young his third goal this season. The notorious Chicago winds created sloppy playing conditions that inadvertently benefited the Maroons, as they were able to tie the game in the 75th minute off a 25-yard free kick. 
The scoreline remained level at the end of regular play, and the teams needed overtime to decide the contest. Having already gotten away with two overtime victories this season, the Tartans were not as fortunate the third time around. A costly error in the midfield forced a turnover and a breakaway goal to give Chicago the win against Carnegie Mellon.
“The playing conditions were pretty bad in Chicago, but at the end of the day we were overall just disappointed with our performance. Now we are looking forward to finally coming back and playing at home for the first time in about a month,” junior co-captain Ian Epperson said.
The Cardinal and Gray’s next game is against another tough opponent, as Carnegie Mellon faces Washington University (Mo.) at home this Sunday at 1:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon Tartan football team improved its record this weekend to 3–2 with a convincing 62–31 win over the Hiram College Terriers. The 26th battle between the two schools took place this past Saturday in Gesling Stadium.
The game began with a 62-yard kick by junior Tartan Patrick Garret, giving Hiram the first offensive drive; but the Terriers weren’t able to hang onto it for long. The Tartan defense shut Hiram down quickly, allowing Tartan offense to take an early lead. With four completed first downs in nine plays, the Cardinal and Gray’s senior Justin Pratt was able to finish the drive with a touchdown capped off by a completed extra kick by senior Elliot Carnevale to give Carnegie Mellon an early 7–0 advantage. The remaining drives of the first quarter proved successful for both teams, rallying back and forth to end the quarter with a 14–7 lead for Carnegie Mellon.
The second quarter was a battle characterized by Tartan touchdowns and Hiram responses, but the Tartans were able to sustain the lead. First, a Hiram field goal closed the gap to 14–10, then the determined Tartans’ sophomores Jake Nardone, Jared Delello, and Patrick Blanks responded with a touchdown to increase the Tartans’ lead to 21–10. Next came a Hiram touchdown and another Tartan response, upping the score to 28–17. With a Hiram fumble recovered by senior Tom Todd, the Cardinal and Gray regained the ball but were unable to capitalize by the end of the half.
After the half, Carnegie Mellon came out determined to score and found success as Justin Pratt rushed a total of 63 yards on the opening drive to give the Tartans a 35–17 lead. Just as the Tartans were getting comfortable, the Terriers recovered a fumble off of a punt return and turned it into a touchdown, closing the gap to 35–24. It took the Tartans just 1:16 to respond, though, as Delello scored another touchdown, making the score 41–24. Hiram suffered two penalties for a false start and a delay of game, but this wasn’t able to hold the Terriers back. Terrier quarterback Brendan Rehor led his team back within 10 points of the Tartans just before the Tartans scored again to end the quarter 48–31.
The fourth quarter was completely dominated by Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans capitalized on three interceptions caught by sophomore Nick Karabin, senior Brandon Van Tassel, and first-year Jack Butler. The offense successfully completed two touchdown runs, making the score 62–31. The Tartan defense had its best quarter of the game, allowing no points from the Hiram offense.
Although the Carnegie Mellon defense struggled to stop the Terriers throughout the first three quarters, Todd, first-year Charles Tanner, senior Jason Stearns, and senior Mike Shedlosky each had a successful sack during the game. Sophomore Owen Parker and Karbin led the team with 11 and 10 tackles, respectively. They were also able to force five turnovers, allowing the success of the offense. The game set a school record for rushing yards, at 585, combining the success of 11 Tartan players. Pratt, Nardone, and Delello all ended the game with over 100 yards rushing, and each with at least one touchdown.
The Tartans will travel to Delaware, Ohio, to face the Ohio Wesleyan University’s Battling Bishops next weekend.

Carnegie Mellon’s women’s tennis team traveled to Fredericksburg, Va., last weekend to compete at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Southeast Regional Tournament. The tournament, hosted by the University of Mary Washington, lasted Sept. 25–27 and featured competitors from 10 different schools, including Johns Hopkins University and Washington and Lee University. Tartans junior Laura Chen took the spotlight at the tournament, wearing down her competition en route to the singles title.
The doubles team of Chen and junior Courtney Chin quickly showed everybody why they went into the tournament seeded first. On the first day, the Tartan duo took their first match 8–1 over a team from Washington College before advancing to the quarterfinals with an 8–2 win over Salisbury University’s Victoria Handlin and Elaina Iosue. Another Tartan pair, comprising senior Danielle Rosenfeld and first–year Sonya Subramaniam, took their first match of the tourney with an easy 8–0 win over a team from Haverford College before falling, 8–4, in the next round against a team from Oberlin. 
The Tartans’ doubles team of senior Jennifer Chui and junior Cze–Ja Tam, as well as the team of senior Ashley Herrick and first–year Madison Rabson, both lost in their respective first round matches but won their ensuing consolation matches, with Herrick and Rabson taking an 8–0 match from an Albright duo.
Chen and Chin continued where they left off on the second day of doubles competition by winning their quarterfinal match, 8–4, over Johns Hopkins’ Courtney Boger and Nandita Krishnan. Unfortunately, however, they could not keep their success going in their semifinal match, dropping a tight 8–6 loss to a team from Washington and Lee.
Chen was not to be denied a championship in the singles competition. The junior from Port Washington, N.Y. came into the meet with a No. 1 ranking for the second year in a row, and after receiving a bye in the first round, defeated the host university’s Cassie Bowman in the second round, 6–1, 6–2. Chin and Chui kept pace with their teammate on the first day of singles competition, as Chin took both of her opening matches, 6–1, 6–2 and 6–0, 6–0, and Chui won a hard–fought opening match, 7–6 (1–0), 6–7, 6–1 before making quicker work of her second opponent, 6–2, 6–4. Although Chui could not move on to the quarterfinals on the second day after a 6–1, 6–3 defeat in her match, Chen and Chin both were victorious, 6–3, 6–4 and 6–1, 6–2, respectively.
Chen (5–7, 6–2, 6–2) and Chin (6–0, 6–1) then won their respective quarterfinal matches to advance to a semifinal bracket that was eerily similar to the previous year’s. Johns Hopkins junior Carolyn Warren joined Chen and Chin as returners to the four–person bracket, with Warren’s teammate Krishnan the only newcomer to the semifinal round. Chen defeated Krishnan 1–6, 6–2, 6–2 to advance the finals, but Chin fell to Warren, 6–1, 3–6, 6–1, preventing what would have been a rematch against her teammate from last year’s ITA Regionals final. Chen then wrapped up her second straight ITA Regional title with a dominant 6–2, 6–2 win over Warren.
“It feels great to be able to win the ITA regional again, especially when there were a lot of good players in the tournament, both old and new,” Chen commented. “I’m looking forward to going to Alabama [for the ITA National Championships Oct. 14–17] and playing against the tough competition in the tournament, so it’ll definitely be a good experience again. I think winning ITAs is a good sign for the season; it motivates me to keep working hard and I hope to continue playing well for the spring season.”
Chen and her teammates will play next on Saturday, at 9 a.m. as they host Oberlin in their last match before Chen travels to the ITA Nationals. This will be the final match of the fall season for the women’s tennis team before they resume playing in the spring.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team traveled to Chicago last week for its first conference game, after a 3–2 win against Grove City College. The Tartans opened their University Athletic Association conference play with a loss against the University of Chicago Maroons in a tight 2–1 decision.
The Tartans topped the Grove City Wolverines in a 3–2 double-overtime game. The Wolverines struck first off junior Emily Hurley’s goal three minutes into the second half. The Tartans struck back with junior Elsa Wu’s third goal of the season. Wu scored off first-year Alex Venegas’ corner kick in the 66th minute of play.
Sophomore Brianna Ma-gill assisted first-year Cecilia Zischkau's goal, which gave the Tartans a 2–1 lead within seven minutes of Wu’s goal. But the Wolverines retaliated with another Hurley goal to tie the game with 14 minutes of play left in the second half. In the first half of overtime, neither team was able to put it in the goal, but in the second, the Tartans scored to give them the win. The Tartans outshot the Wolverines 30–12 as senior goalkeeper Anya Rose made three saves, and Grove City’s keeper Tiffany Yost made 12.
In their first conference game, the Tartans’ expectations were high, coming off of their monumental overtime game. The Maroons bested the Tartans in a close 2–1 contest that was decided in the first half.
Within the first 17 minutes of play, the Maroons struck first with a goal by Emily Benoit. Benoit scored off a 12-yard pass from Sarah Loh. The Tartan’s Wu answered with her fourth goal of the season, three minutes later. Wu scored from 15 yards out.
The Maroons’ Loh scored in the 32nd minute of play to put Chicago up 2–1. Loh tapped the shot past Rosen after the shot hit the crossbar. Loh’s goal was the game winner, though there was still a half to play. In the second half, the Tartans were unable to counter the Maroons to tie the game.
The Tartans shot nine more times and almost found net for five of them, but were unable to put it in the goal. The Tartans were also outshot 12–9, 8–4 in the first half. Rosen finished the game with two saves, while the Maroons’ goalkeeper Emma Gormley finished the game with four saves.
With their loss, the Tartans fell to 6–4, and 0–1 in conference, while the Maroons improved to 6–3–1.
The Tartans host Washington University for their next game on Sunday, at 11 a.m.

The Tartans’ volleyball team opened up University Athletic Association (UAA) round-robin play in Atlanta this weekend with a nail-biting loss to Case Western Reserve University on Saturday. The team began the match by crushing Case Western Reserve 25–14 in the first game, but dropped two games before recovering to send the match to a deciding fifth game. Carnegie Mellon went down after fighting hard in the fifth. 
The women’s team had to turn right back around and play UAA competitor Emory University early Sunday morning, so it was important for the Tartans to stay positive. Junior Kristin Castellano was able to see past this one loss. “Even though we didn’t win today, we saw our true potential. Sunday is a new day and we are ready to take on some of the best volleyball teams,” she said.
In the disappointing loss to Case Western Reserve, senior Aislinn McCloskey and first-year Senna Parsa led the charge offensively with 16 kills each. Rosnick continued her consistent play with 13 kills, while first-year Emily Wright recorded a stellar 44 assists. The women’s team was also strong defensively, as senior Cameron Griffin led the team with 27 digs. First-year Ali Nichols contributed a career high 18 digs, and Castellano followed with 10. Unfortunately, the Tartans could not defeat the third-ranked Emory Eagles. The women played hard but fell in straight sets, 3–0, to Emory. This brings their record for the season to 9–10 overall and 0–2 in the UAA. The volleyball team had to recover again to play later in the afternoon on Sunday against New York University, results available on the Carnegie Mellon athletics website (www.cmu.edu/athletics).
In the match against Emory, the Tartans kept each game close, but dropped the first three to lose the match. The top performers of the day were once again Parsa and Rosnick, who recorded an impressive 10 and six kills, respectively. Griffin was solid again on defense, recording 11 digs, but the Tartans struggled to counter Emory’s attacks. 
With one more game to play in Atlanta, the women once again had to keep their spirits up and focus on the next opponent. Rosnick held high hopes for the rest of the season as she commented, “Looking ahead, I’m really excited because we are finally playing up to our potential.”
The Carnegie Mellon volleyball team plays again Oct. 16–17 in another UAA round-robin hosted by Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. The Tartans will take on Rochester University, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Chicago, and Brandeis University that weekend. The team’s next home match is on Oct. 26 against Point Park University.

In the first installment of this column on April 5, “Hail Mary, full of grace; four balls, take your base,” I made the following predictions on who would finish first and last in each division come the end of the season:
“Here are my predictions for this year’s division champs and chumps:
AL East: Champs — Yankees, Chumps — Blue Jays; AL Central: Champs — Twins, Chumps — Indians; AL West: Champs — Mariners, Chumps — A’s; NL East: Champs — Phillies, Chumps — Marlins; NL Central: Champs — Cubs, Chumps — Pirates; NL West: Champs — Giants, Chumps — Padres.”
Well, when a batter is having a 5-for-12 stretch, it’s considered pretty fantastic. When a team only wins five of 12, it is not quite as great. This was more like a team’s performance.
Entering Sunday, possibly the last day of the season, I was at least right about the Twins, Phillies, and Pirates. On Sept. 21, the Twins did indeed clinch first place in the American League (AL) Central, and the Phillies followed suit shortly thereafter in the National League East. The Pirates truly outdid themselves this season, coming all the way back to overtake a rejuvenated Orioles team for the worst record in baseball, easily clinching at least one prediction for me, finishing 18 games back into sixth place and entering Sunday with a chance to tie for the worst road record in baseball history.
The Giants and Yankees entered Sunday on the brink of clinching their respective divisions, which would confirm two more of my predictions. The Yankees were tied with Tampa Bay for the division lead after Saturday’s action; a Yankees win and a Rays loss would clinch the AL East for New York, but if both teams win or both teams lose to finish in a tie, the division would technically go to the Rays, as they won the season series with the Yankees. Meanwhile, San Francisco entered Sunday one game up on the Padres, but the Padres took two from them last week, and a sweep of the Giants would put them in a tie for the division—and possibly for the wild card as well if the Braves won Sunday.
Speaking of the Padres, they combined with the Mariners to cement that I am horrendous at predicting the outcomes of the Western divisions. I picked Seattle to easily win the AL West after their acquisitions of Chone Figgins and Milton Bradley; they entered Sunday’s action 18 games behind third-place Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim with a very disappointing 61–100 record.
I wrote in my preseason article that “the only bets people are placing on the Padres involve if and when they trade star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to the Red Sox.” On the contrary, the Padres started off the season surprisingly strong and didn’t fade until the last three weeks of the season, when their once-insurmountable division lead dropped significantly with a 10-game losing streak.
Honorable mention has to go to the Cubs and Blue Jays. The Cubs are finishing strong after what has been a very disappointing and sometimes controversial 2010 campaign, and are poised to finish nowhere near the first place that I’d foreseen. Toronto, on the other hand, traded Roy Halladay in the off-season and looked to be entering a long-term rebuilding mode. Picked by many to be the laughingstock of the AL in 2010, they instead had a record season in home runs, including Jose Bautista’s unpredictable 54 home runs entering Sunday. I guarantee you: Anybody who says they are not surprised by Bautista’s mammoth season is being just as truthful as Rafael Palmeiro was when he told a grand jury in 2007 that he did not use steroids. Way to fail a drug test a few weeks later, big guy.
Check back online on Tuesday at www.thetartan.org/sports for a bonus follow-up column, in which I will sum up the official end of baseball’s regular season. Buckle up, folks; playoff time is just around the bend and with the way this season is wrapping up, you know it’ll be a good one.

One Tartan paving the way for a strong cross country season is fourth-year architecture major Dan Addis. Addis, a native of Malvern, Pa., was recently named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Cross Country Athlete of the Week after he helped lead the Tartans to a first-place finish at the Mideast Pre-Regional. There, Addis was the fastest runner two days in a row and recorded an 8k time of 25:41. Addis also had a stellar season last year, finishing All-Region, 15th at the UAA Championships, 14th at the Mideast Regional Championships, and 67th at the NCAA Championships.
Addis chose to attend Carnegie Mellon because it offered both top-tier academics and a competitive athletics program. Before college, Addis ran cross country for four years, and he chose to continue because he felt like he belonged with the team and loved the overall atmosphere. One thing Addis didn’t expect was how to manage sleep deprivation — during his first year here, he overslept and missed the bus for a meet and had to fly out instead. But when not working or running, Addis spends his time playing music or creating songs with members of his band.
With this season as his last year of eligibility, Addis is determined to do well. “As far as the team’s goals are concerned, I love being the underdog,” Addis stated. “We have the potential to be one of the best teams this school has ever seen. The next few weeks are going to be crucial in establishing our team as a competitor at the national level. I’m a fourth-year and this is my last year. [It’s either] now or never and we have the strongest team I’ve ever been a part of.”
Addis has a week-long break before he competes in the Carnegie Mellon Invitational this Saturday at Schenley Park.

Many people spend countless hours and large amounts of energy playing video games. To most, video games are fun and relaxing, although many others see them as unproductive. But what if there were a video game that was not only fun and competitive, but helped in solving complex and important problems to benefit health and science? Two Carnegie Mellon researchers have designed a video game to do just that.
Adrien Treiulle, a faculty member in Carnegie Mellon’s department of computer science, and one of his Ph.D. students, Jeehyung Lee, have developed a video game to help solve one of the most complicated problems in biochemistry: Protein structure.
“A protein is one of the most fundamental molecules in our body. In order to figure out how the protein interacts and how it works in our bodies with other molecules, it’s important to know what it actually looks like,” Lee said. By nature, he explained, a protein always folds into a shape that minimizes its free energy. This is its most stable conformation.
The game, conveniently named “Foldit,” has players manipulate protein structures to reach these optimal, lowest-energy structures. The better the structure they produce, the better their score, which is always displayed on the screen. The player’s score is compared against other players’ scores in real time, instilling a sense of competition among all of the gamers.
The benefits of understanding the structure of proteins are numerous and extremely important. “There’s both the scientific goal of understanding how these proteins fold, and also the engineering goal,” Treiulle explained. “If we can reverse-engineer these principles, then we can modify proteins and create new ones…. We can really engineer cellular mechanics.” By understanding the structure of proteins, new proteins could be created or modified to help the sick or even cure certain diseases.
But why are humans so important in this process? Computers are robust, consistent, and persistent; it would seem as though they possess every skill needed to solve complex problems like protein structures. However, computers lack one important quality: intuition.
When solving for good protein structures, computers essentially scan over every part of the protein and give each part of it equal attention, trying to find the best solution to the problem at that specific location. Humans, however, can focus on “problem spots,” ignoring the parts that don’t need as much attention.
“To a human, pulling that one [problem spot] out is one intuitive step. But to computers, that step is really far away. Humans can make more intuitive, creative decisions on the global level, not just the local level. This makes a huge difference for computers. The problem is computers always try to find the locally optimum solution,” Lee said. “Sometimes computers can never find the [correct structure]. It just gets stuck on some local optimal solution.”
Treiulle and Lee recently co-authored a paper that was published in Nature that discussed the results of Foldit. It was found that the players used a wide range of methods to perfect their protein structures, which varied within individual proteins as well as across different protein puzzles. This differed from the way the computer searched for an optimal structure, and as a result, players were generally able to find better protein structures than the computer could alone.
Interestingly, Treiulle and Lee both admitted that the vast majority of Foldit players have no educational background in biochemistry at all. In addition, in a post-study survey, some players stated that their contribution to science was a motivating factor to play the game, but many other players took notice mainly for the competition.
Although there are some improvements to be made to this human-computer interactive technique, such as instilling more collaboration among the players, it is the first of its kind and shows quite a bit of potential for the future of computing. “We have this three-way meld of human creativity, computer science, and machine learning — all braided together and forming this new way of solving this problem, which has never been done before,” Treuille said.

“Dress warmly or you’ll catch a cold! Stop cracking your knuckles or you’ll get arthritis when you’re older!”
Since we were young, we have been subjected to a multitude of medical myths that many of us take as truth. After all, they sounded fairly reasonable. It seemed like winter always was the most common time for people to catch a cold. Cracking knuckles is accompanied by a loud popping sound that sounds like something breaking. While these warnings are merely myths, the truth behind the fallacies may be important to learn.
Catching a cold
The common cold, according to www.bbc.co.uk, is the most common infectious disease in humans. Over 200 different viruses can cause a person to show symptoms of the common cold. The most effective route of infection is through direct contact with an infected individual. This may happen by shaking hands, touching a doorknob, or using a phone that was touched previously by someone with the cold virus.
The cold virus is commonly caused by a rhinovirus, which enters a human through the respiratory system, where it can infect the body. Our respiratory system is lined with special cells called respiratory epithelial cells. Using cellular receptors, the virus detects and binds to these cells just 15 minutes after entering the respiratory tract. When the body reacts to the infection, it releases inflammatory molecules to the affected site. In addition, it produces extra mucus to remove foreign particles from the body, resulting in sneezing and coughing.
Colds may be more common during the winter not because of the temperature, but rather because people spend more time indoors. This makes it easier for the cold virus to spread, since people are in closer proximity for much of the time.
Because there are so many types of viruses that cause colds, there has been no vaccine developed. Luckily, symptoms do not usually persist for longer than 10 days.
Cracking knuckles
Many movable joints of our body are lubricated with synovial fluid, which is surrounded by a capsule between the bones of the joint, according to www.howstuffworks.com. Popping a knuckle in the finger is caused by pulling the bones in the joint apart. This, in turn, increases the volume of the capsule in which the synovial fluid is held. Chemistry dictates that an increase in volume causes a decrease in pressure of the synovial fluid; this causes gases that are dissolved in the fluid to form a bubble.
When the joint is pulled significantly far apart, the pressure decreases enough for the bubble to pop. This produces the characteristic noise heard when we crack our knuckles.
In contrast, arthritis is an inflammation and stiffness of the joints. It can be caused by the gradual wear and tear of joints, which reduces the amount of cartilage between joints. Decreasing cartilage causes joint bones to rub against each other. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, which means the body will mistakenly attack its own cells, specifically the cells that line the joints, according to www.mayoclinic.com.
While cracking knuckles may not directly cause arthritis, its effects on the body can be detrimental and exacerbate the damaging and weakening of joints over time.
However ridiculous some medical myths may be — “Don’t swallow gum; it will get stuck in your body forever!” — many are created to prevent us from doing something unreasonable, while providing a plausible rationale. It is a good idea to follow medical advice, but it is also wise to use good judgment.

A ubiquitous and essential appliance in the lives of college students, the laptop has become a modern, mobile workstation and also a source of endless diversions. But what if it did not exist? If something unfortunate were to happen to the precious battery that keeps a laptop alive, it would become but an inert hunk of unresponsive metal. Thus, it is important to know how the lithium-ion battery that powers a laptop works and become knowledgeable about how to prolong its life.
The battery inside a laptop is lithium-ion, which means that its electrodes (the conductors in a circuit that connect non-metal parts) are made of lithium and carbon. The positive cathode is made of lithium cobalt oxide, which emits positive lithium ions; the negative anode is made of carbon. The electrodes are placed in a gel electrolyte, a material that conducts electricity, and separated by a sheet of perforated plastic. Ions are free to move throughout the gel, but there is an initial charge difference between the electrodes, with the positive ions concentrated on the cathode.
When recharging a laptop battery, the lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode and create an electric potential difference (a voltage of about 3.7 volts), according to www.HowStuffWorks.com. When the battery is discharging, the lithium ions move back from the anode to the cathode. Total discharge occurs when the return of ions to the cathode decreases the voltage to zero. A lithium-ion battery that is completely discharged will be unusable, though, so these batteries have a failsafe mechanism that shuts them down before they discharge too much. This system, which itself is a small computer attached to the battery pack, monitors the charging levels and temperature of the battery to prevent dangerous usage. This monitor uses power, which is one of the reasons that a battery not in use will still lose charge and experience a decrease in voltage over time. This is how batteries can become ruined even without use.
To prolong battery life, do not allow your laptop battery to drain all the way to 10 percent or lower without subsequently charging it. Contrary to popular belief, there is no need to completely discharge, or “deep discharge,” a laptop battery or any other kind of battery, including those in cell phones and iPods, each time it is used. In addition, lithium-ion batteries can handle hundreds of repeated cycles of charging and discharging. The only possible issue, therefore, is not the process of charging, but the maintenance of a minimum voltage. When a battery goes to zero voltage, it will no longer be able to recharge, and the only solution is to buy a new one.
From the moment lithium-ion batteries are manufactured, they constantly degrade and lose charge, so a laptop battery will only last two to three years, regardless of usage. Make sure to check the manufacturing date when you buy a new battery. An unused battery that has been sitting around is just as degraded as one that has been in use for the same amount of time. Heat will also degrade lithium-ion batteries faster than normal. According to Popular Science magazine, critical temperatures for a laptop battery occur around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Storing a lithium-ion battery at temperatures at or above this level will degrade it more quickly.
Lithium is a very reactive element, especially compared to lead and nickel, which are what car batteries (lead-acid batteries) and electronic toy batteries (nickel-cadmium) typically contain. Hence, lithium-ion batteries can store a lot more energy than typical batteries — about 150 watt-hours per kilogram of battery, according to HowStuffWorks.com. However, since lithium-ion batteries have so much energy, they also warm up quickly from the heat radiated during discharge. When the battery becomes too hot, it releases the polymer gel, which can be ignited by heat or a spark. This ignition is what causes some laptop batteries to catch fire.
Besides laptops, lithium-ion batteries power many modern handheld electronics, including digital cameras and cell phones.

Researchers test swarm of aerial robots
Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology are working on a project called SMAVNET, which stands for Swarming Micro Air Vehicle Network. They are in the process of developing small flying robots that can be sent to a disaster-stricken area to create a communication network. The flying robots are built using one pound of plastic foam with a 31-inch wingspan, outfitted with an electric motor, a Linux-based processor, GPS, and Wi-Fi capability. To design a swarm algorithm, the researchers studied ants. Ants maintain multiple pheromone paths that lead them to food, and this served as an analogue for the robots, which were designed to deploy a communication network that would help rescuers.
The robots are launched in the air just like a Frisbee is, but not before they perform a self-check on themselves. They can be monitored using an interface which runs on any computer. The hope is that the robots reach the disaster site and relay information about the injured and the environmental conditions so that rescuers are more prepared when they arrive on the scene.

Alien planet looks ‘just right’ for life
Astronomers claim to have found a planet beyond the Milky Way which may have the perfect environmental conditions for humans to live on. This discovery was recently published after 11 years of research at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The new planet is called Gliese 581g and measures around 3.5 times the mass of Earth. This planet is tidally locked to its star, which means that half of the planet always faces the sun and the other half is in complete darkness. This causes temperatures to plunge to below –30 degrees Celsius. However, astronomers say that the planet does have a “livable zone” between the shadow and the light.
If we want to travel to the planet, however, it would take tens of thousands of years to get there via conventional rocket technologies. Steven Vogt, an astrophysicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz, said, “If you’re traveling at a tenth of the speed of light, you could reach this [planet] in 200 years.”

Accept credit cards with the iPhone
Why do only “actual companies” accept credit cards? Why can’t we pay with credit cards at a farmer’s market or at a garage sale? Unfortunately, there are a few obstacles to overcome before cards can be accepted. To become a legal credit card merchant, one needs to buy the card-reading equipment. Then one has to register for a one- or two-year contract with the processing company. However, a company called Square has recently developed a system to get rid of all these costs. All that is required is an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or an Android phone.
Square provides a free tiny half-inch reader attachment that snaps into the phone’s headphone jack. This reader has a credit card slot through which a credit card can be swiped. A receipt is sent to the customer’s e-mail address, and the transaction is completed. For each transaction, Square charges 2.75 percent of the total, plus 15 cents. Most other dealers charge around 3 or 4 percent of the total plus 30 cents. The Square system is simple, unique, and has the potential to be a technology that could put many credit card vendors out of business as it saves money, red tape, and time.

Breakfast has always been the most important meal of the day. After all, depending on what you eat, breakfast often tends to thin the line between a dessert and a nutritious morning start. While oatmeal, cold cereal, and breakfast bars are convenient options for busy weekday mornings when you have less than 10 minutes to make it to your class on time, a delicious and well-priced breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning can be a glorious treat. Luckily, by living in a culturally rich urban area like Pittsburgh, there are plenty of restaurants and cafés all over the city to experiment with. 
Pamela’s Diner is a popular choice for a morning meal out in Pittsburgh, but there are many lesser-known breakfast spots in the city that are worth a try. Pittsburgh has so much to offer in terms of food that it would be a pity to just find one place and stick with it. Here are a couple of equally delicious breakfast places that are kind to both your stomach and your wallet:
Cappy’s Café
Conveniently located at 5431 Walnut St. in Shadyside just a short walk away from campus, Cappy’s Café offers several delicious and extremely well-priced breakfast options. Cappy’s is an extremely popular drinking place in the evening, with an active bar and a big-screen television. On Saturday and Sunday, the restaurant also opens at 10 a.m. to serve breakfast. 
Having opened in 1981, Cappy’s has developed into the typical neighborhood bar and a popular place for local residents to grab a beer and watch the Steelers game. When you eat at Cappy’s, you really feel like a member of the family. With an attentive and friendly waitstaff and breezy outdoor seating right on Walnut Street, Cappy’s is the perfect place to relax on the weekend. 
That being said, Cappy’s is also extremely affordable. For a mere $6, you can get “The Viking,” a humongous combination plate of French toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, and home fries. Pancakes at Cappy’s are just $3.25, French toast is only $3.50, and you can get an omelet any way you want it for around $5. Cappy’s prices are a refreshing change from the usual Shadyside restaurants. As one of the most affordable and friendly restaurants in Pittsburgh, it’s certainly worth a visit. 
Tom’s Diner
Breakfast can be the most delicious meal of the day, so why not eat it for lunch and dinner, too? Tom’s Diner, at 1719 E. Carson St. in the South Side, serves breakfast 24/7, so you can eat breakfast whenever your heart desires. The restaurant is designed to look like a ’50s diner, complete with red vinyl booths and a front counter with stools. The cheesy jukebox music playing in the background competes for attention with the TV hanging above the front counter.
The breakfast menu at Tom’s is extensive and has reasonable prices: Almost every item is under $10. It has everything from plates of toast, eggs, and bacon, to made-to-order frittatas, as well as omelets (which can be made by request with an egg substitute), pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, and French toast. One of the most popular options is the Farmer’s Special, which includes three eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, fresh home fries or hash browns, two buttermilk pancakes, and toast. Two of the other popular options are pretty unique to Tom’s Diner: Tom’s Breakfast Special consists of three eggs, gyro meat, home fries or hash browns, and toast, while Penny’s Famous Stuffed Croissant French Toast is a croissant prepared like French toast and stuffed with cream cheese and strawberry or apple filling. So whether you’re in the mood for a breakfast classic or for something brand new, Tom’s Diner has a meal for you.
Stop in early in the morning for the early-bird special, or late at night when nothing else is open and you’re really craving some great breakfast food. The restaurant is rarely over-crowded, so you know you can get in, get fed, and get out. The service is great, too; the servers are friendly and attentive and the food comes promptly. All in all, it’s a great alternative to more popular breakfast places when you don’t feel like dealing with crowds and lines but still don’t wish to sacrifice quality and taste.
Big Dog Coffee
If you are looking for a more relaxed atmosphere, give Big Dog Coffee a try. Big Dog Coffee is also in the South Side, at 2717 Sarah St. It is a coffeehouse in a former bakery with a really homey feel — it has little nooks, comfy armchairs, cute decorations, bright walls, and an actual wood-burning fireplace.
Big Dog is known for its delicious coffee that is bought at direct trade prices, its organic oatmeal with fresh fruit that you can get between 6 and 11 a.m., and its mouth-watering pastries. 
Oh Yeah!
Looking for something fun? Are you a breakfast rebel? Do you believe that ice cream belongs on waffles? Then Oh Yeah! is the place for you.
Oh Yeah!, located in Shadyside at 232 S. Highland Ave., is vegan-friendly and is known for its coffee, ice cream, and waffles — the latter two coming in an overwhelming number of combinations. Ambivalent customers will just have to take a deep breath and make a choice.
Oh Yeah!’s coffee is fair trade, and the entrees are all about $10 or less. The ambiance is great, and the restaurant offers free Wi-Fi for customers. 
DeLuca’s Restaurant
Nearly always recognized as the “Best Breakfast in the ’Burgh” by the Pittsburgh Dining Poll, it’s surprising that more students don’t know about this tasty place. Located at 2015 Penn Ave. in the Strip District, DeLuca’s is a bit more of a trip away than Pamela’s, but the two restaurants have often been compared for quality. As Peggy Lees, a sophomore chemical engineering major and breakfast enthusiast, put it, “You’re either a Pamela’s person or a DeLuca’s person. I personally like DeLuca’s because the Bionic Omelette is simply the largest and most delicious omelet I have ever had.”
DeLuca’s offers a plethora of traditional breakfast items, as well as a selection of more exotic options like breakfast cheesesteaks and several interesting plays on the traditional eggs Benedict. DeLuca’s also offers a menu of fancy toppings that one can add to pancakes and French toast, as well as several crêpes, hotcake dishes, and waffle sundaes. DeLuca’s is also renowned for its incredible portions. If you’re looking for a hearty breakfast, try the Steel City Breakfast of Champions — a short stack of pancakes served with two of the following sides: eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries, or toast.    
If you’re planning on giving DeLuca’s a try, keep in mind that it is cash only. Similarly, you are almost always guaranteed a wait time for a table, so leave yourself an appropriate amount of time. 
Crêpes Parisiennes
If you’re looking to try something different for breakfast, why not do as the Parisians do? With two convenient locations, one at 207 S. Craig St. and the other at 732 Filbert St. in Shadyside, there is no reason not to try breakfast at Crêpes Parisiennes. Chances are that when walking down Craig Street, you’ve spotted this restaurant with its large green windows and brick detailing. If you haven’t gotten the chance to go inside, now is a great chance. Whether you’re looking for a simple, non-corporate alternative to Starbucks or a delicious panini or crepe, Crêpes Parisiennes is a tasty alternative to the usual bowl of cereal. 
Walnut Grill
Regain your energy after a walk to Shadyside with the tasty brunch menu at the Walnut Grill (5550 Walnut St.).
The Walnut Grill opens at 11 a.m. Tuesdays through Sundays for brunch, and the restaurant offers a sophisticated menu of many tasty entrées that are all under $10. The brunch menu includes Belgian waffles, gourmet French toast, eggs Benedict made with Canadian bacon or crab meat, omelets, frittatas, and cheese-stuffed crepes. It even has a sandwich called the Monte Cristo that is made on French toast and contains turkey, ham, Swiss cheese, and American cheese.  
The Walnut Grill offers great food made with great ingredients and served in a lovely atmosphere, making a meal there worth the trip.

The creative writing department offered its first speaker of the year this past Thursday when Susan Henderson, a creative writing alumna from the Class of ’89, came to Giant Eagle Auditorium to give a reading of the first chapter of her debut novel. Henderson’s reading was part of the Adamson Visiting Writer series, a year-long series held to showcase writers from all genres of work.
Jim Daniels, an published poet and faculty member in the English department, described Henderson as a “powerful writer” in his introduction to the reading. While a student at Carnegie Mellon, Henderson’s study focus was in poetry. After receiving her master’s degree from Vanderbilt University, Henderson moved into the world of professional writing, where she has remained since. She has received the Academy of American Poets award for her work; however, in recent years she has changed her focus from poetry to fiction. She has since been nominated twice for the Pushcart Prize, one of the most honored awards in the literary field.
While introducing Henderson, Daniels recalled an anecdote from his workshop class in days past when Henderson was still a student: “There were four couples in that class — and Susan. They all broke up,” he said with a laugh. “Only Susan remained.”
Henderson’s novel, Up From the Blue, is set in 1975 on an Air Force base and centers around a young girl named Tillie Harris. In the novel’s central struggle, Tillie is cast against the backdrop of a rapidly deteriorating home life alongside the issue of her mother’s sudden disappearance — an event that will impact her for years to come.
Up From the Blue makes a powerful statement about the nature of family crisis and conflict — and the difficulty of looking back at hard times in one’s life. “It was about writing from a broader viewpoint — a different angle,” Henderson said. The novel was recently chosen as a 2010 Great Group Reads selection and has since received critical acclaim, a monumental achievement for a debut work.
At the reading’s start, Henderson explained up front that she was naturally shy in front of audiences; adding to this, she apologized in advance for “shaking hands.” Writing, she explained, has always given her the courage to “[stay] in the room when I had the urge to flee.” The reading was followed by a small reception in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center in Baker Hall accompanied by a book signing. Attendants were invited to meet with the author and ask questions over pizza and drinks.
Henderson also writes for LitPark, an online literary blog, and is the curator of NPR’s “DimeStories.” She occasionally blogs for The Huffington Post and has been featured in literary journals such as Zoetrope, A Journal of Delta Studies, and Amazon Shorts. She currently lives in New York with her husband, a drama professor, and their two sons.
The Adamson series will continue with Phillip Lopate on Wednesday, Oct. 27. To follow up on the rest of the Adamson Writers series, check out the English department website calendar at www.cmu.edu/hss/english/events.

Bradford Cox has been a very busy man, releasing six LPs worth of material in around four years. His latest creation sees his return to the band Deerhunter for the group’s fourth LP. Halcyon Digest seems to compete with their previous best, Microcastle, in more ways than one, as the album marks a transition in Deerhunter’s sound away from the talented Cox’s control. Sure, Cox’s presence is nearly everywhere on the album, but Deerhunter should no longer be considered a solo effort. Guitarist Lockett Pundt, bassist Josh Fauver, and drummer Moses Archuleta have subdued the signature Cox sound, making this album mostly pop. Deerhunter has grown from a group under Cox’s control into a band that can utilize his reverb and atmospheric ambience in an album that is both easy on the ears and complex after multiple listens.
This isn’t your older brother’s Deerhunter — this is a band that could be played on the radio, and right away. While the band has often hinted at these pop sensibilities — the song “Agrophobia” in particular — the musicians have never expanded from this line into a full-blown pop track. Interestingly enough, the band recently toured with Spoon, a band that also transformed into a more mainstream sound after a few releases, perhaps indicating that Halcyon Digest might be the album that earns Deerhunter extensive radio time. “Coronado” seems like the perfect transitional single, as it is a track that could easily be played on any radio broadcast. It has a stomping beat, a roaring saxophone, driving guitar rhythms, and vocals that sound more like Julian Casablanca’s from The Strokes.
While the album is more straightforward than previous releases, Halcyon Digest doesn’t desert previous Deerhunter loyalists. The lonesome “Sailing” is the most notably atmospheric track. Drummer Archuleta is absent, leaving the raw, atmospheric sound of previous albums to shine. On the track, synths swoosh and guitars noodle while Cox’s raw voice evokes a sense of pure loneliness. Cox tells us: “Only fear can make you feel lonely out here / You learn to accept / Whatever you can get.”
“Sailing” would probably be the crown jewel of previous Deerhunter albums with its lovely, sparse, and pure emotion. It intentionally languishes and sprawls for five minutes. The track hangs listeners on an emotional peak, giving them an insight into the mire of loneliness contained in sailing by oneself. Close your eyes while listening and you could be there. Near its end, Cox croons away his loneliness as synths slowly overtake his beautiful voice. You are that sailor sitting in a boat on a trip towards nowhere in particular. During the closing seconds of “Sailing,” you think you’ve hit the peak of the album — but, surprisingly enough, you haven’t.
Halcyon Digest reaches its peak during “Desire Lines,” one of the two songs written by Pundt. Most of the previous atmospheric performance is thrown aside for a song that features a new direction. Archuleta lays down a consistent stomp, and bassist Fauver mixes in a very high, smooth bass line. The track is most notable for its placement and length: Smack-dab in the middle of the track list and the second-longest song on the album, this song stands out. Written by Pundt, “Desire Lines” does not have Cox’s influence completely altering and shaping the song into his typical glossy, poppy sound. Listeners are able to focus completely on the beating drums, thumping bass, jamming guitar, and soothing vocals.
“Desire Lines” is the future of Deerhunter. It evolves the band from a Cox-centric universe into something that features the best elements of each of its members. His electronic tinkering combines with Pundt’s textured strumming to form a more cohesive Deerhunter, capable of altering the groups sound and evolving past their signature resonance.
While “Desire Lines” might indicate the future direction of Deerhunter, Halcyon Digest still has Cox’s fingerprints all over it. The lead single, “Helicopter,” is one of Cox’s best. It features a beautiful electronic chopping sample, as layers upon layers of guitar strums coat over the song and blend in with Cox’s croon. In “Helicopter,” Cox has mastered disguising his voice within the background texture of the song. It’s striking just how beautifully his voice floats in and out of the track — both begging for attention and attempting to hide itself in a complex wall of sound.
Last comes the epic “He Would Have Laughed,” a tribute to the recently deceased American garage-rock musician Jay Reatard. Much like “Desire Lines,” the track features the input of the entire band. Archuleta’s piercing drumming is the highlight of the first half of the track, and Pundt plucks gorgeous staccatos during Cox’s verses. The track breaks down between choruses, perhaps as a metaphor for Reatard’s troubled life. The latter half of the song sees Cox asking, “Where did my friends go? Where did my friends go?” While he doesn’t get an answer, the tribute remains a touching monument to Reatard and a memorable end to an incredible album.
Halcyon Digest is one of the best albums of 2010. It contains fewer awkward moments and more polish than all of Deerhunter’s previous albums. It also signifies a dynamic shift away from Cox’s obsessive touch and towards a more cohesive group-based sound. Although it was not the worst thing that could happen to the band, Deerhunter was resistant to change when mired in Cox’s sound. Now, Deerhunter is an interconnected group rather than an extension of Cox, and from the feel of Halcyon Digest, this appears to be a good thing.

As an average college student, I never expected to visit a place like Bali. Yet when my mom invited me to accompany her to attend the Pan-Pacific and South-East Asia Women’s Association (PPSEAWA) Conference this past May, it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. After all, who would say no to a vacation in paradise?
It turns out this trip to Bali was not your typical vacation of sightseeing and relaxing on the beach — it was something far better. While my mom and I did get the opportunity to explore some of Bali, a lot of the time was spent at the conference: attending meetings, discussions, presentations, and getting to know an inspiring group of women.
Basically, PPSEAWA is a non-governmental organization (NGO) associated with the UN that, according to www.ppseawa.org, “supports women and children in the Asia-Pacific region through education, better health, balance in the environment, and peace between its people.”
It sounds just like any of the numerous other organizations claiming to make the world a better place, right? Wrong. PPSEAWA is unique because it focuses on a region of the world encompassing many smaller (and a few larger) countries that we often forget or don’t even know about. Just to name a few members, PPSEAWA includes the Cook Islands, Samoa, Philippines, New Zealand, and Fiji — where my mom grew up.
The coolest thing about PPSEAWA is not so much the exotic nations that are members, but rather what they’ve done. In Indonesia, for example, according to the PPSEAWA website, members “performed a program on helping people whose children were in malnutrition condition and participated in a training program to empower women in the effort of prevention, eradication of drug abuse and of the illicit trading cycle of drugs.”
Being new to Bali and new to PPSEAWA, I didn’t quite know what to expect. I had only recently discovered where Bali actually was — a tiny island within a series of smaller islands that make up Indonesia. As for PPSEAWA, it was the mysterious reason why my mom had been glued to her computer for many weeks leading up to the conference. But that was all I knew.
When I stepped inside the Agung Conference Hall for the first time, I immediately sensed what PPSEAWA was all about. I was instantly surrounded by women from all over the Southeast Asia and Pacific regions of the world, speaking different languages and wearing their traditional dresses. Throughout the conference, presentations were given and meetings took place, all of which made me realize one thing: What these women were doing to make a difference in the world, and the projects they were taking on to better the lives of others, was something I wanted to be a part of.
As a new youth member of PPSEAWA, I began to lead discussions and become more active overall as the conference went on. I found myself talking about issues I felt strongly about regarding American society today and comparing it to other societies around the world. I had never had the opportunity to share some of these opinions before, but the environment within the PPSEAWA Conference made it possible.
Even after the conference, the same vibe of positive energy among these women remained, although it didn’t hurt that we were on the beautiful island of Bali. Our last few days in Bali were more typical of what one might expect from a vacation in paradise. Since we were staying at the Inna Grand Beach Bali Hotel & Resort, we took advantage of the luxurious spa, spectacular seafood restaurant, and stunning beach. There was so much more outside the resort that we discovered, too. For example, since the hotel didn’t offer wireless Internet access, we became quite familiar with downtown Sanur whenever we wanted to use the Internet. We also got the chance to explore rice fields, which are a major agricultural industry in Bali. That same day, we visited the artsy region of Ubud, which ended up being an amazing place to enjoy delicious food and endless shopping.
My trip to Bali impacted me in so many ways, but it really came down to two major discoveries. First and foremost, it gave me the opportunity to learn more about PPSEAWA as an organization. Secondly, it further developed my global perspective, as travel often does. This trip to Bali reminded me of how big the world is and how much there is to learn, and I was able to further appreciate both the new things I came across and the familiar things I took for granted. That’s the thing about traveling: It teaches us how to live.

Jimmy Eat World could be a high school senior this year, scrambling to make deadlines for early-decision college applications. He could be sneaking out of windows on weekends or planning for that last epic spring break trip with his friends. Instead, in his 17 years, he’s whipped out seven albums and seven extended plays, gone through eight labels, and experimented with a few genres, all the while gaining fans across the world.
The band’s eponymous debut album, Jimmy Eat World, was released under Wooden Blue Records and had a punk rock sound, but the band quickly progressed to emocore by its second album, Static Prevails, released under Capitol Records. The group’s third studio album was Clarity, also released under Capitol. Clarity was considered a commercial failure upon its release, resulting in the band’s drop from Capitol Records, but it has since gained critical acclaim and cult status. Then came Bleed American, the band’s most successful album to date, released under Dreamworks. The band’s second single, “The Middle,” took over mainstream airwaves, which jump-started the band to mainstream success. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA. By then, Jimmy Eat World had transitioned into the alternative rock genre. Later on, however, the band became more rock than alternative, as evidenced by the albums Futures and Chase This Light.
The band’s newest album, Invented, has all the charm of classic Jimmy Eat World. The first single, “My Best Theory,” is reminiscent of songs from Bleed American, with a strong guitar presence and lyrics about individuality.
Perhaps the best song off the album is the title track “Invented” — a somber ballad combined with a dramatic midsection that fades back into the soft, heart-wrenching honesty that is Jimmy Eat World.
Although it’s safe to say that there are no disappointing tracks on this album, some are more notable than others, including “Stop,” “Movielike,” and “Coffee And Cigarettes.”
Invented is unmistakably Jimmy Eat World, to the point that any track from this new album could have been found on the group’s previous two. That isn’t to say that the lack of progression takes anything away from the talent that is Jimmy Eat World. There is a reason why the band is so popular, and for the group to continue with the sounds that make it popular isn’t something fans should hold against it. The emotion is there, as well as the clever lyrics and soulful structure, which all combine into one album that cannot possibly let fans down. However, one might worry that in the coming years, Jimmy will become the awkward 30-year-old man who envisions himself as the high-school rock star he never became, stuck playing pop-punk songs from his youth. Although Jimmy Eat World’s music is far beyond that, it has the emotion and angst that appeals to the heartbroken teen, and if he isn’t careful, Jimmy just might get stuck in his teenage years while all his classmates move on to bigger and better places.

This past weekend, the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama staged its opening production of Leonid Andreyev’s He Who Gets Slapped, a Russian screenplay that was published in English in 1922 and made into a film directed by Victor Sjöström in 1924.
The original play tells the story of Paul Beaumont, a scientist who has been working on his revolutionary theories about the origin of mankind for several years. When Beaumont perfects his theories and deems them worthy of presenting to the cademy of the Sciences, his wife Marie steals his life’s work and hands it over to her lover, the baron. When Beaumont presents to the academy, the baron takes credit for Beaumont’s work and thus humiliates him in front of his peers. When he attempts to seek consolation from his wife, Marie admits to her affair, slaps her husband, and calls him a clown.
Five years later, when the Carnegie Mellon drama production begins, Paul Beaumont is now a circus clown in Paris performing under his alias “HE who gets slapped” and denouncing his prior identity. With an eclectic group of talented performers in the show, HE’s act in the circus becomes incredibly popular. HE falls in love with his co-worker Consuelo, who rejects him for a prospective arrangement with her father’s wealthy friend. When the baron leaves Marie and reappears to declare his love for Consuelo, HE soon discovers that Bezano, a daredevil horseback rider in the circus, is also in love with Consuelo and that she returns his feelings. Several scenes later, through a series of dramatic events, HE is forced to meet a tragic fate. 
The show, put on by acting and musical theater majors at Carnegie Mellon, is a circus act in itself. Unicycles, stilts, twirling pillows, strong men, and acrobatics make for an exceedingly enjoyable show. The acting is also spot-on, and the outrageous costumes make the cast even more believable. Senior Arya Shahi, who plays HE, is definitely independent on the stage, taking his hopeful character to a higher level. One could hear the playwright’s own words of love and longing through senior Catherine Urbanek, who plays Zinida, the lion tamer. Of course, the show would not have been anything without Consuelo, played by senior Kailie Torres, who gives a brilliant and elegant performance alongside her intimidating cohort, senior Curtis Gillen, as Bezano. Though sometimes the sequence of events moves a bit quickly, the pace doesn’t take much away from their stellar performances. 
The set, which matches and fulfills the imagery of the story, is also rather versatile — being used as a backstage, a curtain behind which people would change clothes on stage, or a death bed. One of the characters, in thrones of fate, falls onto part of the set, virtually “destroying” it and ending the show with a dark mood. The production definitely took some interpretive liberties, so if you’re depending on Wikipedia for a plot synopsis, well, “you’re a donkey.”
Directed by Tony McKay, the associate professor of drama, the Carnegie Mellon production of He Who Gets Slapped is a thrilling story of vanity, love, and moral corruption. As this is only the first production of the 2010–2011 drama school season, students can look forward to several incredible productions, including Vanishing Point, The 25th Annual Putnam Spelling Bee, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
He Who Gets Slapped will be playing through Oct. 9 in Carnegie Mellon’s Philip Chosky Theatre. Performances are at 8 p.m. on Tuesday through Saturday with an additional matinée performance at 2 p.m. on Saturday. For students, tickets cost $10.

Sublime’s ska punk popularity continues long after the death of the group’s lead singer, Brad Nowell, inspiring the creation of Badfish. On Sept. 21, a small crowd of all ages gathered to welcome the band to Mr. Small’s Theatre & Funhouse. And “small crowd” really means small crowd — maybe 15 people deep in a venue that could have easily accommodated three times that number of fans. The energy the crowd gave off, however, enhanced the atmosphere tenfold.
Badfish had three opening acts: Tropidelic, Full Service, and Scotty Don’t. Tropidelic’s loud guitar and faux rap vocals did little to rouse the crowd at the start of the 8:30 p.m. show. The self-described reggae rock all-stars were high in energy, but because no one could hear a word of what they said, and because their guitar screamed without any distinguishable riffs, much of the crowd remained in the bar area, waiting for the headliners to take the stage.
The next opener, Full Service, successfully set the stage for an audience-involved concert. Similar in appearance to an ’80s hair band, Full Service could easily become as popular as Sublime in the near future. The group’s members came on stage with a giant surfboard while throwing kazoos and copies of their CDs into the audience. Who knew kazoos were all that an audience needed to get amped up? It was this quirky, laid back, and friendly attitude that attracted the attention of the audience.
Their songs mixed a head-banging hard rock with harmonizing vocals in songs like “Hi-Ho” (which, like the title suggests, has a similar rhythm to the catchy Seven Dwarves chant), “Rocketships” (where high pitched harmonies provide an extraterrestrial feel), and “Boons with Boards.” Ten minutes into their set, Bonesaw, the group’s guitarist and vocalist, tore off his shirt. Fellow band members Hoag, Twink, and Smell followed suit shortly after. Perhaps it was simply the lack of clothing or the beaded dreads and shoeless feet, but Full Service’s music was the perfect lead-in to Badfish.
Badfish, whose name is inspired by a song of the same name from Sublime’s 1992 debut album 40 oz. to Freedom, was nominated by the Boston Music Awards in 2008 for Best Tribute Band. This is for good reason — Pat Downes, the lead singer, embodies the reggae, hip-hop, and California feel that heavily influenced Sublime. His voice has the same lazy, relaxed resonance as Nowell’s, yet Downes manages to add strength to his voice that had the audience screaming the lyrics along with him. Sublime’s popular hits — “Santeria,” “Doin’ Time,” and the group track “Badfish” — not only remained popular among the small but animated crowd, but led into high-energy moshing among adults and teens alike.
The Badfish concert was an eerie experience, as the sound and atmosphere was that of a Sublime concert with a little something different, as Downes’ lead vocals brought ska punk back into popularity. It’s difficult to accurately emulate the “sublime” experience delivered by the ’90s band of the same name. Badfish, however, were able to not only pay a tribute to the band, but to stand strong by themselves as artists as well.

Once heard, a sound lives forever within the soul of a man, quietly stirring. Produced by anything, felt through any part of the body, the perception of sound is a bipolar bastard child of the human perception. While lauded greatly when it’s chopped, divided, castrated, and filed in metronomic precision, it goes greatly unperceived in its raw and pure form. This grandeur is not so much one associated with music but with identity. In sound, the intangible and the ephemeral become something physical: a reverberation that physically alters space and time. Vibrations are not respected because they cannot be tamed.
Whether it be the clatter of silverware dancing across the porous walls of an old-age home or the rustling of heather in the empty air of the cold Sierra Nevadas, sound carries an infinite potential whose beauty lies in its unmasterable nature. Yes, while some may become adept at banging out sonatas or strumming tribal breakbeats, the mastery of sculpting something permanent out of that humming quicksilver is not something that the adept few ask for.
Flowers, the material as ephemeral, rejoice in their springtime dances. Sound, which blossoms out from nothing more than the void, is the God of the ephemeral. Enough of that poetic nonsense. Want to get down with the WRCT Sound? Check out the following:
Boards of Canada: Music Has the Right to Children — Experience the beauty of electronic music. Extremely approachable and low-key in its magnificence.
Shoes: Eccentric Breaks and Beats — Flawlessly arranged pastiche of esoteric soul and funk.

Spirited Away
Thursday, Oct. 7
7:30 10 12:30
This 2001 Japanese animated film won the second Oscar ever given out for Best Animated Feature. In the movie, we follow Chihiro, a young girl who is traveling with her family to a new town. However, when they happen upon a mysterious theme park, Chihiro and her family are transferred into a whole new world of adventure. As the title gives away, Chihiro enters the spirit world, and while there, she interacts with a wide variety of creatures as she herself undergoes a major transformation in personality in an effort to rescue her parents. Fun fact: This film overtook Titanic as the highest grossing film in Japanese box office history.
Toy Story 3
Friday, Oct. 8
8 10 12
The highest grossing film of 2010 comes to Carnegie Mellon with Pixar’s Toy Story 3. Nearly all of the original voices from the first two films are back for the third installment of this iconic franchise. After Woody, Buzz, and the gang are mistakenly delivered to a day-care center before Andy leaves for college, the toys face abandonment issues along with wild toddlers who do not necessarily take care of them. A whopping 302 characters make an appearance in this movie, which features dozens of well-known actors from the world of cinema. Fun fact: This is the only Toy Story film not to have a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Iron Giant
Saturday, Oct. 9

After a giant alien robot falls from space, there really are only two ways to deal with it: Befriend it or destroy it. At least, these are the only two choices that seem available during the height of the Cold War. After young Hogarth Hughes discovers a giant robot that crash lands off the coast of Maine, he begins a friendship with it and embarks on a series of fun-filled adventures with his new friend. Meanwhile, a suspicious government agent informs the military, which seeks to destroy the “monster.” Called “the best non-Disney animated movie” by IGN, The Iron Giant is a stellar piece of cinema that puts the audience right in the shoes of its characters.
Paprika
Sunday, Oct. 10
8 10 12
A Japanese movie about a psychologist using a device to enter people’s dreams? This couldn’t possibly result in crazy images and giant robots eating people... oh wait, right, it’s Japanese animation, so of course it can. Things take a turn for the worse after a few prototypes of the device are stolen from a research lab and used on people to begin controlling their dreams. Eventually, reality and the dream world merge and all hell breaks loose. Fun fact: Apparently, a live-action production is in the works for Paprika and, once you see this movie, you’ll wonder how they could possibly pull that off.

**Dear Hoskins Brothers, **
**I like to compete. A lot. Sports, drinking games, drinking sports, everything. I especially love trash-talking, but I suck at it. Do you have any tips on tearing down my competitors’ self-esteem? **
Sincerely,  **
**Pong King
**Dear PK, **
Lucky for you, I happen to be an expert on hurting people’s feelings. Step one: Disregard any feelings of compassion you may have toward your peers. They’re not people, they are your opponents. Step two: Find out what they are most sensitive about — those insecurities that drive them crazy. Use those weaknesses against them. Step three: Cackle in victory.
As an example, I will now trash-talk my brother. Hey Brian, you suck at [insert sport activity here]. You perform [athletic activity] worse than an 80-year-old arthritic woman. That buzz cut makes you look like a baby the doctors needed to use the tongs on. At least now you can audition to be an extra on Coneheads. That show sucks about as much as you do at  [athletic activity].
By now, my brother should be in tears, totally distracted from the game at hand. From here, victory is assured. As long as you don’t suck.
**Insecurities are there for a reason, **
Patrick Hoskins
**Dear Hoskins Brothers, **
**I like to play sports, drinking games, and drinking sports. However, I find that everyone trash-talks me. By the end of it I’m reduced to tears and can’t compete. How can I better react to trash talk? Words hurt me. **
Sincerely, **
**Words Hurt
Dear WH,
First, stop being such a pansy. Remember, sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will hurt forever. That’s why you have to give as good as you get. They’re in your head? You’ve got to get all up in theirs. For example: Sure, I was hurt by my brother’s comments; sure I cried a little, but now I’m ready to tear him down to the speck he is.
Hey Patty, how ‘bout them apples? You enjoying this cold dish of revenge? Why don’t you go sit in front of a computer all day, you CS nerd? Be careful not to get carpal tunnel — oh wait, you have an ergonomic keyboard. You’re so “cool.” I wish I could be “just like you.” You’re my “hero.” I hope to “one day be as great as you.” I “idolize you, your intellect, and your striking good looks.”
That sure put him in his place. Just follow my example, kid, and you’ll go far.
**Patrick definitely didn’t write this response, **
Brian Hoskins

100 Years Ago:
October 5, 1910
The Pertinent and Impertinent section notes that several Plebes were removed from a faculty-only section of campus and chides them for thinking they were entitled to “better things.” I, on the other hand, would have applauded those courageous first-years for sticking it to the man.
50 Years Ago: 
October 5, 1960
A short ad calling for nominees to the “Scimitar Society” is listed in the paper this week. The ad mentions that to be considered, one “must be in the top third of his class academically and participate in activities.” Skill with a blade does not appear to be a qualification. 
25 Years Ago: 
October 1, 1985
WRCT reopened this week after receiving a major renovation in terms of space for the main studios. Strangely enough, absolutely none of the money spent on the station went toward adding new musical selections. Remember, it’s not always the size that counts...
10 Years Ago:
October 2, 2000
One student’s response to a question about Ralph Nader in the “Person’s Opinion” feature has, “Who? Oooh, he is like a political guy, right?” It’s always refreshing to hear that the in-your-face register-to-vote recruiters never could quite get everyone.
5 Years Ago:
October 3, 2005
The Tartan reported on an interesting response by a Pennsylvania school district to rising gas prices: shortening the school week to four days to save on costs. As someone who has been trying to finagle a three-day weekend out of his schedule for three years, I applaud that plan.
1 Year Ago: 
October 3, 2009
An accident on Forbes Avenue outside the Fraternity Quad involving a motorist and a taxi driver caused no significant injuries, though Robert DeNiro did threaten the man talking to him with a gun. Hopefully, more than just the super-nerdy film buffs get that joke.

You don't have to be in CFA to express yourself. This week, say what you feel, let your opinions and feelings be known, and have the confidence to be comfortable with anything that may come from it.
You’re more mustard than ketchup and nothing like mayo at all. Relish this revelation.
Stay away from your shower! That’s where the monster hides! That being said, your hygiene indicates that you've known this for quite some time.
Your phone hates you. Think twice the next time you throw it across the room, call it stupid, and then still expect it to be reliable when you need it.
You must be an advocate for proper care of all robot-themed plot devices. It is your duty to your peers to ensure that the incident with the All-Spark doesn't happen again.
Reevaluate out-of-place events in your week. It may not have been a date; some people just don’t want to eat lunch alone in the corner.
It will all be okay, trust me.
It’s okay that you constantly forget the names of people you meet. Just know that it’s also okay that so many people rightfully think you’re a jerk.
You are what you listen to, so you might want to think twice about filling your playlists with songs about jerk cheaters, depressed loners, and people who own the town. Unless that’s the kind of person you want to be.
The mystic land of YouTube awaits you. Log on and see the world and the finest examples of mankind, one Fred video and bad song cover at a time.
Don't accept the turtle in Farmville; it will bring calamity, mayhem, and chaos to the world.
I see this week being quite routine — nothing remarkable is written in your future. Nothing bad or ominous is either. Hold fast in the knowledge that this week is something that you can definitely handle.

It’s a new week, and for many students this means a new quota of blocks to use up before Oct. 16. For many students, the two-week period of the meal block system, as well as financial concerns regarding the value of the blocks, can complicate mealtimes. Blocks are cherished by some, disliked by others — but regardless of individual opinions they are a requirement for the incoming class and are preferred by upperclassmen who favor on-campus dining options.
Student reactions to the meal plan system have always been mixed. This year, Housing and Dining Services has added a greater variety of meal plan options, targeting students who may want fewer meal blocks than the former plans. This move, while increasing flexibility, heightens concerns regarding the value of a smaller meal plan system versus paying for meals outside of a plan. However, in addition to answering the desires of the students, meal plans must also meet the needs of the vendors — this requiring a balance between value and flexibility for students and utility for vendors.
Some students voice concerns about having to use a block — even when using DineXtra might be cheaper — just because their chosen plan allots them so many meal blocks. “I have found that when I go to places like the Maggie Murph Café in the morning for breakfast that it is cheaper to buy a small tea, muffin, and apple with DineXtra than it is to use a block, but that I will use the block because I do not want to waste them,” said Sarah Horner, a first-year in the Mellon College of Science. “Next year, I will 
go for a plan with fewer blocks and more DineXtra.”
The lack of flexibility becomes most obvious in the Green meal plans, which provides the most blocks and the least flexible dollars. “I have the Green 3 meal plan with 34 meals per two weeks and $275 DineX per semester. I actually regret getting such a high meal plan considering I eat one to two meals per day,” said Giri Mehta, a first-year in the Mellon College of Science. “In hindsight, I would have gotten a much lower meal plan with more DineX.” Such a high number of blocks almost necessitates frequent on-campus eating habits in order to yield any significant value. Like Horner, Mehta also intends to enroll in a meal with fewer blocks and more flexible dollars in the future.
And, as with any pre-paid meal plan, there is always the fear that blocks are actually not saving you money at all.
“I actually did the math out one day and realized that if I paid for the same amount of food, in cash, it would be cheaper than using a meal plan,” said Brian Duff, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major. “That was the day I canceled my meal plan.”
Under the Red 9 plan, Duff had paid $2,225 for 11 meal blocks per week and $675 in flexible dollars. Subtracting the flexible dollars from the price, Duff reasoned that he was paying $1,550 for his blocks. Assuming 16 weeks in a semester, Duff calculated he pays $8.71 for a single block.
“I believe that most dinner blocks cost $8.50 and most lunch blocks cost $7.50 if you pay in cash, so you are losing money by signing up for a meal plan, rather than getting a good deal,” he said.
Of course, $8.50 and $7.50 are just estimates of averages, and whether a student is saving or losing money on the meal plan is very dependent on what type of food he or she orders.
Housing and Dining Services is aware of student concerns regarding the meal plan system, but staff members explain that the value of the meal plan varies depending on the way it is used. “If the student is somebody who doesn’t want to take advantage of what the block has or hasn’t found the right place to eat yet … then they may not be getting the most out of their plan, and we can work with them on that,” said Kim Abel, director of Housing and Dining Services. “The block system is designed to provide value…. We ask our vendors to provide value from blocks.”
However, despite concerns of value, the block model has evolved into a system that Housing and Dining hopes is both useful to students and flexible to their eating habits. “It’s a hybrid model,” Abel said. “We have meal blocks, flexible dollars, and a little bit of Carnegie Mellon thrown in as well.”
Many of the guidelines and fundamental components of the meal plan system have resulted from previous challenges faced by both Housing and Dining and on-campus dining vendors. One commonly cited issue is that pre-paid meal plans run the risk that students will use several meals at once, so vendors are never sure what to expect. “Suppose you are a vendor, and you know that there are 3,000 students on the meal plan who you may have to serve. You don’t know when they’ll show up and how much of their meal plans they will use, so you don’t know what to keep in your inventory,” Abel said. Being understocked will lose potential customers, while excess inventory is a waste of money.
“The way other institutions control this is by serving everyone through the same cafeteria-style dining location…. The flexible dollars can be used at other locations, but the actual meal pass has to be used at a specific location,” Abel elaborated. Central Michigan University, for example offers students unlimited meal plans, but only four of the 15 on-campus dining locations will accept meal passes.
However, Carnegie Mellon wanted to give students more choice with their meals, and that required more vendors to participate in the dining program. To overcome these challenges, Housing and Dining broke down the meal plan into its fundamental components. 
“Dining programs have to run efficiently and be financially valuable, so there has to be a balance basically between the needs of the vendors and … the needs of the students,” Abel said. In this case, students seem to want flexibility, while vendors need predictability of demand. “By creating this block system and this structure, we’ve created a dining program that’s balanced — both for the vendor and for the students.”
It’s a compromise, and in exchange for some flexibility, students receive more variety. “It’s the parameter that makes the system work,” Abel said. “It provides the structure for the meal plan to maintain itself. It lets the vendors know how many meals they will be serving in a certain time.”
As a result, Carnegie Mellon currently has almost 30 different dining locations on campus and is serviced by more than 10 vendors. More vendors are expected to come in the next few years. “We’re distinct because we allow students to use their dining blocks wherever they want to go,” Abel said.
In response to student concerns about flexibility, Abel has set up some of the community dining plans available to upper-class students that offer more flexible dollars relative to meal blocks. Abel has also helped ensure that there are still other dining plan options that offer a high ratio of flexible dollars to blocks.
As a result of these efforts, meal plan enrollment has risen. Currently, the Red plans, which provide the most flexible dollars, are the most popular meal plans among first-year students, while Scotty’s Choice, which averages five meals per week and $450 flexible dollars per semester, is the most popular plan among sophomores, juniors, and seniors. 
“The upperclass plans in particular were a great success last year, so we’re constantly looking at that and trying to make improvements,” Abel said. “Last year we saw a 120 percent increase in upperclass meal plan purchases. We have exceeded that number this year and appear to be trending at an all-time high.”

Pulling an all-nighter in the cluster may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to a new initiative by Carnegie Mellon Computing Services. While Computing Services cannot necessarily alleviate students’ need to work until early hours in the morning, it is taking steps to decrease students’ reliance on cluster computing. Since Sept. 22, campus affiliates have had access to Virtual Andrew, a new pilot program. Virtual Andrew uses technology called VDI, which stands for virtual desktop infrastructure, to allow students to access cluster software from their own computers. The program provides students with remote access to various types of academic software, without forcing them to install the often-expensive software packages on their personal computers.
The Virtual Andrew pilot currently offers a selection of popular software including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat Pro, MATLAB, and Microsoft Office 2010. Virtual Andrew provides remote access to a “virtual” Windows cluster machine using a technology called VMware View. Students can download the VMware View client for their personal machines to access Virtual Andrew. Manager of Cluster Services Connie Deighan Eaton compared the service to a library, as “students will be essentially checking out a Windows cluster machine, a machine that lives in a server room, not a physical cluster.... It will apply the settings you have set up on your personal account in a Windows cluster, such as your MyFiles space, Andrew printing, Andrew File System , and even your browser preferences.”
Alekhya Gampa, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, regularly uses the clusters on campus to access advanced programming text editors and compilers, as well as design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. “This is totally going to change how much I rely on the clusters. I won’t have to walk to one, and then be disappointed to find that it’s full and there are no machines available,” Gampa said.
According to Eaton, the Virtual Andrew pilot is one of Computing Services’ latest attempts at meeting students’ needs. “As students progress through their program at Carnegie Mellon, their software needs become more and more intensive while their personal machines become older and older.... Seniors who may need the most advanced software may have computers that are at least three years old,” Eaton said.
In creating the Virtual Andrew pilot, Computing Services has conferred with faculty from disciplines across campus to get a feel for professors’ concerns. A clear problem is the variability of versions of software on students’ machines. 
“Consistency is important. [Virtual Andrew] will ensure that everyone within a class will have access to the same software. In the past, students working in a group on a project could have been using different versions of software on their machines, and their files might not have been compatible,” Eaton said.
“Now there will be consistency between what students can access on their own machines and what professors are instructing from in the clusters.” 
Ramyata Upmaka, a sophomore materials science and engineering major, needs to use MATLAB software for her courses. She found out about the Virtual Andrew pilot from a friend while logging onto a cluster computer in Morewood Gardens. Immediately after seeing a demo of VMware, Upmaka left the cluster to go open the pilot softwafe on her laptop. “It’s nice because I don’t have to install software onto my own computer. I will definitely tell my friends about this,” said Upmaka.
According to its website, Computing Services encourages students to download the Virtual Andrew pilot on their personal machines. All campus affiliates with an Andrew username may go through the installation steps on www.cmu.edu/computing/virtual-andrew. Because it is a pilot program, users are reminded that, according to Cluster Services, “the service may not be completely stable. Save work often in a secure location, and plan to visit a computer cluster if needed.”
Questions regarding the Virtual Andrew pilot may be directed to clusters@andrew.cmu.edu.

It is ironic that a book about censorship, Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, is banned in some locations due to its containing offensive language and questionable content.
Unfortunately, many other books that have become favorites of readers of all ages — books such as To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, A Wrinkle in Time by Madeline L’Engle, and Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison — are censored for similar reasons. 
This past week, from Sept. 25 to Oct. 2, the American Library Association (ALA) marked “Banned Books Week: Celebrating the Freedom to Read.” However, at Carnegie Mellon, one group of students is recognizing banned books all semester long through a new course in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
The class, Studies in Print Culture: Censored Texts, is taught by English professor Kathleen Newman.
Studies in Print Culture examines book censorship from the mid-20th century to the present and explores political, racial, and sexual censorship. 
The course first focused on the time of the anti-Communist blacklist; the class read Walter Bernstein’s Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist and Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. 
Next, the students will read Catcher in the Rye (J.D Salinger), To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee), Giovanni’s Room (James Baldwin), and The Price of Salt (Patricia Highsmith). 
Newman was inspired to teach the class because she has “been researching writing about the 1950s for almost 20 years. I was ready to share some of my research with my students, and to see what lessons they have to teach me.” 
She found quickly that her students had a great deal to teach her. “I was surprised on the first day of class when so many of the students shared their own experiences of being shut down for various activities deemed ‘inappropriate’ in high school — plays with sexual references and gay advocacy groups, to name just two.” said Newman.
Often books that are banned by some are extolled by others as masterpieces. 
Scott Rosenfeld, senior English major and one of the students in Newman’s class, explained that, “really good books are also usually the most polarizing. A book is your favorite because there’s something in it that speaks to you-the ideas, the characters-and a lot of those strong ideas are ones that are controversial.”
“By banning books, you restrict the amount of culture people are exposed to and shelter people from the realities of life. And it’s unfair that someone can decide what others can read and form opinions of,” said Alyssa Danesh, a first-year in the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
One way Carnegie Mellon students can continue Banned Book Week is by celebrating their freedom to read a banned book. 
A full list of frequently banned books , sorted by author and year published, can be found at www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/index.cfm.
The ALA also encourages individuals wishing to celebrate the freedom to read to volunteer at the American Civil Liberties Union (www.aclu.org).

Last Friday night’s Relay for Life event invited the campus community to join together to support the American Cancer Society. The Relay for Life effort began in 1985 with a single person, Dr. Gordy Klatt, walking around a track for 24 straight hours, and has evolved into a community-based fundraiser well known across the nation. Today, Relay for Life is an overnight relay used to raise money and awareness for the American Cancer Society, which funds hospitals, cancer research, and other services for cancer patients.
Carnegie Mellon’s Relay for Life is a symbolic relay walk in which the teams are formed by students and members of the Pittsburgh community. The event is organized by a committee of students who are particularly motivated to see progress made in cancer research.
“Those who are familiar with Relay for Life enjoy attending the event and think it’s for a great cause. There are so many great aspects of Relay and the American Cancer Society that it is impossible to advertise everything, especially since everyone is so busy and focused on their schoolwork,” said senior English major Lindsey Fu, a co-chair of the Relay for Life committee.
Most Relay for Life events are held in the spring to give teams eight months to fundraise before the walk. Carnegie Mellon’s Relay for Life is therefore unique because it is the only Relay for Life event in the country that is held in October, in an effort to hold the event before it gets too cold to spend the night outdoors. However, this also means that teams are presented with the challenge of raising all their funds over a six-week period rather than an eight-month period.
Each team is composed of at most 15 members, and each team member is encouraged to raise $100, though some team members set their goals much higher. Senior biological sciences major Derek Lee, a chair on the BioSAC team, set a personal goal for $5,000 this year. Like many other dedicated participants, Lee was affected directly by cancer when his father died on Christmas Eve two years ago. Since then, Lee has committed to honoring his father’s memory by pursuing a cure for cancer through many avenues, including a research position at the Human Cancer Center and involvement in Relay for Life. Lee’s hope is that people will be able to survive cancer without remembering it as the worst time of their lives. He believes that eventually a better treatment for cancer can be developed, but “what we really want is a cure for the fear of cancer.”
This year, teams spent 12 hours walking around a track on the Cut — instead of their usual venue, Gesling Stadium — from 6 p.m. on Friday evening to 6 a.m. on Saturday morning. In addition to the teams’ fundraising, the event itself is also a fundraiser where games are set up and food and raffle tickets are sold. During the evening, varied events help participants remember, celebrate, and have fun as a part of the relay. Included in these traditions is the Survivors’ Lap, during which only cancer survivors walk the track. A second major tradition is the Luminaria Ceremony, in which people can honor or dedicate messages to cancer victims on paper lanterns in exchange for a donation. This year, all the lit-up paper lanterns were arranged around the track in the shape of the word “hope” while participants walked a lap in silence. Intertwining a Carnegie Mellon tradition in the event, the lap was led by a bagpipe band that honored survivors, deceased loved ones, and those who are still fighting the disease.
By 6 a.m., an estimated total of $38,000 was raised by donors and participants. In the end, one of the committee chairs, junior music major Jamie Burrows, summarized the event best: “Cancer never sleeps, and neither will we.”

The game “Ultimate Ninja” has conventionally been used in the past as a fun bonding exercise by Carnegie Mellon students. However, last Friday, it was used instead to raise awareness about domestic violence. Given the chance to be ninjas for a day, students across campus signed up and participated in a giant game of “Ultimate Ninja.” 
Taking place in Donner Ditch, the game boasted around 30 players, all competing to be the last ninja standing. The grand prize was a $50 gift certificate to Chipotle. The competitive, fast-paced game lasted over two hours. The participants not only enjoyed an afternoon of fun, but also helped raise money and awareness against domestic violence.
Since October is nationally recognized as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, the event “Ninjas Against Domestic Violence” started off the month on a high note, raising over $1,000. All the proceeds went directly to the Women’s Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, one of the first shelters built for battered women and children in the country. According to the website (www.wcspittsburgh.org), “each year more than 5,200 individuals — women, children, and some men — utilize our services for domestic violence victims.”
Ninjas Against Domestic Violence was organized through Carnegie Mellon’s sorority Alpha Chi Omega, as increasing awareness against domestic violence is one of its main goals. 
Rosie Weisburgh, a senior mechanical engineering major and the vice president of fraternity relations for Alpha Chi Omega, created the event in hopes that by “being bold, and doing something unique, we would raise more interest.... My personal goal is to raise over $2,000 over the course of the month.” Along with help from Courtney Bruggeman, a senior mathematical sciences major and member of Alpha Chi Omega, the event grew quickly. 
“While our main goal behind the event was to raise a lot of money for the Pittsburgh Women’s Shelter, we were really excited when people asked us more about the cause. As the kickoff event of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we really hope that people will remember this event and come to our others to help support the cause,” Weisburgh said.
“At first I thought Ninjas Against Domestic Violence was an unusual event, but a lot of people showed up and we all had a really fun time. The event was for a really good cause, and I’m so glad I participated in it,” said Colleen Treacy, a sophomore physics major.
In addition to Ninjas against Domestic Violence, the sorority sells luminary candles throughout October and has an annual Vera Bradley brand product sale in the spring to continually raise money for the Pittsburgh Women’s Shelter. 
“If the event is successful, which I think it will be since the game of ‘Ultimate Ninja’ has become fairly popular on campus, I could definitely see it becoming a repeated philanthropy event,” said Sara Hoge, participant of the event and service chair for Alpha Chi Omega.
“Personally, I think this is a great cause, because domestic violence is a problem in America that hits home for a lot of people, and donating to the Pittsburgh Woman’s Shelter is a way to help right here in the local community,” Hoge said.

New professional master’s degree program announced
The Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) has created a new master’s degree program called Energy, Science, Technology, and Policy. The program is based in engineering with components in public policy and economics, with a view toward the fields of energy development, production, and transport.
Intended for professionals in engineering- or technology-related fields, the master’s program begins with a set of core courses directly relating to energy. Examples of these courses include Energy Conversion and Supply, Demand and Utilization of Energy, and Energy Policy and Economics. After these initial core courses, a student then customizes the remaining aspects of the major according to a discipline within CIT, such as chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and so on. Courses are taught by faculty members across CIT, providing a varied experience.
As explained by the program website (neon.materials.cmu.edu/energy), upon completion of the program, “graduates will be prepared for positions of responsibility in multiple markets, including traditional utility companies and energy suppliers, alternative and renewable energy companies, power generation and distribution equipment, energy intensive manufacturing ... consulting companies, government labs, and academic institutions.” 
Collective intelligence of groups exceeds individuals’
When working on a group project for class, it may be worthwhile to consider a recent study performed by Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Union College. The conclusion supported by the research indicates that cooperating groups display an intelligence beyond that of an individual member. The extent of this group intelligence is affected by how well group members interact and perceive each other’s emotions. 
According to a university press release, groups with a more even distribution of participation yielded higher group intelligence, along with groups having more women, as they tend to have a higher “social sensitivity.”
“Social sensitivity has to do with how well group members perceive each other’s emotions,” co-author Christopher Chabris said in the release.
Researchers examined groups of two to five people working on various tasks, such as negotiations or brainstorming, at both Carnegie Mellon and the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. Implications of such research could be the use of these studies by organizations to gauge the effectiveness of groups. Researchers included Anita Woolley of the Tepper School of Business as the lead author; Nada Hashmi, Thomas Malone, and Alexander Pentland of MIT; and Christopher Chabris of Union College.

Quadruple amputee Philippe Croizon swam the English Channel on Sept. 18. The Frenchman left Folkestone, England, at 6:45 a.m. and successfully reached Cap Gris Nez, France, at 8:13 p.m. that night. While many people have attempted to make this journey, Croizon was the first quadruple amputee — a person with parts of each of his arms and legs removed — to swim the channel. Here is some data concerning one of mankind’s greatest physical feats:
Shortest distance (from Dover, England, to Calais, France) across the English Channel: 21 miles
First trans-channel swim: Aug. 25, 1875
Time it took for Croizon to swim the entire channel: 13 hours 28 minutes
Most crossings by a single person (Alison Streeter): 43

The basic tenets of test-taking are pummeled into students from kindergarten through college. Don’t copy off your friends. Don’t write the answers on your hand. Don’t talk to others taking the test about the test. In short: Don’t cheat.
These concepts seem to have escaped an unknown number of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents during a late-2008 test that was recently investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The test was on the FBI’s new policies about surveillance and investigation of U.S. citizens, something we think it would be good for FBI agents to understand. 
After five separate allegations of cheating, the OIG launched an investigation into agents’ conduct during the test. The result: 22 agents out of the 76 interviewed had been involved in cheating or improper action. 
The report details all manner of bad behavior: superior officers and attorneys passing out answer sheets, group test-taking, taking advantage of “a computer programming flaw,” and explicit lying on the final question that asks agents to certify they took the test — which was already open-book — without help beyond the allowed materials.
The first, and likely hardest, step here is admitting that the FBI needs to audit all its testing locations. As the OIG report recognizes, the FBI does not normally administer pass-fail tests. Agents aren’t used to being required to actually learn the material on the quizzes in their online classroom. This case seriously deviated from the internal norm because the policies that these agents were being tested on are important and not well understood, which makes it that much more important to preserve integrity. 
The OIG suggested that the FBI figure out how many agents across all locations actually cheated, take disciplinary action, and then draft a new test and re-conduct it across the entire FBI. This is the obvious answer and we support it. School children know that cheating on tests invalidates the exam and gets them in trouble, and the FBI should face those facts and be held to at least as high a standard.

The year is 1933. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announces the New Deal to recover from the Great Depression.
The year is 1961. President John F. Kennedy announces that Americans are going to the moon within the decade.
The year is 2010. President Barack Obama announces... what, exactly? His intention to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” or maybe pass national health care. But these are not the kind of grand, long-term plans that will drive Americans and their government for the next decade. Until we can find such a plan, we as a nation will find it impossible to maintain a competitive advantage over countries such as China that are making big bets in technology and infrastructure.
Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been the only true global superpower, and it took upon itself the role of international policeman. Since 2001, the War on Terror has drained our resources and become one of the government’s top priorities. But as we have poured our resources into Iraq and Afghanistan, we have lost sight of other internal goals. 
We support corrupt governments with foreign aid but leave our own people in poverty. We need a commitment to developing infrastructure, to bringing 21st-century technology to the entire country. We need long-term goals that will inspire a generation of American youth.
In a New York Times column last week, Thomas Friedman (author of The World Is Flat) compared the United States’ investment in Afghanistan to China’s investment in infrastructure and cutting-edge technology. His conclusion: “The contrast is not good.”
Friedman is right. China is investing in renewable energy and high-speed rail, and its (mostly) command economy means that these investments can be supported by the force of its authoritarian government. Among the advanced technologies Friedman discusses are electric vehicles. China has made such cars one of its “industrial pillars.” But while China and Europe are focusing on innovative technologies for transportation, the United States seems to be making little progress. 
Sure, political leaders make speeches promoting renewable energy and high-efficiency vehicles, but until their words are backed by broad efforts, we will only see incremental developments. And while I do not intend to advocate China’s style of government control for America, history shows that our free-market principles and relatively limited government do not stop us from making big bets that have big payoffs. Today, however, we are not willing to make the investments or the sacrifices necessary to achieve these grand goals.
It may be that the United States has outgrown its period of accepting great challenges. We may be too cynical, too skeptical of our government to take big risks. When President George W. Bush tried to channel Kennedy and announced that NASA would return to the moon and continue to Mars, few people thought there was any chance of making his seemingly arbitrary deadlines. Many doubted the goals would be achieved at all. As the last few months have shown, we skeptics were right.
Truthfully, though, a literal moon shot is not what the country needs right now. We need something even more audacious: a genuine change in the lives of Americans everywhere. The age of Kennedy and Roosevelt, when great dreams led to great results, seems to be behind us. Yet if we are to maintain our standard of living, we have no choice but to begin dreaming once more. We must not be afraid to take risks. We must not be afraid to fail. We must not be afraid to make our own future.

Quick — what’s happening on campus this Friday night?
It seems like a simple question — one that you should be able to easily answer in this age of constant connections and information by simply pulling out your laptop or smartphone. Our campus is exploding with new and innovative events: From performances to cultural events to service to gaming, most weekends have something for everyone.
But you’d never know it by looking at the university’s official event calendar www.cmu.edu/events, which generally only displays events sponsored by academic or administrative departments. These are terrific events, to be sure — but they only represent a tiny fraction of life at Carnegie Mellon. The official calendar is barren for a few reasons, but the most important one is simply visibility. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg scenario: Students don’t look at the calendar because it doesn’t have content they want, so they don’t make an effort to add their organization’s events to the calendar since they won’t attract any attention.
Many solutions to this problem have been proposed — the event calendar, when it was developed, was itself an attempted fix. Students spend tens of thousands of dollars and use reams of paper each year blanketing the campus with posters to raise awareness. Some students have even started websites to scrape event data from the Web and aggregate it. Yet the problem with every solution that’s been tried is user adoption. 
To solve the calendar problem, we first need to attack visibility. One of the ideas that I campaigned on last year was the idea of media screens: video displays on which student organizations could post event flyers and details directly via a Web interface. Posting an event to these screens would be significantly easier and cheaper than spending a night postering the entire campus. Most importantly, once content is brought in, it can be redistributed anywhere — through the Carnegie Mellon iPhone application, through an iCal file, or as “commercials” during a cmuTV broadcast.
The point is this: Students are the key to solving this problem. We have the content and the events to get people out of their dorm rooms and offices, and we need to push hard for a better medium to share it, not settle for a patchwork of posters, Facebook, and word of mouth. Our current options simply are not measuring up to what we’re capable of at Carnegie Mellon. Come help us build something better.

When I was just a young boy first discovering the magic of the Internet (and it is truly magical), America Online was the portal to the significantly smaller Net of a decade ago. America Online was my e-mail, my instant messenger, my chat rooms, my browser. America Online was a multitude of CDs packaged with everything imaginable. Free CDs lined racks for free, and America Online direct-mailed advertisements for 100 or 500 or 700 or 1045(!) hours of free access to the Internet. America Online was the way I would clog the phone line every night over our 56K modem as I browsed and chatted and explored what would become my very digital future.
But, looking back, this all seems a bit nostalgic. America Online succeeded in being everything for some 30 million subscribers, but some combination of the rise of broadband, bad customer service, obnoxious lock-ins, and over-advertising — and the purchase of Time Warner — brought the company down from its heights. After America Online’s $165 billion acquisition/semi-merger with the media company, the last decade seems to have spelled out a mess of indecisions over what the then-renamed AOL was really doing. Capitalizing on Time Warner’s access to traditional media didn’t seem to ever happen; subscribers started leaving and continued to leave with every new year. AOL attempted to fight Yahoo! — which we now know has its own downhill battle to fight. It seemed without those free Internet-hour CDs filling our inboxes, both America and AOL had lost sight of who AOL really was.
And when a company has lost sight of who it is, that is the time for an exercise in rebranding.
So, at the end of 2009, as AOL cleaved itself from Time Warner, it brought in Wolff Olins — the company that designed the Sony Ericsson hollow tech-sphere, the Product Red parentheses, and the London 2012 hypercolor tangram. AOL was rebranded as Aol. (period included) in a very nondescript sans-serif in white. The logo is set on various backgrounds: studio-quality photographs, colorful computer-generated abstract art, scribbles ... really anything. This dynamic we-are-everything-again brand is how Aol. decided to start its next decade.
So nearly a full year out, what is the new AOL? Last week it invited (read: purchased) three new members to the family: Brizzly, a Twitter/Facebook aggregator-type platform; 5min, an instructional video-sharing site; and, most significantly, TechCrunch, one of the largest and most-read blogging networks. In TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington’s press release on the purchase, he said, “[AOL CEO] Tim Armstrong and his team have an exciting vision for the future of AOL as a global leader in creating and delivering world-class content to consumers, be it through original content creation, partnerships or acquisitions.” And this in a nutshell does seem to be the strategy of 2010 AOL. These purchases are the most recent in a long string of acquisitions that are about AOL picking up whatever content it can. AOL owns Weblogs Inc., including Engadget and Joystiq; it co-launched celebrity gossip haven TMZ.com; and up until this summer it owned the not-popular-enough social network bebo.
In short, AOL wants to own the content of the Web so that it can — you guessed it — rake in the advertising dollars. Yes, like all the other cool-kid tech companies, AOL is going to bring in its revenue through advertising dollars on all the blogs you read. So AOL will continue “investing in content areas and ... adding more content brands to [its] portfolio,” with Arrington in some sort of prominent internal-content leading position. (The terms of the TechCrunch acquisitions require him to stay for three years).
Now, I have a bit of a relationship with Arrington — that is, he drives me crazy. But I think that self-indulgent, know-everything attitude might actually help AOL in its attempt to gain the attitude that it needs to compete. Arrington, if given control, has the ability to infuse the background imagery behind AOL’s new logo with some serious character and controversy. And already these purchases are drawing attention. AOL’s stock has been up this week. (People are investing in AOL in 2010!).
I have to say that I want AOL to succeed. I want more players in the online advertising space. I want a company that at least pretends to care about providing quality online content, blogs, news, gossip, and maybe someday even real journalism. I like the idea that a company can actually reinvent itself. And I love that AOL is actually partnering with artists to provide some background, some personality to their logo. AOL is showing that they are no longer a company with a brand built on billions of free CDs, but a brand built on the quality of its content.

Universities across the nation have been working for years on efficient systems for informing and protecting their students in case of an emergency, and the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007 only scaled up these efforts. 
Last Tuesday, when a gunman opened fire on the University of Texas (UT) campus in Austin, concerns regarding students’ safety on college campuses were once again raised. The incident put the university’s emergency alert system to the test, and by all reports the system did quite well sending alerts to the 30,000 phone numbers on the text-messaging list and 70,000 e-mail addresses.
As soon as there were reports about a gunman on campus, alerts were sent out across the UT Austin campus. The messages initially told the students and staff to stay where they were. After sweeps of the campus buildings had been carried out, a later message informed people that the situation was under control. 
The rapid response to the situation was impressive, as was the fact that the messages told the students what to do instead of just informing them of the presence of the gunman.
Carnegie Mellon’s AlertNow system has been used occasionally in cases of bomb threats or snowstorms. Although we are glad that we have an emergency alert system in place (and that it has not needed to be used this semester), the system does have some flaws that need to be taken care of.
Most importantly, the system has often shown a delayed response, with many students first hearing about the emergency from sources other than the alert system. In situations like the one at UT Austin, timing is crucial. 
If students are not informed about a threat in time, they could unknowingly walk into the line of fire. If UT Austin’s alert system ran at the same speed as Carnegie Mellon’s, it would have taken almost three hours to notify all the university’s students.
The UT Austin shooting has shown the importance of having rapid, efficient, and informative alert systems. If such an emergency ever occurs on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, hopefully our alert system will show improvement and do an equally good job of notifying students.

The University of Pittsburgh’s Hillman Library recently unveiled its newest gadget, the Espresso Book Machine. This literature printing system, from On Demand Books LLC, has a digital storage system of numerous academic text files and the capability to quickly print, cover, and bind multiple types of books. This accommodates, but is not limited to, textbooks, paperbacks, and university publications.
Rather than having to wait for books to ship, Pitt students will soon have the option of utilizing the Espresso Book Machine to order and print textbooks and other materials on site. This process is less expensive and more efficient than traditional means of textbook acquisition — a 600-page book can be printed in less than nine minutes at only a penny a page in production costs.
Although “efficient” and “low-cost” are phrases that today’s prudent college students love to hear, a more high-tech approach should be considered before demolishing a few forests. The encouragement of e-books and paperless technology in the educational world would ultimately be more promising than additional book printing apparatuses.
In the case of the Espresso Book Machine, the literature is already available on digital files within the machine. Instead of using resources for start-up and production costs of the system, allocating that capital for making said text files more easily accessible to students would be a wiser approach, due to the increasingly computer-intensive nature of college.
Internet textbooks have already been implemented in many undergraduate courses at Carnegie Mellon. Dinesh Ayyapan, a junior mechanical engineering major, uses an Internet textbook for his Differential Equations class and noted that they “have everything you need without taking up shelf space.”
E-books can also consolidate what students carry to class and the library. First-year electrical engineering major Samantha Klonaris remarked, “The ‘E’ in e-books should stand for easy, because they are lightweight and you can access them from almost anywhere on campus.” Essentially, students could turn their laptops into Kindle-type devices, with an astounding amount of information at their fingertips.
Having such an information hub would be quite the progression from lugging around textbooks. Mass printing, which has been around for thousands of years, seems to be regressive in comparison to paperless strategies. Utilizing the growing field of technology would not only conserve paper and protect trees, but would likely be the cheapest and most convenient way to go about course supplementation.

It seems like an easy path to success: Drop out of Harvard, start a tech company, make enormous amounts of money, and then start giving it away. Bill Gates pioneered that particular lifestyle, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg seems to be following the same path, albeit a couple of decades younger. On Sept. 22, Zuckerberg announced that he was donating $100 million to the Newark, N.J. school district. We applaud this act of philanthropy as a model for executives everywhere.
The Newark school district has been trying for years to improve its graduation rates. According to the U.S. Census, in 2003 only 64 percent of adults 25 and older in the city had high school diplomas. The system’s annual budget is about $800 million, so Zuckerberg’s contribution can have a considerable effect on the futures of Newark students. His donation could enable children raised in areas of poverty and crime to succeed in school, go to college, and better their lives. 
Some critics of Zuckerberg have claimed that the donation was an effort to improve his public image before The Social Network, a film presenting a creative interpretation of the founding of Facebook, was released Friday. 
Even if critics’ accusations were true and the donation had ulterior motives, the students of Newark helped by Zuckerberg’s philanthropy probably would not care, and neither would we. In donating this money, Zuckerberg has shown an awareness of social issues and a willingness to address them that is rare in a 26-year-old.
According to Facebook spokespeople and Newark political leaders, the donation had nothing to do with The Social Network. In fact, Zuckerberg wanted to make the donation anonymously and had to be convinced otherwise by the mayor of Newark and governor of New Jersey, according to interviews in Forbes magazine.
While we have often criticized Facebook’s philosophy on privacy, we can only commend its founder’s newly apparent philosophy on philanthropy. Zuckerberg should continue to support worthy causes, and in doing so set an example for other young executives.

Campus Squeeze, a college reviews and rankings website, recently ranked Carnegie Mellon No. 5 on its list of “Ugliest Colleges in the U.S.A.” The site claims it gathers support for its rankings from online input and student opinions — for Carnegie Mellon’s ranking, a student post on a message board is quoted as saying, “I don’t think its buildings or classrooms would meet the local building codes in my town.”
While the legitimacy of this ranking may be argued — especially when other recent article headlines on the website read “Slow Motion Sneezing Is As Disgusting As It Is Hilarious” and “Yes, Naked Fat Men Make Us Want To Drink Soda” — the title of fifth-ugliest university in the country, regardless of who bestows it, should certainly give the campus administration pause as the architecture of campus buildings is considered.
With space along Forbes Avenue awaiting construction and the next decade’s master plan for campus development nearing completion, questions of building aesthetics may be more crucial now than ever. And while the issue may not be as simple as “ugly” or “beautiful,” as the Campus Squeeze article would suggest, the issue of classic beauty versus temporal appeal is worth discussion.
Buildings on campus fall squarely into two categories: those whose architecture draws on the traditional style you may expect of academic buildings (consider the College of Fine Arts or the Mellon Institute) versus those buildings whose architecture attempts to encapsulate Carnegie Mellon’s belief in innovation and breaking with accepted standards (consider Scaife Hall, with its chip-shaped roof, or Donner House, with its blue-tiled facade).
For an ideal example of the second category, take a look at Wean Hall. The concrete, parking-garage influence may have been a cutting-edge example of Brutalist architecture when the building was constructed in 1971, but today there is nothing inspiring about the design — except maybe the dreams of transformation associated with its bottle-cap-filled holes.
If Wean was once considered to be the peak of innovative architecture, only to descend to the most-despised building on campus, we can only imagine what future generations of Carnegie Mellon students will say about the Gates Hillman Complex.
