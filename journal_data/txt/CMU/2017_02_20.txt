With one final game left to play in his Carnegie Mellon basketball career, senior forward Jack Serbin is ready to finish with a bang. A leader on the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team, Serbin leads the team in points per game (17.2), rebounds per game (11.6), and assists per game (2.2). “It’s been a blast and I’ve loved every second of it,” he said in an interview with The Tartan.
Growing up in Columbus, OH, Serbin has been playing basketball since the first grade along with several other sports, including baseball, football, and soccer.
It wasn’t until high school that he made the decision to focus solely on basketball. Serbin had always wanted to play basketball at the collegiate level.
He came to Carnegie Mellon because of the opportunity to play and to be in the Tepper School of Business’s finance program. “I was kind of able [to hit] two birds with one stone by coming to Carnegie Mellon,” he said.
Balancing academics and basketball, especially with a traveling schedule, has been really hard for Serbin.
“I’ve been balancing sports and school my whole life, but never really realized how hard it can be,” he said. “You need to manage your time really well.”
Earlier this month, Serbin was named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Athlete of the Week for the third time this basketball season. He attributes his success to his teammates and coaches. “They’ve helped me so much throughout my career to not only become a better player but a better teammate. If it weren’t for my teammates I wouldn’t be able to do what I do on the court. It’s really all to them.”
For Serbin, mental toughness comes with practice and experience. Because he has played basketball his whole life, he has faced almost every court scenario imaginable and draws from his experience to make split-second decisions. “Being mentally tough comes from experience, having been there before, knowing how to act and how to keep your composure. Especially for me as a senior mental toughness comes with time and experience.”
After graduation, Serbin will be working for a private equity firm in New York City. “As I enter the professional world, I’m not too worried about having a good career. I think that will take care of itself as I work hard.” Serbin hopes to stay in touch with his teammates and the friends he has made here at Carnegie Mellon. “I want to maintain those relationships as I get older because at the end of the day I think that relationships with your friends and your family are way more important than any success you may have in your career.”
As Serbin rounds out his basketball and academic careers at Carnegie Mellon, he reflected on how great the experience has been, and how much he’s loved playing basketball here. “If I could go back and do it all again I’d do it in a heartbeat.” At the same time, he is also excited to see how the team develops in the coming years. “I’m excited to come back and cheer on the team,” he promises.
Even though after graduation he will not play basketball competitively, Serbin says basketball will continue to have a presence in his life, and plans to join a league wherever he ends up. “I love playing the game,” he said. “I plan on playing for as long as I can.”
Serbin and the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team will conclude their 2016–2017 season this Saturday, Feb. 25, at UAA rival Case Western Reserve University.

Life presents a series of challenges to tackle, overcome, and move past. For senior sprinter and mid-distance runner Ariel Tian, her choices in sports and academics define her desire to continuously pursue and conquer new challenges to improve herself to be the best she can be.
Rather than remain content with what she has already achieved, the computer science major with a creative writing minor from Acton, MA always has her eyes looking forward to the next opportunity for improvement.
“It just kind of happened,” Tian said regarding how she first got into sports.
“I did soccer and figure skating when I was really young. When I was eight, I started swimming competitively.”
It wasn’t until she reached high school that she reached the sport she would pursue in college. “My sophomore year in high school I started track.”
At first, the sport was for fun since she enjoys partaking in physical activities in her free time, but she soon began to view the sport as the next challenge she wanted to pursue. “One thing that happens in sports is that you hit a plateau, and that’s what happened to me in swimming. I thought I had more potential in track.”
Tian gives her craft a year round commitment. “Track trains all year round. In the fall, we don’t have meets, so we train to stay in shape and get better. In the winter, we go to Pitt since they have an indoor track.”
She added that the team would appreciate getting an indoor track to reduce the travelling they must do. “In the spring, it’s hectic. It’s a couple hours a day, sometimes longer. We have to go to a lot of places.”
While the physical training is something Tian is used to, she feels that the mental preparations are just as, if not more, important. “Getting ready for meets, most of it is mental. You get to a certain point where you know what to expect. It’s not pretty. You know you have to fight, push through, and beat your own times. Once you get over that anxiety, everything follows.”
The determination to push through and succeed carries through into her academic life. Describing her college application process as “semi-random,” she pursued many schools and programs from various disciplines.
“The computer science program was the best program I got accepted to, period.” Though she hadn’t specialized in learning computer science, Tian described herself as ready to take on the challenge. “I feel like I was one of the more well-balanced people. Even though I wasn’t particularly good with computer science, I chose it, and it turned out to be a very good choice.”
Tian is not the type of person to gush over her previous awards and accomplishments. When asked, she never even hinted at the indoor school record in the 4x400-meter relay during her junior year, the outdoor school record in the 4x100-meter relay and the 4x800-meter relay during her sophomore year, or even placing third in the 4x100-meter relay at the 2014-15 University Athletic Association (UAA) Outdoor Championships.
Rather, she singled out the process that drives her each and every time she steps out onto the track. “In sports, I think it’s pretty easy to say that time I got my best time as my proudest accomplishment. But I would say, sometimes when you line up, you get overwhelmed with doubt. It’s scary to go out and always try to beat the marks you’ve already set. Whenever I get on the line and overcome that doubt, that makes me feel very accomplished.”
She did, however, point out a time she won a coloring contest that netted a trip to Disney World as a singular accomplishment she was proud of, highlighting the fact that Tian is far more than just a runner.
In keeping to her view of constantly pursuing the next challenge, she expressed that her goals were things she likely would never accomplish but would nevertheless continue to pursue.
“Someone once told me you need to have soft and hard goals. Hard goals are very specific and tangible. I want to reach this time. I want to break a minute in the 400[-meter dash]. I think what really keeps you in check are the soft goals. You can’t really finish them, and they keep you going when you reach your hard goals. I want to stay fit or I want to contribute more to the team. These are things you keep working on. You’re never really finished.”
Tian and the Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team continue their season this Saturday, Feb. 25, at the UAA Indoor Championships at Brandeis University.

Conspiracy theories have been around for a very long time, usually kept under wraps since people are smart enough to not make public beliefs contradicted by scientific evidence. Still, in this age of alternative facts and fake news, conspiracy theorists can find a space for themselves, especially when a public figure gives them a voice in the public sphere.
On a Friday, Feb. 17 appearance on the Road Trippin' podcast, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving took part in an interview that led to the discussion of various conspiracy theories.
Some of the beliefs that he had were not so strange; for instance, the belief that "there are extraterrestrial beings that exist in the universe" is one that many scientists are eager to find evidence for, studying how modern bacteria could possibly survive on Mars and analyzing fossilized bacteria from an ancient Martian meteorite.
Other theories he expressed were considerably much less mainstream, including his belief that the CIA assassinated singer-songwriter, musician, and guitarist Bob Marley because "he tried to bring people together and the fact that it was fundamentally built on love and truth and we kill people for doing the right thing like that." Suspicions surrounding the treatment of a toe injury that later developed cancer have led some to believe that the CIA was after Marley for his potential to influence the future leader of Jamaica. The "proof" to back up the theory is entirely unsubstantiated.
The theory that seemed to land most headlines was his firm belief that "the Earth is flat. For what I’ve known for many years and what I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that — can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these ‘planets’ and stuff like this.” Evidently, the concept of gravitational pull is something that has eluded Irving, as the physics behind gravity and orbits has been proven since the days of Sir Isaac Newton. The very fact that gravity is constant throughout the planet is because the distance between the surface of the planet and the core is always essentially the same, which is not possible for a flat Earth, but most certainly is a property of a round one.
This leads to a separate question. For what reason would there be to perpetuate a round Earth if the concept of a flat Earth had lasted all the way through to the Renaissance? Irving doesn't seem to have an answer for that, focusing instead of the modern implications of a round Earth conspiracy. "I have a very firm belief that what they’re putting out in front of us is there for a reason. It just depends on whether you want to believe in the truth or not. The fact that they can make all these movies with alien descriptions, they’re not just going on strictly brainpower and this is just creative things that we’re going to put out to everybody."
Irving is suggesting that humans aren't creative enough to imagine what an alien looks like but are able to create a massive conspiracy to propagate an incorrect round Earth.
Naturally, photos taken from space would seem to disprove the flat Earth theory even for fervent believers; however, Irving also believes that humans have never actually gone into space. "The fact that his footprints don’t look the same comparatively to the boot that is in the museum is ridiculous. I look at this stuff all the time. His boot print is not the same, so you want me to really sit back after you proved it — they have a picture of it and his boot side by side — I need an explanation."
The supposed contradiction Irving believes in can be explained by the boots worn over the suit, which do match the print on the moon.
No matter how much scientific evidence and arguments we develop, there will always be conspiracies, backed up by any combination of hearsay, pseudoscience, and religious teachings.
Still, there is merit in examining some of the absurd beliefs that people have had and continue to have.

Two weeks ago, Farewell Spit in northern New Zealand saw one of its largest whale strandings ever. More than 650 pilot whales became stuck on a beach, leading to 400 of them dying. Whale strandings are common at Farewell Spit, and residents see trapped whales every year. Nonetheless, the numbers this year were unprecedented and shocked conservation officials. Whale strandings are caused by their navigational mistakes. They may follow the wrong currents that push them into shallow waters or make directional mistakes while chasing prey or escaping predators. 250 of the whales successfully made it back into the deep waters, refloated by locals and officials.
Unfortunately, many more could not be saved and had to be euthanized. Others became stranded again after returning to the beach; officials monitored the saved whales swimming nearby the beach. Large trucks transported about 200 of the whale carcasses to dunes a mile away, where they will rot. Unfortunately, the trucks could not reach some parts of the beach. The inaccessible carcasses will simply be left. 
Andrew Lamason, an operations manager for the Depart of Conservation, admitted that leaving the whales in the water would make them rot faster, but would also place visitors of the beach in danger. Lamason said in a New York Times article “There is nothing attractive about these whales after they have
been on the beach for a few days. All their internal organs have exploded, the skin has peeled off, the smell is unbelievable...unbelievable.” Since internal gas can cause the whale organs and bodies to explode, officials punctured the whales to let the gas out. Pathologists at Massey University in New Zealand will study how exactly the whales died and organic processes that occur after their deaths.
Locals and tourists came in large numbers to help with the excavation and re-floating of the whales. They were warned about the dangers of dealing with whales. When they become agitated, they can easily injure of kill a human with the flick of a tail or fin. As unfortunate as this stranding is, pilot whales are not considered endangered. 
There are about one million long-finned and 200,000 short-finned pilot whales worldwide. Short-finned pilot whales, the type that ended up on New Zealand’s beaches, inhabit the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Longfinned pilot whales prefer much cooler waters and can be found in the Northern Atlantic.
The large-scale death of so many pilot whales is reminiscent of the Faroe Island whaling tradition. The thousand-year-old tradition involves driving pilot whales into a bay where participants kill them in the water, often turning the entire bay red with blood. The tradition has come under fire and public
outrage time and time again. 
Locals defend the practice,saying it is primarily for food. Pilot whales are protected under the MMPA (Marine Mammal Protection Act) worldwide. Unlike the Faroe Island tradition, the whale stranding was not caused by humans and was much less bloody. New Zealand currently has no method to stop strandings.

Popular cult movie series like The Terminator or Mission Impossible rely heavily on allowing their characters to gain extra information via super-vision gadgets, bionic contact lenses that analyze their environment and display updates to them as they interact with the real world. This idea of gaining or changing information as one perceives it is augmented reality (AR).
AR is the technology that layers the perceived world of a user with extra components that enhance their experience. It processes the world perceived by the user in real-time to add to or modify its components, such as adding visual or auditory elements. For example, Pokémon Go uses augmented real mapping to allow its users to catch Pokémon in the real world. Online dressing rooms for e-shopping sites and online make-up testers let users test products virtually using AR. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), which is a part of the Integrative Design, Arts and Technology (IDeATe) Network, has been studying interactive agents as a part of AR, and how AR differs from virtual reality. Drew Davidson, the director of ETC, said in a press release "Augmented reality is in some ways potentially more immersive than virtual reality … I think AR is opening up these new potential ways to think about and develop these [virtual reality] games."
Researchers at the ETC have been worked on two projects, namely MixAR and Everywhere Music. Both of these projects use Microsoft’s HoloLens, a self-contained, holographic computer, to execute AR.
MixAR [https://www.etc.cmu.edu/blog/projects/mixar/] uses an interactive agent, named Mixy. Mixy, a spherical robot that floats in the user’s reality, is supposed to have a strong emotional presence and was created with the intention of making users interact directly with the AR in a physical space and evoking emotional responses in the user. According to MixAr’s website, the team is interested in “learning where an agent can be most useful and where it simply gets in the way.”
Everywhere Music is an AR-Assisted Piano Improvisation tool allows users to ‘perform live with a band’, have interactive theory and piano lesson. Users access the AR via glasses that enable them to view a guiding keyboard over their own instrument, which they then follow. 
Will Hagan, a student at the ETC and the producer for the MixAR team, says, "The power of AR isn't to radically change our lives, but to make us better at what we already can do." He continues, "Right now the field is truly in its infancy… Imagine a paramedic arriving at an accident with an augmented reality device that can provide all the vitals of an unconscious individual, saving them the moments they may need to prevent that person's death. Dramatic perhaps, but one of the best examples of how we could use augmented reality to improve our society right now."

In the early 1980s, Hideo Kodama of the Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute developed and implemented advanced methods of printing that were able to construct 3D objects out of plastic polymers. The processes were revolutionary and were the basis for a large shift in the manufacturing and engineering industry today. The techniques became known in industry as additive manufacturing (AM) and are more commonly referred to today as 3D printing.
Kodama figured out a way to expose certain areas of photo-hardening polymer to ultraviolet (UV) rays and wash away the unhardened polymer. What’s left behind after the wash is the hardened 3D structure. The most difficult challenge in developing these techniques is finding a way to accurately and precisely restrict the material’s UV exposure. The 3D structure to be printed is first diagrammed and prototyped as a collection of extremely thin, 2D cross sections. Today, computer-aided design (CAD) software is capable of slicing 3D models into the required 2D segments. After individual diagrams of each 2D layer is prepared, the exposure process can begin. An extremely thin layer of the hardening polymer is laid down, and a selective laser maps out and hardens areas of the polymer as per the diagram. A second thin layer of the hardening polymer is added directly over top of the layer just previous, hence the term “additive manufacturing”. This process of layering and lasering is continued, sometimes repeated thousands of times, gradually producing the 3D structure from the bottom up. 
Photo-hardening polymers used by Kodama and others could only be used to form plastic objects, not metal. Until the 1990s, all metal-working techniques, such as casting or welding, were subtractive in nature; material was removed from a stock, not added, until the desired shape is reached. The lack of stability and longevity in large plastic objects prompted researchers and engineers to look for ways to apply AM techniques to metal. By the late 1990s, engineers at Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University developed ways to deposit metals and other materials so that they can be assembled additively. These developments, coupled with the improvement of 3D printers themselves, meant that more durable, long-lasting products could be created. As a result, 3D-printed structures aren’t restricted to prototyping and are now used for end-of-the-line consumer goods and products.
One of the largest improvements on the AM process in the last decade has been focused on the back end of creating the 3D model. The accuracy and precision of each round of “printing” relies heavily on the accuracy and precision of the digital model that is sent to the 3D printer or other additive machining device. Improvements in computer-aided design software have made 3D printing a much more seamless process. In the last decade, these improvements have allowed engineers to redefine existing printing processes and introduce a variety of new techniques.
Of the many methods used in practice and industry today, the most popular are Stereolithography (SLA), Binder Jetting, Fused Filament Fabrication and Extrusion, and Powder Bed Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). The latter is closely related to Kodama’s original technique.
SLA utilizes liquid ultraviolet resin that, much like Kodama’s plastic polymer, solidifies when exposed to UV laser beams. Rather than laying out thin sheets of polymer, the liquid is poured into a large vat, and the laser is directly toward the bottom of the vat. The laser solidifies the necessary shape and works its way slowly upward to create the full structure.
Binder Jetting also uses a powder polymer base material that is thinned out into 2D layers. Rather than using a laser like the other methods, Binder Jetting uses a liquid binding adhesive that is piped out through a jet nozzle. Material science engineers have been able to adapt the Binding Jetting method and use it to pipe out molten glass into ornate glass figures.
Fused Fabrication employs a jet nozzle like Binder Jetting, but rather than using a liquid adhesive it utilizes two separate materials. The first material is dissolvable, and the second material is not. The jet nozzle passes over a grid, and at each grid location it deposits one of the materials. Using CAD data, the printer determines where to deposit the dissolvable support material and where to deposit the material that will solidify into the final product. After the object is fully printed and hardens, it is soaked in a solution that dissolves away the support material and leaves behind the desired shape.
What started out as an efficient way to rapidly assemble plastic, back-end prototypes has emerged as an industrial, top-of-the-line technique for researchers, designers, and engineers on a global scale. Additive manufacturing is a quickly growing field and its promise and potential are far-reaching — from the 3D printing of nanoscale medical devices to large scale art installations to the rapid assembly of computer hardware. It is likely that the next big break for additive manufacturing is scientists ability to 3D print functioning human tissues for medical use. The future of additive manufacturing is on the rise — literally.

Carnegie Mellon researchers found that married people are healthier than their single, divorced, or widowed counterparts. The study, published in Pyschoneuroendocrinolgy, showed that married people have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol than people who were never married. This is the first biological study to confirm the claim that has long been circulated.
Over three non-consecutive days, researchers collected saliva samples from 572 healthy adults between the age of 21 and 55. The samples were then tested for cortisol. Researchers also compared daily cortisol rhythm, which peak sharply after waking up and gradually fall during the day; married participants displayed a faster decline than their unmarried counterparts. Faster declines are associated with reduced heart disease and increased cancer survival.
"It is exciting to discover a physiological pathway that may explain how relationships influence health and disease," said Brian Chin, a Ph.D. student in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, in a Carnegie Mellon press release. Sheldon Cohon, a professor of psychology at Robert E. Doherty University, added "These data provide important insight into the way in which our intimate social relationships can get under the skin to influence our health."
These results demonstrate how social constructs can affect our biology. However, the study does not fully conclude that marriage leads to increase health. After all, the researchers' sample population was strictly comprised of healthy individuals.
The publication of the research was funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Chin conducted the research along with Michael Murphy, a Carnegie Mellon post-doctoral researcher, and Denise Janicki-Deverts of the University of Pittsburgh.

Science has a messaging problem. Science is often corrupted in public perception so the general populace gains completely false beliefs that they attribute to science. In the opposite direction, some scientific consensuses are viewed as political or treated with outright denial rather than healthy skepticism. Scientists, who often rely on public funding and therefore goodwill with much of the nation, must communicate effectively and positively with the public. Groups like the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Park Service have been stripped of their ability to communicate with the public and other scientists. The problem has gotten so bad that scientists are planning to march in protest of the current president's actions. Pugwash discussed what is causing this disconnect between science and parts of the public and what might fix it.
One of the primary problems with communication science faces is that media often covers science extremely poorly. Often, reporters do not understand what the study actually says and end up reporting a flashy part of a bit of research, completely corrupting the research along the way. John Oliver has already completely blown up his spot for this, but Al Roker once famously said "I think the way to live your life is you find the study that sounds best to you and you go with that." This shows how badly parts of the media misunderstand science. Cherry picking your results is a recipe for bad results. However, because the mainstream media will pick up stories from science media, they’re often reporting on single studies. This is not how science is designed to work, and it causes incorrect information to flow through the public.
Many examples of single studies wreaking havoc on society exist. The famous study linking vaccines to autism has been roundly discredited, but it continues to be a driving force behind the anti-vaccination movement. Similar things happen with climate change research. These lead to decisions that are bad for public safety.
Some of this is an internal problem. Null results are essential to make sure that false positives don’t cause us to gain false beliefs. However, null results often don’t get published in papers. This leads to several outcomes, all of which are problematic. The first is p-hacking, where scientists change their data analysis to get “statistically significant” results from their data and prove their point. This leads to incorrect or misleading information being published. The second is that false positives should happen no matter what due to statistical noise. If 20 scientists perform an experiment and there has no relationship between the variables they are measuring, one of them would be expected to get a significant result. This would be the result most likely to be published, and selection bias creates bad science. This is further compounded by the fact that it’s harder to publish reproductions of other studies, so false positives end up being the final say on a topic. This means that when facts get misreported, it can be difficult to try and publish evidence to the contrary.
Communication of science can be improved by making sure everyone has the tools necessary to interpret basic scientific facts. Understanding that results are not certainty but evidence in favor of a conclusion and other knowledge of the scientific method could be extremely effective in helping people understand the science necessary to make decisions in their day to day lives.
In addition, inspiring the public through science can help make more people interested in pursuing scientific research on their own. NASA’s moon launch inspired a generation of scientists; something similar could help science strike a more positive chord with people today. This could help scientists more effectively fulfill their role of inching closer to completing the public's knowledge of the natural world.

NASA picks concludes poop challenge
On Oct. 16, 2016, NASA opened the Space Poop Challenge to the general public, tasking participants to come up with an innovative way for astronauts to relieve themselves while in their spacesuits. Astronauts spend several hours performing extra-vehicular walks, meaning they do not have access to restroom facilities for extended periods of time. The poop challenge was NASA’s way of addressing this inconvenience. On Wednesday, five ideas were chosen, and the winners received a $30,000 prize. The ideas came from two doctors, a dentist, a product designer, and an engineer.
Spacesuits currently use diapers to solve the problem, which are more than uncomfortable for the occupant. In fact, suit designs have not changed much since the Apollo missions — a consequence of the massive budget cuts the federal space program has seen over the decade.
The winning idea, courtesy of Air Force officer and flight surgeon Thatcher Cardon, draws inspiration from minimally invasive surgical techniques. It uses an airlock disposal mechanism and allows the occupant to change his or her underwear while in the suit. Complementing this ingenious idea are the slender spacesuits Boeing unveiled last month, which make movement is the suits much more unrestricted. An era of comfortable space exploration may be upon us.

Nokia is re-releasing the 3310
Often referred to as the most reliable phone, the Nokia 3310 will be re-released in 2017. It will be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress later this month. Initially launched in 2000, the phone was a success thanks to its relatively cheap price, efficient battery, small size, and tremendous ability to withstand impact (which spawned an internet meme).
Nokia is hoping to tap into the nostalgia of the millions that used the phone in the early 2000s. The revamp of the 3310 will be sold for only about $60; this will also provide a viable connectivity option for poorer regions of the world, as the phone will be powered by modern processing chips and cellular antennas. 
After 2007 and the introduction of the wildly successful iPhone, Nokia struggled to keep up with the smart phone tide. The company was sold to Microsoft soon after, and spend subsequent years releasing retro versions of its most successful phones, such as the Nokia 215. Nokia also ventured into the smartphone sphere, although its sales there were dwarfed by the likes of Apple and Samsung. Perhaps, this is its chance to rise to the top once again.

Winston Churchill’s wrote about aliens
In an unearthed essay written by the former prime minister of Britain Winston Churchill, the leader pondered the existence of extraterrestrial life. Churchill sent the essay, titled “Are We Alone in the Universe?” to his publisher on Oct. 16, 1939, a month after Britain entered World War II.
His essay displays his deep thought about the topic.  Scientists say Churchill approaches the discussion about extraterrestrial life in a scientific and sophisticated manner, impressing them with his strong reasoning — reasoning quite similar to that of modern scientists concerned with alien life. Churchill writes “I am not sufficiently conceited to think my sun is the only one with a family of planets.” He is correct in saying this, as the probability of life on earth being alone in the universe is extremely low.
Historians believe the essay is inspired by Churchill’s early exposure to science-fiction and academic literature such as ‘War of the Worlds’ by H. G. Wells and ‘On the Origin of Species’ by Charles Darwin. Over his lifetime, Churchill wrote over 30 million words, including African travelogues and a book on oil painting. Thus, it comes as no surprise that he found time to write about aliens while dealing with a world war.

Student designs bee-like drones
Reminiscent of a ‘Black Mirror’ episode, a bee robot project has been started by Savannah College of Art industrial design student Anna Haldewang. Inspired by a challenge posed by her professor as well as the need to highlight the necessity of bees in agriculture, Haldewang designed a miniature robot that sucks up pollen and transfers it to other plants, just like bees do. It is wittingly called the Plan Bee project. 
The drone consists of a small foam body to make it light, as well as propellers to keep it airborne. Minute holes at the bottom of the body suck pollen in and drop it out. The drone looks nothing like a bee and the pollinating action does not rely on mechanics or electronics.
A patent has already been submitted, and Haldewang hopes to have a market-ready product in two years. The primary use of Plan Bee will be as an educational tool, since it will allow people to actively monitor how pollination occurs. Many see much grander uses of the drone, such as in large-scale farming. However, the dystopian future depicted in ‘Black Mirror’  is far off.

Drone taxis are now a reality in Dubai
Dubai is the first city to test drone taxis on the public. The drone taxis are no bigger than a smart car and can only fit one person with luggage (all below 220 lbs). The drones will have a travel radius of about 31 miles and reach maximum speeds of 62 miles per hour. The rider simply sits in the taxi and enters the final destination — no flight is performed manually.
The iron taxi will certainly not replace the traditional road taxi, especially since it only fits a single person. Nonetheless, if the trial is to succeed, it will have major implications on transport in Dubai — which has some of the deadliest roads — and around the world. Congestion is on the rise in many cities with the rise in car ownership, so the drone taxi is a possible solution. The pilotless drone will also dramatically reduce labor costs for companies. Its no wonder Uber is looking into flying cars.

iPhone 8 will be radically different
A new leak has confirmed suspicions that Apple’s next iPhone will be radically different. In a memo obtained by 9to5Mac — a website dedicated to all things Apple — top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed many new features that will most-likely be present on the next iPhone. 
The first and most obvious change will be the removal of the home button. It will be replaced with a ‘functionality area’, much like the Touch Bar on the latest MacBooks. It will adapt to whatever the user is doing and display the appropriate buttons and information.
The display is also seeing a major upgrade. The screen will not have a bezel, making it a whopping 5.8 inches and curved glass at the edges. The display will use OLED (organic light-emitting diodes), which produces richer and more distinct colors, especially in naturally and darkly lit places.
To add to this, Touch ID may be no more. Apple might replace the security measure with other biometric checks like iris scanning or face recognition. The phone will probably be announced this September, and available for shipping in October.

Walnut Street is a popular place to go shop and eat, and it also has its share of bars. One in particular, Mario's East Side Saloon, is a popular place for people to go hang out, drink, and throw a few darts until the patrons pack the place so tightly they start spilling out the front door. Thursday night was a weeknight, so the bar was a bit quieter and we decided that would be a good place to check out.
The location: Walnut Street has multiple other bars and restaurants, so it’s a decent place for bar hopping. Will Penn, The Yard, Stack’d, and Steel Cactus are all within a block and the latter three serve food until late if you get the munchies. It’s easy to get to by bus since Walnut is nestled nicely between the 71B and D on Fifth and the 75 on Ellsworth. That said, it’s also within walking distance from campus and just about anywhere in Shadyside.
The drinks: One of Mario's most famous features is the shot wheel. If you don't feel like deciding on a drink yourself, you can leave the process to fate. Some of the shots on there are wonderful. Of course, because luck is a stupid way to order a drink, we scored some gin, which was decidedly not wonderful. The bartender was nice about it and said some lime makes it “not too bad,” which is true if you’re me and enjoy gin, but not true if you’re one of the approximately seven billion people who don’t like gin. If you have better luck, you might end up with a really good drink. My personal favorite is the black and gold, but they have birthday cake shots and a shot that actually tastes like a pretzel. If you have worse luck, though, you might get iced.
The vibe: Winter is the hockey season, so Mario’s is truly a sports bar on weekends. It’s a great place to catch a Penguins game. During the rest of the year, they have an outdoor deck which is a nice place to grab a few drinks and look over Walnut Street. If you catch them on a Monday, it’s karaoke night, which is always a fun time.
Mario’s works best for bringing out large groups of friends. The design with the tables in addition to the bar means people section off into their groups, but if it’s not a weeknight, it’s usually too loud to sit and have a conversation.
Lit or nah: Mario's is a great bar and falls pretty firmly into the lit category even though we just had a couple shots of straight gin and hung out for a bit. You can go with a bunch of friends, get a dope drink you never knew about from the shot wheel, have a few drinks, and have a great time and it will be lit. This is why Mario’s is so popular and full on the weekends. Monday is also a big night because of the karaoke, which tends to be a blast whether you participate or are just present in the bar to watch those brave enough to try.
We’re just two people, though, so some space to sit and talk is nice. The bar can be crowded on nights with events like karaoke and trivia on Thursdays, but afterwards and on other weeknights Mario’s is a good place for going out with a friend. It’s quiet enough that you can sit down and talk in the ample seating or go have a more bar type experience next to the bar itself.
With all the different things happening on different nights and different times of year, Mario's is a fun bar and a good one to head to if you're looking to spend a night out.

Dear Ruth,
With each weekend comes yet another challenge. It’s the time when college students ditch responsibilities, forget that annoying Monday night deadline, coordinate Ubers, and head out.
There’s just one problem, though. I don’t drink, and my friends are desperately trying to change my mind. In high school I always pulled out the classic “My parents will totally freak out, dude.” But now I’m in college, so gone are the days of pinning it on my parents.
I do enjoy going to parties. It just seems like everyone around me is drinking, and I feel pressured to join in. I try to meet my friends half way by joining in and using water instead of alcohol, but it doesn’t usually appease them. I’m firm in my beliefs and I don’t want to start drinking. But I need help on trying to navigate the party scene.
Best, 
Seriously Over Being Endlessly Ridiculed
Dear SOBER,
For as often as CMU students like to joke about how nerd and socially-awkward we are, our party scene is surprisingly strong. And pretty awesome, so no one should have to miss out on having fun with their friends if they want to. With that in mind, let’s talk about some practical strategies you can use to avoid drinking:
— There’s usually juice or soda as a mixer. Put one of those in a red solo cup — people don’t usually ask what you’re drinking, and even if they do you can say there’s a shot of vodka or something in there.
— Say you’re on meds that restrict drinking, your family has a history of alcoholism, or you’re a designated driver. Basically, say anything that people will accept as an outside reason of your not drinking.
But here’s the thing: none of the options should actually be necessary. No one should ever pressure anyone into drinking if they don’t want to. If a friend doesn’t understand that, well, do you remember those “I feel” statements they teach in middle school? Try sitting them down (when sober) and explaining that you don’t want to drink and that it bothers you when they can’t understand that. Then, give them a chance to learn, if they can’t — well, then I would think about whether you want to continue partying with them.
There’s another layer to this question, though. It sounds like at least some of the pressure for you to join in on the alcoholic reindeer-games is self-inflicted. Which really — who can blame you? The vast majority of college-related media revolves around drinking, and while there are always stories of “college drinking gone wrong”, even those assume that drinking is inevitable. (Not to mention the usual message that gettin’ crunk is the best way to be cool, and anyone who doesn’t drink is a stuck-up fundamentalist weirdo.)
Drinking at parties is usually the expectation. Going against expectations is always going to be harder than going with them. If you genuinely want to drink? Great! Find a friend to keep an eye on you, go in moderation, and live your life. But if you don’t? Then stand by your decision. Your choice is valid and totally reasonable, so don’t let anyone — even yourself — convince you otherwise.
Sincerely,
Ruth

It’s about that time in the semester, where the only things on people’s minds are midterms and projects. Most of us are probably spending our days in our dorms or in the library, hunched over textbooks while munching on Pop-tarts or chips. It’s important that we use the weekends (or really any free time we have), to relax, treat ourselves, and take our minds off of all the work. I mean, that is what weekends are for — to have fun with others and eat real food. A great place to do just that is Mercurio’s in Shadyside. 
Mercurio’s is a small family-owned Italian restaurant that is known for its wood-fired Neapolitan pizza and gelatos. On Friday nights, the place is usually packed, with people even waiting outside to be called in for a seat. My friend and I were amongst those people, where we had to wait about 45 minutes, but it was all fine thanks to the many comfy cafes to sit in and little stores to look at around Walnut Street. The area itself is cute and very nice to walk around, with benches scattered throughout the strip for those who’d want to sit outside and enjoy the view. 
Once my friend and I were at our seats, we both noticed how lively the social environment was in the restaurant. There were many young customers and families, chatting and enjoying themselves over wine and pizza. The setting was very comfortable and friendly, with a bit of a classy vibe as well. The tables were all neatly set, with a fresh rose decoration on the side. The walls were painted a nice yellow that complemented the wooden floors, and portraits were hung up throughout the place. The most important aspect of the restaurant, however, one that added to its classiness, was the food.
Mercurio’s has a variety of items on its menu, from paninis, to salads, to pizza. My friend and I decided to order their Bianco and Oliva pizzas. The Bianco had fresh mozzarella, parmesan, basil, and olive oil on it, while the Oliva was essentially a margherita pizza with parmesan and olives.  At Mercurio’s, a whole pizza is about the size of a large plate, so it satisfies just one person. Our food was served to us about ten minutes after we ordered, and both our pizzas were presented very nicely. The colors of the tomatoes and basil on top of the warm and freshly-made crust looked too good to eat. Amazingly enough, the pizza tasted just as good as it looked. The ingredients were all fresh, not very greasy, and everything was easy to eat. When my friend and I were finished, we certainly did not feel any bit of guilt for eating pizza. 
Since Mercurio’s is also known for their gelato, my friend and I decided to order some for ourselves. They make batches of their homemade gelato every day, and there are so many flavors to choose from. In the end, my friend and I ordered their mocha chip and pistachio gelato. The gelato was creamy and delectable and were definitely nice finishing touches to our meals that night. 
Overall, I had a very satisfying experience at Mercurio’s. The prices are reasonable, the service is great, and the food is delicious! It’s a very comfortable place where you can spend time with friends and really feel at home. The restaurant is even far enough from campus where you and a couple of people can get away and focus on relaxing and having fun. So the next time you feel like treating yourself, head over to Shadyside and stop by Mercurio’s.

According to the dictionary of obscure sorrows, the word ‘sonder’ means, “the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own — populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness — an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”  
As such, this word was perfect not only as a theme for this year’s Lunar Gala (LG), Carnegie Mellon’s annual all-student-run fashion show, but also for my experience of watching the show. Lunar Gala every year is a spectacle of astounding dresses, phenomenal dancers, amazing visuals, great music, and production quality that rivals those of professionally run fashion shows. This year was no different: the show not only lived up to my expectations but gave rise to the sudden realization that I was surrounded by such talented peers here at Carnegie Mellon. Lunar Gala involves three main components: the fashion lines, the dances, and the overall show elements like the music and visuals. 
All the fashion lines this year were amazing, but the ones that stood out to me were États, Summer’s Mourning, Alumni Line, Assimilate, and Humanesque. États, designed by social and decision sciences senior Joanne Lo and business administration senior Lynn Kim was one of the edgiest and most innovative works I saw at the show - it involved exploring various states of matter using zip tie modules. Summer’s Mourning was another line that stood out to me. In this line the narration, the music, and the clothes all came together to represent the designer, global systems and managment and fine art senior Lanre Ad’s, loss. I appreciated the Alumni Line because each of the creations were so amazing and phenomenal I heard the crowd gasp in awe as soon as the models sporting the line walked out onto the runway. Also, the line Assimilate designed by electrical and computer engineering juniors Ananya Chandra, Ranjini Narayan, and Sarika Bajaj stood out to me because it incorporated designs and patterns from India into western clothing, which coming from India but having grown up in a more western atmosphere felt extremely familiar. Lastly, I liked the line Humanesque designed by business administration and modern language junior Emily Hirao and business administration juniors AJ Jeffs and Amy Yang because of the watercolor look of their designs.
After the show, I got the opportunity to speak with one of the designers of this line, Emily Hirao. Upon asking her why she wanted to design for Lunar Gala, she said, “after looking at Lunar Gala I really enjoyed the amount of creativity that I saw and thought that it would personally push me to be more creative and to think of a different industry as a person.” In addition, I asked her about why Lunar Gala matters to the Carnegie Mellon community, to which she responded, “It helps to bring together people to show the creativity of [Carnegie Mellon]. We see different designs, for example one, [the Assimilate line] was by three different electrical and computer engineering students, and it had a lot of circuitry involved with lot of LED lights, and also involved structural integrity, as well as being very creative by using Indian garments. I think it just helps to show that we’re a multi-faceted university.” 
I talked to one of the LG dancers, Molly Chou, a senior business administration and statistics double major, who also took part in Lunar Gala as a model. She said, “Dance was the best, I knew all the dancers, and one of my best friends choreographed, and it was awesome.” This was Molly’s third time dancing at Lunar Gala and second time modeling. I asked her what made here return time and time again to Lunar Gala, “LG is known to be the biggest [Carnegie Mellon] event. Someone asked me today, like one of the makeup people, they were like oh do you guys have a fashion school here and I was like no. Everyone who does this is like [computer science], bio, and design, and everyone comes together, I think it’s crazy how it’s all student run. Yeah, it is kind of insane.” 
After understanding their roles better, I asked them why they thought LG mattered and why the average fashion unconscious student, aka me, should show up to Lunar Gala. Le responded by saying, “It’s just really exciting 'cause it’s a completely student run show, and from the performers and models and dancers, and people who create the show, it’s all students, and a lot of people friends, and it’s just really exciting to see something that was created by people your age and I think in general the show is just very like visually, it’s really fun to watch, and it’s just a lot of different things, and we really try to make it more than a fashion show. It’s really for artists to showcase their talents and for dancers, and for visual artists, all the visuals that the creative team creates, are a big part of the experience as well.” 
If you aren’t convinced about the awesomeness of Lunar Gala yet and why you should make it a habit to attend every show while you’re here at Carnegie Mellon, let me tell you my reasons for going to the show. One was obviously so that I could write this article and show myself as a fashion connoisseur. (Also, maybe because the passes were free. Press seating is great, you don’t even have to stand in line. But don’t tell anyone that.) The main reason was to see all my amazing peers across all fields come together and work so hard to create a show that is so interdisciplinary and unique that it could only exist at Carnegie Mellon. So please, next year, remember to attend and be blown away by Lunar Gala and give your friends less shit for not hanging out with you and instead spending countless hours putting on the spectacle that is Lunar Gala.

This month’s Third Thursday was a celebration of Iris van Herpen’s extraordinary, otherworldly fashion designs. Known for her sculptural, futuristic pieces and frequent use of unconventional materials, Van Herpen is a Dutch designer who has dressed the likes of Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and Björk. She interned with Alexander McQueen before starting her own label in 2007, and this exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art is part of her first ever North American tour. Her exhibit features 15 of her fashion lines, with pieces that range from textured and rigid to ephemeral and delicate. Her pieces strike a chord that rings both modern and ornate; she pushes the envelope to the point where her designs seem almost from an alternate universe.
The event also focused on Van Herpen’s use of unconventional materials and invited attendees to create their own fashion experiments. Van Herpen herself has used materials ranging from lace and traditional fabrics to 3D printed forms and the repurposed spokes of children’s umbrellas. No longer confined by just fabric for material, her designs are dynamic and creatively sourced. Her unique approach to her materials often applies new technologies to the creative process of fashion design, and, at other times, provides a subtle commentary on reuse and sustainability. 
Attendees were given the opportunity to apply these concepts of unconventional materials and sustainability to their own accessories. Pittsburgh’s Center for Creative Reuse provided a wide variety of materials — fabric samples, plastic tubing, jewelry findings, feathers, metal caps — and standard crafting materials for a DIY accessory-making session for Third Thursday attendees. By giving people the resources to design their own accessories, Creative Reuse and Third Thursday put the power of self-expression through fashion directly in the hands of the wearer. Not only is the practice of creative reuse sustainable and environmentally friendly, it provides unique materials for arts, crafts, and in the context of fashion, ownership of one’s outward appearance.
In addition to a runway and “white carpet” photo station, Third Thursday featured DJs from Hot Mass in the echoing Sculpture Hall. In all their eclectic fashions, attendees danced and celebrated their personal definitions of fashion and self-representation. Attendees were encouraged to wear their most “fashion-forward ensemble,” and this challenge was met in very diverse and personal ways. From semi-casual attire to gothic gowns, formal wear to the avant garde, Third Thursday patrons represented themselves through their own interest — and background-informed aesthetics.
Complementing the event’s focus on sustainability and unconventional resources, the event also featured the makeup brand Winky Lux. A lip bar allowed patrons to swatch lip glosses, lip sticks, and eyeshadows. In the name of innovative fashion and self-representation, the inclusion of this lip bar — which included Winky Lux’s “flower balms,” lip sticks with real flowers inside that change color in response to the wearer’s pH levels — exposed attendees to unusual and custom makeup. 
February’s Third Thursday was rich with self-representation and appreciation for personal definitions of beauty. Iris van Herpen: Transforming Fashion will be showing through May 1st in the Heinz Galleries on the second floor of the Carnegie Museum of Art. Guided exhibit tours are available every Friday and Sunday at 12:30 p.m., and every Thursday at 6:30 p.m.

In an era where horror becomes comedy and comedy often turns to horror, The Santa Clarita Diet is a refreshing intersection of gore and chuckles. This Netflix Original Series stars Drew Barrymore, who surpasses the bounds of reality through her supernatural “condition.” It’s not quite “The Walking Dead” or “Resident Evil.” It’s more of a Desperate Housewives-meets-Dexter-meets-Arrested Development sort of situation. 
I came across the show while scrolling through my newsfeed a few months ago. Seeing the title of the advertisement, I was less than eager to see what was coming. There stood Barrymore, smiling in a classic red dress, talking about a “new diet” that “isn’t like any other diet.” She smiled at the camera, and expressed how lively and sexy she now felt. As I started scrolling past, I heard the words, “I can eat anyone I want” in the background, and immediately scrolled back up. I went from eye rolling to googling, and stumbled upon the premise of this intriguing series. I had fallen victim to Netflix’s digital advertising, and I was excited to see if it was worth it.
As someone who loves conspiracy theories and controversial plot lines, I was hooked before I even started watching the series. I’ve also loved Charlie’s Angels for as long as I can remember, so seeing Drew Barrymore’s face again brought back my inner fan girl.
The series released on Feb. 3, this year, and was exactly what I wanted it to be.
The story revolves around Sheila Hammond (Barrymore), a realtor-turned-undead woman, who lives in Santa Clarita, California with her husband, Joel (portrayed by Timothy Olyphant), and her daughter, Abby (portrayed by Liv Hewson). The pilot carries us through Sheila’s transformation from a reserved human to a confident zombie, and sets the tone for many of the show’s subplots. What’s interesting about yet another zombie-based plotline? Barrymore’s character wants nothing more than to embrace her new life and live it to the fullest. The series lacks the notorious apocalyptic fear that has wiggled its way into the Zombie-flick archetype, and works to explore themes such as family values, morale, and (inevitably) death. 
Naturally, Joel is constantly in jitters throughout the show, and on a mission to both find a cure for Sheila and help her in her quest for flesh. As Sheila’s co-realtor and high school sweetheart, the two have a truly endearing bond that gives rise to anxiety-induced, frantic banter that boosts the sense of urgency that resonates through the episodes. 
Abby, on the other hand, is your quintessential sassy teenager with an insatiable hunger for adventure that is only fueled by Sheila’s transformation. Her escapades balance out the watch-through-the-cracks-in-your-fingers sort of feeling that the blood and guts give you. She is often seen with Eric, the “geeky,” incredibly knowledgeable next-door-neighbor who supports all three of the Hammonds in their time of need. Eric dotes on Abby, which is part of what keeps him motivated to keep helping a family, who really - probably by the second episode - need to be arrested. 
The Santa Clarita Diet also hosts its share of guest stars, who are strategically eliminated from the plot either by being eaten, or being driven away by the notion of being eaten. Some are even drawn in by the zombie conundrum, and we are certainly hoping to see a lot more of them in the future. In just the first season we see Nathan Fillion, Portia de Rossi, Ravi Patel, and Thomas Lennon, amongst others. 
While I thoroughly enjoyed binge-watching this season, I will admit that the show is not for everyone. There is a lot of what I would call content that is unsettling to the stomach, and a pretty large amount of killing and conversations about killing. To say the least, the graphic content of the show may not be for everyone, and if you’re planning on watching this with a younger sibling (or your parents), note that there is a hearty amount of swearing and a splash of sexual references here and there.
What is amazing though, is the show’s ability to push such an unsettling plot element to normalcy, and bring in smaller issues and blow them out of proportion. Somehow, everything does tie together, and somehow, the Hammond’s are able to survive without provoking any excessive suspicion. The undead brings out the unexpected best in this family, and shows how a horrific and unexplained incident can bring people closer together.
The show also boasts a very light-hearted, almost spacey acting style that elevates its dark comedic flair. While some critics have rendered this unappealing, I find that it is necessary to counteract the intensity of the murders in the show. This also brings all the actors, regardless of their age, on the same level, setting a tone for the show.
The artistic direction and staging of scenes is incredibly well-done, especially given the amount of blood and guts that the production team have put together. Live actors are recreated as lifeless, disemboweled corpses, and Barrymore is constantly chowing down on whatever they’ve sculpted into faux internal organs. The attention to detail, down to the coloration and anatomy of Sheila’s victims, is commendable, but, again, is what might make it difficult for many to watch.
So far the show has ten episodes released to make up its first season, and is well set up for many more seasons to come. For those who can stomach it, this show is worth it for the long haul.

Big Sean is a certified superstar, with a number one album and eight singles charting higher than 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. But for all his catchy, entertaining party tracks, he had yet to prove his true artistic abilities. With his fourth album, I Decided., Big Sean has finally shown that he is more than just a hitmaker, by creating an album with musical cohesion that is enhanced by consistently focused lyrics centering on themes of resilience, persistence, and the courage needed to make major life decisions.
Big Sean (born Sean Anderson) hails from Detroit, where he got his musical start in high school by participating in rap battles at a local radio station. Sean got his big break when his hero, Kanye West, visited the station. After pleading with a reluctant West, Sean spit 16 bars for his idol. West liked what he heard so much that two years later, he signed Big Sean to his GOOD Music record label. After several mixtapes, Big Sean dropped his first album, Finally Famous, in 2011, which reached number three on the Billboard 200, and delivered three hit singles: “Dance (A$$),” featuring Nicki Minaj, “My Last,” with Chris Brown, and “Marvin & Chardonnay.” Sean found further success on the GOOD Music collaboration project, Cruel Summer, where he featured on “Clique” and “Mercy,” delivering his silly but memorable “ass-quake” line, and his third album, Dark Sky Paradise, took him to number one, propelled by the hit singles “I Don’t F*** With You” and “Blessings.”
Clearly, Sean knew how to create a club-ready banger, but none of his albums really held together. Beyond a few breakout tracks, with bass-heavy, danceable beats and playful flows, the albums were inconsistent. On I Decided., however, Big Sean digs deeper, producing lyrics that, for the most part, remain centered around a main theme and delve into intimate moments from his life. Even the lead single, “Bounce Back,” which often falls back on a tough guy attitude, gives fans a taste of what is to come. The energetic track features a head-bopping Metro Boomin-produced beat, which is mostly composed of synth tones and bass, and pairs well with the catchy hook. While he tends to use his sharp wordplay for typical boasts—“Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing/I kept it G, yeah, one thousands”—the hook previewed his message of rebounding from setbacks: “Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back/Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back.”
The album’s standout tracks — “Jump Out the Window,” “Inspire Me,” “Sunday Morning Jetpack,” and “Voices In My Head/Stick To the Plan” — offer intimate looks into Sean’s life while continuing the ominous, tonal musical style. In “Jump Out the Window,” Sean discusses a female friend in an abusive relationship, for whom he has feelings. Taking a leap of faith, he decides to intervene and save her: “You been up at night, sleep deprivation/What’s the hesitation? What's ya reservation?,” he asks her. “You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself.” Sean describes specific moments in their friendship and some of his innermost feelings (“Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart/And you always picked the princess/I realized you was princess way back then/We the best thing that never happened”) while staying focused on the story and not indulging in braggadocio, a flaw common to many rappers, including Sean. The auto-tune singing, which sometimes is overused in hip-hop to cover up for poor vocals, works well here, turning Sean’s distress over the situation into musical expression—much the same way his mentor Kanye West used the same effect on 808s & Heartbreak.
“Inspire Me” also delves into Sean’s personal life, with the song reading like a conversation and apology to his mother, similar to West’s “Hey Mama.” It is a fun, catchy song with an airy, melodic beat and high-pitched background vocals. The lyrics are sweet and relatable, with Big Sean rapping, “You tried to keep me away from temptation/Introduced me to The Temptations/Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers/Dancing so hard the living room shaking” and later, “When I got a new love you invite 'em in/When we break up, you don't like 'em then”. The song’s positive message and upbeat production leave the listener smiling; it is one of the few genuinely happy tracks Big Sean has released.
In “Sunday Morning Jetpack,” Sean reveals childhood memories and discusses how he learned to rise above the hardships in life. He reminisces that “This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday/With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake/Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving” and that “you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through.” “Voices In My Head/Stick To the Plan” offers a look into Sean’s darker thoughts. He raps about self-criticism (“Voices in my head sayin' I could do better”) and contemplating suicide (“Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking/Bullet to the head might be the way to free it/If I leave my body I can free the spirits”).
While there are definitely many great pieces, there are also some inferior songs like “No Favors” and “Same Time Pt. 1.” The former features Eminem, yet his verse falls epically flat. Eminem’s voice sounds like he rapped while standing a few feet away from the mic — he’s shouting the lines but his visceral intensity is absent. Worse, the verse lacks focus, with lyrics ranging from boastful (“So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early”) to political (“Trump’s a bitch”) to just plain weird (“I’m urinating on Fergie”). “Same Time Pt. 1,” which features his girlfriend Jhené Aiko, is a bland song that seems out of place on this album and more like a teaser for the couple’s second TWENTY88 album. Considering that Sean said he had to fight to get all 14 tracks on, this space would have been better filled by “No More Interviews” or “Living Single,” two strong singles he released in the buildup to the album’s debut.
Despite these flaws, the album is overall a success, featuring a level of musical and lyrical cohesion and consistency Sean had yet to display. The album has its fair share of party songs while also including several personal, darker numbers. After four albums, Big Sean has not only solidified himself as a hip-hop star but also proven himself as an artist.

Carnegie Mellon University was one of several prestigious research universities to join an amicus brief opposing the executive order on immigration implemented by President Donald Trump. This brief was created in the U.S. District Court in New York on Monday, Feb. 13.
In addition to Carnegie Mellon, the brief was signed by Brown University, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, Emory University, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Stanford University, Vanderbilt University, and Yale University.
The brief states that “international students, faculty, and scholars make significant contributions to their fields of study and to campus life by bringing their unique perspectives and talents to amici’s classrooms, laboratories, and performance spaces. These individuals also contribute to the United States and the world more generally by making scientific discoveries, starting businesses, and creating works of literature and art that redound to the benefit of others far beyond amici’s campuses.” Furthermore, it states that the “Executive Order at issue here threatens amici’s continuing ability to attract these individuals and thus to meet their goals of educating tomorrow’s leaders from around the world.”
The brief explains that when the government restricts countries from sending individuals to America, it severely hinders our nations universities. Without access to the best minds of the globe, their ability to educate and train future leaders is diminished. As a consequence, the impact of significant research and innovations will be negatively affected. U.S. universities and colleges have long been a center for both industrial and academic advancement, which has led to economic growth and improvement of the lives of millions of Americans. The list of advancements at Carnegie Mellon includes: the invention of Java programming language, CAPTCHAs, and the first “thinking computer.”
As the current executive branch has not indicated that it will stop the pursuit of the immigration restrictions, this action by the institution of Carnegie Mellon shows that they stand in solidarity with the Carnegie Mellon community, and still strongly emphasize the importance of international students, faculty, and staff who are a part of what makes the university so exceptional. Having experience from all over the world enriches the university from an educational, research, and cultural perspective. The signing of this brief was an attempt at showing the support for all of the people who work to make Carnegie Mellon so influential.
In a section of the document, Carnegie Mellon described its interest in the amicus briefing, stating that the university seeks to “build on leadership in world-class education and research outside the borders of a traditional university campus; focus on continued international engagement, and deeper and broader incorporation of the full [Carnegie Mellon] experience around the world.”
Earlier, Subra Suresh, president of Carnegie Mellon University and former Director of the National Science Foundation, released a statement to the community describing his reaction to President Trump’s executive order. In his statement, he reemphasized his commitment to make Carnegie Mellon a welcoming campus, stating “we will do all that is within our power, as individuals, as an institution, and by working through national organizations such as the Association of American Universities and with federal, state, and local officials, to support our international students and scholars to the fullest extent possible.
President Suresh ended his release with some powerful words: “As president of this great university, I will do everything within my capacity to ensure that our extraordinarily talented students, staff, and faculty receive similar opportunities through the core values that underlie our university and our nation.” He also promised that there will be opportunities to learn about evolving conditions and specific university support in various areas of concern.

On Feb. 16, Carnegie Mellon’s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation hosted an event titled “Building a Resilient, Smart, and Sustainable City: The Energy and Water Nexus.”
The first part of the event consisted of a keynote lecture by Dr. Michael Webber, the Josey Centennial Fellow in Energy Resources, an Associate Professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s mechanical engineering department, and the Deputy Director of Energy Institute. Webber, a Stanford graduate, has written two books about the subject of energy and policy and over a hundred other articles in both research journals and in popular media outlets such as The New York Times and Scientific American.
The lecture was based off a book Webber had written, called Thirst for Power: Energy, Water, and Human Survival. The overarching theme was the fundamental and intricate connections between water and energy, as water is necessary for life and energy is necessary if people want to do more than just survive. Pittsburgh, like many other cities, is defined by water, as exemplified by three rivers surrounding the area. Webber gave historical examples that showed the correlation between a sustained lack of water and the collapse of civilizations — from several Chinese dynasties (Tang, Yuan, and Ming), to the Roman Empire, to the Mayan Empire. Water is so important that it is all over our cultural lexicon. For example, “glass half full” means optimist, and in Greek mythology, Tantalus is punished for leaking the secrets of the gods by being made to stand in an ever-receding pool of water.
Meanwhile, energy is essential not just for cleaning water (a basic human need) but also for mobility, productive industry, comfortable shelter, and abundant food.Energy is essential to a high quality of life. This point is illustrated in the time-lapse videos from the International Space Station which shows North Korea in darkness except for a small speck of light at Pyongyang, because most of the people there live without power and in poverty. As an example of the connection between water and energy, he discussed the situation many women and girls in developing countries face: missing school or work to carry water from miles away and then boiling it using primitive, unsafe cookstoves. Statistics show that a disproportionate number of women and girls die prematurely because of this every year. Additionally, while our bodies require freshwater, much of Earth’s water is either saltwater or locked in ice caps, both of which require energy to turn them into freshwater. Simply heating water is responsible for over 12 percent of nationwide energy usage.
“The last time I checked, boiled water is not a new technology,” Webber said half-jokingly, illustrating the fundamental nature of the connection between water and energy.
He went on to illustrate how this connection demonstrates both opportunity and vulnerability. The vulnerability arises in areas ranging from energy production-related pollution contaminating water sources — oil spills, for example — to the increased seismic activity induced by the injection of wastewater in fracking to the displacement and costs associated with hydroelectric dams and even the deaths that can result should a dam collapse. In 2003, a heat wave in Europe heated up the water so much that nuclear power plants could not use the water for their cooling systems without risking the violation of thermal pollution limits. On the other end of the temperature spectrum, frozen water can threaten the power sector by damaging everything from hydroelectric power plants to delaying the start of the shipping season. In 2014, the polar vortex froze rivers and lakes, preventing road salt from being delivered and thus driving up the price of fuel because fuel trucks couldn’t make it through the snow and ice. Floods and droughts can damage the power sector as well, since both can leave people without power for extended periods of time.
Webber said that water will become the most precious resource as we head deeper into the 21st century. There have already been many Hollywood movies made about the possibility of water wars. In the real world, the Syrian civil war is worsened by the ensuing water crisis there, and India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers, are at risk of breaking into a conflict over water resources.
On the other hand, the connection between energy and water presents an opportunity. Currently around 10 to 40 percent of water is wasted, while over half of all electricity produced is lost as heat. Webber made a case for smart meters that can save and stabilize energy and water consumption, depending on time of day and indoor use versus outdoor use, among other functions. He concluded by calling for better STEM education to improve water and energy literacy and discussing the benefits of conservation.
Webber’s keynote lecture was followed by a panel consisting of Rich Fitzgerald, the Allegheny County Executive; William Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh; Philip Mezey, the CEO of Itron; Richard Riazzi, the CEO of Duquesne Light Company; Morgan O’Brien, CEO of Peoples Natural Gas; and Rick Stafford of Carnegie Mellon and the founder of Metro21 and MetroLab. The panel was hosted by Dr. Jared Cohon. A short question-and-answer session followed the panel.
The panel started off with Cohon praising Mayor Peduto and Fitzgerald for understanding the energy-related issues of this current century. The mayor discussed the need for new economic models due to the disruptions in the modern economy that will be created by forces such as automation. He emphasized that the definition of sustainability goes beyond just environmental protections and preservation; it also encompasses economic equality and affordability. Fitzgerald added that we should learn from the misuses of water and other resources in the past and apply them to the present to create a more sustainable economy. The discussion also revolved around themes such as increased efficiency leading to economic growth, research development initiatives, the importance of partnerships, and integrating all these issues to increase the quality of life for more people.
In the question session, Fitzgerald was asked about what university students can do to be involved in the issues surrounding the nexus of water and energy. He emphasized the need for new business models. “There’s as much honor in innovating new business models as inventing some brand new widget,” he said.
Webber concurs with the idea of integrating different areas necessary for tackling future challenges. In an interview with The Tartan, he concluded that “[He] would like to see more integrated thinking and more integrated design, where we realize our energy systems mean water and water systems mean energy, and we design them to be more resilient and less vulnerable.”

On Feb. 15, Van C. Tran, an associate professor of sociology at Columbia University, visited Carnegie Mellon to discuss issues regarding Latino assimilation and challenges faced by Latino immigrants after President Trump’s election.
Tran was born in Vietnam, raised in Thailand, and moved to the United States with his family in 1998. His research focused on the immigration process of Latinos, the impact of immigration on society, and the ethnic inequality experienced by these communities. During the lecture, Tran presented several challenges Latino immigrants are likely to face under the current administration and the studies leading up to these conclusions. He examined historical trends of immigration, the social status and mobility of immigrants, and how they have been incorporated into the American identity since 1965.
Tran pointed out that the sense of loss of the white majority likely influenced the rhetoric and the result of the presidential election. The population of Latino immigrants has drastically increased in the past three decades. According to a census in 2013, a quarter of second-generation immigrant Americans were Latino, and the projected overall population of Latino Americans in 2030 is 15 percent.
Tran mentioned two contradicting views on Latino immigrants’ social status held by Americans: some believe that second-generation Latino descents are doing worse than their parent generation as well as their native peers, and they are on the downward spiral of social mobility. Others believe that second-generation Latinos gained advantages through immigration. These conclusions are different because the empirical evidence are mixed.
The racial distinctiveness, bifurcated economy, neighborhood poverty, and structural discrimination within the American society were the reasons why many believed Latino immigrants to be unsuccessful. However, Tran showed that Latino immigrants generally accomplished more after coming to America, because of the hyper selectivity of the immigration process and affirmative action, which allowed Latino descents to move upward. Despite the opportunities available, second-generation Latinos struggled in their attempt to Americanize due to their legal status and the inequality in the United States.
Tran specifically discussed the result of the 2010 census taken right after the Great Recession, and its connection with Latino immigration. The number of unauthorized Latino immigrants reached its highest in 2009, consisting mostly of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban immigrants. “[The Latino] population lives under legal exclusion,” Tran said. “[The Latino Americans] averted the bicoastal phenomenon in immigration, and settled in regions with no immigration history.” He also discussed the Latino assimilation in American society, and the general trend that shows after three generations, which is that Latino descents stop identifying with their origin. Tran noted that this trend implies that these Latino immigrants have then fully integrated.
Tran also pointed out that the progress made by Latino immigrants and their upward social movements were sometimes concluded to be the reason why the African American community was “held at the bottom of society.”
The domestic hostility toward Latinos comes not only from white Americans, but from various communities. The number of undocumented Latinos has reached 11.7 million, surpassing the number of African Americans living in the south in the 1960s. There has not been a reasonable change in immigration policy since 1980 to allow Latinos to legally work in the United States. Instead of resolving this problem, the current administration has chosen deportation as the only solution, but the deportation process at such a scale would take more than a decade and is unrealistic considering more Latinos are simultaneously entering the country.
Tran noted that, while nativism and xenophobia rose within the American society, more and more people and organizations began to advocate to extend civil rights to human rights, offering undocumented immigrants protection and basic human rights. Sanctuary states such as California established their own policy regarding immigrants instead of complying with the federal government. In conclusion, Tran remarked that this disparity between the state and federal government would likely have an impact on future U.S. immigration policy.

On Thursday, Feb. 16, Scott Reynolds Nelson, UGA Athletic Association Professor of History at the University of Georgia, visited Carnegie Mellon as part of the Department of History and the University Lecture Series in conjunction with the Hiawatha Project. The award-winning author of Steel Drivin’ Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend and several other books, Nelson revisited the legend of John Henry and its roots in the evolution of music from the 19th century to today in his lecture, titled “Take this Hammer: The Death of John Henry and the Birth of Rock ‘n’ Roll.”
Nelson explains that the legend of John Henry has been an integral part of American folklore since the end of the 19th century. A “steeling-driving-man,” John Henry is known for his huge and powerful figure, always carrying his hammer. The story goes that he raced a steam drill and won, before falling over and dying from exhaustion. John Henry is also known as the hero of the trackliners, 100,000 men, mostly African American, in the South who laid the railroad track in the 1860s and 1870s.
The origin of John Henry is shrouded in mystery, and in his 2006 book Steel Drivin’ Man, Nelson proposed a different history of the man. Contrary to previous beliefs that John Henry worked on the Big Bend Tunnel of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in West Virginia, Nelson’s research suggested that he instead worked on the Lewis Tunnel, 40 miles away in Virginia. By interpreting lyrics of the songs of John Henry that said he was buried by a “white house” deep “in sand,” Nelson was led to the Virginia State Penitentiary, which was often referred to as the “white house” of Richmond.
Convicts from the Virginia State Penitentiary were used as labor to finish the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. According to Nelson, “the working conditions were horrible” and “10 percent of prisoners who worked in railroad construction died every year,” many from silicosis from the dust built up during construction. Through his research, Nelson discovered that there was a man named John Henry from New Jersey who was jailed in the Virginia State Penitentiary and was quite likely one of the 200 bodies of convicts found buried in the sand near the Virginia State Penitentiary.
The story of John Henry is deeply ingrained in the history of music. It was one of the first blues songs, the second country song ever recorded (by Fiddlin’ John Carson in the 1920s), and also a bluegrass song. It took center stage in the 1970s during the revival of folk music, and many famous musicians recorded ballads about John Henry, such as Bruce Springsteen and Woody Guthrie. The trackliners carried this song and its floating verses as a tool to set the pace during work.
While songs about John Henry were carried by the trackliners and used during the work on the railroad, Nelson argues that it also talks about where the bodies of the 200 convicts were buried — a song about the dead. Nelson paused the lecture to listen to a recording of the Song of John Henry sung by trackliners with the base of the hammer and steel. The lyrics “say now who gonna kiss your rosy cheeks/Darlin’ who gonna be your man/Well-a who gonna be your man” are indicative of the country ballad, but when combined with distinctive African music elements, the trackliners created the first Black ballad.
“Rock music rests on the foundation laid by the trackliners in the 1860s carried forth by the blues musicians of the 1920s to the 1940s,” Nelson said. He again paused the lecture to listen to Led Zeppelin’s “Bring it on Home” (1969), which is clearly grounded by old work songs. The base and rhythm of the song paired with the tone of the harmonica create the sound of the moving train. Like the trackliners’ songs about home and women, “Bring it on Home” is also a song about lonely men traveling and leaving their girls home. The famous slide and twang so prominent in rock music is half violin, half guitar, derived from the techniques of blues musicians.
Nelson argues that rock ‘n’ roll music was not “some special blast that hits Elvis Presley” in the 1950s. The fusion of blues and country music instead began nearly a hundred years prior, in the time of trackliners, who cut into mountains to the rhythms we hear in rock music today.
The story of John Henry, Nelson said, changed from a story about death to a story of a legend, a story of heroism, embraced by workers and laborers against the perils of capitalism and advancing technology.
Nelson is currently working on a history of Kansas wheat, Russian communists, and the end of World War I.

Carnegie Mellon study suggests married people have increased health benefits
A Carnegie Mellon study, published in Psychoneuroendocrinology, provides the first biological evidence that suggests married people are healthier than those who are single, divorced, or widowed.
During their study, the researchers collected samples of saliva from 572 healthy adults, aged 21 to 55, for three consecutive days. Multiple samples were taken daily and tested for cortisol, a stress hormone. The results showed that those who were married had lower cortisol levels than those who weren’t. Increased levels of cortisol interferes with the body’s ability to regulate inflammation and can promote the development of diseases.
The researchers also compared each person’s daily cortisol rhythm. Typically, cortisol levels peak when a person wakes up and decline during the day. Married people showed a faster decline, a pattern that has been associated with less heart disease and longer survival among cancer patients.
In a university press release, Sheldon Cohen, the Robert E. Doherty University Professor of Psychology and co-author of the article, said “these data provide important insight into the way in which our intimate social relationships can get under the skin to influence our health.”
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health funded the preparation of the article.
Mimus, a robot at London’s Design Museum exhibit, showcases personality with visitors
Madeline Gannon, a Ph.D. candidate in computational design at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture, has created an industrial robot named Mimus who interacts with visitors at the Design Museum London’s exhibition. The exhibition is called “Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World” and will run until April 23.
Visitors interact with Mimus, an ABB IRB 6700 industrial robot, through its glass enclosure much like how they would interact with an animal at the zoo. Mimus’ unique name comes from the Latin root “mimic” and a genus of the mockingbird family.
According to a university press release, Gannon hopes that Mimus can reinforce the message that robots are not just things or replacements for human labor but are interactive creatures.
“Creating new ways to communicate with machines is my passion, and I’m so excited to share this experience with others through Mimus,” Gannon said in a university press release. “When something responds to us with lifelike movements — even when it is clearly an inanimate object — we, as humans, cannot help but project our emotions onto it.”
Justin McGuirk, the chief curator of the Design Museum, also shared his enthusiasm for Gannon’s creation. “What’s fascinating is the way Madeline has subverted the robot by reprogramming it, taking something designed for industrial repetition and making it seem alive and spontaneous. One starts to get the sense of how robots may behave in the future,” McGuirk said.

We all come to Carnegie Mellon to get the best education available to us. When changes in laws threaten the ability of students to continue an education here, our best defense is educating ourselves. With this in mind, the President’s Cabinet hoped to create such a space for our students.
The Open Forum on Immigration Policy, hosted by the President’s Cabinet and the University on Tuesday, Feb. 14, resulted from feelings of shock at the rapid change of the immigration rights of so many, and a need to help our community members gather accurate information on their options in these new tricky situations. In this event, we welcomed members of Klasko Law, one of the top five immigration law firms in the United States, to answer questions by students, staff, and faculty attending the event, as well as members of our community who were watching online, about how this change in policy would affect their ability to travel or their immigration status.
It quickly became apparent why Carnegie Mellon turned to Klasko Law as they doled important advice about potential risks threatening the rights of citizens from the seven nations affected by the recent executive order. After a personal explanation from Ron Klasko about why he did not agree with the new policy, a brief explanation was offered about its immediate effects and possible changes and expansions in the future. It was stressed that citizens of other countries with a large Muslim population, such as Egypt, should refrain from traveling internationally unless necessary, due to the immediate effect of executive orders and the lack of a need of notice to these sudden changes. It was stressed that all social media and confidential files can be searched at airports and borders as well.
Especially important in this event was the reaffirmation of President Suresh to the University’s values of inclusion of all students, staff, and faculty, and how it will always stand above others’ fear of the unknown. “To those in our [Carnegie Mellon] community concerned about their welcome in this country, and in this university: you belong. You deserve to be here. Our university would not be the same without you, and you will always be welcomed here.” Similarly, Vaasavi Unnava, Carnegie Mellon’s Student Body President, restated her commitment to being an advocate of every student at Carnegie Mellon University, regardless of their background or the external political climate.
I am so proud, as a student and an immigrant, to attend and work in a University that is so committed to welcoming and protecting all its students, staff, and faculty. The audio file of the forum is available on the Carnegie Mellon website. The Office of International Education, as well as Student Government, is always available to help guide questions about immigration or safety on campus and in this nation.

Over the last four months, one name has saturated all news outlets — Donald Trump. The President has been discussed incessantly on almost every talk show, late night show, news room, and news feed, rendering him inescapable. He infamously received $2 billion of free media during last year’s election, far more than his opponents did, including Hillary Clinton. Recently, some media juggernauts have been fighting this coverage trend by changing the topic altogether. But is that the ethical thing to do, especially in a democracy where the media plays such a crucial role?
A day ago, late night host John Oliver announced that his show’s new season will weigh less on the daily musings of President Trump and more on anything else he wishes to discuss. Oliver views it as a chance to focus his discussions on investigative journalism conducted by his team and on content that gets far less coverage time. This will certainly set Oliver apart because every other late night host is satirizing Trump’s actions, competing for the funniest monologue. Yet, it is also risky since Trump is all audiences seem to care about for the moment — Oliver’s viewers included.
Two years ago, The Huffington Post moved all news stories related to Trump to its entertainment section. Admittedly, this was far before he was seen as a serious contender for the White House. Nevertheless, it exemplified the media’s attempts to change the discussion.
Adding to the coverage boycott are publications that have nothing to do with politics. In its video series The Closer with Keith Olbermann, GQ Magazine routinely reprimands Trump. Last week, Olbermann advised journalists not to attend White House press briefings anymore, especially when Trump labels their organizations as fake news. It comes as no surprise that fashion magazines are commenting on politics in 2017. Everybody, including Meryl Streep, has joined the Trump conversation. It is because this election has arguably permeated the most lives, simplifying politics from what many perceived as economics, fiscal, and diplomatic jargon to right versus wrong.
Nonetheless, the media is pivotal in a true democracy. It may be ethically irresponsible to simply ignore Trump because we are tired of him. Instead, we must consider what makes the President such a hot topic.
Trump’s tendency to engage any person or organization that offends him adds fuel to the fire. He did so before he ascended to office, and he does so now. His petulant behavior disheartens many who view him as unpresidential, yet inspires his supporters who see his demeanor as anti-establishment. Trump’s unpredictable tirades even have positive effects for corporations. Trump’s latest tirade against Nordstrom Rack for dropping his daughter’s clothing line perplexingly increased the retailer’s stock by four percent, proving that Trump’s most minute actions have far-reaching effects.
Trump’s Twitter account is perplexing. Consider his decision to cancel a meeting with Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto through a public tweet. Most recently, Trump used the official POTUS twitter account to retweet his own personal tweets, blurring the lines between his official and personal positions and showcasing his lack of experience and decorum.
Trump alone is not the deer in the headlights when it comes to presidential etiquette. His whole administration shares his lack of skill. People are baffled, amused, and irritated by Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway’s ability to utter complete falsehoods so casually. People are frightened by Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s tendency to do the same on behalf of Trump in his indignant tone. Many more names, like Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, elicit just as much concern. This band of unorthodox appointees is easily scrutinized and satirized, so much so that they provide a never-ending stream content for the media, from CNN to Saturday Night Live, for the foreseeable future.
Is it possible for the media to completely ignore the most powerful position in the free world when it is so unpredictable? Trump’s actions are intertwined in events across the globe, from causing casualties in Yemen to offending prime ministers in Australia. His elected officials and their rushed policies affect the well-being of American citizens and permanent residents. The media, as well as the public, are simply fascinated by Trump. Until this fascination dissipates, not much will change.
Trump’s dominant presence in the news may not be as unusual as we think. After all, he is still within his first hundred days in office. In retrospect, new presidents are always initially a spectacle. We analyze their judgement, scrutinize their policies, and delve into their personal lives. Consider the fanfare that surrounded the young and promising John F. Kennedy during his 1960 campaign and after his election. Recall the exhilaration and excitement that came with the appointment of the first African-American Commander in Chief, Barack Obama. In 2009, Robert J. Samuelson of The Washington Post wrote an op-ed titled “The Media’s Infatuation with President Obama,” saying “the Obama infatuation is a great unreported story of our time,” stating that it “is not healthy for America.” Samuelson’s views on Obama, although not shared by many at the time, do resonate with what is being said about Trump today.
Ignoring Trump is thus idealistic. The now-infamous travel ban, for example, should be on every American’s mind. The nomination of his Secretary of Education who is unaware of the “growth versus proficiency” debate should bother every student, guardian, and faculty member. The silencing of environmental agencies should concern us all. The list continues and is increasingly disheartening, and it is the job of the media to cover it all. This coverage is not unusual for a new president, but things are different this time around — the world-wide protests week after week, the polls indicating he is the most unfavored president in the history of polling, and his two million popular vote defeat all speak to that deviation from the norm.
For as long as Trump occupies the most influential office in the world, he will be media worthy. For as long as his administration attempts to undermine the role of the media in a democracy, the media will have to fight back with transparent coverage.

Thanks to the dumpster fire that the 2016 election turned out to be, it can be hard to find anything positive to write about. Here in Pennsylvania, the Democratic Party dropped the ball big time, squandering a comfortable lead over Donald Trump in a state that turned out to be pivotal to his electoral victory, and losing a winnable and key Senate race and several vulnerable Republican Congressional seats in the Philadelphia suburbs. This, in a state that has one million more registered Democrats than Republicans and hasn’t voted for a Republican nominee for President since Ronald Reagan. Yikes.
But if I had to point to a bright spot in my own campaign experience this cycle, I might point to Carnegie Mellon University. Here, our beloved student body, harried and beleaguered by constant overtures from several campaign organizations on campus, turned out to vote in record numbers. According to Democratic campaign officials that I spoke with, voter turnout in the Cohon Center increased by over 50 percent from 2012 to 2016. In 2012, just 40 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s registered voters voted. In 2016, 62.5 percent of voters, virtually all of them college students, showed up to the polls. Not only does this smash the national turnout rate among college-aged voters (40 percent) but it also exceeds the national turnout rate overall, which was 55 percent in 2016. 
David Linden, who was one of the of the Democratic Party organizers working at Carnegie Mellon this election, commented that Carnegie Mellon students were instrumental in helping to secure healthy returns for the campaign in Pittsburgh, where Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by a wider margin than Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney in 2012. In Allegheny County overall, Linden also noted that Clinton earned 106,000 more votes than Trump, exceeding their goal by 6,000. Not only did our unexpectedly strong turnout help the campaign exceed their goals, but Linden also pointed out that students at the university completed hundreds of volunteer shifts in the weeks before the campaign, bolstering voter turnout here on campus and in the surrounding community.
Carnegie Mellon has often earned a reputation among its students for a culture of political apathy and disengagement. But students I spoke to think that that is changing, noting the visible presence of the campaign on campus throughout the fall semester, including major events featuring Bernie Sanders and Senator Tim Kaine. They also pointed to examples of engagement after the election, such as protests, walk-outs, and a general buzz of consciousness surrounding the presidential transition and early days of the Trump administration. Last week, more than twice the number of people expected attended a College Democrats event featuring U.S. Congressman Mike Doyle about resisting Donald Trump.
Iris Stegman, a senior studying decision sciences said, “People say [Carnegie Mellon] students are apathetic, but that’s just not true. Students want to be involved and engaged, but they’re not always aware of the opportunities available to them.” To help address this problem, Stegman has founded a new Social Justice Coalition of student organizations, so that socially-conscious student groups can collaborate, reach more students, and support each other’s programs.
One thing that all the students agreed upon: the campaign organizing on campus was visible and effective, if annoying. Two main outside groups worked with students and organizations on campus to spearhead organizing at the university during the election. The first was the Democratic Party’s Victory Campaign, which represented Hillary Clinton, Senate Candidate Katie McGinty, and numerous Democratic candidates for state and local office. The other was NextGen Climate, a climate change-oriented super PAC funded by California Businessman Thomas Steyer.
Both progressive organizations held massive voter registration drives on campus and voter engagement events throughout the fall semester. Students joked that they couldn’t walk from the Cohon Center to the library without being asked several times if they were registered to vote, every day, for weeks. It paid off. Organizers from both organizations estimated that, in total, between 2,000 and 3,000 students were registered to vote on campus. Nick Voustinos, the organizer for NextGen Climate, a climate change-oriented super PAC funded by California Businessman Thomas Steyer.

Organizers from both organizations estimated that, in total, between 2,000 and 3,000 students were registered to vote on campus. Nick Voustinos, the organizer for NextGen Climate, added that students who register to vote on campus are significantly more likely to vote than if they plan to vote absentee in their home jurisdiction. And since many Carnegie Mellon students come from Democratic strongholds like California, New York, and New Jersey, their votes matter a lot more in Pennsylvania.
Still, despite the success on campus, students reported feeling discouraged by the result of the election and by the behavior of the Democratic Party. Victor Vega-Gonzales, a senior studying international relations and politics and statistics, said, “The Democratic Party stands for the right values at its core, but so often it gets its priorities mixed up and uses harmful tactics.” Vega-Gonzales pointed to the DNC, who actively worked during the primaries to support Hillary Clinton and undermine Bernie Sanders,as a prime example of how Democratic Party leaders get in their own way, putting connections and their own pursuit of power over what’s best for the party and the country. “And when politicians give into the pressure from donors from Wall Street and Corporate America,” Vega-Gonzales continued, “it is the energetic, progressive base of the party and the most vulnerable people in society who pay the price.”
His point? If the Democratic Party fails to connect to students, it will struggle to tap into their energy to work on campaigns, and might struggle even to get them to come to the polls. Nationally, students’ concerns about the Democratic Party are reflected in voting statistics. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won voters aged 18-29 by 18 points, a sizable margin, but much smaller than Barack Obama’s 24 point margin over Mitt Romney in 2012. Democrats need to alter course to shore up this crucial advantage. Meanwhile, though the number of young people who identify as “Liberal” increased from 32 percent in 2012 to 37 percent today,the percentage of young Americans registered as Democrats has actually declined. Though young people side with Democrats on policy, they’re hesitant to actually vote for Democrats.
So, those are the lessons that Carnegie Mellon has to offer to the Democratic Party on its path moving forward. First of all, organizing is key, and voter turnout must be an essential piece of the party’s strategy. The party’s success at Carnegie Mellon shows that if you devote the resources and manpower to getting students to vote, they will show up, perhaps even surpassing the national turnout rate. And since students across the country overwhelmingly support Democrats, turning out young voters is a major key to longterm Democratic success, especially in swing states. Second, the Democratic Party must not take young voters for granted, and the party must listen to our frustrations and observations to achieve success moving forward.
To harness our energy and turn out our votes, Democrats need to embrace the grassroots, reclaim the mantel of economic justice, stand unapologetically for social justice, and shed the ties to Wall Street and other corporate interests that make them difficult to trust.

Last Thursday, Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) held a virtual town hall, his first town hall of any kind in four years. The town hall, announced to the public just an hour prior, was held in part as a response to the criticism that Toomey has not been available enough to his constituents. At least since his re-election to the senate last November, the senator’s phone and fax lines have been blocked,  which was of particular frustration to Pennsylvanians during the close senate confirmations of Donald Trump’s controversial cabinet picks. A petition that has garnered over 26,000 signatures was even created to recall the senator, a process not actually possible, in Pennsylvania.
Toomey’s job as a governmental official for Pennsylvania is to represent the people of Pennsylvania. The preamble to the United States Constitution itself begins with the words “We the People of the United States...” It’s a phrase that sets the precedent for a government of the people, for the people, and by the people.In the creation of the American government, the Founding Fathers wanted to move away from the centralized governments of kings and queens that pervaded early modern Europe. It would be impractical and disorganized to have every single little decision made by the people with no real leaders, so the Founding Fathers chose to create a representative democracy, the key word being “representative”: members of the United States government are supposed to reflect and abide by the will of the people.
Representation is a job that Toomey has been neglecting along with his phone calls. Toomey can’t know the thoughts and feelings of Pennsylvanians without picking up the phone or holding frequent town halls and listening to them, and his senate votes reaffirm how out-of-touch with his constituents he really is. Even though Toomey won the 2016 election, he did so with less than a majority of the votes, only beating Democrat Katie McGinty by roughly one percentage point, which means that much of the state is far more liberal than he is. A swing state like Pennsylvania should not have a senator who can be described as “one of the most reliable Republican votes...a safe vote for the Republican party in Congress.” Toomey is supposed to represent the real values of Pennsylvanians, not advance his own agendas and the agendas of his donors.
Toomey should take a page out of the book of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is the epitome of representation. Throughout her years in government, Gillibrand has seamlessly adapted to the views of her current constituents. When Gillibrand was a member of the House of Representatives for a rural, conservative district in upstate New York, she played the part of a conservative, earning high ratings from the National Rifle Association and supporting George Bush’s fiscally conservative policies. Now that she’s a senator, representing the entire state of New York, including the highly liberal and highly populous area of New York City, she is one of the most far left members of the senate, most notably voting no on more Trump cabinet picks than any other senator. Gillibrand has reached a level of listening to and representing her constituents that other politicians should aspire to.
Pennsylvanians are mad about Toomey’s lack of accessibility, and rightfully so. No last-minute tele-town hall can make up for the fact that Toomey has been downright neglecting his constituents. His explanation for his constant unreachability, that out-of-staters have filled up his voicemail, is unsatisfactory. After all, there are many other Republican members of Congress who are surely also hearing their phones ring off the hook over every new Trump action, but none have had quite as much trouble keeping up as has Toomey. In six years when the senator is next up for re-election, Pennsylvanians should remember that they can do better.

The week of Valentine’s Day, Greek organizations Alpha Chi Omega (AXO) and Kappa Sigma (Kap Sig) collaborated to create Healthy Relationships Week in the Jared L. Cohon University Center. Throughout the week, activities such as making cards and distributing bite-sized candies were made available for students and ultimately created a starting point for a much-needed conversation — one that addresses healthy relationships. By spreading awareness on campus of domestic violence and contributing to the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, AXO and Kap Sig are doing tremendous work in helping victims of domestic abuse.
However, male-perpetrator/female-victim relationships are not the only types of domestic abuse that deserve our attention — in fact, we are only scratching the surface by speaking almost exclusively of these types of relationships.
Extending this conversation does not mean, by any means, that I wish to deter the focus away from female victims who are treated unfairly or abused by their boyfriends. The prevalence of a problem in society does not make one’s problems any more or less legitimate. Being abused or in an unhealthy relationship is detrimental to the victim’s mental, psychological, and physical well-being regardless of characteristics such as race, gender, sexuality, or religion.
Relationships exist on a spectrum — from healthy to abusive with unhealthy somewhere in the middle. On one far end we have healthy relationships where both (or in the case of polyamorous relationships, all) people are involved in a consensual connection based on mutual trust, respect, and honesty. This is not to say that healthy relationships are without imperfections, but in a healthy relationship, these conflicts can be resolved without violence of any kind.
Don’t be misled by the fact that unhealthy relationships, abusive relationships, and healthy relationships all have the word “relationship” in them; the commonalities between the three stop there. Unhealthy relationships involve “physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence,” which can often spill into the opposite end of the relationship spectrum: abusive relationships.
As misrepresented and warped domestic violence where the male dominates the female is portrayed in in pop culture and in advertisements, it is arguably even more appalling that there are instances of domestic violence that are ignored or, in some cases, even glorified.
When asked to imagine an unhealthy relationship, most imagine something along the lines of the following: a man beating his girlfriend, or perhaps a string of misogynistic remarks thrown at a woman. However, many of us fail to consider a woman slapping her boyfriend — in fact, a shocking number of people might see “girl power” or a “weak man” in such a scenario.
Even though male victims are hardly recognized, these types of relationships are not nearly as uncommon as you would think. Approximately one out of three women have or will be victims of some type of domestic violence in their lifetimes, but  one out of four men have or will be victims in their lifetimes.  True, there are more female victims than there are male victims, but these numbers may be skewed for various reasons — not being aware that they are in an abusive relationship, not knowing if they will be taken seriously, and not being cognizant of resources, to list a few.
Unfortunately, the barriers do not stop there.
The lines between healthy and unhealthy and abusive relationships can be muddy, and for men, this might be an even murkier line. A conversation that is already so stifled is further restrained due to additional stigmas attached to the matter. It’s human nature to want to not appear weak or vulnerable, and men are no exception. Thus, many times, men are found in situations where they are not aware that what they are going through are potential signs of unhealthy relationships. When the conversation is so focused on female victims and male perpetrators, it can be easy to forget that abuse that happens the other way around is just as worthy of attention.
Society does not do an adequate job of making resources known or accessible. Centers for domestic violence are often focused around women. Yes, this might make sense to some degree because the majority of victims happen to be of the female sex. However, there are still thousands of men who are in need of resources to escape domestic violence. Out of the handful of centers in this nation, a good fraction have the word “Women’s” in them, yet there is not one with the word “Men’s” in it. Even if these centers help men, the name might mislead non-female victims into thinking that the centers are not able to help them. Some shelters have noticed this; the New Jersey Coalition for Battered Women has changed its name to the New Jersey Coalition for Battered Women has changed its name to the New Jersey Coalition to End Domestic Violenceto make it more inclusive.
Although each of us, as individuals, cannot eliminate this problem, we each have the power to help end the stigma and reach out to others. One of the most important steps is to open up dialogue to include all victims of domestic violence — not just women abused by men. It truly is remarkable that the conversation about domestic violence is being brought to the table at Carnegie Mellon University, but let us extend this conversation to include our brothers as well. Domestic violence does not discriminate against any demographic conceivable.
Another step to combat domestic violence is to be cognizant of what domestic violence looks like and resources for victims. There are various potential symptoms, ranging from psychological, such as anxiety and depression, to physical, such as bruises or concealed injuries. If these signs are noted, there is a range of resources for victims of domestic violence such as The National Domestic Violence Hotline or your nearest emergency room. There is nothing wrong or weak about seeking help —your safety is the top priority.
I would like to conclude with a few sentiments:
To my brothers who are victims, I hear you.
To those in the LGBTQ community who are victims, I hear you.
To anyone who is in an unhealthy relationship, regardless of whether your relationship fits the traditional image of an unhealthy relationship, I hear you.

“What the f*** does [Beyoncé] have to do to win Album of the Year?” That’s the question that Adele and an entire nation of black people asked themselves and the Recording Academy last Sunday at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It’s what I have continued to ask myself, and it is what I’ll ask myself until I figure out the answer.
It wasn’t long after Adele’s Album of the Year title was announced that the internet exploded with backlash against the Academy. Academy. Taking after the famous #OscarsSoWhite hashtag was #GrammysSoWhite, which highlighted the belief held by many that Adele’s win over Beyoncé was race-driven.
A black female artist has not won a Grammy for Album of the Year since Lauryn Hill took home the title in 1999. The way I look at it, there are two possible explanations for the lack of titles. Either black artists just simply aren’t as talented as their white counterparts, or there’s a race problem.
This year, Beyoncé was nominated nine times, including nominations for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. Beyoncé has won a total of 22 awards in her career and received a total of 62 nominations. Kanye West, Drake, and Rihanna each earned themselves eight nominations at this year’s Grammy Awards. Chance the Rapper was nominated for seven. In 2016, Kendrick Lamar received eleven nominations and The Weeknd received seven. J. Cole went certified double platinum with no features with his album 2014 Forest Hills Drive, which hadn’t been done in over 25 years. He also went certified gold with no features with his album 4 Your Eyez Only. Alicia Keys has received 39 nominations during her music career and holds 22 awards. Jay Z has been awarded 21 times, and has received over 60 nominations.
That being said, I think we all know the “not as talented” defense is B.S., so let’s get to the real problem. My personal opinion is this: Beyoncé lost because Lemonade made white people uncomfortable.
It’s no secret that Lemonade  was a hard-hitting album, the likes of which we really hadn’t seen from Beyoncé before. She has produced numerous award-winning albums and chart-topping singles, but we’ve never quite seen her so unapologetically feminist and black. She gave this album her all, and black people, especially black women, took notice.
The symbolism and message in each of Lemonade’s songs are hauntingly strong. The video “Don’t Hurt Yourself” features clips of black women played one right after the other overlaid with samples from “Who Taught You to Hate Yourself?”, a speech by civil rights activist Malcolm X. The video is empowering in every sense of the word. “Sorry” gave us the famous quote, “You better call Becky with the good hair,” a criticism of society’s preference for the white appearance over a darker complexion. “Freedom” is my favorite song on the album. The song emphasizes how important it is to be strong for yourself, regardless of the opinions of those around you. This message is important for young women everywhere who are faced with countless messages that they are lesser than male counterparts. The album’s most famous song, “Formation,” took the country by storm and commanded the attention of anyone who listened. In the song, Beyoncé makes it known that she is damn proud of the black woman that she is. She makes it known that there is strength in being black and that there is strength in being a woman. The title of the album itself comes from a speech from Hattie White, Jay Z’s grandmother. “I’ve had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.”
This album means so much to so many people, myself included. It is more than an album of catchy songs and great beats. It’s more than an album of heartbreak tales or teen angst. It’s an album that looks misogyny and racism in the face and refuses to back down. And if that can’t win Album of the Year, then yeah, there actually is a race problem.

Academics like behavioral economists have been arguing for years that even professionals cannot consistently “beat” the stock market. This means that the average returns on investments provided by the largest public companies generally do as well as any elaborate attempt by investment professionals trying to find the perfect stocks to invest in.
Investing in these large public corporations can often be done easily by investing in “index funds” which track a widely-available conglomeration of hundreds of the best stocks. For example, one can indirectly invest in the S&P 500 (the most popular such fund), which would mean putting your money into an aggregation of the 500 largest American companies. This involves little effort and thus has low management fees.
Even though Carnegie Mellon is a university whose primary motive is to spread such financial knowledge to thousands of students, its own administration has not considered these teachings when making its investment decisions. Instead, Carnegie Mellon has consistently attempted to make greater returns than the market average and it has, like most other universities, failed to do so.
As of June 30, 2016, Carnegie Mellon was investing 41 percent of its endowment in hedge funds (aggressively-managed funds) and private equity investments, which tend to involve high risk but promise great reward. Only 16 percent was invested in U.S. public equities (stocks that are publicly traded). Worse, the university plans to move further to increase its investments in hedge funds, from 12 percent to 18 percent while decreasing investment in U.S. public equities from 16 percent to 14 percent.
The obvious question that arises, then is, how well has Carnegie Mellon performed with its current investment portfolio? The answer is that it has performed well, but not as well as it could have. Between the end of fiscal year 2009 and 2016, Carnegie Mellon gained 84.9 percent on its investments, but the S&P 500 index fund gained 134.1 percent.
If Carnegie Mellon had invested its entire endowment in the S&P 500 since 2009, it would have earned $414 million more by now. Since that covers seven years, that would be $59 million more per year. Even assuming current enrollment levels, including undergraduate and graduate students, for all seven years, that would mean $4,243 for each student each year, a substantial cost savings if that additional profit could have been put into financial aid.
But, that’s unfair. After all, hedge funds promote themselves as the safer option since they offer greater risk-adjusted returns. That is, they offer lower losses in a down market and lower returns in a booming one. We should thus account for the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008 when evaluating the two options.
Over the past ten years, then, the university has earned a total return of 56 percent through its investments. If the Administration had simply invested in the S&P 500 index fund, it would have earned returns of 65.24 percent. Even a mix of 60 percent of funds in the stock market and 40 percent in safe fixed-income securities (such as a bond, which is when you purchase a loan) would have resulted in returns of 61 percent.
Some may say, however, that the problem lies with the specific investments Carnegie Mellon made or its personnel. Rather than abandon the strategy of investing in hedge funds, these people argue that we should remain patient and merely evaluate our investing philosophy.
Carnegie Mellon’s investment team certainly holds that opinion. 2016 was the 11th year since Carnegie Mellon had shifted from investing in public equities to more global private equity investments. The Annual Report excuses currently low returns in the hope that they will eventually pan out, stating, “We believe that over the long-term talented fund managers will be able to exceed the return from investing in public securities.”
Translation: Sure, we are losing money now, but to make up for that we are going to double down on the strategy that isn’t working in the hope that eventually it will.
But, this is not how the investments Carnegie Mellon has made work. Fund managers are generally trying to maximize short-term profits. If they can’t do that this year, or over the past ten years, there is no guarantee they will ever be able to do so.
What is a guarantee is that they will never be able to do so consistently. Research by S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that 99 percent of actively managed U.S. equity funds under-performed compared to the S&P 500 over the last ten years, according to the Financial Times. In The Power of Passive Investing,Richard Ferri notes that the average active manager under-performed his benchmark by 2 percent.
Most hedge funds, too, fail with the average lifespan of one being five years, according to The New Yorker. More, most hedge funds have a 2 and 20 rule, where they charge two percent of all investments put into the fund and 20 percent of any profits made, negating the benefits of potentially outperforming investments.
Unless Carnegie Mellon is going to consistently pick the top one percent of private equity funds or one of the few hedge funds that will offer outstanding returns, if such funds exist, its investment strategy is not going to be very helpful, either in the short-term or the long-term.
But Carnegie Mellon is not alone in this. Peer institutions with high endowments have been consistently under-performing the market, but refusing to change their strategy. A report released two weeks ago by the National Association of College and University Business Officers showed that universities with smaller endowments (under $25 million) saw significantly higher returns than those with larger endowments (more than $500 million), according to The New York Times. For comparison, Carnegie Mellon’s endowment is worth $1.3 billion.
The reason for this discrepancy in investment success was simple: colleges with smaller endowments have moved their money from hedge funds and other alternative investments to low-cost index funds and bonds.
The universities with the smallest endowments have just 17 percent of their endowment in alternatives, hedge funds, and private equity firms. Their larger counterparts (those with endowments greater than $1 billion), which have fared much worse, have on average 90 percent of their endowments in these groups.
Carnegie Mellon is much better off than other institutions of its size, but that doesn’t mean it can’t work to improve in the future. An investment strategy that more closely follows financial experience would bring higher returns to the university. Perhaps it could even mean an end to tuition increases.
