Game 9: win, vs. Washington, 5-3
Sunday was the first time the Pirates won a series all season; they took three of four games against the Washington Nationals. With José Quintana starting on the mound, the Nationals surged to a quick 3-0 lead with four consecutive hits in the top of the second inning. Slowly but surely, the Pirates crawled back into the game. With one man out and two on base, Michael Chavis made a tremendous catch to rob César Hernández; that was it for the scoring until the sixth inning, when the Pirates scored twice. In the seventh, though, Cole Tucker stole home on a wild pitch, Chavis drove Josh VanMeter in, and Yoshi Tsutsugo stepped to the plate. At first, he appeared to ground into a double play; upon review, the umps decided he was safe, meaning that Daniel Vogelbach’s run counted. A pitching relay held off the Nats for the rest of the game, and that was it; the Pirates were 5-4, having won four of their last five, and were above 0.500 for the first time this season.
Game 10: loss, at Milwaukee, 6-1
This series against the Brewers was never supposed to be a fair fight, despite the teams’ similar records. This was a pitching battle between Eric Lauer and Zach Thompson through three and a half innings. The Brewers scored in the bottom of the second and the Pirates hit back in the top of the fourth. But then, Thompson fell apart. A single, a double, and a walk loaded the bases. A sacrifice fly by Kolten Wong knocked in a run, making it 2-1, and then another walk loaded the bases for Christian Yelich. Yelich, returning to form, completely got on top of it, hitting a long grand slam. Lauer pitched a six-inning gem and Thompson was run from the game. Pittsburgh couldn’t get back on the scoreboard, Milwaukee didn’t need to, and that was the end of the game.
Game 11: loss, at Milwaukee, 5-2
The Pirates seem to have a habit of playing good teams down to the wire, save for one inning.  This was yet another example of that. Save for a four-run bottom of the second, it was a tight game and nobody scored until the sixth. Yet, that inning marked the end of the Pirates’ victory hopes. The Brewers won for the second consecutive time 5-2.
Game 12: loss, at Milwaukee, 4-2
This marked Milwaukee’s sweep, with Pittsburgh suffering from the single-inning curse that they have suffered from all season again. Coming into the Brewers series, the Bucs were 5-4; now, they’re 5-7, all thanks to a single three-run inning that propelled the Brewers into the lead. If there’s a bright spot, it’s that two of these three games were very winnable; the cards just didn’t fall their way. The defense was good, the hitting was okay, the bullpen was fine. The starting pitching, yet again, was atrocious.
Game 13: win, at Chicago, 4-3
For the fourth time in four games, the Pirates’ pitching surrendered runs first; in this case, two in the bottom of the first and one in the second. But then in the third, the Pirates came back; they added two more runs, to pull within one run. In the fifth, with Wil Crowe pitching in relief, the Pirates blanked the Cubs again before scoring the game-tying and go-ahead runs. From there, the Pirates bullpen did the job. Seiya Suzuki struck out three times and the Cubs couldn’t score the whole rest of the game. There were bright spots in the offense, too. Seven different Pirates recorded a hit and Ben Gamel, on a hot streak, went three-for-four to power the Bucs to the win.
Game 14: win, at Chicago, 4-2
It took a while for this match to get started — it was raining in Chicago, and the teams sat in the clubhouse for six hours waiting for the game to commence. But once it did, it was a gem. José Quintana worked a beautiful game and the Pirates’ bullpen came in to close, allowing no runs from the second inning onward. After the bad series in Milwaukee, the Bucs were .500 again. A sign of things to come or just a lucky streak? Either way, the Bucs had secured at least a split at Wrigley, and that’s nothing to turn your nose up at.
Game 15: loss, at Chicago, 21-0
This one stung to write about. It stung to even write the score. Yes, the Cubs brought their A-game and, yes, it was an off-day for the Pirates and, yes, Chicago got some lucky bounces. And yes. At the end of the season, this will count the same as any other loss, on any other rough day at the ballpark. But this one was worse. It was a franchise record loss, the third worst in Major League history. Every pitcher got shelled. The Cubs outhit the Pirates 23-3, and the Bucs essentially lost by three touchdowns. Nothing to do but grit our teeth and move on… but it doesn’t get much worse.
Bottom Line:
It’s too early to tell whether the Pirates are for real this year, but there are some encouraging indicators. For two weeks in a row, they’ve been good — not great, but solid. The starting pitching is a huge question mark, and the team isn’t consistent at all, but they’ve got some bright spots — one of the best defenses in baseball, a bunch of good hitters, and a bullpen that you can’t turn your nose up at. Long-term, this is looking a lot like a team that could be pushing .500 all season long. But short-term, there are two more games against the Cubs on the road before a homestand against the Brewers (again) and the Padres. What the Pirates’ record is coming out of these next seven matchups — and what course that sets for the rest of the season — will depend on how well they can bounce back from that shellacking at Wrigley Field and start playing the clean baseball we’ve been privileged to see this season.

Champions League
On Tuesday, Real Madrid will travel to the Etihad to face Manchester City in the first match of the Champions League semifinals. Manchester City will be coming off of a 5-1 victory over Watford and looking to extend their winning streak to three matches. Real Madrid has momentum coming into the match, having beaten Osasuna 3-1 last weekend and looking to extend their winning streak to three matches. This match will mark the first time these sides have met since August 2020, when the postponed second leg of their round of 16 fixture was played (City won 2-1). While the current odds favor City, it would be a mistake to write out Real, especially with Benzema’s performance in the quarterfinals. In all likelihood, this will be the semifinal match to watch.
On Wednesday, Villareal will travel to Anfield to face Liverpool in the second match of the first leg of the Champions League semifinals. Liverpool is coming off of a 2-0 win against Everton and has a three-match winning streak. Villareal had a solid 2-0 victory over Valencia last weekend, beginning a two-game winning streak. This will be Villareal’s second-ever Champions League semifinals, following their first in 2006. Should Villareal advance, they will play in their first Champions League finals. The two clubs haven’t met in competition since their May 2016 game in the Europa League semifinal (Liverpool won 3-0). The odds are in Liverpool’s favor and, regardless of the final scoreline, it will be tough for Villareal. Having successfully pulled off the upset against Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals, however, Villareal have a chance, albeit a small one, if they play pristinely and capitalize on Liverpool’s mistakes.
Premier League
With 34 out of 38 matchdays gone, the Premier League season is reaching its climax. Manchester City sits at the top of the table with 80 points to their name. City reached and maintained the position on Matchday 15 after beating Watford 3-1. With their last four fixtures at Leeds, versus Newcastle, at West Ham, and versus Aston Villa (plus a postponed fixture against the Wolves), it seems unlikely that City will be dethroned.
Liverpool, sitting second in the Premier League table with 79 points, should not be discounted. Having briefly topped the table after Matchday 6 before being knocked off the top due to a draw to Manchester City on Matchday 7, Liverpool have been consistently on City’s heels since Matchday 15. However, with their last five fixtures being at Newcastle, versus Tottenham, a postponed Matchday 33 fixture against Aston Villa, versus Wolves, and a postponed match against Southhampton, Liverpool will have a tougher last couple weeks in comparison to City. Still, with just one point separating the two and five matches to be played, Liverpool could overtake the defending champions.
Chelsea sits in third with 65 points and will likely end the season there. Arsenal, currently in fourth with 60 points, will probably not move higher up the table. Fifth-placed Tottenham (58 points) may break into the top four; the result of their fixture against Liverpool will determine the final placings for both teams. Sixth-placed Manchester United (54 points) will look to maintain their place for Europa League qualification as seventh-placed West Ham (52 points) tries to overcome United.
La Liga
With 33 matchdays down and five to go (plus postponed fixtures), the race for the La Liga title is coming to a close. Despite Real Madrid sitting at the top of the table with 78 points, having opened up a 15-point margin over second-placed Barcelona, they have not yet secured the title. Still, considering their current position and remaining fixtures (over half of which are against teams sitting in the bottom half of the table), Real Madrid seems certain to maintain a good enough form to reclaim the La Liga title. Second through fourth place seem relatively set as well. Although not many points separate the teams, it seems likely that Barcelona, Sevilla, and Atlético Madrid will return to the Champions League next season.
Between fifth-placed Real Betis (57 points), sixth-placed Real Sociedad (55 points), and seventh-placed Villareal (52 points), final finishes are still undetermined. On Matchday 35, Real Sociedad will face 19th-placed Levante as Real Betis faces Barça and Villareal faces Sevilla. Real Sociedad will likely advance as both Real Betis and Villareal drop points. On Matchday 37, Villareal and Real Sociedad will face each other. The outcome will likely determine the final standings for these three clubs. If Villareal wins, they will likely qualify for the Europa League. Otherwise, Real Sociedad will return to Europe.
Bundesliga
Although there are still three matchdays out of 34 left to play, Bayern Munich opened up enough of a margin after their 3-1 win in Der Klassiker over Borussia Dortmund that they were declared the 2021/22 Bundesliga Champions and awarded the Meisterschale for the 10th consecutive season, topping the table with 75 points. Though league champions were already decided, there is still a tight competition for Champions League and Europa League qualification — the top four Bundesliga teams qualify for the former while fifth and sixth qualify for the latter. With 63 points, Borussia Dortmund guaranteed their return to the Champions League next season. However, just six points separate third and seventh place.
Bayer Leverkusen currently sit in third with 55 points — enough to guarantee a place in Europe, but not enough to secure Champions League status. With their final three fixtures against ninth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, eighth-placed Hoffenheim, and fifth-placed Freiburg, Leverkusen need to be on their A-game to qualify for a Champions League spot. Leipzig, sitting in fourth with 54 points, face a much easier rest of the season, scheduled to face 11th-placed Borussia Mönchengladbach, 14th-placed Augsburg, and 17th-placed Arminia. Fifth-placed Freiburg (52 points) and sixth-placed Union Berlin (50 points) will compete on Matchday 33, likely determining their placings relative to each other. Köln is not to be counted out, either. Despite sitting in seventh with 49 points, Köln will face Augsburg, 12th-placed Wolfsburg, and 16th-placed Stuttgart — all winnable matches.
Ligue 1
Like the situation in the Bundesliga, Paris Saint-Germain was crowned the 2021/22 Ligue 1 Champions after their draw against Lens on Matchday 34 of 38. They received the title for the 10th consecutive season, with 78 points. With the top three teams having a shot at the European top flight, fourth and fifth looking at the Europa League, and three points separating third and sixth, there’s plenty on the line in the last four matchdays of the season. With second-placed Marseille (65 points) and third-placed Rennes (59 points) playing each other on Matchday 37, fourth-placed Monaco (59 points) may knock Rennes for a shot at the Champions League. Fifth-placed Nice (57 points) will also have a good chance of bettering their position, facing 19th-placed Bordeaux and 18th-placed Saint-Étienne on Matchdays 35 and 36, respectively.
Serie A
In Italy, the title race has come down to a battle of the Milans. With 34 of 38 matchdays gone, AC Milan tops the table with 74 points, followed closely by Inter Milan with 72. Inter Milan will likely have the advantage; their remaining fixtures include 12th-placed Udinese, 14th-placed Empoli, 17th-placed Cagliari, and 16th-placed Sampdoria. AC Milan, however, will have to face seventh-placed Fiorentina, ninth-placed Verona, eighth-placed Atalanta, and 10th-placed Sassuolo. While it is certainly possible for AC Milan to best Inter Milan and claim their first Serie A title since 2011, it’s looking much more likely that Inter Milan will defend their champion status.
Napoli, in third with 67 points, will not be in contention for the title lest both Milans blunder, but will almost certainly qualify for next season’s Champions League. Juventus, in fourth with 63 points, is in the same boat. For fifth-placed Roma (58 points), sixth-placed Lazio (56 points), and seventh-placed Fiorentina (56 points), top four seems just out of reach, but all three will fight for Europa League qualification. The outcome of the match between Fiorentina and Roma on Matchday 36 will determine the ranking of those two teams relative to each other, and with Lazio likely to drop points against Juventus on Matchday 37, it’s difficult to predict which sides have a shot at a European campaign.

This article is part of an ongoing series that discusses wildlife in the Pittsburgh region. Specimens in the accompanying photos are identified by the author, which may include the use of identification tool “iNaturalist.” As such, species identifications may not always be 100 percent accurate.
White M Hairstreak Butterfly
Parrhasius m-album
The White M Hairstreak is a butterfly native to the United States and can be found mostly in states along the Atlantic coast to east Texas and as north as southeast Iowa. They are seen between March and October with peak sightings in April and September. Its wingspan is 32 to 42 millimeters. The White M Hairstreak can be found most in forests and woodlands. Oak trees serve as host to the species' larvae and adults feed on nectar from a variety of plants like dogwood, common milkweed, and sumac.
Eastern Carpenter Bee
Xylocopa virginica
The Eastern Carpenter Bee is native to the United States and found in much of the eastern United States and into Canada. They nest in a variety of wood, hence the name Carpenter Bee. Their diet consists of pollen and nectar; they do not store food in the nest and instead partake in “nectar robbing.” They use their maxillae to reach the nectar stores of plants, which bypasses pollination.
The Eastern Carpenter Bee is similar in size to bumblebees, but they have a mostly black body that has a slightly metallic purple tint. Female carpenter bees sting, though they are unlikely to do so unless one is handling them; male carpenter bees do not have a stinger, but only hover outside the hive and guard the nest.
The females of the nest are broken into three groups. The primary group is responsible for reproduction and food provisions. Secondary females help to provide for the larvae and to perform nest maintenance. Tertiary females rely on food provisions from the primary group and remain inactive while they wait for overwintering. They usually develop into primary females following their second overwintering while secondary bees rarely survive a second overwintering. 
Eastern Garter Snake
Thamnophis sirtalis ssp. sirtalis
The Eastern Garter Snake, a subspecies of Garter Snake, is native to the United States. They live across eastern North America, from southern Ontario and Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico. They are mostly found from March to November, with a peak in April and May. The snake prefers grassy or shrubby fields but will settle in a variety of environments. Their diet mostly consists of toads, frogs, slugs, and worms, but they will consume anything they can overpower. They average between 18 to 26 inches in length and are brown, black, or greenish in color and feature a yellow or white stripe (which resembles a garter strap, hence the name). Though venomous, they are fangless and harmless to humans (except in rare reactions). 
Cut-leaved Toothwort
Cardamine concatenata
This plant is native to the United States and can be found across North America in March, April, and May. It is a perennial woodland wildflower that grows in rich woods, wooded bottomlands, limestone outcrops, and rocky banks and bluffs. “Cut-leaved” comes from the five-segmented leaves that have large “teeth” on the margins and “Toothwort” comes from the tooth-like appearance of its rhizome (a modified plant stem that sends roots and shoots from its nodes). The plant has white to pinkish flowers and the vegetative parts of the plant can be anywhere from 20 to 40 centimeters. The roots of Cut-leaved Toothwort can be washed, chopped, and ground in vinegar to be used as a horseradish substitute. Other names include crow’s toes, pepper root, or purple-flowered toothwort.
Downy Woodpecker
Dryobates pubescens
The Downy Woodpecker, the smallest species of woodpecker in North America, is native to the region. Though they look similar to the Hairy Woodpecker, the Downy’s bill is smaller and is overall about two-thirds the size of the Hairy Woodpecker. The Downy Woodpecker also has spotted outer tail feathers while the Hairy’s are all white.
The Downy Woodpecker can be identified by its vocalizations, which includes a short “pik” call. It will give about a half-second between a series of four piks. It will also give a rattle-call, a short burst that sounds similar to a bouncing ball. Its drums (when it pecks into trees) are slower compared to that of other North American woodpecker species. 
Common Grackle
Quiscalus quiscula
The Common Grackle is native to North America and currently “Near Threatened” globally; its population has reduced by about 50 percent since 1970. They can be found in most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Common Grackles have long and dark bills, pale yellow eyes, and a long tail. They have an iridescent appearance on their blue-tinted heads. Males are slightly larger than females, are more iridescent, and have longer tails.
Common Grackles nest in cavities or in man-made structures in colonies, which can be quite large. They will lay four to seven eggs in a clutch (a group of eggs laid in a single season). For winter, northern Common Grackles will migrate in flocks to the Southeastern United States (a group of grackles is called a “plague.”) Grackles are omnivorous — they eat insects, minnows, frogs, eggs, berries, seeds, grain, and sometimes small birds and mice. Grackles also partake in “anting,” a maintenance behavior that involves rubbing insects on their feathers and skin.

Sega announces release date, DLC for ‘Sonic Origins’
Developer Sega announced that “Sonic Origins” will be released on June 23. The game was in early development in July 2021, and the game’s trailer was released on April 20. “Sonic Origins” will be released as part of the 30th anniversary for Sonic the Hedgehog and features four digitally remastered Sonic games: “Sonic the Hedgehog 1,” “Sonic the Hedgehog 2,” “Sonic 3 & Knuckles,” and “Sonic CD.” “Sonic Origins” will launch on PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and will be available on the Epic Games Store and Steam for PC. 
“Sonic Origins” features many new options that the originals didn’t. While players can experience the games in their original 4:3 format in “Classic Mode,” there will also be an “Anniversary Mode” that has a full screen 16:9 display and an infinite number of lives. “Story Mode” allows players to control Sonic and experience scenes from different “Sonic the Hedgehog” titles and includes new animated cutscenes. “Mirror Mode” is available after players complete Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, or Story Mode. Mirror Mode will flip the level, meaning players complete levels in the opposite direction.
Alongside the game’s release date announcement was one regarding downloadable content. The “Start Dash Pack” is for those pre-ordering the same and includes 100 bonus Coins (the game’s currency), Mirror Mode being unlocked, and a Sega Mega Drive Letterbox background. The “Premium Fun Pack” serves as a “Digital Deluxe” edition for $3.99, offering players additional hard missions, character animations on the main menu, and tracks from other “Sonic” titles. A “Premium & Classic Sound Pack” will be available for $3.99 with music tracks from Mega Drive “Sonic” titles. 
‘Rimworld’ unbanned in Australia
"Rimworld"  was given an “R 18+” classification in Australia following an appeal from developer Ludeon Studios. The studio appealed a “Refused Classification” status in March despite launching its 1.0 version without issue in 2018. When a game is given a “Refused Classification” status, it cannot be sold in Australia. With the shift to its “R 18+” rating, it now has a consumer advisory of “high impact themes and drug use.”
The reason for its original classification change was due to drug use presented in the game. “Rimworld” is a colony management game that features drug use, prisoners, and organ harvesting, though players don't have to use all of these. Following the appeal, the Australian Classification board stated, “The game includes fantasy drug use, but in the Review Board’s opinion, the game mechanic ultimately provides disincentives related to drug-taking behavior, to the point where regular drug use leads to negative consequences such as overdose, addiction, and withdrawal.”
Potential GBA emulator for Switch?
Dataminers have found hints of Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Nintendo Switch. According to a Twitter user who accessed the leaked files, both emulators seem to be functional, but are still buggy. The emulators are developed by Nintendo Europe Research and Development; the Game Boy emulator is called “Hioyo” and the Game Boy Advance emulator is “Sloop”.
A list of the games tested on the emulators also surfaced from these leaks. Games on this list include “The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,” “Golden Sun” and “Golden Sun: The Lost Age,” and “Kirby and the Amazing Mirror".
‘Xenoblade Chronicles 3,’ ‘Splatoon 3’ receive release dates
Two major Nintendo-developed games announced release dates this week — “Xenoblade Chronicles 3” slated for July 29 and “Splatoon 3” for Sept. 9. “Xenoblade Chronicles 3” was originally announced in February for a release in Sept., and “Splatoon 3” was originally announced in Feb. 2021 with more details announced in September 2021.  
“Xenoblade Chronicles 3” is an open world action role-playing game that takes place following the events of the first games in the series. The game is developed by the Nintendo-owned studio Monolith Soft, known for “Xenoblade Chronicles,” which provides support to other Nintendo development studios. Unlike the previous entries that limited the party system to three characters, this game allows up to seven characters to participate in combat. A new “Interlink system” utilizes pairs of party members and allows more powerful moves. 
“Splatoon 3” is a third-person shooter with competitive online multiplayer alongside a story-driven single player mode. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future where most life has been replaced with “Inklings” and “Octarians.” The most recent trailer confirmed the inclusion of “Turf War,” one of the main battle systems. An earlier announcement confirmed the return of the "Salmon Run" mode, and the story mode will focus around the return of mammals to the world. 
New ‘Tales from the Borderlands’ to arrive this year
Gearbox Software, the studio responsible for the “Borderlands” franchise, announced on April 21 at PAX East that a new “Tales from the Borderlands” game will be releasing later this year. “Tales from the Borderlands” is an adventure spinoff of the main franchise, and the first installment in the series was developed by TellTale Games before they closed in 2018. According to the interview, the game will be fully revealed sometime this summer.
National Labor Relations Board complaint filed against Nintendo
Following an unnamed worker’s complaint against Nintendo and Aston Carter, the National Labor Relations Board will begin to investigate the video game giant. The allegations state that Nintendo of America and Aston Carter, a firm that they use for hiring contractors, engaged in “concerted activities” and made “coercive actions” against a worker. The worker believed this interfered with the worker’s right to organize and as such, filed a complaint. 
This is one example of growing unionization efforts in the video game industry. Quality Assurance workers at Raven Software have recently been engaging in a labor dispute, which could lead to the first union in the industry.

I went into my watch of "driving home 2 u," which came out on March 25, with no knowledge of what it was, so I was surprised that it was a documentary. I was expecting something along the lines of a love child of Olivia Rodrigo’s "SOUR Prom" and Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well” short film. I was hoping for some kind of creative representation of the story behind the songs, but what I found was very different. "driving home 2 u," on Disney+, came close to "SOUR Prom" in that it debuted uniquely directed performances of every song on the album "SOUR" (which I thought was a little repetitive for Rodrigo), but it also covered the story of the creation of the album in a novel and interesting way.
Purportedly, "SOUR" was written by Olivia Rodrigo in some liminal space between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. The documentary very prettily covered the drive between the two cities as a metaphor for the journey of writing and creating, which added the fictional element I had originally been looking for. This was enhanced by overtly dramatized and unrealistic sets — Rodrigo performed and spoke in pastel diners (supposedly recreations of the ones she visited during her actual trips) and empty gas stations in the middle of the desert, in antique motel rooms and in the middle of the forest. She drove this odd, dusty Jeep that must have cost a fortune from an antique car collector. It was so obviously well-designed that it didn’t seem like a documentary; at one point they even showed the circular camera track used to film one section of performance. There was an element of falsehood which did not help the scriptedness of the interview content itself.
There were scenes that were obviously shot for the film, forced positive testimonials from Rodrigo’s co-creators, and barely-veiled allusions to the motivations for songs like “driver’s license.” Throughout, Rodrigo seemed to shirk off the fact that much of her album was known to be a public call-out of Joshua Basset. Instead, Rodrigo focused on what she referred to often as “devastation” on the album. While I obviously cannot attest to the physical, mental, or emotional state of the artist, the way she discussed the real-life behind the album spoke to her background as a child actress — constantly the center of attention and relatively privileged. Even her claim that she felt so caught up with her newfound fame rang empty in the context of her childhood stardom and clear intention to capitalize on the lottery win of “driver’s license” by hastily throwing together an album from the (may I note, very good) recesses of her voice memos.
That being said, anyone who likes "SOUR" (which I do) probably has in some way connected to the power of Rodrigo’s raw rage — tracks like “brutal” and “good 4 u” trigger a kind of teenage angst that is so appealing, regardless of its origin. Most of Rodrigo’s songs work well because she knows her audience, even if she seemed to avoid that idea in "driving home 2 u." The entire aesthetic of the film seemed angled toward the indie-ification of a pop-oriented artist — both in method and visuals. Anyone who follows Rodrigo closely knows about her deep artistic connection with Taylor Swift, who is equally guilty of trying to add depth to her career in places where there frankly just isn't any.
A well-done, honest aspect of "driving home 2 u" was the sporadic song performances that followed the story of the album. Staging, costuming, and instrumental choices all served to highlight Rodrigo’s spectacular voice and simple writing. I particularly loved the orchestral version of “good 4 u” that pulled out the pain inside of it and the live looping of “traitor” at a gas station. 
The film itself was stylistically beautiful and well directed by Stacey Lee. It captured all the interesting facets of Olivia Rodrigo and her artistic journey, while diving into what seemed to me to be an entirely new genre of film. Simultaneously music video, documentary, and fiction, "driving home 2 u" brought new life to Rodrigo’s album.

In my capacity as a smug college student, it has been my duty to tell everyone that I go to Carnegie Mellon. The structure of the conversation will vary, but I always mention two things. I start with the fact that Carnegie Mellon is the best ranked graduate school for artificial intelligence. People like when I say that. They often cheer, maybe hit me with a “tell me more,” and rarely roll their eyes if they’re some sort of enlightened humanities-loving hippy. 
The second thing I mention is not as popular. As soon as the words “exclusive Bubly sponsorship” leave my lips, people go ballistic. There are boos, jeers, “Can you believe this guy?”s and so on. I never knew the topic was so contentious! I was a SodaStream man, living off my parents' gas purchases, and the transition to Bubly was very smooth for me. I remember going to my friend Clara's house as a youth, and trying her SodaStream Coke or Orange flavorings. I kept it real. Even then I preferred unflavored bubbles. However, a nice lime Bubly is no sweat off of my back. The carbonated water fandom obviously disagrees, so I have made it my mission to scientifically demonstrate the best, and worst, carbonated water variants. I must mention my incredibly strong distaste of small bubble plastic brands, brands so unknown I don’t even need to mention them. One swig fills your mouth with little pricks, and your heart with hatred for whatever executive decided to attempt to increase the market share of their company with such a bone headed endeavor. 
I must introduce the work horses of the business, Perrier and San Pellegrino. Their basic variants do not call attention to themselves, but they remain a vital portion of the worldwide intake. They were the most common brands I drank during my stay in France, which no doubt leads to my semi-uncritical support for them. 
Being owned by Nestlé, Perrier has some problematic elements. Chief among these problems is the unnecessary diversification of bubble level. 11 years after being acquired, Perrier came out with Eau de Perrier, a less carbonated and therefore less satisfactory variant. This was so catastrophic that Perrier almost went through a complete restructuring. I have nothing but distaste for Eau de Perrier. The carbonation is minimal enough that a swig leaves the mind with an impression not of a sophisticated palate pleaser, but that of a drink left uncapped in the sun. The ever so faint impression of carbonation masked by a preposterous aftertaste. It is my firm belief that brands need only a normally carbonated version, a strongly carbonated version, and five flavors at most. Too many choices inevitably lead to uninformed consumers picking the worst one, and I dread to think of the legions of possible converts we lost to alcoholism after their first taste of the better path was Eau de Perrier. Disgusting. I am rather fond of normal Perrier, a fact I mention to everyone I meet, but I will admit it’s shortcomings. Perrier’s pseudo-natural acquisition results in a carbonation level below that which my tongue and pharynx find most pleasant. I will admit that if I could only drink it, I would have a much lower opinion of it. However, the memory of it pleases me. San Pellegrino receives a similar assessment. With slightly more bubbles, and those delightfully acidic lemonades and orangeades they put out, I hold San Pellegrinos in slightly higher regard.
Of course, if you want an unflavored sparkling water, the undisputed king is the SodaStream machine. Allowing experienced users a fine degree of control over carbonation, you can produce palatal experiences tuned to your preferred degree of pop at that specific moment. I, through my parents, have been a patron for many years now, and currently prefer my bubbles at a full gas tank four “fart” level, or a near empty 14 second hold. Critics will argue that the machine renders carbonation artificially and that there is no replacing the natural spring levels of carbonation. These are luddites. As a man of the people who isn’t even all that into sparkling water when you get right down to it, I know that the freedom of expression offered by a SodaStream machine and a fine hand is enough for anyone. SodaStream can't fit every situation. In hypothetical situations where someone is on the road, or their siblings refused to let them commandeer a SodaStream machine, or they realized that it can’t be considered a job expense if the person doesn’t get paid for their writings, these people must resort to cans. Market analysis has presumably shown companies that consumers prefer their sparkles flavored when on the road, so there are sadly few unflavored canned carbonated waters for me to review. A pure LaCroix has a pleasant tone that lets the mind appreciate the undertones often masked by a hipster flavor. Although I seem a god, I am a man with a finite memory, and will only be able to review the few flavors I was able to get my ungrubbed fingers on. 
LaCroix Flavors:
Beach Plum trades a good taste for a funny name. The allusion to a beach bum is obviously welcome, but I prefer my drinks to taste good, and not make me chuckle when I see them at CVS. Lime is definitely Limey, although not in a British way. You strongly feel the lime, yet there is still a strong sweetness to it, the hallmark of a LaCroix. Razz-Cranberry is a crime against humanity. I once went to the Coca Cola museum, and they had a seasonal gingerbread flavor. It was so good, but they never released it. Yet the LaCroix corporation has the guts to release this! Pamplemousse is the quintessential La Croix flavor. It has the strong fruit flavor that LaCroix lovers adore, while still using a fruit that tastes good. One question though. Do people really only drink this as a healthy alternative to lemonade?
Bubly Flavors:
Honestly, all Bubly cans have very similar flavors, all equal in mildness. I have recently found myself drinking large amounts of blood orange grapefruit and mango passion fruit bounce, strictly due to availability. My favorite has to be grapefruit, and least favorite the cherry. Of course, the gap between favorite and least favorite is minute, and I would willingly indulge in a can of any type.
After reading this far in, you might consider me some sort of carbonated-water radical. But I’m nothing compared to some of the more ardent members of the community. One writes:
Seltzer is great. Many people will back me up on this point. What many people don’t understand is why I dislike water. I was introduced to seltzer at a young age and I loved it. The bubbly sensation that rises up you, the refreshing-ness of the drink, the satisfaction of it all. We aren’t here for an ad though, and I’m sure you’re wondering why I dislike water. Water leaves a horrible taste in my mouth that just tastes weird. Maybe for other people it’s less obvious but I know the taste is there. Sure if I was dying of thirst I’d drink water, but if you drink water right now, I beg you to think about the taste.
I hope you have left this article satisfied and satiated. On this all-out brand war, SodaStream definitely wins. It has everything that I specifically need in a sparkling water. It feels better, and is more portable than can brands. If I had to choose one, I wouldn't go with Carnegie Mellon’s choice. I prefer a milder taste to go with my bubbles, but the average consumer prefers their water more soda-like and less water-like. As Carnegie Mellon services an entire community of well rounded average consuming urbanites, the LaCroix choice should be clear. Bubly was chosen simply because the brand was created by Pepsi, who sponsors Carnegie Mellon. On that subject, I hope Pepsi’s got their lawyers ready, because I have on good information that there are a couple Coke vending machines in Doherty that have been getting frequent refills.

Los Angeles, CA — On the subject of her most recent screenplay, a local writer feels conflicted. “I understand how important representation is,” screenwriter and bartender Sophia Hagelman says. “I just feel like I might be treading some past ground here.” Fresh off the heels of Disney’s first gay character Artie from "Cruella" (a flamboyant David Bowie impersonator that works with a woman who kills dogs), Disney’s first gay character MacGregor from "Jungle Cruise" (a “confirmed bachelor” whose “interests lie elsewhere”) and Disney’s first gay character Phastos from "Eternals" (a 7,000-year-old man-loving robot that invented the atomic bomb), Sophia has been tasked to create Disney’s first gay character, this time, a lesbian. This new character, currently named Melinda, is inspired by Sophia’s own lived experience as an out (and about) lesbian woman. 
As one of the 14 people working on the script for Disney's new live action adaptation of "Finding Nemo," Disney executives/starving author wranglers explain that she was chosen for her understanding of what it is like to be “into hugging and kissing women even though she is also a woman.” Charlston Rockefeller-Kurtzmann (Mickey Mouse cupbearer by trade, Disney executive by choice) explains: “When we decided to include our first gay character in our new film 'Finding Nemo,' we knew that we would have to make a splash. When I say make a splash, I am of course referencing our upcoming motion picture 'Finding Nemo,' as well as the original animated version of 'Finding Nemo' and its animated sequel 'Finding Dory.' Both of those movies can be found on Disney+, and we have many toys and accessories available featuring characters from both of those movies. You can additionally experience the lives of Nemo and Dory at one of our Disney-quariums, or visit Disney World or DisneyLand or Paris Disney or Disneyland Hong Kong or CMU Africa or Disneyland Japan for various 'Finding Nemo' experiences. And when I say make a splash, I mean big. Melinda will be sitting on a bench with an ambiguously-coded girlfriend, and definitely point at Nemo when he strikes a cool pose. To strengthen the historic importance of this moment, we will of course be issuing a press release in English, French, and German about how totally gay, slay, and bae Melinda is. We will also be releasing a separate press release in Russian, Mandarin, Turkish, and Arabic. I am not free to disclose the contents of that release at this current moment.” 
When asked for more information about Melinda, Hagelman is glad to elaborate. “She’s a character that means a lot to me. Like me, she owns two dogs and has a loving girlfriend, also named Joanna! I've created a pretty complicated backstory for her. Steering away from classic tropes, Melinda didn’t have a rough coming out experience, and has a rocky relationship with her mother for religious reasons, and not homophobic ones. Melinda is an intellectual. She’s witty, loves mouthing lines that cannot be heard, and loves residing on the far right side of the frame, where she could easily be cropped out.” 
Hagelman is obviously very excited about the film, but what about everyone else? We decided to speak with some former Buzzfeed listicle writers for some more insightful takes, and then to some online homophobes to keep the article balanced. Wendy “Minnie’s worst nightmare” Angle expresses her complaints: “I love gay people, and of course representation is good, but I really would like for Disney to release a second gay character. Every first gay character keeps getting effortlessly removed from select international releases, which I personally dislike. However, I have placed the concept of loving Disney very deeply into my identity, and consider myself a Disney adult, so I fully support Disney in all their homosexual endeavors. I would love Disney even more if they came out with a second gay character, maybe with two lines ambiguously about loving men, so that I could write some spicy fanfics about it. Of course, we’ll be writing those regardless (laughs).” 
Charlie “Minnie is my Waifu” Pierce has some other ideas. “I’m only a little homophobic, and I think that Disney has gone too far. If they keep releasing groundbreaking first gay characters like this, me and other merry men like me will have no choice other than to stop watching children’s movies. And that’s just us lesser homophobes! Think about all the men so homophobic they can’t even talk to women! These are all the valuable customers you will be missing out on Disney. I’ve spoken my piece, now leave me be. I have some Funko Pops that need purchasing.”
This is on the scene reporter Zachary Gelman, signing off.

This article contains spoilers for "There Will Be Blood."
As my Instagram followers all know and hate, I am in a long running Paul Dano phase and have been ever since I saw "The Batman" over spring break. While this has been a great inconvenience to other people, I feel it is benefitting me on the whole. I have since been exposed to movies such as "Okja," "Little Miss Sunshine," and the subject of today’s review, "There Will Be Blood." Loosely based on the Upton Sinclair novel "Oil!" and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, "There Will Be Blood" follows oilman Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) on his quest for wealth and his gradual descent into crippling greed. As the movie plays out, we see Plainview through his first taste of riches, the start of his oil company, the adoption/theft of his "son" HW, and his quest to drill up all of the oil in Little Boston. 
Let me just start by saying that this movie is harrowing. It is so relentless, there really is not a relaxed moment. Plainview is constantly lying and going back on his promises, and I pretty much spent the entire movie waiting for things to blow up in his face. Day-Lewis perfectly portrays him with this very calm, kind surface, but you can tell there’s something sinister running underneath. The one redeeming quality Plainview seems to have is that he really loves and cares for HW (until he doesn’t, but we’ll get to that later). Paul Dano’s Eli Sunday is very unsettling. He has this soft spoken way about him, and is oppressively religious. Something about him is so ominous. He is a character that is just… unsettling. There are also an alarming amount of oil rigs. Even today, they are astoundingly dangerous to work on, and we see four drilling-related accidents in this movie. Let me tell you, maybe this is the Good Christian Woman coming out of me, but I really wish Plainview had let him bless that well. The creepy little Jesus boy probably would’ve been kinder to you if you had just let him bless your well.
My favorite thing to be distressed about during this movie was HW’s wellbeing. I don’t know what it was about this kid, but I swore immediately that if he died during this movie I was gonna have to find a way to kill a fictional character. Luckily, he survived, but he was often left unsupervised around oil wells. As you can imagine, this did not end well. When the drilling finally breaks through, a great blast of oil comes bursting out of the ground in a massive geyser, throwing HW off the section of rigging he was standing on and causing him to hit his head, hard. While Plainview is initially very concerned about HW, as soon as he gets his son inside, Plainview immediately seems way more excited about the amount of oil he’s just found than being concerned about HW’s obvious distress and poor condition. While his son lays inside, frightened and confused by sudden hearing loss, Daniel grins widely at his fountain of money. This is our first peak into Plainview’s descent. 
Daniel Day-Lewis is such a stand-out performer here. His unraveling is palpable; you can feel his greed growing from one scene to the next. He does increasingly desperate things to prove himself as an oilman, and it eats him up from the inside out. By the final scene, 25 years have passed and Plainview is surrounded by opulence, but he is a lonely alcoholic and wildly unhinged. This corruption of his mental state culminates in Plainview harshly cutting off HW and mercilessly revealing that he isn’t actually his son. In a final blowout with Eli Sunday, Plainview mocks him by forcing him to pronounce himself a false prophet and say that God is a superstition, before crushing his final hopes and killing him with a bowling pin. It is truly astounding how believable Day-Lewis makes this — it genuinely wouldn’t have been the same film with anyone less skilled.
One of the things that immediately drew me into this movie was the score. From start to finish, it's filled with some of the most tense orchestra music I’ve ever been subjected to while watching a movie. Even in moments where nothing particularly exciting was happening, they were backed by this harsh, dissonant, percussive score that never let you forget about the dangerous oil drilling happening around the clock. As the credits rolled, I noticed the score composer wasn’t anyone I had heard of before, so I Googled his name. Imagine my surprise when I found out that this intense score was written by none other than the guitarist for Radiohead, Jonny Greenwood.
As previously discussed, I’m terrible at thinking critically about movies and can only rate them on a scale of “I had a bad time watching this” to “I had a good time watching this.” Given that I am a huge fan of watching a man’s slow descent into madness, and there are plenty of scenes featuring Paul Dano just being a freaky little weirdo (as well as excellent direction, sound design, score, and cinematography), "There Will Be Blood" falls firmly into the “I had a GREAT time watching this” category, and I would highly recommend this movie.

“Pass the scallops, boy,” shouts a conspicuously pointy-headed new hire at Josh’s Lobster Hut. 
I’m writing this from the back of the eating area at the Mobile, an Alabama seafood restaurant where the newest season of "Undercover Boss" is taking place. Each episode, employees get the opportunity to work with their boss, though they don’t know who he or she might be. To celebrate the 157th Anniversary of the Ku Klux Klan, this season’s undercover boss is none other than the Mobile Chapter’s Grand Wizard.
“I’m still trying to suss out who it could be,” says busboy and junior rally organizer Argus Underwood. Part of the fun of this show, I’ve found, is trying to determine who the boss is. Obviously, the makeup and costume team is hard at work obscuring their appearance, but usually there are “tells” that give them away. At an automechanic, the boss might look like everyone else but be unusually concerned with customer satisfaction. At a McDonalds, the boss might apply fake acne and hair grease but have a bizarre obsession with loss prevention. But at Josh’s Lobster Hut, famously a front for America’s favorite hate group, it’s harder to suss out the Wizard from the merely hateful Warlocks.
“Seafood spots have been a Klan haven since, hmmm, I’d say about the 50s,” reports local Klan historian and hopscotch Bronze medalist Mackey Dodgeson. According to Dodgeson, locations just like Josh’s Lobster Hut serve as easy places of work for what would otherwise be unemployable bigots. “Put a Klansmen in front of a cash register anywhere else, and they just cease to function. The register has black keys? The products are from China? The receipts are vaguely Semetic? Forget it. But somehow the smell of hush puppies and popcorn shrimp overrides the part of 'em that hates. Me, I just think they make a mean crab leg!” says store assistant manager and aspiring gay wedding cake-denier Cathleen Redmayne. I can’t help but agree as I dunk the delicious sea bug’s appendage into golden butter.
Watching the workers puzzle out the identity of the Grand Wizard among them reminds me of my childhood. I’ve seen the same expression of racist confusion on grandmas and truckers alike as they tried to find out if I was mixed or just Dominican. From arranging fries into incorrect swastikas to see who corrects them, to playfully dropping hints that they’re ok with race-mixing, I feel like I’m watching a game of white-supremacist cat and mouse. Of course, I know who’s the Grand Wizard; but as a Texan, I know how to keep a racist secret around delicious food. 
All I will say is, tune in this week for the conclusive episode! And after that, keep the tube on to see the shocking reveal of the fourth property twin, whom they’ve kept locked up in the basement of just the nicest brownstone you’ve ever seen!

We hope you are having a great day, PILLBOX readers — but we hope that we can make your day just a little better. We have a selection of calmer articles this week, for people on the winddown before the final "Omega Grind" of the year begins. Our theme this week is "White Heat." It's been blatantly sweltering this week, and we hope these little articles of protest will return us to the Pittsburgh weather we love and hold so dearly.
First on deck, we have a lovely article by Anna Cappella, all about Olivia Rodrigo's proto-sophomoric effort "driving home 2 u." Lovers of comprehensive takes will love the full throated analysis of themes of the movie, and lovers of hot takes will love her scathing critiques on artificiality.
Then we have two articles by the thankfully inimitable Zachary Gelman. One a comprehensive vaguely humorous analysis of a large variety of sparkling water flavors stylistically as mentioned in the "Calvin and Hobbes" bubblegum magazine strip, the other an Onion style article on the phenomenon of the first gay Disney character.
Haley Williams returns with a movie review about "There Will Be Blood," featuring Paul Dano, who's living rent-free in her head. Danophiles rejoice, your unconventionally attractive king is back in the spotlight for one more week. But don't worry, once he's gone I'm sure you'll find another quirky softboy to latch on to.
Zivan Vasquez drops one spicy satirical masterpiece: an "Undercover Boss" setup involving the Ku Klux Klan. His imagination somehow has still not reached any bounds, and as his second to last week as a Carnegie Mellon student, we hope he comes out in full force for our final issue next week.
Given to us by the grace of God, finally we have some beautiful poems written by Anna Lulushi. Fake fans will weep that they didn't take the chance to get acquainted with Lulushisms before the Milk and Honey style contract. I'd be very wary to pass these three poems by.
Bless up reader, the semester is almost over.
With blood, sweat, and tears,
Zachary Gelman & Pria Dahiya

The energy in front of the City-County Building was charged with hope on Friday afternoon. Dozens of people came together for Earth Day, celebrating with songs, poetry, and call-outs against the fossil fuel industry. In addition to the universal dangers of climate change, the rally emphasized the intersectionality of environmentalism. 
“They're choosing the poorest communities — the Blackest and brownest communities,” said Brandi Fisher regarding the placement of facilities that produce toxic waste. Fisher is the president and CEO of the Alliance for Police Accountability. “Our race, ethnicity, income, or immigration status shouldn't matter when it comes to having a stake in the facilities that end up in our backyard.”
Black Lives Matter posters were raised alongside cardboard canvases that ranged from “Divest” to “I want a hot date with the planet.” Interspersed among “No gas, no oil, keep the carbon in the soil” were chants validating Black and queer communities. 
Elise Silvestri, a senior at Obama Academy, was one of only two Obama students at the rally. Of course Silvestri was there — she helped organize the event. But where were her classmates? “When I asked them to come they were like, ‘I don’t have time; I have to work.’ That really speaks to … this divide [in climate advocacy] that really exists.” 
The majority — 53 percent — of Obama Academy students are low-income. It has the second-lowest percentage of low-income students among non-charter Pittsburgh Public high schools. “Climate justice is racial justice,” said CAPA senior Luna Plaza on the steps of the City-County Building. In addition to the disproportionate risk communities of color face, Plaza spoke about her frustration with the lack of representation among teachers and administrators at her school, how she doesn’t see her experience reflected in her educators. CAPA, a creative arts charter school, has a teaching staff that is 93 percent white, 31 percent higher than its student population.
Lisa Gonzalez, a Pittsburgh native, is disappointed both in Pittsburgh Public Schools and the education system at large. “I have grandkids. I don’t want them in a world like this. … Schools are teaching European history, but that’s not our history. We’ll be equals when they teach true Black history.” The conversation about education links closely with environmentalism, Gonzalez told The Tartan, because waste practices influence who lives where, and neighborhoods determine feeder schools. In her 55 years as a Pittsburgh resident, Gonzalez said affordable housing was the biggest change the city has made. As in — it’s getting harder to live here, and people are being pushed out. “I have family that left [Pittsburgh] to raise their kids somewhere else.”
Climate justice isn’t Gonzalez’s main fight; her advocacy centers on equitable transportation. But she showed up for Earth Day, because “you can’t just fight for one community. You have to fight for all the communities.” 
Silvestri led the rally alongside Ilyas Khan, a senior at Winchester Thurston. Both are part of the Sunrise Movement, a political environmentalist organization for people under 35. The Pittsburgh chapter has about 35 active members, who organize teach-ins, canvassing efforts, and — as of Friday — climate rallies. 
“It takes people power to create political power,” Silvestri said in an interview with The Tartan. “This fight is for everyone.” That’s why it’s so important to promote racial and economic justice, she explained: “People don’t have the capacity to pay attention.” Access to transportation and ability to take time off work both factor into participation, underscoring environmentalism’s intersectionality. 
Beyond protesting for climate justice, the rally was a source of community. Activists wove their way through the crowd, passing out flyers and asking for petition signatures. Political posters were exchanged for petition clipboards as participants freed their hands, jotting their names beside campaigns for green energy in Pittsburgh. 
One woman wore a tambourine like a necklace and walked along the edge of the march. Without breaking stride, she would step up onto the sidewalk and smoothly pass flyers to pedestrians. When there were no passersby for her to hand a brightly colored paper, she slipped off the tambourine and shook it to the beat of the chants.
The group marched through downtown Pittsburgh, growing as they accumulated pedestrians. “Off the sidewalks into the streets,” co-organizer Ilyas Khan called into a megaphone. “Join us, folks!” 
One boy with a backpack slung across his shoulders slipped into the crowd and asked a woman what climate change was. After receiving a three-sentence explainer, the boy shouted, “It’s Earth Day, y’all! You know what it is!” A block later, another group of boys joined, laughing and cheering. 
Buses lined the sides of the street, waiting for activists to pass. One driver tapped along to the beat as protesters chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, fossil fuels have got to go.” Car horns honked in support. Petitions and flyers were passed through rolled-down car windows. 
During a lull in the protest, onlookers watched dubiously. “Y’all ain’t even protesting — y’all just marching,” one man called from the sidewalk. “Protest!” he encouraged. 
In between leading chants and introducing speakers, Khan checked in on participants. “How are y’all doing? Y’all look exhausted,” he said to a group of middle schoolers sitting on the curb. 
Energy began picking up again when Edwin Everhart led “Abre La Frontera,” written by Jose Ochoa. “Deje que canten,” the group sang together. “Make the land whole again.”
In front of the City-County Building, a man with a yellow shirt, yellow bandana, and black guitar approached the mic. Mike Stout assumed his role as song leader, building to the chorus: “Stop, stop, stop the frack attack.” The crowd danced as Stout jumped up and down. From the first floor of the City-County Building, a white-haired woman watched, her face an inch from the window glass. 
Silvestri led the crowd in “There are More Waters Rising.” As with all songs and speeches delivered during the rally, this one was accompanied by a sign translator. 
Speeches were spaced between songs, like the one given by a high schooler in a patterned, rainbow skirt. “Recycling is a scam,” she said. “Although we should all be doing our best to reduce single-use plastics ... We can never forget the ones responsible for the plastics crisis are the ones who keep making plastic: the fossil fuel industry. They are cracking our communities, poisoning our air, polluting our water, creating generations of damage. … We should be furious at every part of the system that perpetuates this violence — from the cops who protect pipelines over people to the banks and insurers who finance this violence.”
The student called out the hypocrisy of clean, responsible fracking and labeled carbon capture alternatives a “false solution.” She encouraged people to sit with their “rage and grief, because that is what it means to love this place and love our people. Be furious at the fossil fuel industry and many of our elected leaders who look at southwestern Pennsylvania … as nothing more than a sacrifice zone for their profit.”

This past Friday, Mayor Ed Gainey joined the Institute of Politics and Strategy for a town hall, where over 150 members of the community joined over Zoom. He discussed his first 100 days in office, including the crises and challenges his administration faced going into his term. 
Gainey assumed office on Jan. 3, and within his first month in office, Pittsburgh was hit with a couple of the city’s first snow storms and the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse. Soon after, a high school student was shot and killed outside Oliver Citywide Academy, prompting Gainey to visit the local schools and talk to students as a first step towards making schools safer and addressing the spike in violence. 
“And some people might not have seen this as a big step but trust me, it was. Because some of these kids thought that death was okay. There’s this spike of violence in the city and in the country, and I wanted these kids to know that there’s quality in their life. That there’s value in them. And that you always have to work to try and be the best version of you. And know that somebody cares about you,” Mayor Gainey said. 
The issue of gun violence was brought up by multiple people later on during the town hall as they called for him to address what the city is doing to address gun violence after the tragic mass shooting in the Northside that left eight injured and two dead on Easter Sunday. The shooting happened at a party being held at an AirBnB, and two 17-year-olds from Pittsburgh Public Schools were killed. The question posed to Mayor Gainey during the town hall asked about ways that the city is working toward long term solutions for gun violence.
Gainey said closing cases was number best short term solution for city safety, and that he was in contact with local law enforcement about aspects of the case that he could not disclose. To address long term solutions, Gainey spoke about the culture of violence enveloping American youth, citing social media, music, and video games. 
In that same vein, he addressed concerns about over-policing and issues with the prison system. He talked about community-oriented policing, and how it works only with the right mindset: He talked about his own experiences with inequity in policing across the city: “I witnessed it myself,” Gainey said. He talked about how the police would check up on his grandmother when he lived with her in Oakland as a kid, but when they moved to East Liberty, there was no one checking up on them. In Gainey’s words, community-oriented policing only works when, “it’s not about ‘What door am I knocking on?’ but rather ‘What door am I knocking on to serve and protect?’” 
“We can talk about the first hundred days you know because we got a story to tell. But the reality is that the first hundred days don’t define us,” Gainey said. “It doesn’t matter what we did yesterday or the day before or the first hundred days. It only matters what we accomplish going forward and how we build a city for all.”

COVID cases at Carnegie Mellon surged to a record-breaking high this month. Since April 1, 370 students on campus have tested positive, compared to the second-highest count of 197 in February. 
The convergence of the BA.2 variant, Carnival weekend, and recent mask-optional policy led to an unprecedented spike. Last week, the university said Isolation and Quarantine (IQ) Housing would only be offered to students with moderate or severe symptoms. All other positive students were instructed to isolate in place, even if their roommate did not test positive for COVID-19. 
Following the announcement, the university made a distinct change to its COVID dashboard. Rather than reporting the percent of students in IQ Housing, it now reports “the total number of students who are currently isolating or quarantining in residential housing.” This means it’s no longer possible to know IQ Housing capacity. 
On Wednesday, before the dashboard change was made, only 10 percent of IQ Housing — 12 students — was in use. Yet more than a hundred students living on campus were positive. Why were so many students isolating in their dorms, when 90 percent of IQ Housing was available?
When The Tartan asked Peter Kerwin, the Director of Media Relations, he explained: That most cases are mild,  "and these are the residential students who are isolating-in-place. This is in keeping with how residents have historically navigated communicable illnesses such as the flu or mononucleosis. Residential students at higher risk and/or with moderate-to-severe symptoms will continue to be temporarily relocated to our dedicated IQ housing locations.”
It was not made clear why the university would not tap into facility resources it has the capacity to fill. The university maintained its decision from last week that it would not provide a list of residence halls where students are — or are not — isolating. However, multiple residential advisors (RAs) said they would not be surprised if most if not all dorms are housing COVID-positive students.

In place of the Undergraduate Student Senate meeting on April 21, the Finance Committee (headed by senator Diana Crookston) held the university's second annual Finance Town Hall. Presenters included Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Angela Blanton, Associate Vice President and Director of Enrollment Services Lisa Krieg, and Director of Finance, Student Affairs Jennifer Cox-Siegel.
Blanton shared information regarding the university’s revenues and expenditures. About 46 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s current income is student-based, while roughly 71 percent of its costs are associated with serving students. Blanton also broke down where the university’s revenues come from and where they go.
In fiscal year 2021 (FY21), the university had a total of $1.283 billion in operating revenue and support. Thirty-five percent came from sponsored projects (revenues from third-parties like the federal government for research projects), 11 percent was from gifts and endowment distributions (gifts received from donors and from the Carnegie Mellon endowment), one percent came from investment income, seven percent came from “other revenue” (government-received financial aid, royalties on investments, third party-sponsored reimbursement of Carnegie Mellon's international program), 44 percent comes from tuition and fees (undergraduate, graduate, and pre-college tuition; net of student-based financial aid), and two percent comes from auxiliary services provided by the university (housing, dining, parking, etc.).
The breakdown of tuition is $279 million from undergraduate ($397 million gross, $118 million from financial aid), $256 million from graduate ($315 million gross, $60 million from financial aid), and $34 million from other tuition. 
The university had a total operating cost of $1.267 billion in FY21. The difference of $16 million between operating cost and revenue will go into future university investment. Blanton gave the example of the Highmark Health Pavilion, which will open fall 2023. Though a large part of the building's funds come from outside sources, the university will pay for some of the associated costs. 
Blanton went on to discuss the university’s operating costs by function. Twenty-nine percent of costs are for sponsored projects (research related expenses sponsored and funded by third parties), three percent is for auxiliary services, four percent is for student services (student affairs administration, enrollment services, financial aid services, etc.), nine percent is for capital funded by operations (building construction and renovations), 11 percent put toward administration and institutional support (president, operations, legal, risk management), 13 percent goes into academic support (provost, college deans, libraries and computing services, etc.), and 31 percent is for instructional and departmental research (academic-related expenses focused on student instruction, curriculum development, and academic advising). 
When comparing the revenue and expense coverage, Blanton noted that revenue for sponsored projects and auxiliary revenue covered their respective expenses. The rest of the revenue coming from students and other funding sources went toward student-serving expenses.
The next section focused on comparisons between Carnegie Mellon and peer universities. There was a brief discussion that Carnegie Mellon has 16 programs that rank into the top five of their field in the U.S. News and World Report Undergraduate Program Rankings, with nearly double that ranking in the top 20 of their category nationally. A graph showed the contributions of educational expenditures per student from external sources like gifts and endowment income compared to tuition share. Out of the universities shown (which included MIT, CalTech, UPenn, Brown, and others), Carnegie Mellon had the highest share of per-student expenditures come from tuition at 69 percent of the estimated $67,000 spent per student. 
While Carnegie Mellon was toward the lower end of expenditures per student, the reason they had the highest percentage coming from tuition share is due to its comparatively low internal revenue sources. For instance, MIT has the highest expenditures per student at $239,000, but only 14 percent of that comes from tuition since they a large internal revenue from gifts and endowments. 
In the upcoming academic year 2022-23 (AY22-23), tuition will increase by four percent, which is higher than the previous increase of 3.2 percent in AY20-21. There was no tuition increase during AY21-22 due to COVID-19. Carnegie Mellon annually raises their tuition at about the same pace as their private university peers. It was also noted that Carnegie Mellon meets the full need of its students who apply for financial aid in alignment with tuition increases to support access and persistence. In the past six years, the annual financial aid spending has increased 55 percent, totaling $120.8 million in FY22.
Blanton said the reason for the tuition raise is “to address increases in operating expenses, personnel costs (faculty, staff, students), academic facilities renovations, and the student experience.” The increased funds are expected to promote “a world-class education.” The Board of Trustees decided on a four percent increase following recommendation from university leadership. Analysis and simulations played a large role in how university leadership arrived at a recommendation, which encompasses the university’s mission and strategic goals, the anticipated increases in the cost of students’ educational experiences, and financial aid needed to meet the full need of students.
Krieg focused on undergraduate financial aid. Her first topic was the goals of financial aid, including access for students from all socio-economic backgrounds, supporting equal access and increasing enrollment diversity, meeting financial need and decreasing student financial stress, and promoting the university's retention rate.
Students who are U.S. citizens and permanent residents can apply for financial aid through Carnegie Mellon. They must complete two forms: the FAFSA from the U.S. federal government and the CSS profile from the College Board. Both give an estimated family contribution (EFC) of how much a family is expected to contribute to their child’s education. A student’s financial need is the difference between cost of attendance and a student’s EFC. According to Krieg, the FAFSA and CSS profiles may give slightly different numbers since the CSS profile takes more consideration of students' families' assets. Carnegie Mellon uses the EFCs from both to determine how much financial aid to provide. 
Since fall 2016, Carnegie Mellon has met the full need for every admitted first-year. Currently, 45 percent of undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon receive grants from the university. Additionally, 14 to 16 percent of each first-year class receive Pell Grants, awarded by the federal government to students with exceptional financial need. Admission at Carnegie Mellon has a “need-blind stance,” so financial need of U.S. applicants is not considered for admission. It was also noted following a question from the audience that domestic and international students are treated equally in the application process; international students are not treated differently even if they will not receive financial aid.
In AY20-21, $150.3 million was distributed to students for financial aid. Of this, $113.9 million from Carnegie Mellon grants, $8.2 million from federal grants, $6.9 million from tuition remission (students who are dependents of Carnegie Mellon staff or faculty have at least part of their tuition at Carnegie Mellon or another institution paid by the university), $3.7 million is from other grants, and $17.6 million is from “self-help.” Any aid that a student has to apply for on their own falls under self-help. This includes $10.4 million in federal student loans, $6 million in private student loans, and $1.2 million in federal work study.
Krieg said nearly all financial aid applicants have historically been awarded federal direct subsidized loans. These are preferred over unsubsidized loans since no interest is accrued while the student is enrolled in an educational institution. The cohort that graduated in AY20-21 had 38 percent of students borrow federal loans, with the average student graduating with $20,353 in federal loan debt. It was also noted that almost all Carnegie Mellon students repay their loans. For the past five years, less than one percent of federal loans borrowed for Carnegie Mellon tuition default in their first three years of repayment.
In the past three years, the average amount of federal debt that the average Carnegie Mellon student graduated with decreased from $25,900 to $20,000. This coincides with a decrease in the number of students who graduated over the last four years, starting at 59 percent in 2018 to 38 percent in 2020 and 2021.
Krieg also showed the institution grant amounts Carnegie Mellon distributed over the past six years and forecasts for the next four. The main growth between 2016 and 2021 came from undergraduate tuition. Gift amount makes up a very small fraction of the total funds distributed to undergraduates, and endowment funds remained fairly stable until extreme increases in the past three years. Projections for the next four years estimate an increase of about $30 million, including a sizable increase from endowments and undergraduate tuition. 
The main reason Krieg gave for the increase in institutional spending is the university’s “meet-full-need approach.” Though most of the increase in aid spending comes from tuition revenue, Krieg highlighted the importance of giving to the Carnegie Mellon campaign to raise funds for financial aid when possible, citing personal donations made to the financial aid office. 
The next point of discussion regarded Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF) that Carnegie Mellon received and distributed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of $13.9 million in HEERF and CARES emergency grants were given to students. Sixty-eight percent of these funds went to undergraduates and 32 percent went to graduate students. The university maximized the student grant allocation from HEERF funds and distributed 100 percent of their emergency grant allocation. The financial aid office is prepared to respond to student emergencies. 
The priority of HEERF requests was housing, food, technology, course materials, health care, and child care, respectively. It was also noted that over 75 percent of applicants indicated more than one expense category that was provided when explaining why they needed HEERF.
The Tartan Emergency Support Fund (TESF) also provided assistance for students during the course of the pandemic. More than $795,000 was distributed to over 1,000 students, across undergraduate and graduates and domestic and international students. The TESF was established through “funds through the generosity of alumni, friends of the university, Undergraduate Student Senate, Graduate Student Senate, and student organizations.” Its main goal is to give students “emergency funds to assist with unforeseen expenses related to pandemic disruptions.”
For each year of the pandemic, roughly 450 students have requested a review of their financial aid due to a major change in their financial situation. During a normal year, Krieg said, this number is usually around 150 to 200. Most of these cases were because the student’s family lost some, if not all, of their income as a direct result of the pandemic. Krieg stated that each request is reviewed individually by the office for financial aid and adjustments are made based on the family’s unique circumstances.
The presentation concluded with Cox-Siegel, who discussed finances from the SLICE Office. There are four ways student organizations spend funds: expense reimbursement (personal funds are used which are then reimbursed), PCard purchasing (the organization uses a university-issued credit card), purchase orders (purchase made through a vendor), or journal entries (funds transferred between organizations). In FY19, the last fully in-person year, SLICE had 6,086 expense reimbursement requests, 4,706 PCard purchases, 935 purchase orders, and 2,505 journal entries. After students submit requests for payment to the SLICE finance inbox, the finance team follows up with the student until all details are resolved, the transaction is processed, and the appropriate paperwork is filed. 
There is an ongoing evaluation to determine how to make this process more efficient and effective. Recent improvements include transitioning to processing student employees through a streamlined employee reimbursement process, converting to electronic submission of all backup documentation, and eliminating tax exemptions. Due to the nature of the student activity fee, it was much more difficult and time consuming for SLICE to process requests that were tax exempt.
Upcoming changes include submissions changing to an online web form with built-in logic gathering necessary information, completed forms routing to workflow queues to allow oversight of volume and outstanding items, and new electronic record retention.
The Senate Business Affairs Committee will be hosting a hybrid forum for student workers on Monday, April 25, from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in Doherty 1211 and over Zoom. Students are encouraged to attend and share their experiences with employment at Carnegie Mellon.

With summer break on the horizon, Carnegie Mellon students bring the college vibe more than ever. With spikeball galore and hammocks by the tennis courts, it should be a happy time full of ice cream and picnic blankets. As we all know, however, Carnegie Mellon students simply don’t know how to take a proper break. For many, this is one of the most anxious times of the year. With finals looming on the horizon, many are asking themselves the age-old question: “What to do with summer break?”
Many scramble to find internships, checking Handshake or sending daily emails in the hopes that this next application will be the one. Others register for summer classes, trying to keep pace with peers who always seem one step ahead. Some scavenge for a decent-paying summer job — one that pays the bills without increasing the burnout that has been building all year. It is not the simple preparation it should be.
Summer break is one of the incredible perks of academia. For many of us, it’s what kept us going through our primary and high school years. Having a designated long break every year to rest, recharge, and actually be outside for once (with hopefully no snow) is a luxury we don’t typically get to keep for the rest of our lives. So why do we feel the need to cram it with more and more resume-building activities?
Part of it is simply because our peers are doing it and we don’t want to fall behind. Though Carnegie Mellon does have a collaborative atmosphere at times, there’s no denying the competitive undertow. We push ourselves to be the best, even if that means cutting hours out of our sleep schedules or doing homework for an extra hour when we should be taking a break or hanging out with friends. We’re told of the success of those that came before us and we don’t want to fall short of the goals that we set for ourselves.
We’re burnt out. The more words we see, the less we know. Rather than building our knowledge base, working through math problems has us losing brain cells. Our sleep deficit is encroaching upon unprecedented reserves. As we stagger toward the finals week and the finish line, it’s clear we need a break. There’s a reason we have breaks built into our schedules. It signals a shift from chaotic course schedules to a time where we can step back and enjoy the world for a few months.
But, since high school, most of us have been conditioned to spend every waking moment finding a way to become the perfect capitalist specimen with resumes barely fitting on the page and every minute of our days spent being productive little working machines. However, judging from the state of most Carnegie Mellon students, this is impossible and we all end up beating ourselves up for not being able to sustain an unsustainable lifestyle.
This summer please, take a break for once. Instead of beating yourself up for not getting the internship or having the perfect work experience, remember that you are truly doing what you can now and that you do not owe anyone your entire life. Try to take time for yourself and take things at you own pace; school will still be here when you get back in the fall. Summer is for letting yourself take a break for once and soak up the sun, because before you know it Pittsburgh’s cloudy skies and the endless cycle of work will be waiting for you to return.

Unlike a lot of students at Carnegie Mellon, I didn’t grow up in a populated area. In fact, only about 7,000 people live in the township that I grew up in, located just northwest of Pittsburgh. While it wasn’t an everyone-knows-everyone situation for me, it was for a lot of people who lived there. Beyond the occasional Facebook post or message I’m sent by my parents about local happenings, I don’t hear anything coming out of the area. All the information has simply dried up — this is because my hometown is a news desert.
But, what exactly is a news desert? It refers to an area that has little or no local news outlets. Most who live in rural areas likely feel that they live in a news desert. In the last two decades, approximately a quarter of all U.S. newspapers  stopped printing. About 50 percent of newspaper workers were laid off during that time, so papers no longer have the resources to attend that town hall or feature a community hero. Local journalism has taken a hit over the past few years, and it’s actively felt in small towns.
I wasn’t aware of the lack of news coverage in my community until I was in high school and started writing for our newspaper, the “FHS Press.” Though we were only a 20-something member staff of high school students, it felt rewarding to cover the events that were going on in our school of about 400 students because we knew that if we didn’t, no one else would. Though we made jokes (and I still do about The Tartan) that no one reads the paper, when you get down to it, there are always the people who do care enough to actually read news. Those are the people that local journalists write for. Plus there’s the added constituency of bored people who happen upon a copy of the paper.
Why is local journalism so important? Since the beginning of the so-called “Information Age,” it’s been easier than in prior centuries for people to consume media. That mostly comes in the form of short headlines we scroll past and quick social media posts. I can almost say with certainty that headlines on Twitter or Reddit aren’t going to feature a small, mostly-farming community in Pennsylvania — though I suppose something newsworthy could happen someday. But anything less than that probably isn’t going to escape the local Facebook group. Anyone who isn’t a part of that circle isn’t going to know about local goings-on unless they actively pursue information. A local source of news provides easy access to more in-depth information than you could find from a local Facebook mom group, with the added benefit of not supporting Mark Zuckerberg.
The fall of local journalism also increases  polarization within local elections.. Voters often only cast their ballots in big elections like presidential races; Beaver County had an 81 percent turnout in 2020 compared to a meager 34 percent in 2021. This happens nationwide because the general sentiment is that local elections don’t matter. This isn’t true; change begins at the local level, like school boards. Coverage of local elections helps educate voters beyond party lines. Given how polarized politics are today, it’s important for voters to break free from partisan politics and judge candidates on their platform, not just subscribe to a Republican or Democratic agenda.
What’s the solution to this? Outside of local newspapers rebuilding their staffs (which is unlikely), or new newspapers appearing in small towns (also unlikely), there’s not much chance for local journalism to return. The digestible social media content consumers turned to simply doesn’t translate to the local level and, as a result, news deserts continue to grow. For now, Facebook mom groups are the only option for an unfortunately large number of Americans.

When I was eight, I wanted to be a mad scientist. What that entailed specifically, I didn’t know. I dreamt of rocket ships soaring through the solar system and mixing mysterious chemicals in flasks — there would be an explosion and my hair would poof up just like on TV. I would wear a pristine white lab coat, and freely roam my creepy basement, sparks flying in the background.
I did not imagine waking up at 8 a.m.
The basement part came true. I spend half my nights in Scobell House with the other basement bros — a collection of chronically exhausted 18-year-old men (or boys, let’s be honest with ourselves) looking for answers in a building that has none. Frankly, I’ve been asking a lot of questions lately, and Carnegie Mellon has yet to answer them.
I never got the STEM-kids-wake-up-early memo. Or rather, I got it in the form of a remote Concepts of Mathematics lecture at eight in the morning of my very first week of college. It took me about another week before I reconciled with myself to simply not attend. Still, I had honors physics at nine, at Hammerschlag Hall, on the other end of campus.
I should clear something up before I continue. This is, to some extent, a rant. I can’t say that my opinions here are totally based on hard facts, but they are based on real, intense emotions. Furthermore, I may not have things as bad as they could be; if I had a class at the Mellon Institute, I might not have made it through the semester. So, to the kids in CS effectively living in Gates, indulge my complaining. We’re all in the same boat, the emotional and mental equivalent to the Titanic. We are STEM students.
Allow me to speak generally. The STEM student does not eat breakfast. They often drink coffee, perhaps even energy drinks, but they do not sit down for a nice meal at the Egg Shoppe. At most, they afford themselves a snack — a croissant, perhaps — but nothing more. Furthermore, the STEM student does not participate in class. They are not afforded that sweet, sweet ten percent of their grade earned simply by talking. Thus, they remain silent, saving their breath for when they inevitably order from Hunan Express later that night. No other social interaction is necessary.
When I arrived at Carnegie Mellon, I was an ambitious, passionate physics student. I envisioned an image similar to that from my high school classes — asking lots of questions, talking to the professor after class — but I did not anticipate the difficulty of waking up after six, five, or four hours of sleep (or let’s be honest, zero), and still having the discipline to go to class. I frequently dozed off mid-lecture, slept through alarms, and entirely skipped recitations because I was too tired. It was so bad in the beginning that I woke up one morning at 9:30 a.m., halfway through my first college physics exam.
My parents, understandably, were pretty pissed. It had become abundantly clear to me that without my mother around (who historically woke me up every morning), I lacked the ability to buckle down and get the sleep I needed. On top of that, I lacked the will to get out of bed in the morning, even when I did wake up. Somehow, I showed up to college completely unaware of how brutal mornings are. It almost wasn’t surprising, since I understood myself to be a night-owl rather than an early-bird, but still I couldn’t help feeling disappointed in myself. I simply couldn’t figure out what to do. I set multiple alarms, I skipped my morning showers (and took them later in the day, don’t worry), but it wasn’t enough. The clear culprit was my late-night attitude, but I couldn’t bear to give that up.
Until October 2021, I blamed most of the situation on myself. I figured my struggles were due to my shortcomings alone. Then I met a humanities student.
The humanities are great — this is not me trashing on a humanities degree — but holy shit, these people have it nice. She woke up at ten or eleven, enjoyed coffee (and sometimes breakfast) with a friend, and got to class early. She did not sleep through a single class, and did not skip a single class. I was beyond envious. Partially of her killer work ethic, but predominantly of her bullshit schedule. This coming semester, she will not have class on Fridays. She will only have two classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, beginning at 3:05 p.m. Her earliest class is at noon. Some bullshit is amuck.
Who the actual fuck decided this made any sense? The poor STEM kids, who just desperately want a break, get to have less sleep. They struggle every morning to get to class. Just from an intuitive standpoint, people are less attentive when they just wake up. It takes time to get ready. Humanities kids on the other hand, oh, they have it bad — so bad that to compensate, they get to sleep in every day like it’s summer vacation (note, the humanities can be brutal too, but let’s be real, STEM is in its own league. I’ve heard too many 15-122 horror stories to think otherwise).
I’m sure there are plenty of reasons why this is the case. My girlfriend blames capitalism. Still, I feel there’s a degree of injustice here. I myself am considering switching to a creative writing major, and dropping my planned B.S. in physics with an astrophysics track. The tragedy of it all is that a factor in my decision is this schedule conundrum. It is not just about passion, or where in this godforsaken world my heart is — and if that’s not what it’s about, then we’ve done something wrong.
For now, I will return to my creepy all-male basement. We are not a cool bunch, but we try. The STEM community as a whole knows this, feels this, lives this. Maybe one day we will be treated with the respect employers allegedly have for our degrees. Until then, I’ll see you in line at Hunan, face planted in a Hunt table, or passed out in those chairs behind the Gates La Prima.

The “Stop Wrongs Against Our Kids and Employees Act” (also known as the “Stop WOKE Act”) was recently signed into law in Florida by Governor Ron DeSantis. It’s the latest stunt by opportunistic reactionaries to capitalize on dangerous and rhetorically violent disinformation for their political aspirations, and there’s not much more to it than that. However, the passage of the act reveals a deep rot within our education system and our cultural mindset about education. It is a self-fulfilling cycle compounding on itself to create a slew of institutional, psychological, and sociological problems.
There are a couple central components to the “Stop WOKE Act.” First, it reaffirms the opposition to teaching critical race theory (CRT) in schools, even though CRT is mainly taught in law schools and is focused on institutions and legal frameworks rather than identity politics. Second, the law allows parents to sue schools if they think their children are being taught CRT. In other words, it legalizes white self-victimization and legitimizes censorship as a valid policy avenue. Third, the law extends to businesses. Disney recently lost their special tax status for their statement against Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which prevents discussions of gender identities and sexual orientations for children until third grade. The most recent “Stop WOKE Act” can also be applied to training related to CRT and discussion of sensitive topics overall in the private sector.
It seems strange that a law  ostensibly based on the psychological impact of teaching history to our children would also extend to the private sector. But, it isn’t so hard to see the link between education and the private sector. Public education was introduced in the 1830s by Horace Mann, a Massachusetts state legislator. He advocated for “common schools” that would be funded by the state for the intellectual, civic, and economic benefit of the public. As America industrialized, more workers were needed, and education became the means for training them, as seen by the proliferation of factory model schools that would teach reading, writing, and arithmetic skills that were necessary to generate productive blue-collar workers. This is even worse when you consider segregation (or zoning laws and ordinances designed to create de-facto segregation), urbanization, migration, and white reactionary politics, which is the reason all these issues get perpetuated across generations.
But as this happened, just as many noticed that what was going on is wrong. Education has become the means of raising awareness and bringing about change as much as it was intended to create workers and social, racial, and economic stratification. Higher-level education is really important for this, particularly the focus on academic research. Specialized scholars and teachers are important for verifying our historical records and passing knowledge down to future generations, which builds over time as new discoveries are made and new research is done. As time has gone on, academia has expanded and tended towards boundary-pushing work that challenges the way things are. While this is good for the edification of our society, it is not good for the capitalist since change is required, which affects the executive’s earnings. Additionally, a lot of higher education is tied to capitalism which is becoming ever more visible. Companies like Amazon and Google, as well as other industrialists and military contractors, are frequent sponsors for research in universities today like our very own Carnegie Mellon, which was originally two different schools created by two different capitalists named Andrew. Additionally, these universities gear students for specialized, higher-paying work in the private sector, which was the primary incentive for industrialists like these which founded and/or otherwise contributed to the development of the higher education system.
The result is that higher education is a class gateway, and many of those who work in academia are often overpaid, overlooked, and exploited. Academic journals make revenue in the billions and have profit margins that are higher than that of even tech giants like Apple. Much of the research is also inaccessible, hidden behind paywalls or written solely for a technically competent audience. Writers and authors who help translate technical research for a lay audience help overcome the accessibility issue that plagues academia. But that’s not how the majority consume information. The majority get their information from news and social media, where there is a lot more bias and projection of opinions, and it’s very apparent. There are constant jokes about universities turning people into communists, which is ironic given how entrenched higher education is within the capitalist system.
There has been a gradual push in education to teach racial relations and economic history with more depth and offer more nuanced and challenging material to children. This has coincided with more students choosing to pursue higher education and communities with the requisite political willpower and property tax revenue integrating this into their curricula. Health and sexual education have also been key, teaching children about important topics like identity, consent, and mental health to help develop well-adjusted and stable adults. However, when bills like the “Stop WOKE Act” are passed, we see the greatest harm from the legitimization of white reactionary politics. It will be damaging for children to not feel affirmed and instead be coddled as if the world is out to destroy them. It creates hostility, instability, and distrust that can negatively affect their future behavior towards others and towards themselves. This isn’t how a healthy society, especially one that claims to be as “advanced” as this one does, should operate.
Reactionary politics is hitting a new streak again in our modern history, and those who have read their history know that this is not the first time this is happening. America has a long history of censorship and repression, much of which isn’t mentioned in schools. Kids learn about Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech, but they don’t talk about the FBI’s counterintelligence program against Black communities and subsequent targeting by law enforcement and the CIA. Kids learn about indigenous culture, but don’t learn about factory schools or the military-led genocide that was key to Westward Expansion. Even slavery is taught without delving into the ugliness of it, focusing on narratives about “states’ rights” and the “necessary evil” of slavery. The real history isn’t taught because it makes the majority demographic look bad, and as political power shifts, the majority will try to keep their majority. Empires led by white men conquered all seven continents, and now we live in a world where it isn’t like that anymore. Reactionary politics was inevitable, and the education system those in power want is to keep a world that looks the way they and only they want it. This world is cold, exclusionary, dehumanizing, and economically unsustainable. It’s not for the good of the country or for the public or even for white people. It is just for their gain.
