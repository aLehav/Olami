Students at Carnegie Mellon are not strangers to endurance. For 30 weeks of the year, they go through grueling homework and stressful midterms only to be confronted by a barrage of hellish finals at the end. Running 26 miles, then, should be a feat far easier to accomplish. The only problem, however, is that it is really not easy.
This week at Carnegie Mellon, Matt Imhof gave a talk to students and faculty about how to train for a Marathon/Half Marathon. Imhof is a USA Track and Field Certified Coach and has been an ACE Certified Personal Trainer for over 20 years, during which he has coached hundreds of adult runners to their first half or full marathons. He was formerly the Head Track and Cross-Country Coach at Kean University in New Jersey and currently works as the Director of Training Programs at Elite Runners and Walkers in Pittsburgh.
Imhof truly is a coach at heart, as both his most memorable running moments and his source of continued motivation are the joyous faces of the athletes he has coached upon their completion of their goals. Imhof first picked up running in his middle school years as he didn’t see himself as a traditional team sport kid. Over the years, life has thrown him many curveballs and challenges that have forced him to take extended breaks from running. Coming back to the sport meant he had to face the weight he had put on and the fitness that he had lost. However, having always managed to get back on his feet (literally and metaphorically) every time tells us that Matt knows a thing or two about how to stay motivated through the thick and thin.
Imhof dispensed a lot of well-structured advice during his talk. His first question was about the goal that everyone had in mind. Whether merely finishing the marathon and having fun, or running it in a specific time, your goal will always determine your training. According to Imhof, “If you’re training for a time goal, every workout has a purpose. If you’re running for fun, well just make sure you have fun.”
With a goal in mind, Imhof advises runners to start 20-26 weeks in advance (15-16 weeks for a half marathon) to go from scratch to being able to run a marathon. He feels that this will give people a chance to let their bodies adjust to the strain of training and still get enough rest to recover. “The challenge is as important as the rest,” Imhof said when asked why he feels that runners shouldn’t run their everyday runs faster than their easy pace. “Something that most people don’t realize is that something that feels easy may not be physiologically easy.”
The goal of your training is to strengthen your body from your bones to your muscles and glands. “Strengthening requires time,” Imhof said.
He stressed the importance of creating a game plan, sticking to it, and reviewing it with the passage of time, in order to adequately strengthen one’s body without straining it too much. The key factors in a workout plan that one can change are time/distance, pace, and frequency. Imhof is a strong believer in the 10% plan, a plan where a runner may increase his or her pace or distance by no more than 10 percent each week with a down week every third week. When asked what running plans he recommends, Imhof advocated for Hal Higdon plans and the plans given by his company, Elite Runners.
Imhof revealed later in a personal interview that the reason he stresses on the importance of goals stems from experiences he has had with running. “Running can make you selfish, and I was for a long time. I have learned that there is a better way. I need to enjoy it when I can and accept that my fitness and performance goals will have to be modified at this time. I need to enjoy my boys and everything they bring to my life.”
Apart from setting goals and planning for them, Imhof stressed the importance of a support system, both physically and mentally. Imhof explained that this is the reason he has a Sunday morning group. “Getting up on a cold Sunday morning to run 13 miles every week is far less preferable than merely turning the snooze off and going back to sleep. If you know you have someone waiting out there to run with you, it makes it far harder for you to turn that snooze off.” 
Having three kids, however, Imhof likes his downtime and recognizes that runners need to balance their alone running time, their internal motivation, with group runs, their external motivation. He recommends that runners get their friends and family involved to help them reach their goals. He noted that his performance on race day has fluctuated based on how much support he got from his friends and family. Additionally, Imhof feels that 80 percent of being able to run a marathon is between one’s ears and only the remaining 20 percent is reliant on physical fitness. Having a positive mindset and keeping oneself driven are key to being able to run a good marathon. Equally important is being able to think while you run and have a back up pace and goal, should the conditions on race day be critically different from training conditions. Imhof says that one must be willing to change and let go of the ego that comes from having trained so hard.
Physical support includes everything from the right apparel to the appropriate nutrition and even running form. Running 26 miles takes a long time. No one wants to go a long time in shoes that are uncomfortable or aren’t suited to their feet. No one wants to feel cold, itchy, wet or inflexible for that time span either. “Take the time and money to invest in good running gear. Acquire some running fuel such as goo, Gatorade or even Power Bars and test your body’s response to them before running the marathon,” said Imhof. Repeating a certain movement for a long expanse of time can have a grave toll on one’s body if one doesn’t make sure that one has the right form. Things to focus on according to Imhof are lean, cadence (foot strike rate), core, and arm movements. 
Imhof recommends professional help when it comes to the physical support section, as dealing with one’s body requires unique advice that should be given by someone with the relevant knowledge so that one may avoid injury and achieve one’s goals with comfort.
By focusing on all of the above things Imhof believes anyone can have a happy marathon and achieve their goals. All of the above points are equally important and no one factor can make up for another. Imhof’s final comments on running a marathon were: “You are out there running with 20,000 of your closest friends. It is a great social experience and provides a lot of motivation. Take in what’s around you and enjoy what you are doing.”

Women’s Basketball
On Friday night, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team traveled to St. Louis to take on Washington University. The 9th ranked Bears were the toughest of the teams the Tartans have played so far in University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play and it showed when Carnegie Mellon lost 73–49.
The Tartans were cold shooting the ball, with only three made baskets the rest of the half (and of those only a layup by freshman forward Kajae Jones came in the last five minutes) and found themselves down 14 at half, 39–25.
Any hopes of a comeback were struck down with a similar poor shooting effort to open the second half, again with only three made baskets in the half’s opening ten minutes.
The loss drops the Tartans to 11–6 on the season and 2–4 in UAA play. They traveled to Chicago on Sunday to finish off their road trip before returning home this weekend to face off against Washington and Chicago again on their home court.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team continued their woes in UAA play as they traveled to Washington University in St. Louis to face off against the 7th ranked Bears. The Tartans ended up dropping their 4th straight game, 79–59, as they got blown out by ranked opponents for the second time in as many games.
The Tartans started off strong with sophomore forward Jack Serbin making the opening basket and a layup by junior center Blake Chasen, giving the Tartans a 4–2 lead. Unfortunately, this was the last time Carnegie Mellon would be ahead as Washington proceeded to tear off a 15–1 run.
Coming out of the half the two teams were fairly even, but with Washington already having a 10 point advantage, it just wasn’t enough. Halfway through the second half, the Tartans went cold from the field as they pushed a bit too hard to try and cut the lead. The points not off of free throws were a lone layup by senior Kevin Stursberg.
With the loss, the Tartans drop to 1–5 in UAA play and 10–7 on the season. Similar to the women’s team, the men battled University of Chicago on the road Sunday and will return back home this weekend to take on Washington and Chicago again.
Swimming & Diving
On Saturday the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams competed at University of Pittsburgh. The men competed in a tri meet against the University of Pittsburgh and Clarion University, and ultimately fell to Pitt 216–81 but beat Clarion 223–58. The women faced off in the quint meet with Pitt, Clarion, California University of Pennsylvania and Duquesne University in their tune up to UAA Championships in two weeks. The women lost to Pitt 234–60 and Duquesne 172–113 while defeating the California 214–61 and Clarion 185.50–105.50.
The men got their first win of the day from freshman Josh Taekman in the 1000 yard freestyle, where he dropped 4 seconds off of his seed time to win in 9:52.84. Sophomore Brian Jay and freshman Tyler Goulding took second and third in the 50–yard freestyle finishing with times of 21.42 and 21.74 respectively.
The only other top showing for the Tartans came from sophomore Brian Walsh in the 100–yard butterfly, as he touched the pad at the 51.06 mark. Walsh also placed third in the 200–yard freestyle with a time of 1:44.02. In the final event, the 200–yard freestyle relay, Carnegie Mellon took second when Goulding, Jay, junior Joseph Robinson, and freshman Kevin Steinhouse combined for a 1:25.58 time.
The weakness of the men’s team, the diving, continued to be problematic as the men’s divers were outclassed by their field, finishing in the last spots in both the 1 and 3 meter events, putting up scores over one hundred points behind the next competitor.
Due to the strength of the field, the women’s highest finish in an event was multiple third-place times. Freshman Sarah Winget earned two third-place finishes with a pair of season best times in the 200 yard butterfly and the 500 yard freestyle with times of 2:09.82 and 5:18.35.
Another pair of freshman picked up third-place finishes when Miranda Ford took third in the 1000 yard freestyle and Hannah Soltz took the 100–yard breaststroke with times of 11:15.59 and 1:06.19 respectively.
Machika Kaku was the top Tartan diver, taking fifth in the 1 meter with a time of 232.85.
Both teams next compete in the UAA Championships in Atlanta starting on February 11th.
Track & Field
On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to Case Western Reserve to compete in the Seventh Annual Battle of the Obelisk. The women fell 81–55 while the men lost 70–66.
Junior Sasha Spalding was the first top finisher for the women at the meet with 5.27m leap in the long jump. Spalding followed this up with a 10.86m hurl to win the shot put. Senior Sara Kelly took the first track event for the Tartans with a win in the 1 mile run in 5:32.95.
It was a top-two finish for Carnegie Mellon in the 400-meter dash with freshman Sarah Cook and sophomore Ariel Tian taking first and second with times of 1:01.03 and 1:04.42 respectively. Spalding and Cook repeated the feat in the 200 meter dash with times of 26.63 and 27.71 respectively. The final win of the day came in the 4x400 meter relay where the Tartan ‘A’ team took the top spot with a time of 4:13.28.
On the men’s side, they struggled a bit more with field events, not taking a single event. But they more than made up for it on the track side. Freshman Jeffrey Chen took first in the 55 meter dash with a time 6.66 while sophomore Cutris Watro took the top spot in the mile run with a 4:28.31. In the 400 meter run, senior Thomas Vandenberg won with a time 48.90 and in the 800 meter run, junior Marc–Daniel Julien took the title in 1:57.97. Vandenberg also took the 200 meter dash in 22.72 seconds to cap off the Tartan domination in the dashes.
The Tartans dominated distance, starting with the distance medley with their ‘A’ team finishing in 10:34.74. Senior George Degen and sophomore Ryan Archer took first and second in the 5000 meter run with 15:13.63 and 15:16.37 respectively, while senior Eamon Cullinane, senior Joshua Antonson, Degen, and junior Brian Bollens, took the top for spots in the 3000 meter run with times of 8:53.07, 8:53.29, 8:53.75, and 8:56.94 respectively.
The teams next compete at Denison University on Saturday in the Bob Shannon Invitational.

For a game full of firsts (two career first interceptions and a player who has been on an NFL roster for less than two months getting his first catch, touchdown, and hundred yard game), it was sad to see it all end on what will be one of the most scrutinized play calls in NFL history. Down by 4 with under a minute to go, the Seattle Seahawks faced a 2nd and goal from the 1 yard line. With one of the best running backs in the league in Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch, Seattle made the inexplicable decision to try and pass the ball for the touchdown.
As famous University of Texas coach, Darrell K Royal said, “Only three things can happen when you pass, and two of them are bad.” Royal was referring to the good, a catch, the bad, an incompletion, and the ugly — an interception. Sadly for the Seahawks, this throw was ugly. Patriots Rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler pulled in his first career interception as he sold out to cover the quick underneath route, putting a quick end to the Seattle comeback.
Two plays earlier, Seattle wide out Jermaine Kearse made what would have been the catch of the century, having the ball tipped away by Butler only to have it bounce off his legs as he laid on the ground, off one hand and finally corralled at the 6 yard line only to get up and pop out of bounds to stop the clock at the 5 yard line. This catch would have been an all-time great, right up there with New York Giants’ wideout David Tyree’s helmet catch to end the Patriots’ undefeated season in 2007 and the immaculate reception by Steelers’ fullback Franco Harris in 1972. But it will be forgotten because of a bad play call, a bad read and a correct sell out play by a rookie in the biggest game of his life.
The game started slow, with both defenses dominating. The Patriots completely stonewalled the Seahawks, allowing only a few rushing first downs and a complete lack of a passing. The Seahawks held more of a “bend, don’t break” philosophy, letting the Patriots drive but getting a crucial interception from nickel corner Jeremy Lane in the red zone. The euphoric high Lane experienced from getting his first career interception during the Super Bowl was quickly smashed as he broke his arm getting tackled as he tried to gain better field position.
Undrafted Chris Matthews was the next unheralded player to leave his mark on the game as his first career catch was a spinning leaping grab over New England nickel corner Kyle Arrington on a long bomb by Seahawks’ quarterback Russell Wilson. His second career catch was a touchdown to culminate a 30-second drive after the Patriots scored a touchdown to break a 7–7 tie with 32 seconds remaining. 
There was another interesting play call made during this drive as the Seahawks were sitting at the 11 yard line with 6 seconds remaining. Many were calling for the chip shot field goal to guarantee points leading into half, but Seattle thought they could fire one shot into the end zone before settling for 3 points. Wilson threw nearly instantaneously after the snap (similar to the end of the game) but this time found an open Matthews, again leaping and spinning around Arrington to land in the end zone to knot the game at 14.
Coming out of half, the Seahawks got the ball and were determined to keep up their momentum, scoring another 10 points to jump out to a 24-14 lead as the fourth quarter begin. While most teams would be left for dead down double digits against the league’s best defense, the Patriots (who had two separate 14-point comebacks against the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round of the playoffs) just kept fighting. With a short pass to former quarterback-turned-receiver Julian Edelman, Tom Brady and Patriots took the lead back with 2:06 remaining in the game, and we already discussed what happens next. Brady’s fourth passing touchdown was enough to overcome his two interceptions and earn him Super Bowl MVP honors, although that honor probably deserved to go to the Seahawks offensive play caller.
With the Patriots 28–24 victory, Brady and longtime coach Bill Belichick get their fourth title, and first in the last decade, but the game was tarnished. No one likes to see a game decided by the referees, but to see one decided by one over thought play call makes the game feel tarnished. The Super Bowl is supposed to decide the best team, not the best coaches. While coaches certainly have a large role in how their team plays on the field, they should not be the ones deciding games.
Congratulations to the Patriots, but maybe next year they should focus a bit more on the running game — They of all people know best, “that only 3 things happen when you pass, and two of them are bad.”

Imagine a world where your every move is being monitored. Your routine actions and personal thoughts become the business of others, and are manipulated beyond your control. It almost sounds like a page taken from George Orwell’s novel, 1984, a chilling story about a totalitarian society. As our world becomes increasingly reliant on digital technology, we, too, may soon find ourselves facing the realities of science fiction, through a phenomenon known as the Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT refers to our seamless ability to connect to the Internet through a wide range of computing devices. In turn, we become more vulnerable to security hacks that compromise our individual privacy.
Despite such concerns, the IoT has made our lives more convenient. It is the reason why the United States, as well as several other countries, celebrate Data Privacy Day, an international holiday that strives to increase public awareness about data privacy and protection.
Last Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon shared in the celebration by hosting a number of privacy-related events. A highlight of CMU Privacy Day 2015 was keynote speaker Julie Brill, who spoke before a large audience after receiving a warm welcome from President Subra Suresh. The event took place in Rangos in the Jared L. Cohon University Center.
Back in 2010, Brill became the Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). A magna cum laude from Princeton University and the New York University School of Law, Brill eventually found herself attracting national recognition for her work in protecting consumer privacy.
The Commissioner believes that it is possible for us to “unlock the potential of big data, and enjoy its benefits, while still obeying the privacy principles that protect individuals.” Brill said that one of the main goals of the FTC is to protect consumers by preventing foul business practices in the marketplace.
Brill referenced many examples of past consumer privacy violations throughout her speech, including a major incident from last year in which the FTC pressed charges against Snapchat for its lax security policies. A third-party app was found that allowed recipients to recover and store messages, or “snaps,” that were supposed to have disappeared. “You can imagine,” Brill said to the audience, “that a security failure that leads to the capture of an image that you thought would be ephemeral is a pretty rude shock, and undermines [an] essential selling point [and] privacy enhancement that Snapchat was offering.”
During the same year, Credit Karma and Fandango also settled charges with the FTC for misrepresenting the security of their mobile apps to consumers. The two companies failed to secure the transmission of highly sensitive information due to “man-in-the middle” attacks. Through these attacks, hackers were able to gain access to the credit card details, credit report data, and social security numbers of consumers.
To further address these security issues, the FTC is working on enacting federal laws to set guidelines that would push companies to take action. 
In addition, during a visit to the FTC, President Obama called on Congress to pass legislation that would “strengthen the FTC’s existing data security enforcement tools” and “provide education to consumers” in the event of a security breach.
There are, however, companies that are interested in finding ways to protect and gain the trust of their consumers. In response, Brill proposed several solutions.
One proposed solution was the implementation of security by design. A software engineering term, security by design describes a product that was built to be secure from the start. Data minimization and de-identification would help to further protect consumers from the potential risks of providing personal information.
Brill also encouraged companies to become more transparent in establishing their security policies. Furthermore, she said that consumers should be given more tools to control the privacy of their data.
But simply enforcing these guidelines will not be enough to combat the invasion of privacy that comes with the increasing prevalence of the IoT, Brill said. 
Aware that she was speaking to the technology-focused Carnegie Mellon community, Brill urged the technologists in the room to help ensure those changes take place. While she recognizes this is not an easy task, Brill is confident that the analytical and creative skills of computer scientists and engineers will help companies reach milestones in enhancing data security.
Incredible advancements in technology show promise of a future that greatly differs from Orwell’s fictional, totalitarian society. Digital technology may not, after all, become the downfall of the sophisticated intelligence that is characteristic of the human race. The IoT may even prove to be advantageous within the modern world, provided that we use it mindfully.
Quoting the Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro, Brill said that a “revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past.” Only time and the efforts of many can bring us the solution to one of the 21st century’s most controversial issues.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been a topic of extensive study for neuroscientists for years, but it seems that with every new study, the disorder as a whole becomes increasingly unclear. This obscurity stems largely from that fact that there is so much contradictory information being discovered and published. One example of this involves brain synchronization, or connectivity. Some research has attributed ASD dysfunction to a lack of synchronization among brain regions; other research has stated the exact opposite, that the brains of individuals affected by autism exhibit hyper synchronization.
Neuroscientists from Carnegie Mellon University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel created a study which would adjudicate between these findings once and for all. The team included Marlene Behrmann, professor of cognitive neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon University and co-director of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition; Avital Hahany, Ph.D. student of neurobiology from Weizmann Institute; and Rafael Malach, professor of brain research from Weizmann Institute.
The researchers originally set out to examine the brain in its resting state. “There is an assumption that when you are not doing anything, i.e., when your brain is at rest, that the interactions between brain regions [are recapitulated],” Behrmann explained. This means that activity from the waking state is ‘played back’ when the brain is at rest. “We wished to see whether or not the alterations seen during daytime activities could also be seen in the resting state.”
The research soon evolved into a large-scale exploration of connectivity, or the synchronicity of activity between individual brain regions. The study’s evolution was triggered by the release of 1,000 fMRI brain scans, half of which were part of control groups, the other half consisting of ASD individuals. Before this landmark release, it was difficult for scientists to acquire large enough samples to do in-depth studies with widely generalizable results — hence the differing findings produced by previous studies.
Thanks to the combined efforts of twenty organizations, including Carnegie Mellon University, a public database was created. With access to this large, high-quality database, Behrmann and her team were able to create a study which would finally shed some light on the true nature of brain connectivity in individuals with ASD.
The study incorporated a sample of 68 control and 71 ASD brain scans. Data in hand, the research team was able to form three-dimensional brain images such that the brain’s intricate folds could be inflated, and their activity could be seen on the surface. The researchers laid a grid over the three-dimensional brain in order to separate brain regions into “voxels,” or 3-D pixels. Each voxel’s activity (rate at which its neurons fired over time) was recorded and compared to that of every other voxel. The sample size was so large and of such high quality that the team was able to compare the activity of each voxel in one hemisphere of the brain to the corresponding region on the other hemisphere, as well as compare activity between voxels of the same hemisphere.
As they compared activity throughout the brain, the research team discovered that, when compared against one another, the connections within the brains of the control groups were similar. The connectivity within the ASD brains, however, was not only different from that of the control groups, but the ASD brains displayed notable differences from one another — some being hyper-connected and others being under-connected, as previous studies had discovered.
The findings support a burgeoning hypothesis regarding the nature of ASD brain development. “There is a growing perception that because we live in very much the same kind of environment, our brains are all entrained in similar ways,” Behrmann explained. “If we see a dog, for example, and hear it barking, the visual and auditory stimulus come together, and those brain regions work together.”
While typical individuals’ brains develop and work in similar ways, individuals with ASD display diverse and rather unique connectivity profiles. Researchers hypothesize that not only do their environmental experiences shape their connectivity, their connectivity shapes their ability to interact with the environment. This is demonstrated by the fact that some young ASD individuals tend not to look at other people’s faces. As a result, the brain region which works to identify faces is impaired because it has not been utilized frequently enough.
As with many neuroscientific studies, the ramifications are unclear. “One of the things we had originally hoped was that, if we had a large sample, we could see individuals who had clusters of activity,” Behrmann said. 
The goal was to find similar patterns which could have been used to create neurological profiles for ASD individuals, perhaps for diagnostic use, but the results were far too varied. “Before we can even start thinking about how we can use this information, we need to have a refined characterization of the disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is defined subjectively by a set of behavioral traits, a checklist. We really need an objective measure that allows for a more precise diagnosis before we can consider using this data.”
While ASD may still be mysterious, discoveries like this advance our understanding of brain disorders and neuroscience as a whole. “We are entering a new era in neuroscience research” Behrmann said. “Not only is the science itself exciting, but there is great joy in working collaboratively. The process of discovery and working with other people really drive me and make me excited about this work.”

Google is a company that everybody knows, most publicly for its search engine. However, it is also involved in many other areas. Recently, Google began leasing infrastructure from Sprint and T-Mobile and reselling internet services to consumers. This week Pugwash discussed the possible implications of this move.
First, it was noted that Google has an incentive for providing good connections. Because most of Google’s money is made from people viewing ads, it is to Google’s benefit to have more people connected to the Internet. It was speculated that Google could even offer the Internet services for free or for a very low price, gambling that they would make enough off the increased traffic to their web content. Through vertical integration, Google would be highly incentivized to provide good service.
The idea of a Google monopoly was also discussed. Worries that Google will create a monopoly were quickly put to rest. Service providers already carve up regions so as to avoid competition, and Google isn’t even entering the market as a true competitor. When it leases the infrastructure, it usually is only doing so where the bandwidth is not already being used. Because Sprint and T-Mobile still own the physical infrastructure, there is little risk of them being toppled and replaced by Google. 
If Google began encroaching on the service providers by undercutting them, the service providers could simply raise the rent or choose to end Google’s access to the infrastructure.
The question of monopolies also applies in the context of public utilities. We were unsure about how the status changes when utility infrastructure is rented out to a third party. However, classifying a service as a utility is one of the few ways to prevent monopolies from taking advantage of limited regulation.
Regardless of market competition, some members expressed distrust that Google would have access to their data from start to finish. Google already gathers incredible amounts of information about people using the Internet; do they really need more? 
Many modern companies have, or are attempting to get, similar levels of integration. It was mentioned that this could be the “honeymoon” period of large oligopolies. Just because Internet companies like Amazon and Google are providing great services now, they might decide one day that they want to stop operating at a loss.
So far, Google hasn’t run into anti-trust laws in the United States, beyond a slight warning about promoting their own search results without disclosure. In the European Union, however, there have been more legal consequences for Google’s reach. Whether Google and other massive tech companies will ever be challenged was a question open to debate. The current goal of many, if not most, startups is to grow just big enough to be bought out. Although there may be some companies, like Uber, that resist buyout and end up as strong corporations themselves, the frequency of that happening may be declining. In the Internet service provider business, where startup costs for small businesses are incredibly high, it can be even harder for a newcomer to present a real threat to the larger, established companies.
Whether Google’s move into the business of Internet service is positive or negative seems to depend on how much one trusts Google. Having vertical integration gives them more incentive to provide quality Internet access, but at the same time, they are now in control of users’ data from start to finish.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion about Google serving as a phone carrier.

Problem set due Monday. Essay due Tuesday. Another problem set due Wednesday. Project due Thursday. Friday is the weekend. Wait, what’s a weekend?
Stress is a shadow that follows every college student, even on cloudy days — especially on cloudy days. It is oftentimes overwhelming and cannot be erased overnight, but there is one way to gradually reduce it: through the foods that you eat. According to Gill Paul’s book Eat Yourself Calm, “There are loads of delicious, nutritious foods that positively support all the body systems during periods of stress and target the symptoms that accompany stress. We can literally eat ourselves calm.”
Although our bodies do a good job of dealing with short-term stress, they are less victorious when it comes to long-term stress. As a result of chronic stress, your immune system lets its guard down, your blood sugar levels go on a roller coaster, and your blood pressure climbs. While most people are familiar with methods of combatting stress such as exercising more, getting enough sleep, and practicing yoga and meditation, fewer people know about the benefits of a stress-reducing diet.
One way to reduce stress is by keeping your blood sugar at a steady level, because fluctuating blood sugar will unbalance your energy and mood. 
This can be achieved by eating small snacks throughout the day consisting of foods that take a long time to burn, such as vegetables. Today’s Dietitian, a nutrition magazine, also explains how iron is essential in preventing fatigue. Iron is necessary for the formation of hemoglobin, the molecule which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Some of the best sources for iron include thyme, parsley, basil, eggs, beef, salmon, almonds, spinach, and broccoli.
Another way to reduce stress is by eating foods with lots of B vitamins. According to Eat Yourself Calm “B group vitamins are particularly useful because they support the nervous system and brain function and stimulate the production of feel-good hormones such as serotonin.” 
Reader’s Digest explained the functions of specific B vitamins: Vitamin B1, for example, helps control your blood sugar level. Vitamin B3 plays an important role in the synthesis of serotonin. Vitamin B5 influences the adrenals, the glands which regulate stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Vitamin B12 has been shown to be beneficial for combatting depression, which is often linked with anxiety. Some examples of food which are rich in B vitamins are whole grains, potatoes, bananas, legumes, oily fish, poultry, and nuts.
Antioxidants are another key to stress reduction, especially antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E, as they can help “lower blood pressure, protect the heart and digestive system, and encourage brain function,” according to Eat Yourself Calm. Fruits and vegetables are a good way to get antioxidants, especially those with the brightest colors.
Finally, reducing your caffeine and alcohol consumption can help reduce stress. Since caffeine is a stimulant, it causes the release of chemicals such as the fight or flight hormone adrenaline, which raises your body’s alertness and anxiety. Alcohol, although often used to relieve stress, can actually prolong it. According to an article in U.S. News, in some cases alcohol can decrease cortisol, the hormone which helps the body respond to stress, causing the anxiety to stay for an even longer time.
While exercise and sleep are critical for reducing stress, sometimes it’s hard to find the time to fit in a workout or go to bed earlier. Eating, on the other hand, is a part of your daily routine. Just make sure to include some stress reducing foods in your diet, and you’ll be on your way to a happier lifestyle in no time.

Google[x] unveils contact lenses to track blood sugar
Research teams at Google[x] and Novartis AG have joined forces to deliver to the world a smart way to correct vision as well as monitor blood sugar levels. Smart contact lenses, the latest in a series of technology products designed to correct bodily function, relay data on glucose contained in tears via a tiny sensor and an equally tiny antenna. 
In a news release earlier this month, Google described the technology in the lenses as being “so small they look like bits of glitter” and the antenna as being “thinner than human hair.”
The executive teams at both Google and Novartis believe these lenses will support a broader trend to involve patients in managing their own health, and to lower costs for management of chronic diseases.

Microsoft HoloLens merges technology and reality
Microsoft, on Jan. 21, released a video announcing its newest product: the HoloLens. Taking after the technology of Google Glass and the Oculus Rift, the HoloLens will blend the virtual and the real by superimposing an operating system onto the real world, enabling us to envision the world as we imagine and want it to be. 
That, according to the executive team at Microsoft, is only the beginning. The technology behind it is simple: The goggles will track your movements, watch your gaze and transform what you see by blasting light at your eyes. The HoloLens has applications involving virtual interaction. Because the device tracks where you are, you can use hand gestures, which right now include only a midair click, by raising and lowering your finger to interact with the 3-D images.

New medical robot  allows for better surgical methods
On Jan. 29, a surgical robot, fitted with a total of nine arms of varying sizes, carried out its debut operation on a cancer patient, at the Royal Marsden Hospital in England. 
The Da Vinci XI, a robot considered to be a technological breakthrough, has opened up the doors to various possible treatments. It is hand operated by surgeons, enabling them to make tiny and precise incisions. The robot mimics, but minimizes the movements of the surgeon who controls it, enabling them to carry out complex surgeries with minimal invasion. 
The recovery time of patients has been cut down by several months, with far less invasive keyhole surgery. In addition to reducing the recovery time, robotic surgery also reduces the pain experienced and the blood lost by patients.

New leads on a way to fight aging and disease
Scientists at the Stanford University School of Medicine could have finally made progress toward reversing the process of aging. The scientists are gearing up to announce to the world the new method of quickly and efficiently increasing the length of human telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that are mostly linked to aging and the advent of various diseases. The procedure involves the use of a modified type of RNA that allows researchers to generate large numbers of cells, which can then be used for study or drug development. In the recent studies conducted, skin cells with lengthened DNA were able to divide up to 40 more times compared to untreated cells, giving the scientists a lead as to treating diseases linked to shortened telomeres, and also in slowing down aging.

SpaceX explains the benefits of reusable rockets
Late last week, SpaceX released an animation that demonstrates what it would look like if the giant Falcon Heavy Rocket (one of the most powerful operation rockets in the world by a factor of two) returned home safely, after carrying its payload beyond earth’s atmosphere.
 This strategy is part of SpaceX’s effort to make space exploration cheaper with reusable rockets. SpaceX’s CEO Elon Musk believes that reusing parts from used rockets could potentially bring down the cost of production by a factor of one hundred, if only rockets were programmed to return to the earth after having completed their mission. Though SpaceX’s launch trial earlier in January failed, the team has big hopes for the Falcon Heavy Rocket, the launch of which is scheduled later this year.

Google’s self-driving car begins street testing
In May 2014, Google promised the public a self-driving car with no steering wheels or pedals, and they announced earlier this year that the car prototype is now “fully functional” and ready for testing on roads starting this February. The car will be tested first on a closed track and then on public roads, with “temporary manual controls” in case of a malfunction. 
The advent of self-driving cars, long dreamed of by auto giants such as Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and General Motors, has the potential of revolutionizing the “regular journey” by eradicating the need of forward facing seating, mirrors, and foot-operated controls.
Despite this ability, the prototype still resembles a normal vehicle, and is about the size of a smart car.

For someone searching for the ever-out-of-reach answer to the meaning of life, The Theory of Everything may prove a stepping stone in the eternal quest. Yet for entertainment it certainly falls flat. Do not go into The Theory of Everything looking for a good story, and if you can help it, go in knowing nothing at all about Stephen Hawking. Reading the Wikipedia page on Dr. Hawking’s life, at least in my estimation, essentially makes any element of plot a moot point.
A lack of plot or entertainment seems like the ultimate curse for a film, the basic description of a flop. It would certainly be hard to argue that The Theory of Everything is one such flop in the wake of the film’s many Oscar nominations. It is currently nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screen Play, and Best Original Score. The film tells the story of the legendary Professor Stephen Hawking, played by Eddie Redmayne, starting from his days as a Ph.D. student in physics at the University of Cambridge, to the release of his seminal book, A Brief History of Time. Far from focusing on Dr. Hawking’s professional life, much of the film centers around the blossom and decay of his relationship with his first wife Jane, played by Felicity Jones, while simultaneously dealing with the progression of his motor neuron disease. And if that wasn’t enough material to cover in the film, throw in friends, a choirmaster, a nurse, three children, and the rest of Hawking’s family. Indeed, the film leaves one feeling a bit whiplashed, never quite focusing on one subject long enough to get any real depth.
That is not to say that the film lacks emotion. In fact, the emotions it can elicit might be the most redeeming quality of the film and what showcase it as a piece of art. The characters are complex and rich, and played with extraordinary skill and subtlety. They leave you broken hearted one moment, the next laughing, and finally screaming at the screen for their insanity. One such outburst this author experienced was, “The man can barely eat and you’re having a third child with him? COME ON. BE REASONABLE!” And yet it is exactly these complex questions that make the film a great exploration of the human experience.
Jones and Redmayne deliver through the film’s emotional highs and lows; Felicity Jones deeply engages the audience. As the film progresses, even her most blank look conveys the internal struggle and pain that Jane is experiencing caring for a disabled husband and three young children. Her portrayal is matched by Redmayne who, though confined to a wheelchair for most of the film, is able to portray the depth of a complex (and surprisingly funny) man. But something is missing; in some way or another, the audience’s understanding of the characters feels hindered. If only the actors had some dialogue ...
Looking back on the film overall, one of the most amazing things was how little dialogue there was. Perhaps it was a commentary on the reserve of the English, but the dialogue is so sparse it is hard to believe that these people know each other at all. The lack of dialogue leaves the beginning of the film seeming almost ludicrous, because in the span of three meaningful glances Stephen and Jane have gone from just meeting to dealing with his motor neuron disease and getting married. Such a ridiculous plot jump has not been seen since Princess Anna and Prince Hans, of Frozen fame, got engaged.
On the other hand, from the standpoint of the filmmaking craft, The Theory of Everything is beautifully rich. The director, James Marsh, has a definite affinity for motifs, as they spring up throughout the movie, providing an interesting binding thread. The costuming is also a rather ingenious mechanism of character development. One watches rather helplessly as the flowing, young, dreamy dresses of young Jane morph into the old and frumpy. It is these details that help give the film its artistic quality.
Though containing too many themes, characters, and subject matters to truly deal with any of them, The Theory of Everything provides a sharp look at the meaning of life. It may be totally wrong for a movie night with friends, but perhaps it is a crucial piece of cinema. Be sure to watch it during your next existential crisis.

Thursday nights are Shonda Nights. No questions asked. Last winter left Shonda Rhimes’ fans with three nail biting mid-season finales on her hit shows Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and the newest addition to the line-up, How To Get Away with Murder. And this past Thursday marked the highly anticipated return of all three. Ever since 2012 when her hit series Scandal premiered immediately following her longtime success Grey’s Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes — screenwriter, director, and producer — has scheduled a place in millions of viewers’ weeks with hours of Thursday night delight.
I’m a newbie to the tradition, hopelessly hooked to Shonda Night’s newest addition, How To Get Away with Murder, written by Pete Nowalk and produced by Rhimes, which first aired last September. The show follows Annalise Keating, a sharp, brilliant, and mysterious law professor, and her five protégés (affectionally dubbed “The Keating Five.”) The characters work on criminal defense cases weekly, meanwhile unraveling a murder they are all somehow connected to over the course of this season’s episodes. While I recognize that this drama may sound like any other court show, watching just one episode will show you why it’s not.
Every Thursday when I tune in, I get goose bumps when Oscar-nominated actress Viola Davis steps into the role of Annalise Keating, a character I’ve never seen the likes of on television before. Annalise is an incredibly powerful and respected lawyer who presents herself as a strong, self-assured professional, doing everything she can to fight for those who are innocent. In the very first episode, she commands a college lecture hall as she proudly marches down to the front of the blackboard and introduces her class to “Criminal Defense 101” or as she likes to call it, “How to Get Away with Murder”. In that tension filled moment, I remember sitting on the couch and holding my breath until her sly smile and bright eyes gave me permission to breathe again. In every scene of every episode, Annalise exudes confidence from the classroom to the courtroom, which is exactly what her clients need as she saves them from punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. In one case when she has the chance to save a wrongfully accused client from time on death row, she delivers an impassioned speech, almost getting thrown out of the courtroom, which ultimately brings a powerful senator to his knees. After she wins that case, her law student, Michaela Pratt, (played by Aja Maomi King) speaks for us all when she says, “I wanna be her”.
But one-dimensional characters aren’t fun, so behind the confident brilliance viewers also get a glimpse of the other Annalise, a woman who is scared, plagued by betrayal, mistrust, and dishonesty behind the doors of Keating and Associates. In a much-buzzed-about scene, after an exhausting court case, we see Annalise physically stripping down her powerful image as she removes makeup, eyelashes, and her wig and looks into the mirror to see her natural self. I couldn’t imagine such a powerful moment with any other actress in the “I woke up like this” era of television. Her vulnerability serves as a refreshing look to see a complex character; a woman struggling with her marriage, struggling with her morality, and struggling with herself.
Shortly after the show premiered, New York Times TV Critic Alessandra Stanley wrote about how Shonda Rhimes’ productions, referred to as Shondaland, have created a generation of African-American women who are “authority figures with sharp minds and potent libidos who are respected,” unlike the many “sassy sidekick” roles African-American actors and actresses are often reduced to. Viola Davis has risen to fame in many of these supporting roles, winning an Oscar nomination for 8 minutes of screen time in the film Doubt. But Davis describes herself as the type of individual who works hard no matter the number of pages in the script she’s given. And so far, we’ve seen this; she doesn’t waste a single second during the show.
My obsession with How To Get Away With Murder hasn’t ended with Thursday nights. Both Shonda Rhimes and Viola Davis are incredibly successful women and have incredibly valuable lessons to share. If you missed Rhimes’ commencement speech last year at her alma mater Dartmouth College, you’re missing out. She speaks honestly and openly about the differences between dreamers and doers, criticizing our generation for our focus on hashtag activism. She tells young people that we need to recognize the difference between wishing and doing, pushing for us to take action on the latter. At one point she is hilariously straightforward when she says, “So you think, ‘I wish I could travel.’ Great. Sell your crappy car, buy a ticket to Bangkok, and go. Right now. I’m serious.” And, speaking simply and openly, you and I both know that she’s absolutely right.
I keep these lessons close to my heart and am grateful that I live in a time and place where I can look up to see these incredible women doing amazing work and being recognized and celebrated for it. I get to learn lessons about success and failure, hard work and humility, complexity, and morality from women who have an incredible gift and power. That’s why Thursday nights mean so much to me. And if you’d like to join in, I’ll save some room on the couch.

Dear Evan,
My boyfriend has started sleeping over more often, which is great. What’s not so great, though, is that I don’t think it’s because we’re becoming closer. We’ve been fighting more about the littlest things, and he’s started having dinner with his friends most of the time instead of me.
I think it’s because of the walrus. My mom gave me this huge stuffed animal walrus when I left for college, and a few weeks ago I took it out of my storage bin and put it next to my desk facing the window, so that it could survey the outdoors.
My boyfriend’s taken to bringing it to bed with us, then nestling up close to it. Every time I try to get close so we can snuggle, he just snores loudly (I know he’s faking) and grinds up against Edgar, the walrus.
I’m afraid that I’m losing my boyfriend to my giant stuffed walrus. What do I do to win him back?
Heartbreakingly,
Old Days Of Bonding Escape my Newest Understanding, Seems he’d Rather Ordinarily Sport with My Animal, Really Upsetting my Soul
Dear ODOBENUS ROSMARUS,
How lifelike is this walrus? If Edgar is a cute, plushie-fied version of the actual beast, then you lost the war the minute you took the walrus out of the box. Not even Olivia Wilde could compete with a cute version of a giant sack of blubber and flesh. If it’s pretty lifelike, however, you have some options.
The simplest answer would have you hide or trash the walrus, but I’d imagine that’s equivalent to making a heroin addict go cold turkey: You’d be sure to suffer some major consequences somehow. You’d have to hide all your other stuffed animals, too, so that he doesn’t find a substitute — or tear them to shreds.
Probably the best option is to break your bank account and go to couple’s counseling — and bring Edgar with you.
If their relationship has gotten to the point where they’re taking moonlit walks through the park together, then you’ve got no chance. Might as well find yourself a nice plushie sloth. 
Or a psychotherapist,
Evan Kahn

I’ve always loved the physical signs of history. I love that the rushing tide of human life has carved its structures and swirls into the world. One of the reasons I chose to study abroad in Granada, Spain this semester was that Spain’s unique history of interaction between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish cultures permeates the city. A prominent example of this exchange is the Alhambra.
The Alhambra is a mix between palace and military fortress. Originally a military base, the Alhambra was built in the 9th century on Sabika Hill, right on the banks of the Darro River. The complex commands a strategically excellent view of the countryside and the city. In the 13th century, Mohammad I renovated the fortress, decorating it with religious and cultural artwork, and adding a water system that still works today. In 1492, the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada. The Alhambra remained an important palace for Spanish royalty until it was abandoned during the 18th century. 
All of this history adds up: the Alhambra is very old, very big, and completely beautiful. The outer walls of the complex are visible from all over the city, and are made of a reddish clay particular to this area of Spain. At night, when the Alhambra is illuminated, the walls shine a deep red-orange color. My two favorite aspects of the Alhambra are the Islamic decorations and the view from the walls. Arabic script figures prominently in the adornment of the buildings. Poems ring entire rooms, and variants on “Allah is the Lord” appear over and over again, carved into the white and cream marble that so many of the inner walls are made of. Carving words into the walls instead of painting them or hanging tapestries holds a certain beautiful simplicity. To me, the words look like decoration, but to someone who can read Arabic, they communicate a constant reaffirmation of faith. I love the idea that the assertion of belief is all the decoration that a palace needs.
The other part of visiting the Alhambra that I loved was the view from the walls. It seems clichéd — I liked the view — but rather I liked the way I could see a kind of history stretching out before me. American cities were designed with trade in mind; most major population centers revolve around rivers and potential ports, without the same clear need to protect and defend. While early American invaders had bloody conflicts with Native Americans, the threat of attack did not exist on the constant scale and level that many European cities experienced. From the walls, I could see that the fortress and the city were built with invasion and defense in mind. The Darro River and the mountains protect the city, and from the Alhambra, you can see for miles. From a military standpoint, visibility is key. Up on the walls, I felt like I could see the needs and the fears of the past so clearly.

Carnegie Mellon’s a campus known for embracing quirkiness, but some of us still have appearances to maintain — not all of us want to be upfront about our appreciation of anime, and in my case it’s usually pretty easy. Generally, I’m not impressed by the bulk of Japanese broadcast animation; they tend to strike me as kind of trope-y and formulaic. Even if there are interesting designs or story flourishes, another show about the machinations of a student council or the passion-based fighting style of a cyborg is something I can’t put up with for too long.
So that’s why I’m so glad that something like Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure exists.
While there are older animated adaptations of the acclaimed manga by Hirohiko Araki, the latest run is jam-packed with visual charm and a great sense of style. Heavily stylized openings accompanied by delightfully hokey original compositions embrace the over-the-top attitude of the series show with arresting color palettes and some impressively detailed character animation that might just be CGI, but looks like nothing else.
It’s an indicator of what happens visually during the show as well. Every character in this show is built like a Greek statue, and there’s a goofy tendency for them to strike body-building poses when they deliver important lines. In scenes of heightened peril or emotion it’s not uncommon for the colors to shift shades enough that everything gets purple overtones or, in the case of the most recent episode, a villain is shown in shades of green as he stalks one of the heroes.
The series tells the story of a multi-generational struggle between the Joestar family and the immortal Dio. A deliciously evil and eminently quotable villain, Dio is transformed by an ancient stone mask from a malicious London street urchin out of an Austen novel into a bloodthirsty vampire. He partners up with the likes of Jack the Ripper and builds an army of the undead in a small British village.
The only one who can stop him is perfect gentleman Jonathan Joestar (called Jojo, as is the protagonist of every subsequent season). He’s taught an ancient martial art by an Italian baron named Zeppeli that allows him to “imbue his punches with sunlight.” Joined by Robert E. O. Speedwagon, he confronts the vampire and manages to seal him away.
Oh, did I mention that most every character in the show is named after an American musician or song from the ‘80s or ‘90s? Because there is literally a character named ACDC. He’s a bad guy from the second story arc. In this arc, Jonathan’s grandson, Joseph, is traveling the world to fight the ancient civilization of incredibly buff men who created the mask that transformed Dio. He teams up with a Nazi cyborg and a few other outrageous fighters to defeat this new threat, culminating in a fight inside an active volcano off the coast of Italy.
The current season is about Joseph and his stoic, tough-guy, half-Japanese grandson fighting their way across southern Asia alongside a serious Egyptian fortune teller, a manic French duelist, and another Japanese high schooler who likes to hang out poolside... in his school uniform. They’re trying to reach Cairo after Dio re-emerges, but this time, instead of using ancient martial arts, everybody gets a physical manifestation of their force of will called a “stand.”
The fighting in the later seasons becomes a little faster paced, and while there’s still has a lot of exposition about attacks and powers, things are kept fresh and visually interesting, and fights don’t usually last longer than an episode. It’s somewhat offset by a number of long narrations about some of the exotic locales visited by the group, explaining local customs or tourist attractions.
Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is a completely ridiculous and utterly fun watch that either bucks the trends of a lot of anime or embraces them so wholeheartedly that they seem interesting again. If you’re looking for 75+ episodes of something to watch that looks good and is unabashedly silly in a way that’ll recapture some of the joy of your first exposure to “Japanimation,” look no further.

This past week, one of my best friends from home texted me. Her boyfriend’s birthday is coming up next week, and she wants to make him cupcakes. Here’s where I come in: “Any suggestion on flavor?” She obviously came to the right person, because the answer is yes — I always have ideas for cupcakes! In addition to being one of my greatest friends, she is also the busy mother of a beautiful 8-month-old baby boy. To give her a flavor that isn’t going to take up a whole bunch of time, I’ve come up with a really fun idea that can be made almost entirely with store-bought ingredients: The ice cream cake cupcake.
You know those delicious ice cream cakes from Dairy Queen? Layers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, separated by those little cookie crunchies that were really the only reason you loved the cake, then topped with a creamy whipped frosting. Now imagine all of that scrumptious nostalgia being reborn as a cupcake. The bottom layer, in lieu of ice cream, is a layer of chocolate cake, followed by the cookies, vanilla ice cream, then a perfect swirl of whipped cream, not complete without some rainbow sprinkles and a cherry on top — or a candle for the birthday boy! This can be as easy or as involved as you want it to be. If you’ve got all the time and resources in the world, you could make every single part from scratch. On the other hand, if you’re in a pinch or pinching pennies, each component can also come straight from the grocery store. I’m going to make just the cake from scratch, but buy the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream from the store. If you want to make ice cream or whipped cream at home, there are plenty of recipes on the web!
Cake
1 cups of sugar
7/8 cups of flour (do your best estimation)
3/8 cup of cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon of baking powder
3/4 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1 eggs
1/2 cup of milk
1/4 cup of vegetable oil
1 teaspoon of vanilla
1/2 cup of boiling water
Cookie Crunchies
1 package of Oreos or Chocolate Wafers (but I recommend Oreos)
1 bottle of chocolate Magic Shell (that super exciting ice cream topping)
Vanilla ice cream
Whipped cream
Rainbow sprinkles or jimmies (I am tolerant of all language variations)
Maraschino cherries
Instructions
First things first, preheat the oven to 350 degrees and put liners in two full cupcake trays, 24 cupcakes total. Measure out the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Then put in the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla, and stir it all up. Really carefully, pour the hot water in. If you’re wondering why the water has to be hot, it’s because it really helps to bring out the flavor of the chocolate, so no cheating! The mixture should be thin, so don’t worry, you didn’t do anything wrong. Put a generous spoonful into all of the liners and bake those for about 8 minutes.
While those are baking and cooling, start making the cookie layer. If you have Oreos you’ll have to separate each and every cookie from its cream filling. Even though it takes longer, at least you’ll get to eat all that Oreo filling! If you got chocolate wafers instead, try not to be too sad. After you have a ton of naked cookies, crush them using either a food processor or a zip-lock bag and a hammer-type object (excellent for stress relief). Don’t crush them into crumbs, but keep them in big enough chunks that they’ll be recognizable and crunchy. Pour them into a bowl with the whole bottle of magic shell and mix it all up. Before you keep going, make sure the cupcakes are cooled the whole way through so the entire thing doesn’t melt!
If you have time to soften the ice cream, that will be really helpful in binding all of the elements together. To assemble the cupcake, spoon enough crumblies to cover the cake, then put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of the cookie layer. When all 24 are done, put them in the freezer so it all sticks. Keep them in there until it’s time to serve, then swirl some whipped cream over the ice cream, followed by the sprinkles and, of course, the cherry on top!

Outside The Frame Gallery on Friday night, blue and red lights flashed like police sirens from a front window onto the corner of Margaret Morrison Street and Forbes Avenue, where people rushing to get out of the cold were illuminated momentarily. Black screens covered the windows of the gallery, preventing onlookers from seeing inside. The title of the show, Blackout, a dramatic concept, emphasizes the powerful and drastic nature of the artwork inside The Frame.
The exhibit, curated by sophomore art majors Maya Kaisth and Jarel Grant, is part of the annual celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. M. Shernell Smith, assistant director of Blackout, coordinator of campus MLK Day events, and housefellow for The Intersection, worked in collaboration with The Frame co-directors Jamie Earnest and Emily Miller to bring art addressing national social and racial discrimination to the gallery. “We have the MLK writing awards, which are wonderful, but I really felt as if there was a creative element missing,” Smith said of the MLK celebrations. In November, after approaching Earnest and Miller at The Frame, the three issued a call asking for individuals interested in curating a show dealing with the topics of racial and social injustices.
When approaching topics such as these it is important to remember the scope of the conversation. Carnegie Mellon’s celebration of Dr. King’s legacy has examined local, national, and international inequalities. As a globally recognized university, Carnegie Mellon has a unique role in shaping the dialogue surrounding issues of injustice and ignorance across national borders. However, Smith thought it was important to have a space for members of the campus community to respond to the recent events in Ferguson and New York as well as create art in response to the day-to-day experiences of living and growing up in this country. “We needed a space that allowed us to have a national conversation about injustices, period,” Smith said. And Blackout does just that. Every piece is provocative and illustrates the nuances in everybody’s experiences within America’s cultural and racial framework.
Maya Kaisth, one of the curators, decided to apply to take on the project when she attended a student-led protest at Schenley Plaza with Jarel Grant. Kaisth felt passionately that she “didn’t want to glaze over any of the hard topics brought to light by current events.” Both she and Jarel contributed to the exhibition. Kaisth’s piece uses the screens that prevent people on the street from seeing inside the gallery. On the sides of the sheets facing inward, Kaisth projected recent trending hashtags, such as “#icantbreathe,” as well as hashtags dealing with similar subject matter from a couple years ago, such as “#trayvonmartin.” Occasionally obscured by individuals passing in front of the projector, the flashing of these hashtags across the screen is an ever-present reminder of the gravity and relevance of these issues today. “I wanted to make a piece that was integral to Blackout and showed the importance of new media and social media in framing the movement,” Kaisth said.
When Kaisth and Grant sent out a call to artists, they received responses from non-majors, majors, and faculty alike. The media range from drawings to sculpture to video art.
Some of the art in the exhibition uses text to make a powerful statement. BHA junior Jacqueline Barnes’ piece “Betoken me,” is an illustrated narrative of her life accompanied by text. Each piece in the series shows how she has felt throughout her life, and talks about the power of her art to communicate her experiences. Phrases like “so I dreamed when I could not breathe, making a mold where none would fit me,” are incredibly powerful.
Junior art major Heather Cowie used her experiences on the popular app Tinder to create her piece “Me so lucky.” Cowie took the racial slurs and demeaning phrases that had been directed at her as an Asian woman by people on Tinder, and wrote them out on slips of paper like the kind found in fortune cookies. Fortune cookies and the “fortunes” stand on a small pedestal and gallery goers are encouraged to pick them up and read them.
Junior music performance major Nehemiah Russell’s piece “Civil War” included the text “with liberty and justice for all” in front of an illustration of a man’s face and shoulders divided down the center. The left side of the man’s face is a policeman, and the right side is an African-American man. The word “civil” falls on the side with the policeman, and the word “war” falls on the side opposite. The juxtaposition in color and identity of the two sides of the man is powerful and painfully truthful.
The rest of the pieces in the show are just as fascinating and important. “Wanting to be left alone,” a video art piece by sophomore art major Clair Chin, shows the artist white washing herself with derogatory words and phrases written on her skin. “Will Horton,” associate professor of art Andrew Johnson’s piece, is a drawing of Will Horton created from shoe polish used on top of sewn together flags that have been white washed. Walking through the exhibit brings so many questions and unique experiences to light. And that, after all, is the point of art — to make people think about their experiences and others’ and seek to learn more.
Smith hopes that exhibitions similar to Blackout can be done in future years in connection with MLK events. This year’s celebrations in honor of Dr. King have been emphasizing the importance of continuing a dialogue. Art is a way to get students out from behind their computer to go look at what experiences are like for those in their community. That is a different kind of engagement in a movement, one that relies less on acknowledging articles on Facebook in passing, and one that relies more on person-to-person interaction and understanding others’ lives and experiences. That is engagement, and Blackout certainly explores perspectives and experiences that are eye opening and essential to our understanding if we ever hope to achieve equality.
Blackout is on view at The Frame until Feb. 20.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra had a concert on Friday Jan. 30th. The concert, conducted by Krysztof Urbanski, was held at the ever opulent Heinz Hall. If you’ve never been, I would greatly encourage going to a symphony just for the ambiance of the Hall. The auditorium is beautifully lit, with impressive chandeliers adorning the ceiling in an arrangement that is reminiscent of a necklace. The stage itself is surrounded by impressive, modern-looking auditory buffers and wood paneling, and the wall-to-floor red velvet carpeting completes the experience, making a potential viewer feel like he stepped into an old European opera house. The concert itself opened with “Russian Overture,” a piece composed by Sergei Prokofiev. The piece started out with simple call and response melodies and never extended its reach to elicit any emotion from the viewer in its relatively brief 14-minute runtime.
The second piece was the highlight of the show, due in no small part to soloist Noah Bendix-Balgley, a violinist of international quality who is soon going to be Berlin Philharmonic’s concertmaster. The piece, Concerto for Violin and Orchestra by Aram Khachutarian, featured Balgley, who lent immense emotional gravitas to the solo parts. The Concerto’s opening movement is performed in the traditional sonata form, with two contrasting themes and a full development section. After a brief introductory outburst by the orchestra, Balgley presents an animated motif that soon evolves into a bounding, close-interval folk dance. This theme, punctuated once by the strong orchestral chords from the introduction, continues for some time before it gives way to a lyrical complementary strain of nostalgic emotional character. As the movement unfolds, the soloist is required to display one dazzling technical feat after another, culminating in a huge cadenza that serves as the bridge to the recapitulation. The finale is a whirling showpiece for Balgley that evokes the energetic world of jazz as Balgley’s violin playing drops in with blazing orchestral color.
The final piece, “Pictures at an Exhibition” was composed by Modest Mussorgsky. The piece is composed of ten different sections. According to Mussorgsky, the first section, called Promenade, depicts the composer roving through the exhibition “now leisurely, now briskly, and at times sadly, thinking of his friend.” The piece’s opening act is a mixture of triumph and quiet introspection. The soloist Balgley calls forth the feeling of matchless beauty and sacred enchantment during this part. The middle section is fairly standard material, and then the piece ends in an epic orchestral movement, with booming brass and swelling score. If anything, I would recommend one see the orchestra simply for the soloist, whose masterful playing creates emotional depth throughout the three pieces.

Childhood mandolin prodigy Chris Thile continues to wow listeners with his virtuosity at age 33. Thile made a name for himself with the progressive acoustic band Nickel Creek in 1989, and since their dissolution has become a popular collaborator due to his undeniable talent and genre crossover ability. In 2006, Chris Thile formed The Punch Brothers, then called How to Grow a Band, and cut their first album How to Grow a Woman from the Ground.
Since 2006 The Punch Brothers have released four additional albums, the most recent of which is Phosphorescent Blues, released this week. Straddling bluegrass, alternative rock, and classical genres, the band focused on various areas for each of their past albums and projects. Coming off of the success of their last studio album Who’s Feeling Young Now, the band had a lot to live up to, giving their fans some of the same kinds of music while continuing to explore their sound. As a result, fans have had very specific criticisms of this most recent album depending on the genre they would like the band to lean toward.
The band, made up of frontman singer and mandolin player Chris Thile, violinist Gabe Witcher, guitarist Chris Eldridge, banjo player Noam Pikelny, and bassist Paul Kowert, all contribute their prodigal skill in complex and virtuosic musical demonstrations during each number (each band member also lends additional vocals.) Phosphorescent Blues is no exception. On the song “My Oh My,” Pikelny’s quick banjo licks make the rhythmic nature of the song fun and exciting. “My Oh My,” a single from the album, is inarguably the catchiest song and one that is the most reminiscent of the lyric-driven, harmony-filled, and chorus-oriented numbers from Who’s Feeling Young Now.
However, “My Oh My” is one of the only satisfying moments from the album for those looking for more songs like favorites “Who’s Feeling Young Now” or “This Girl.” In general the tenor of this latest album is more laidback, with calmer, more soothing melodies that are more classically influenced. Indeed there are a few solely instrumental pieces including “Passepied,” an arrangement of Debussy. These classical interpretations are beautiful and certainly fascinating for lovers of Debussy and other composers listeners they may recognize. These pieces are similar to Thile’s earlier period of instrumental arrangements of classical pieces as well as his album Not All Who Wander are Lost. The removal of a vocal line allows the instrumentation to become even more textured than it is in some of the other numbers.
The majority of the numbers are more bluesy — as the title of the album would suggest. “Forgotten” is a melodic exploration of the lyrics and doesn’t adhere to the more traditional song structure of some of their earlier works. While one might appreciate the avant-garde nature of such songs, some of them work and some of them get a little overwrought toward the end. “Between 1st and A” is such a song, where calm soothing humming over long expanses of strumming (though incredibly impressive), isn’t super thought-provoking or stimulating. “Julep,” another single from the record, is an example of when a rambling musical exploration works in a satisfying way. In addition, “Julep” lyrics such as “heaven’s a julep on the porch,” conjure up vivid imagery. The song moves forward to give listeners new material often enough to keep them entertained.
Thile and the band have obvious talent as songwriters and arrangers. Though they run the risk of being too noisy due to the prevalence of strummy and melodic acoustic instruments, arrangements are nuanced enough so that the banjo, guitar, mandolin, and violin combination never gets aurally overbearing. Lyrically the songs are interesting, having inspirations ranging from failed relationships to beautiful and wonderful days, and a lot of ground is covered.
Phosphorescent Blues is not a disappointment in the sense that The Punch Brothers have lost what makes them so special in the genre crossover world. But due to its combination of musical types: alternative rock pieces from albums like Who’s Feeling Young Now, experimental roaming bluegrass tunes, and instrumental arrangements of classical music, the album loses some of its coherence. Previous albums have had a more coherent musical sound, but this one leaves listeners feeling a little unsettled and confused. These complaints, however, are not enough to make a faithful Punch Brothers fan disheartened and it will be very exciting to see what these men do in the future.

A Carnegie Mellon graduate student and alumnus were found dead in Sherwood Towers Apartments on North Craig Street in an apparent murder-suicide last Thursday.
Chalalai Chaihirunkarn, 26, a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computation, Organizations, and Society program within the School of Computer Science (SCS), and alumnus Bryan Springer (CIT ‘07), 29, were found in their apartment after the building’s management asked police to check on the apartment’s occupants.
Chaihirunkarn was shot multiple times in the head and chest after Springer purchased a gun and ammunition from Iron City Armory in Bridgeville on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported. Springer was an information technology support associate at the Software Engineering Institute, according to an email to the campus from Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno.
“We are reaching out to family members and friends to offer any assistance we can provide in this time of loss,” Casalegno wrote in the email.
Chaihirunkarn was attending Carnegie Mellon with a fellowship from the government of Thailand, Director of the Institute for Software Research (ISR) William Scherlis wrote in an email to members of the institute. She was being advised by ISR professor James Herbsleb and was also a graduate of SCS’s MSIT in eBusiness Technology program, according to Scherlis. Springer had family in Thailand as well.
“Chalalai’s colleagues talk both about her talent and capability as a researcher and also about her as a kind and thoughtful friend,” Scherlis wrote in the email.
In regards to Springer, Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Software Engineering Institute Paul Nielsen wrote to members of the institute, “I know I speak for the entire Executive Leadership Team when I say our hearts are with those who are grieving the loss of one of our SEI family.”
Dean of the School of Computer Science Andrew Moore wrote in an email to the School of Computer Science, “I am shocked and grieved and my personal thoughts are with the families. I am sure we all feel the same way.”

Making the Carnegie Mellon experience last a lifetime, balancing work and wellness, and better representing minorities on campus were just some of the items up for discussion at Wednesday’s campus-wide strategic planning town hall meeting.
The university’s second town hall this academic year drew in an array of campus members, including undergraduates, graduates, exchange students, staff, faculty, and administrators, leaving many to stand on the edges of the packed Posner Center conference room.
Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, spoke first about the ways in which Carnegie Mellon can enhance its learning experience, one of the main focus areas for those charged with creating the university’s new strategic plan.
Among a number of points listed in the slideshow, Scheines focused on the ideas of forming “meaningful interdisciplinary experiences” and creating “the degree with long tails.” He first proposed that students from different majors study topics such as sustainable energy, immigration, or privacy to show how differing viewpoints bring different ideas. He then proposed that students have opportunities for research later on in their undergraduate careers.
Scheines also proposed that the university better merge creative disciplines like art and music with more academic majors like business and politics.
Focusing on the concept of creating a degree that lasts longer than four years, Interim Provost Nathan Urban proposed that the university provide opportunities for high school students and graduates to continue learning from Carnegie Mellon through initiatives such as programs for high school students or technology-enhanced learning and access to additional programs for alumni. Urban described the idea of alumni as a “subscription to a CMU degree for decades thereafter.”
Next, James Garrett, dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT), introduced Carnegie Bosch professor of marketing Peter Boatwright to discuss facets of “Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship,” which was identified as a focus area in early discussions of the strategic plan.
Boatwright suggested that the university try to have broader societal impact, nurture innovation, be known as a place where people go to learn about leading innovation and entrepreneurship, and that the university broaden support for faculty and students. Gary Fedder, CIT’s associate dean for research, proposed campus members work with the private sector, have flexible work spaces, have more entrepreneurs in residence, and connect to alumni, among other ideas, to achieve these goals.
Speaking about the campus experience, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert asked those attending the town hall, “how can we maintain our excellence in all domains while ensuring a commitment to wellness for all campus members?”
“One of the things — the challenge — is this sort of implicit notion ... that there’s somehow some conflict between really working as hard as we want people to work and quality of life,” said Caroline Acker, head of the department of history. “Whereas I think what we’re looking for is that level of hard work that is compatible with quality of life that does not have a lot of wasted energy.”
John Lehoczky, interim vice president, addressed the issue of diversity on campus, asking members how the university can promote diversity in all three strategic planning focus areas, as well as recruit diverse members to the campus community. Lehoczky cited “low representation of minority groups and women in the student body, staff, and faculty” and in “the leadership of the university at all levels” as one of the hurdles to achieving this diversity.
Last, K. Jimmy Hsia, vice provost for international programs and strategy asked attending members how Carnegie Mellon can present itself in a world where an international presence is “not a luxury.” Among his questions, Hsia asked how the university can consistently be top in the world, address the world’s “most pressing problems,” and act quickly on international opportunities.
The third campus-wide town hall for the strategic plan will occur in March, with a specific date and time to be determined. For a recording of this town hall, visit www.cmu.edu/strategic-plan.

Last week, students in the School of Drama noticed something different about the lobby of the Purnell Center for the Arts: The large painting that hangs over the lobby’s lower stairwell was marked with a set of initials in the lower right-hand corner.
This isn’t the first time the painting has been marked. According to Jonathan Ward, the properties master of the School of Drama, the painting was first defaced about a year ago, when someone wrote the initials “FTC” in the lower left-hand corner in what looks like white crayon or oil pastel. The most recent initials, “TSU,” appeared just last week.
Although the provenance of the large painting is murky, Ward thinks that it was given as a gift to the School of Drama when the school was founded in 1914. The portrait was painted by Louis Kronberg, a Boston native who has other works hanging in the Philadelphia Academy Charter School and New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The subject of the painting is Richard Mansfield, a European actor, in his role of Cyrano de Bergerac in the eponymous play, which he performed on Broadway in 1898 and 1899.
Ward estimated that Kronberg painted the portrait around the turn of the 19th century. Ward found the painting in the School of Drama’s storage warehouse about four years ago, and learned that it used to be on display in the Dean’s Office of the School of Drama. Ward decided to bring the portrait back to life in the Purnell Center for the Arts lobby, and even uses it as part of his stagecraft props class — he teaches students to repair the chips and fractures in the painting’s elaborate gilded frame.
“It’s a really cool and impressive piece of artwork, and it fits our lobby really well,” Ward said. “It’s been moved a lot, it’s been stored a lot, and there’s been some deterioration, but it’s still kind of neat to see a relic like that, to have it in our lobby.”
When Ward saw the most recent graffiti tag on the painting, he contacted University Police, as well as University Archives, which informed him that the painting is not part of Carnegie Mellon’s artistic property collection, and belongs to the School of Drama alone.
According to University Police, the investigation of this incident is ongoing.
“We’re interviewing people and we don’t have any strong leads at this point,” Lieutenant Gary Scheimer said. “But we’re still hopeful, and we’re going to find out who did this and why.”
The Carnegie Mellon Police Department is working with the Pittsburgh Police Department, which has a dedicated graffiti task force, and the Port Authority Police, which also has an extensive graffiti investigative department. Ward noted that he had seen the tag “TSU” in other places around Pittsburgh.
Students and faculty alike are dismayed and shocked that someone would deface the 100-year-old work of art. “It makes me really sad and upset that someone would vandalize something so beautiful,” Ward said.
“I think it’s old; I think it’s expensive.” said sophomore musical theatre major Lea Dimarchi. “I think we all kind of agree it’s disrespectful, and we don’t really know who did it.”
Ward said that the next step is to restore the painting. Although Ward lacks the experience to restore the painting himself, he has contacted the Carnegie Museum of Art’s restoration department and hopes to restore the painting with their help.
Ward stressed that the painting still hangs in the Purnell lobby. “I’m not covering [it] up. I’m not making a point to hide it. Because the general response has been very similar to my own, from anybody I’ve talked to: That this is just disgraceful, it’s just wrong, and nothing this beautiful deserves to be treated like this.”

The Northeastern U.S. bundled up in anticipation of Winter Storm Juno early last week. Pittsburgh was firmly within the designated disaster zone and prepared accordingly, canceling more than three dozen flights out of Pittsburgh International Airport, among other moves to combat the Steel City’s impending weather.
The predictions didn’t pan out. The fear that the whole Northeast was moments from becoming a tableau in The Day After Tomorrow turned out to be based on a forecast error by the National Weather Service (NWS).
The storm hit slightly further north and to the east than initially expected. The storm turned out to be problematic for places like Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, which did receive record snowfall of over two feet, interrupting many citizens’ daily activities.
This saved Pittsburgh from the brunt of the storm. The official tally, according to The Weather Channel, turned out to be 4.3 inches of snow, still a heavy snowfall considering Pittsburgh’s usual January totals. On average, only 0.8 days in January per year receive three inches of snowfall, and 0.2 receive five inches, according to currentresults.com.
Using the site’s provided data, there would be approximately 0.33 days receiving the level of snowfall Pittsburgh got, meaning this kind of storm only happens once every three years. That level of impact is not something to just brush off, but it does not compare to the estimates of between one and two feet, with rates predicted to reach two feet of snow per hour.
Given the forecasts, students at Carnegie Mellon were unimpressed by the storm.
“I thought school would be canceled,” said sophomore physics major Anthony Paone. “But then it barely snowed at all.”
The contrast between expectation and reality was echoed by much of the student body with common terms like “underwhelming” and “anti-climactic.”
The contrast between the predictions and reality led to some anger with local politicians and the NWS.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city may experience a “potentially historic blizzard,” which some saw as an overreaction to the models given the reality of the storm in New York, which saw less than a foot despite predictions nearing three feet. The mayor received backlash for his decision to shut the city down, but defended the decision to The Weather Channel saying, “We heard from meteorologists all over the region, that this was going to be two feet or more of snow. If that had proven to be true ... it was a no-brainer this was the right thing to do.”
Additionally, the NWS claimed that their prediction was largely correct in predicting the shape and intensity of the storm, but their projections were about 50 to 100 miles off.
While the snow was unusually intense, it did not reach the heights initially predicted. Pittsburgh residents were able to go about their daily activities without severe disruptions, except for flights into and out of the city.

Financial allocation: CMU International Film Festival
Senate discussed a request to allocate $4,000 to the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, an organization that brings filmmakers and directors to campus. The $4,000 would mainly be used to bring an Oscar-nominated filmmaker to the festival. 
Last year, 4,000 people attended the festival, of which 40 percent are estimated to be students. 
Tickets to the festival will be $5 per film for Carnegie Mellon-affiliated attendees and $10 for the general public, with packages available at a discounted price. Senate voted to approve the allocation.
Financial allocation: Tartan Sports Analytic Club
The Tartan Sports Analytic Club approached Senate for funding to attend the SABR Analytics Conference, which is in Phoenix, Ariz. from March 12–14. 
The group’s cost for registering for the competition is $1,750. The Tartan Sports Analytic Club has forty members and seeks to advance the skills of its members through analyzing the sports-associated statistics. 
At the conference, members will have the opportunity to both compete and meet those involved in the analytics industry. Senate voted to fund the conference registration costs.
Financial allocation: CMU's Got Talent
After a two year absence, the CMU’s Got Talent event will be hosted after Carnival in late April. Organizers of the event approached Senate for funding to cover unexpected costs.
In addition to the performances of students competing in the event, there will also be presentations from a UNICEF-related charity on the topic of human trafficking and performances by rappers Dumbfoundead and Awkwafina.
The goal of this event is to work as a public relations campaign and benefit Ten Thousand Villages.
Additional money will also be sought through the CMU Crowdfunding service as well as alumni donations.

Professors explore digital privacy issues and policy
A new study published by Carnegie Mellon professors found that people are often influenced by others when deciding what, and how much, they disclose online.
The study, published in Science by Carnegie Mellon professors Alessandro Acquisti, Laura Brandimarte, and George Loewenstein examines the key privacy issues facing people and their behaviors in the modern age, and makes recommendations for policy responses.
The study pinpointed three findings regarding people’s perceptions and actions with respect to privacy issues: often being uncertain about the consequences of their privacy-related choices, the level of concern about privacy being context-dependent, and influences by companies and government which can make people’s privacy concerns malleable.
For example, people do not understand the consequences of sharing a family milestone or are not sure about their own privacy preferences, according to the release. 
In terms of malleability, the study cited, among other examples, the idea that people let other forces, like website administrators, make choices about their privacy, making their concerns flexible dependent upon who suggests the privacy settings to them.
The authors concluded that policy approaches which focus exclusively on informing individuals of the privacy risks faced when using technology are not adequate, and should instead focus on attaining a better balance of power among individual people, governments, and companies using their digital data.
CMU partners to create Humanities Festival
Carnegie Mellon has announced that it is partnering with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust to launch the first Pittsburgh Humanities Festival.
Scheduled for March 26–29, the Humanities Festival will focus on the theme “Smart Talk About Stuff That Matters” and will be hosted in various locations throughout Pittsburgh’s Cultural District and surrounding neighborhoods.
“The festival will demonstrate the humanities — broadly defined as knowledge of humankind and its works — are stimulating, entertaining and vital to the life of the community,” said professor of English and Director of Carnegie Mellon’s Humanities Center David Shumway in a university press release.
Carnegie Mellon and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust provided details of a vision for the Humanities Festival in a roundtable on Jan. 28. Tickets for the Pittsburgh Humanities Festival will go on sale Feb. 16.

See CON side of this debate here.
President Obama made history in India last week by becoming the first United States president to attend India’s Republic Day Parade as its chief guest. Held every year on the 26th of January since 1950, Republic Day commemorates India adopting its constitution to become a democratic republic.
Traditionally, the chief guests at these parades have been the heads of India’s old allies. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took on the role in 2014, French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007. As such, President Obama’s attendance signals a new era of strong alliance between India and the United States that will be highly beneficial to both countries.
Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed to enjoy each other’s company. From joking about how little sleep they get as heads of state to hosting a joint radio broadcast, they reveled in the attention of the Indian media circus, providing sound bite after sound bite. Modi referred to Obama as “Barack,” and spoke expressively about how he and Obama shared a personal chemistry. Obama, not to be outdone, greeted his audiences with a “Namaskaar” and found the time to try his hand at a famous Bollywood movie dialogue. As such, both Obama and Modi pulled out all the stops to create an image of intense personal camaraderie.
Grand gestures aside, the visit also included measurable progress. Both nations have similar concerns — from China’s assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region to terrorism in the Middle East and the threat of Climate Change — that were finally addressed as a team.
Several of these issues were addressed through a Joint Statement. In an oblique reference to China, the statement “affirmed the importance of safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over flight throughout the region, especially in the South China Sea.” The United States needs a strong regional partner to contain China to effect its  "rebalance to Asia" policy. For India to stake a credible regional claim of its own, it needs an ally as powerful as the United States.
On the topic of terrorism, Obama and Modi “stressed the need for joint and concerted efforts, including the dismantling of safe havens for terrorist and criminal networks, to disrupt all financial and tactical support for networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis.” India and the United States have both been victims of horrendous attacks from these organizations. Any kind of cooperation — from the sharing of intelligence to co-ordination of troops and equipment — is mutually beneficial.
The most substantial progress, however, was in clean energy. Massive hurdles in a dormant Indo-U.S. civil nuclear deal, signed in 2008, were cleared. An overreaching nuclear accident liability law in India was worked around through the establishment of a multimillion-dollar insurance pool.
A United States requirement that all nuclear exports to India be tracked in real time was waived since it was considered intrusive. This clears the way for Indian and United States companies to work together to set up nuclear power plants throughout India. This is very good news for energy-starved India, large parts of which receive electricity for less than the whole day, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is also very good news for the United States, now well positioned to become the primary supplier of India’s massive energy modernization drive. Finally, reducing India’s dependence on coal-fired plants is great for the environment and thereby beneficial to both countries.
Significant progress was also made in the field of defense exports and imports. The US is the world’s largest exporter of defense equipment, and India is the world’s largest importer of defense equipment, according to the International Business Times. Even so, historically, defense trade between the two countries has been depressingly anemic.
However, this past week agreements have been signed between the United States and India that allow for the coproduction of weapons, as well as the transfer of technology to India that allow weapons designed in the US to be manufactured in India. Besides being another massive boost to trade, the export of manufacturing capability of defense equipment to India is particularly significant as it implies a trust that extends beyond the civilian realm and into the highly sensitive realm of defense.
Obama’s visit to India represents the final realization of a relationship that seems only natural. Both countries have been stable democracies since their inception. Both countries are home to people from a multitude of ethnicities and religions. As such, both countries have a deep respect for secular thought and are home to a wide swathe of often oppositional views. Finally, people in both countries enjoy freedom of speech, and can openly and publicly speak out for or against those in power without fear of retribution. Culturally and ideologically, there could hardly be two closer large countries than India and the United States, and these new, stronger Indo-U.S. ties will prove highly beneficial to both nations.

See the PRO side of this debate here.
I’ve been wary of Narendera Modi ever since he came into office as the prime minister of India, and Obama’s recent visit to India and the blossoming relationship between the two countries just confirmed my uneasiness.
Modi is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party in India. Before running for prime minister, he was the chief minister of a state called Gujarat, which is equivalent to a governor of a state here. While in charge of Gujarat, he made great progress with infrastructure within the state, getting electricity and water to more people than ever before. But when riots broke out between religious Hindu nationalists and Muslims following the destruction of a Muslim tinderbox, Gujarat soon gained international recognition for another reason. After the burning of a train that was filled with Hindu pilgrims, the riots soon turned into an almost all-out massacre of thousands of Muslims.
Modi did not do anything to stop the violence while in power. He ordered officials to take no action against rioters, and was complicit in the dismissal of many police and court cases against Hindu rioters, according to The New York Times. On top of all of this, there are also allegations that Modi was actually actively perpetuating the violence against Muslims. The United States actually imposed travel restrictions on Modi during this time for his role in the riots. Even so, he was eventually re-elected as chief minister on a platform of uniting Hindus, largely around a fear of Muslims.
With the United States’ own shaky history with Islam and the Middle East, this closer relationship between the United States and India is incredibly worrisome. It might be great for both countries individually, but not for the international Muslim community as a whole or other countries, especially Pakistan and China.
India and Pakistan have had a long and violent history, starting and ending with the conflict over the border in the Kashmir region. U.S.–Pakistan relations have been shaky ever since 9/11, and have increasingly worsened after the death of Osama Bin Laden. On one hand, we found him in their country, which brings into question their commitment to eradicating terrorism in the region, but on the other hand we stepped all over Pakistan’s sovereignty as a nation by sending in a SEAL team and killing someone on their soil without even consulting them.
Pakistan’s foreign policy chief Sartaj Aziz warned of “India’s dangerous desire to create a space for war,” while Sherry Rahman, a former Pakistani information minister added, “Relations between India and Pakistan are in tatters,” according to The Wall Street Journal. Ever since Modi came to power, this has definitely been the norm. Peace talks have been called off and Pakistan’s attempts to revive dialogue have been rebuffed, all while Modi continues to accuse Islamabad of not taking enough action against terrorists. Meanwhile, there is growing aggravation that Obama has now visited India twice during his presidency but has not visited Pakistan even once. China, however, has been reaching out to Pakistan more and more.
While Modi and Obama were hugging in New Delhi, Pakistan’s army chief was on an official visit to Beijing. China is also regarding the U.S.–India relationship with vague suspicion, according to The New York Times. During Modi’s talks with Obama, the security quadrilateral he proposed included the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, which was worrying to China.
The South China Sea conflict, and China’s recent inflammatory moves in the region, were other topics of the talks. At Obama’s urging, Modi signed a statement criticizing China for how it handled the situation. There is also the threat that will result from the United States increasing sales of military technology to India. This development comes right after China lost its hold as India’s number one trade partner, a huge blow to China and worrisome for the nation on the security front.
Improving Indo–U.S. relations are great for both nations, and as an Indian-American, I’m happy to see the countries’ relations growing and forming in a new direction, but I’m still very wary of the public and overt way that this is happening, especially because both countries have had many issues regarding Islamaphobia in the very recent past, and both countries are now in the position to be extremely influential on the international stage. I just hope their influence is a good one.

My career found me. Now that I’m working full-time on my startup, it’s amazing to me that I even imagined doing anything else. I studied entrepreneurship and music technology at Carnegie Mellon, and I’m the business development guy at my music tech startup. It’s like I picked this career path when I applied to this school.
Simply put, I love what I do. The existential crises of junior year — when I didn’t know how to make my career revolve around music — have vanished now that I wake up every morning with the intent of changing the way music is made in 2015, our mantra here at the office. 
I truly am blessed to have found my incredible co-founders, all of whom share my passion and drive for helping musicians work together, and that we were able to start a company together.
But I’m one of the lucky ones. Not everyone finds their calling in college. In fact, I think most people don’t. It’s incredibly easy to get funneled into the typical paths for your major, as that’s where a lot of people will guide you, but those avenues don’t necessarily represent the best way to fulfill your passion. If those paths seem unsatisfying, consider entrepreneurship.
While it may seem daunting to forego the security of a traditional career path to push the boundaries of innovation forward, the entry barriers to starting a company have never been lower than they are now. After reading last week’s article  about Teach for America, I felt compelled to write about Venture for America, one organization that’s lowering the barriers to entry for college students seeking to get involved in entrepreneurship.
Like Teach for America, Venture for America Fellows are recent college graduates who do a two-year fellowship at a startup, rather than a school. Venture for America’s mission is to help bring startup culture to cities that are struggling to keep their economies afloat. Venture for America Fellows won’t be going to the Bay Area, but instead will spend their fellowship in cities like Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Las Vegas, or Miami.
Venture for America picked these cities because it turns out entrepreneurship is really good for the economy. 
Every year, existing businesses hemorrhage jobs and opportunity, and it’s up to new businesses to create more jobs than existing business lose. New business activity is the source of the majority of the economic growth in the country, and the prosperity that we all share as Americans was created by generations of enterprising entrepreneurs building off each other’s successes. Venture for America was created to bring the prosperity that comes with entrepreneurship to areas that are underserved by the innovators that they need.
The best part about Venture for America, though, is the work you’ll be doing and the people you’ll be with. I’ve worked at three startups now, and each time I’ve noticed that the people I’m around are some of the most driven, talented, and passionate people I’ve ever met.
Better yet, they’re all committed to changing the world in some way. Relay Network is changing the way that companies communicate with their customers. Clutch is changing the way that companies engage their customers. My latest company, Nebulus, is changing the way people make music.
As a Venture for America Fellow, you’ll be doing irreplaceable, impactful work in an organization that is seeking to shape the world in its image, all while helping revitalize an urban environment that’s desperately in need of your talent. You also get to pick the domain of the startup where you’re placed, so you can make sure you’re working on a company that’s full of people who see the world the way you do.
As you move forward through Carnegie Mellon, seeking fulfillment and career advancement, consider joining Venture for America. Your talents can make a massive difference in your startup, your community and, eventually, change the world for the better.

With all of the hullabaloo surrounding the recent Microsoft news releases, it’s no surprise that the newly announced Microsoft HoloLens has rocketed to the top of headlines this past week. Windows 10 is one thing; a major company stepping into the world of augmented reality (AR) is another.
Other companies are working on virtual reality (VR) — Oculus being the most notable example — but it’s Microsoft that seems to be taking the lead in the realm of AR. The now-discontinued Google Glass was barely a heads-up display (HUD); the HoloLens, Microsoft is promising, will be able to do much more.
Most people are probably familiar with the idea of a virtual reality, but AR is a different can of worms entirely. Instead of transporting you to another world, the HoloLens is intended to bring the digital world to the real one. While Google Glass prevented interaction with the outside world, the HoloLens will be a much more intimate merger of the Windows 10 OS and the world right outside of your computer.
VR currently has great potential for the entertainment industry, but it’s AR that truly has the power to change the world as we know it today. Some of the demos that Microsoft showed off included a 3-D model editor, an army of floating, movable screens, and a playable Minecraft world sitting right on your living room table. These are some of the obvious applications: the crowd pleasers, if you will. But the other possibilities are even more exciting.
Take the guided instructions overlay that Microsoft showed off at the conference. When using that, another person can watch your visual feed and sketch in arrows or notes to help you complete a task. This could be incredibly valuable in the medical field, both as a learning tool and as an instrument to help treat patients in isolated communities. This overlay technology will only become more valuable down the line, especially when integrated with services like Google Maps. You won’t need to glance down at the GPS when your route is drawn in bright red on the pavement.
Due to the ubiquity of social media today, it’s only appropriate that we expand our expectations of the future to encompass them as well. Geocaching, an activity where people go hiking or exploring to find objects hidden by people online or in clubs, has already become a popular hobby in today’s urbanized society. Imagine cybercaching — exploring your neighborhood or home to find a digital object or program waiting somewhere for you to find it.
This idea of “tagging” outdoor areas could extend easily to commercial venues as well. Imagine the Yelp of the future, where you can find virtual reviews and ratings hanging outside of the door of your favorite restaurant, or a Facebook feature that lets you leave comments, pictures, or videos at a given location for anyone to see.
Let’s take a moment to also appreciate the entertainment value of AR. We’ve already seen Microsoft bring Minecraft to the real world, but imagine engaging in virtual Pokemon battles with people or friends on the street. You could design an interactive HUD for use in a tabletop game, create an app that lets users appear to “waterbend,” or even play YuGiOh the way it was always meant to be played — with ridiculous, over-the-top holographic monsters.
Given the success of the Oculus, more than one person has speculated that the way of the future seems to be open sourced. If that’s true, then it may be time to start thinking of new ways that you’d like to interact with the world around you. With a technology with as much potential as the HoloLens, it won’t be long before programming reality becomes the next big thing. When it comes to AR, the entire physical world — and the digital one — is at your fingertips.

In the mid-1960s, researchers discovered and licensed the first vaccine for the measles, an overwhelmingly deadly disease. Now, many consider measles to be a disease of the past.
In some communities, however, measles is still infecting children. In Marin County, CA., 6.45 percent of children in public schools, compared to a 2.5 percent average statewide, have a “personal belief exemption,” according to NPR. Children with a personal belief exemption are not required to get available vaccines for communicable diseases, which in most states include polio, hepatitis B, varicella, measles, and others.
Right now there are 109 confirmed measles cases in the United States, according to Mashable, most of which originated in California’s Disneyland. The crowded amusement park acted as the perfect incubator for measles, and the outbreak even affected six people who were vaccinated.
Most parents’ aversion to vaccination stems from fears that certain ingredients in vaccines are linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among other reputable health institutions, however, has dispelled that notion in more recent studies. In fact, the 1998 Lancet study that originated the myth of a vaccine-autism link was later retracted for unethical and fraudulent scientific practices, according to CNN.
It is dangerous for parents to refuse to vaccinate their children, and the more unvaccinated children there are, the more likely it is that those who are vaccinated will be infected, as they were in Disneyland. In addition, herd immunity is dependent on a critical majority of the population being vaccinated. Anti-vaccination parents are not only putting their own children at risk, but also anyone unable to be vaccinated, including infants under 12 months of age and those with extenuating medical circumstances.
Vaccination-dubious parents should not be the cause of a new pandemic. Measles is entirely preventable. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 95 percent effective, and is directly responsible for the 99 percent reduction in United States measles cases, according to the CDC. Not only is there no connection between the MMR vaccine and autism, but the MMR vaccine is widely considered one of the safest and most effective vaccines currently available.
Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children are contributing to an easily preventable problem, and should consider the dangers of refusing vaccination, for both individual children and the surrounding community.

During Sunday’s Super Bowl, the NFL aired a PSA in partnership with No More, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for issues of domestic violence and sexual assault. Recent major sporting events like the Super Bowl and World Cup have brought protests and campaigns around these subjects. 
While these issues are significant and deserve recognition, there is a danger in vilifying the sport itself instead of the abusers. Football is a violent sport, but there needs to be a distinction between the game and manufactured football culture.
Survivors of sexual assault deserve support, and backing from major organizations like the NFL can go a long way in spreading awareness that assault is an addressable legal issue. However, the NFL and organizations like it contribute to a toxic image of masculinity, in which a man should compete with and dominate those around him. This behavior plays a role in the power and control that can lead to domestic violence and abusive relationships. Men perpetrate domestic violence at much higher rates than women, and unrealistic views of men in society certainly contribute to the ethos of proving one’s strength. Celebrity athletes and raucous fan culture can also perpetuate an unhealthy image of male dominance.
The problem with blaming the sport alone, as some of the protests have, is that it excuses perpetrators and discredits male survivors. Male survivors face additional stigma associated with their masculinity, so blaming a hyper-masculine culture for sexual assault can be harmful for men who have been assaulted by women or by other men.
Blaming a hyper-masculine culture also excuses instances of violence as angry outbursts. Alcohol is commonly associated with instances of domestic violence, and sporting events are often attached to drinking culture. When intoxicated fans become passionate or angry, violence may result. At the game, this leads to stadium fights. At home, family members may be in danger. Anger, however, is not an appropriate excuse for domestic violence. Alcohol is not to blame here — abusers should be held accountable.
The NFL has a unique place in America as an icon of masculinity. Cases of domestic abuse among its players have received recent media attention, including criticism that the League does not go far enough to punish perpetrators. Domestic violence is not solely the result of the sport or the organization behind it, but such a prominent organization should take measures to prevent violence and educate men about harmful relationships. The PSA was an important step toward recognizing the issue (especially during an event when people are watching commercials) but did not address violence prevention or support following an incident of violence.

Earlier this month, Senator Ted Cruz was named chair of the newly renamed Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness. He is expected to be confirmed in the coming days. The subcommittee has several major responsibilities. These include deciding where to allocate money for science and overseeing several government organizations with scientific goals, most notably NASA.
This appointment led to a simultaneous cringe from much of the country, as Cruz is a noted science denier who believes in neither climate change nor government spending in general. However, while his appointment is certainly a mistake, the true disaster of it lies in Cruz’s publicly-stated goals that some consider reasons for cautious optimism.
Loudly, Cruz is in favor of giving NASA the power to explore space and establishing the United States as the world’s foremost space power, according to The Huffington Post. He constantly trumpets the need for more space exploration. He has two major policy goals in this regard. The first is that — due to America’s icy relationship with Russia — he wants to reduce reliance on Russian space stations, an aim that has more to do with politics here on earth than space itself.
Another reason is that Cruz is a senator from Texas and has always been a fighter for his home state’s interest. Texas benefits massively from the aerospace industry, home to many giants who receive large contracts from the government such as the Dallas-based Lockheed Martin Aeronautics unit. Reduced reliance on Russia would help the local industry operate at maximum efficiency since there are fewer outside barriers and international tensions.
The second policy goal is to cultivate private space exploration companies such as SpaceX. Cruz believes that these companies are good for both the efficiency of space exploration and the country’s economy as a whole.
All of this sounds encouraging, but a slightly deeper reading shows that Cruz might have an ulterior motive. Space exploration is largely apolitical, which seems to be why Cruz is so intent on it. His exact words did not mention providing additional resources to NASA in order to achieve his policy objectives; they were about focusing NASA’s goal.
That means something has to be cut out of the picture, and that thing appears to be climate change research, which NASA has been at the forefront of for a decade now.
Space is not Cruz’s only responsibility, but it seems to be his entire focus. Funneling money into a particular area of science not only fails to meet his job description, but given Cruz’s permanent battle to slash funding in all ways possible, indicates that he is actively shirking his responsibilities for political gain.
It’s always good to have a powerful advocate of space exploration fighting for money to explore space, as acquiring any sort of budget is always a battle. However, it is dangerous to confuse being an advocate of space exploration with being an advocate of NASA. Based on Cruz’s voting record and failure to champion the causes he is now in charge of, his appointment casts a gloomy shadow over the immediate future of scientific research, NASA included.
