The Carnegie Mellon’s women’s basketball team had a very atypical start, compared with their previous home games of the season, in their game against the Washington University in St. Louis Bears. The Tartans struggled to find a rhythm offensively, and were baffled defensively by the Bears’ ball circulation. This led to an early lead for the Bears, which they would hold on to for the rest of the game. The pace of the game was alarmingly high, with some great hustle plays from both teams. Washington University played a full-court man-to-man defense while the Tartans stuck to a more conservative zone defense. The Tartan’s lack of depth in their bench became clear as their starters began exhibiting signs of fatigue midway through the game.
Carnegie Mellon’s sophomore center Lisa Murphy started and played the whole game alongside senior guard and captain, Chandler Caufield, who only took to the bench for a minute during the game.
This game was one of the rare occasions when Murphy was overpowered when rebounding, and only managed to grab 7 rebounds during the whole game. The Tartans were struggling to move the ball around in the first half which led to multiple interceptions and forced mid-range shots. However it also opened the floor for some brilliant individual plays by junior guard Lindsay Poss and Caufield, both of whom were unstoppable from behind the arc. Poss shot an amazing 4–5 from three-point land and Caufield was not far behind, shooting 4–6. Towards the end of the half, the Tartans began to fight back with multiple scoring runs each cut short by the Bears’ timeouts, which successfully killed the Tartans’ momentum.
At the start of the second half, the score was 43–24 with Carnegie Mellon trailing. Washington continued their penetrating offense and exploited the Tartans’ 2–3 zone. Their offense was systematic: make continuous circular passes until the Tartans’ zone is scrambling and then get into an open position for a mid range jumper or a drive to the basket. Unfortunately for Carnegie Mellon, the women from Washington could not miss from mid-range as they kept expanding their lead, as shown by the night’s shooting stats. The Tartans shot a brilliant 12–21 from three point land but were restricted to 10–33 on shots inside the arc.
Washington could not match Carnegie Mellon’s three-point barrage, and had a skimpy 7–20 on three-pointers but more than made up for it with an average of 21–40 from the field. The mid-range jumpers were the source of difference between the two teams in this game.
As the second half went on, Carnegie Mellon’s women were giving everything they had to find their offensive stride, but kept falling short with forced shots and incomplete plays.
Disheartening as those misses were, it seemed that the Tartans were beginning to get into a passing groove as they finally seemed to be finding the space that had been eluding them all game long. Recognizing that the zone defense was causing bad double teams and a plethora of open spaces, the Tartans shifted to a more arduous man-to-man. This made a huge difference for the Tartans as it forced fewer double teams and made the Bears work for their baskets. The Bears could no longer find open jumpers by just passing the ball around and had to move without the ball to get into scoring positions. The Tartans persistence was starting to pay off as they improved their conversion rate late in the second half and started rallying behind Poss’ prowess. Kudos to the Tartans for their spirit to fight back and not lose hope (a quality that is much valued and needed at this university). They managed to close the lead to 10 points and ended the game 61–71. Poss ended the game with a team high 18 points with Murphy and Caufield both notching 12 points apiece.
This game may have been a hard loss for the Tartans’ women, but there were bright spots for them that show great improvement: They finished strong (outscoring the Bears 37–28) — something that has been lacking from their previous home games. They were also able to hold confidence in the their shooting and improve it mid-game — something that even professional athletes struggle with. This loss drops the Tartans to 11–8 for the season.
The men’s basketball game started off much slower than the women’s, with both teams struggling to settle offensively, resulting in premature shots and unwise passes. Senior guard and captain Seth Cordts would lead the Tartans from the front by scoring the first basket for the trailing Tartans. This was followed swiftly by a three pointer from behind the arc by junior center Blake Chasen, which gave Carnegie Mellon its first lead of the game. The pace started to pick up around seven minutes into the game as both teams started to spread the floor more effectively, getting into open spaces and finishing with good jump shots. The Tartans squandered their lead only once when the game was tied at 7–7, but never let up after that. The Tartans played a full court man-to-man which they carried through with tremendous vigor and stamina. Midway through the first half, sophomore forward Jack Serbin exploded, knocking down everything from three pointers to baseline jump-shots, even finishing at the basket from time to time. His teammates exhibited a similar range as well, scoring from all parts of the court (something their female counterparts were unable to do). The Tartan’s big men exploited their size advantage and crashed the boards on defense while posting up beautifully on offense.
The Tartans were active on both sides of the floor and played a solid defense, taking away passes and forcing the Bears to work for the basket or give the ball up. Cordts was struggling to find his shot from behind the arc but more than made up for it on defense by staying in front of his man through multiple screens on every play. There has never been a more appropriate use of the word suffocating than in describing the Tartans’ defense.
They pressured their rivals continuously playing a tight defense and taking away every opportunity the Bears tried to create. This helped the Tartans cause multiple turnovers but took away their offensive prowess as they slowed their pace. Cordts may have not had the best night from three point land, but the Bears made up for it by sending him to the line multiple times during the game — and Cordts doesn’t miss from the line. He ended the game shooting 14–14 on free throws with Carnegie Mellon as a whole not far behind with 18–19 — talk about focusing on fundamentals. The half ended with Washington getting the ball to their post players for some tactful lay-ins, shortening the Tartan’s lead to 30–22.
Although the first half ended with Washington threatening to overtake Carnegie Mellon, from the very start of the second half the Tartans dispelled any chances of that happening and were on fire with Serbin making three after three on back to back plays. If that wasn’t enough, Cordts ignited the court and the crowd when he ran from being knocked to the floor to put back one of Serbin’s rare missed threes. The tired Tartans that closed out the first half weren’t the same men in the second half. These men in white were on a mission, and they put their heads down and went to work. Sophomore center Chris Shkil was crucial in helping the Tartans run away with the game by being unstoppable in the paint and coming through at crucial points in the game.
Washington tried to mount a comeback several times during the second half, but that backfired as it sent Cordts to work, scoring and assisting on multiple drives from the field. The Tartans were united in arms, played great team basketball, and expanded their lead to 21 points with 16 minutes left in the game. The Bears’ point guard used his speed and court vision to get Washington a few open shots, but Washington’s conversion rate was falling as Carnegie Mellon’s rose. In the second half, the Tartans shot 14–27 from the field while Washington was held to 12–26. Carnegie Mellon had a few defensive lapses late in the second half that lead to easy buckets for the Bears and gave away two steals that led to Washington fast breaks towards the end of the game. Normally, that would be enough to tip the momentum in favor of Washington, but it was Carnegie Mellon’s consistency and levelheadedness on offense  that made sure that the Bears never saw the light of day. The game ended with the Tartans winning 72–59, and the crowd erupted, applauding the men as though they were heroes returning home from war. And indeed, with the exception of sweat instead of blood, they were heroes and they defended the battlefield of Skibo admirably.
Kudos to the three horsemen — Cordts (22 points, a game high), Serbin (21 points), and Shkil (17 points) — that led the Tartans to their victory. Free throws, three pointers, and post work: These men had it all, and were supported thoroughly by their teammates.
For in the end, it was Carnegie Mellon’s distribution of dependence and unity that won the day.

What would you do if you suddenly were given millions of dollars? This is the fundamental question asked of rookie professional athletes every year. The NFL has some of the strictest requirements when it comes to who is eligible for the draft, mandating that players be at least three years out of high school before entering (after their redshirt sophomore or true junior seasons), but that still means that many NFL rookies are the same age if not younger than many of the students on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. The MLB and NHL allow players fresh out of high school and the NBA requires just one year of college before turning pro, leading to odd situations such as New Orleans Pelicans MVP candidate Anthony Davis being in his third year, dominating the league and on pace to break the record for most efficient season ever based on the Player Efficiency Ranking (PER), being only 21.
I am confident that if I gave many of the undergraduate students here at Carnegie Mellon millions of dollars to go professional in a field they have worked hard to be one of the best at (their major), most of them would instantly go wild and party for a while. They found their reward for years of hard work and finally get to reap the benefits, so why not enjoy it?
This behavior creates the dichotomy faced by many of the young players in professional sports. Society looks to at best, 21- and 22-year-old and, at worst, 17- and 18-year-old role models and shoves them into the public spotlight. Johnny Manziel is the latest example of a star talent who society punished for overly enjoying the fame his talent provided.
Johnny “Football” has always had trouble staying within the law. Back in high school, his parents offered him a brand-new car if he could avoid drugs and alcohol during his junior and senior years as being the starting quarterback. Even with the large added incentive, Manziel fell into the same trap that high schoolers from well-to-do families do, and quickly succumbed to the temptations and peer pressure of rebellion through alcohol. 
His parents took away the car, but it barely seemed to matter.
The same story was present throughout his college career at Texas A&M University, where Manziel’s star kept rising and — much to the chagrin of his parents — his notoriety of a party animal kept rising as well.
Leading up to the draft after his redshirt sophomore year, Manziel faced many questions about his immature habits, but did all the right things to convince teams of his newfound maturity. He managed to convince the Cleveland Browns, at least, who took him with the 22nd overall pick in the first round.
Right after the draft, however, the old Johnny ‘Football” emerged as pictures of him showing up to Vegas nightclubs and incriminating photos implying cocaine usage turned up.
Manziel started the season on the bench and was demolished in his two starts ending the season on injured reserve and the poor note of missing his injury treatment due to oversleeping from his party the night before. Last week, at the age of 22, Manziel checked in to rehab for, at a minimum, alcohol use. For most 22 year olds, the second semester of senior year is the last chance of partying and drinking before accepting responsibility, but here is Manziel in rehab with gallons of ink spilled writing about what a terrible role model he is and his lack of maturity.
I appreciate that professional athletes are blessed with an opportunity that few will ever come close to, and certainly have little room to complain, but at a certain point we need to step back and look at them as real humans. There are minimal expectations of a 22-year-old to be sober on a Friday and Saturday night, much less lead a team of their seniors into battle against the top competition in the world on a weekly basis. The media has been hounding Manziel for years, with the spotlight only intensifying after his Heisman Trophy win after his redshirt freshman year. But Manziel is still fundamentally a college kid, and he deserves a break.
We act as if he is some horribly irresponsible man, even though his largest crime is partying too hard.
Sure he should have probably taken his job more seriously, but most Americans, particularly those most critical of Manziel, do not give 100 percent at their jobs every day. Men reach their physical peak well before their mental one, but society expects its young professional athletes to be at both before they are really at either.
I applaud Manziel for recognizing his flaws and their increased magnitude in the current media spotlight, and taking action for trying to become the person society expects him to be regardless of the stigma associated with rehab. His decision shows true maturity.

Women’s Tennis
This weekend marked the beginning of the spring season for the seventh-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team. On Friday, the Tartans took on Slippery Rock University at their home indoor facility in Monroeville and won 8–1. The next day, Carnegie Mellon faced off against Division I opponent Duquesne University and fell 6–1.
Against Slippery Rock, the Tartans started off strong, taking all three doubles matches with sophomore Vanessa Pavia and first-year Stacy Chang teaming up for an 8–0 sweep in the third seed match. On the singles side, all five Carnegie Mellon wins came in straight sets with first-year Cori Sidell and Chang both winning 6–0, 6-0, meaning Chang did not lose a single game during her entire match.
The following day, the Tartans faced much stiffer competition in Duquesne, and it showed. Pavia and Chang again won their doubles match but required a tiebreaker to do so, leaving the end score at 9–7, and were the only Carnegie Mellon team to win their doubles match. In singles, most Tartans were able to put up a fight with three of the five losses requiring a third set and Sidell defeating her opponent for the lone single win, 6–4, 2–6, 6–3.
The Tartans next face off against St. Francis University on Friday evening.
Men’s Tennis
The ninth-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team started their spring season against Duquesne on Saturday, ultimately failing to their Division I opponent 5–2.
The match started off rough with all three doubles teams failing quickly. Senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar put up the best fight, pulling the score all the way to 8-6 in their defeat. Singles play went better — Two Tartans gained points for Carnegie Mellon, with sophomore Kenny Zheng winning in three sets 6–4, 1–6, 1–0 (10–3) and fellow sophomore Kunal Wadwani putting up a dominant performance 6–1, 6–1.
The men will be the second half of a double header with the women on Friday in their match against St. Francis.
Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams competed at the Bob Shannon Invitational hosted by Denison University on Saturday. Both teams finished second behind Ohio Wesleyan in the ten team meet with the men losing 129–115 while the women lost 193–93.
In the track events, the men started off strong with junior Jeffrey Chen setting a school record with his first place finish in the 60-meter run, finishing with a time of 7.06. Senior Thomas Vandenberg continued his strong season with another win in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:54.03, over 8 seconds faster than second place.
In the distance events, the Tartans kept up the winning ways with sophomore Owen Norley taking first in the mile run, crossing the line in a time of 4:26.16, and fellow sophomore Curtis Watro winning the 3000-meter run in 8:56.55. In the 5000-meter run, sophomore Gordon Pace took second out of team represented individuals with a time of 16:05.70.
On the women’s side, senior Sasha Spalding took home a second place finish in the 400-meter dash as she crossed the line at the 1:00.06 mark. Fellow senior Erin Kiekhaefer set the meet record during her win in the 800-meter run with her time of 2:21.20. In the mile run junior Priya Patel and sophomore Emily Joyce took second and third among affiliated runners with times of 5:51.95 and 5:52.70 respectively.
For the field events sophomore Rebecca Fortner took first in the high jump, clearing the 1.57 meter bar on her second attempt. In the pole vault, sophomore Grace Yee lost the tiebreaker for second place by taking all three attempts to clear the 3.05 meter bar against her opponent’s two attempts.
The Tartans will next compete on Valentine’s Day at the Tiffin Dragon Open at Tiffin University.

University career fairs can sometimes seem like madhouses, with hundreds of employers visiting each day and an even greater number of students passing through. Nevertheless, it’s important to remain collected and professional when presenting yourself to the people who, hopefully, will soon be hiring you for a full-time position or summer internship. Here are five things you should be sure to bring to the Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) to make sure you strike the perfect first impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know what you’re doing is half the battle at a career fair. To make your attire reflect the confidence employers want to see in candidates, stick to a formal dress code. For men, wear a business suit with a solid shirt or one that has a clean pattern. Tuck in your shirt, and wear a belt even if you don’t need one. Don’t forget a tie and a pair of black or brown shoes to finish off your look.
For women, wear a suit or a skirt with a suit jacket. Stick to neutral colors like black or gray, and wear heels to complement the outfit. Both men and women should take the time to iron out wrinkles in your pants and shirt and to brush off any smudges that may be lingering on your jacket. As for hygiene, make sure your hair is cleaned up — cut and combed — and you look as if you got more than your fair share of sleep the night before, even if you haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending the fair, visit the Career and Professional Development Center’s career fair webpages to view the companies coming to campus. Research companies that interest you and make a list of the ones that seem to be good fits. 
For the companies you’re head over heels for, consider spicing up your résumé and making unique copies, rather than a general résumé, to focus on the qualities you know those companies are looking for. 
Hand your general résumé out to the companies you’re less interested in, but would still be happy to work for. By researching companies beforehand, you’re sure to make a better impression with recruiters. Knowing a company’s work and how you can specifically help the company will definitely make you stand out from the rest of the pack.
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résumés, but don’t know what to do with them? Take a trip to the University Bookstore to pick up a portfolio. These firm folders for your papers will round out your professional look.Not only do they look sleek, but they also ensure that you won’t suffer any résumé snafus, like dropping all your papers or accidentally handing a recruiter a unique résumé intended for another company. 
These handy folders allow you to organize your résumés, and a list of references and samples of your work if your field typically requires those elements.
Portfolios are easy to tuck under your arm and walk with, and they also add to your air of professionalism while giving you something to do with your hands.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become packed and hectic. To give yourself some relief in your multiple layers of clothing, bring a water bottle. Take a drink of cool water if you’re feeling hot or overwhelmed. Staying hydrated will ensure that you are focused before you visit the companies that potentially hold your dream jobs. 
Before the fair, also make sure to eat. Sometimes, you may find yourself waiting in unexpectedly long lines, which could cut into time allotted for lunch after the fair. Even if the fair isn’t crowded, it’s always better to be over- rather than underprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at the career fair to land a job or internship. Act that way. Approach all recruiters as if you want nothing more than to work for their company. Greet them enthusiastically and shake their hand firmly.
Show them what qualifies you for a position at their company through an already prepared speech, but be sure to be flexible in what you’ve prepared if the recruiter has other plans for your conversation. Be ready to answer some tough questions, and don’t break a sweat if you’re not able to adequately answer one. Answer it to the best of your ability and get ready for the next question. 
Ask the recruiter some questions yourself to show your interest and ensure that a position at the business is something you truly want to pursue. Thank the recruiter at the end of your conversation and follow up with an email after.

If you walk into the University Center Tuesday and Wednesday while taking the warmer route to class, you may feel out of place amongst an exceptionally well-dressed crowd, the likes of which are rarely seen on campus outside of the Tepper School of Business. It’s that time of year again: various companies are here this week for the Spring Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC), the semester’s largest career fair that will take place in the Wiegand Gymnasium in the Jared L. Cohon University Center from 12–5 p.m.
If you’re a first-year or sophomore, chances are that you’re not going. Perhaps you intended to go, but are now having second thoughts given the number of jobs that go to upperclass students. On the other hand, you may be going, but mainly for the swag — free stuff, for the uninitiated. Here are some better reasons to go to the EOC as an underclassman.
Nothing to lose
Take a moment to sit back and think about your dream job. I bet there will be at least one company at the EOC where you can get that job, or do something related that’s equally exciting. This semester’s EOC is one of the few events at which you’ll have absolutely nothing to lose by talking to recruiters. Your passion may even impress them enough to land you that dream summer job! You’ll never know if you don’t take the plunge.
Prep for future fairs
If you’re firmly convinced that there’s no way that the company of your choice will hire a freshman or sophomore, here’s a more practical reason to go to the EOC. 
Going to the EOC this year is good preparation for your following years at Carnegie Mellon. Attending this semester will allow you to feel what it’s like, so that you know what to expect as an upperclass student.
Simply walk up to the company that you’re eyeing for a job in the future, and chat with the recruiter. Ask about the company’s required qualifications and interview process, so that you know what they’re looking for and can be better prepared for the following year, when you’re in the running for a job.
Small booths are hiring, too
While you’re at it, check out some of the smaller booths that none of the upperclassmen are going to. Chatting with the recruiters there is less stressful — sometimes even fun — and can definitely boost your confidence.
And remember, they’re hiring too. So if they offer any opportunities you’re interested in, go for it! The odds of getting that job are substantially higher and the company probably pays more than traditional summer employers.
So, hunt out your nicest formal clothes and be prepared to join the crowd of well-dressed students at the EOC. Draft a quick résumé — or update an existing one you have — and print out a few dozen copies. Make a name tag, dress nicely, and get ready to go.

As students prepare to flock Wiegand Gymnasium this week and try to earn a place among the employed, the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) has announced changes intended to improve the Employment Opportunities Conference experience (EOC), including an 850-person cap on the number of students who can be in the gym at once.
The 850-person limit for the event, starting this year on Feb. 10 and 11 from noon to 5 p.m., was conceived as a result of conversations with Fire Safety Manager Rick Caruso, according to Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Career and Professional Development Kevin Monahan. Monahan said some members of the campus community, as well as potential employers, raised concerns over the number of people in the gym at once.
“I’ve been here for a year and a half and I’ve seen a handful of career fairs,” Monahan said. “And the staff of the [Jared L. Cohon University Center], myself, students, employers — we all saw that the events were overcrowded.”
Monahan said that, while no official ordered the cap, those involved with conversation about the fair suspected that fewer people should have been in the gym at one time during previous career fairs. After Caruso conferred with the staff of the University Center and members of the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) about the gym’s capacity, he determined the maximum capacity considering such factors as the number of exits and the square footage of the gym. Monahan said that, with an estimate of the employers and booths at the fair, the manager was able to determine the number of students allowed inside the facility at one time.
Speaking of wait times this year compared to previous years, Monahan said, “Usually, everybody goes into the gymnasium and then the wait times are waiting for employers. Since we’re only allowed to have 850 students in the gymnasium at any one time, naturally the lines for each employer are going to be shorter. Also with the concept that employers might be meeting with [a few] students at a time, that should also speed up their lines, and we’ve also asked employers not to do individual product demonstrations.”
Monahan explained that employers, in addition to not doing time-consuming demonstrations, have been asked to field common questions amongst groups of students, rather than individuals, if their lines become long.
“We also realized that this wasn’t a healthy environment to be so crowded,” Monahan said. “It’s not conducive to hold a conversation with a potential employer when you are in a very uncomfortable situation because of crowds and heat and noise.”
Those facilitating the career fair will ask students to move to Rangos 3, where CPDC Career Partners will be located this year, or wait outside the gym to enter once it reaches maximum capacity. The Career Partners will occupy 15 booths on the first day of the career fair and include such companies as Bloomberg LP, Dropbox, and Facebook, among others.
There are 189 occupied booths at this year’s EOC, according to lists of attending companies provided by the Career and Professional Development Center. The number of attending companies is less than the number of occupied booths because some companies attend both days or occupy more than one booth. Monahan said that the CPDC hopes to expand the physical space that the fair occupies in subsequent years to reduce crowding even further.
“We want to get students in there as quickly as possible, and we want them to have a good experience,” Monahan said. 
“But if and when [the gym reaches maximum capacity], we want to make sure that students are aware that this is for their safety and that when they do enter the fair space, it’s a more positive, healthy environment than what they might have experienced at past fairs.”

Mankind has come a long way from communicating through landlines, to using smartphones for communication, information, entertainment — you name it. Now imagine your smartphone, already capable of so much, functioning on a power supply equivalent to that used by a light bulb. Then imagine it performing computations at a rate equivalent to the human brain, with comparable artificial intelligence. This technology is en route to becoming a reality right this minute, in the Litt Lab of University of Pennsylvania.
Duygu Kuzum, a postgraduate in electrical engineering from Stanford University, is conducting groundbreaking research in the field of neuroengineering, using what we know about nanoelectronics to simulate the chemical reactions that go on inside our brains. 
Last Tuesday, Kuzum was invited to Carnegie Mellon to speak about her current research as part of a seminar series hosted by the Biomedical Engineering Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT).
Recognized by the MIT Technology Review as an innovator under 35, Kuzum captivated her audience when she talked about how drastically her research could change the world we live in, in only a matter of years. 
She began by talking about humankind’s fascination with the human brain and by questioning the concepts of perception, curiosity, intelligence, and the brain’s ability to store and process new information. According to her team, the world has got it all wrong. “Instead of trying to understanding the power of the mind, we need to understand how the neurons work,” Kuzum said. Her reasoning is simple: Just as a strong building needs a strong foundation, the secret behind the remarkable operation of the brain lies in the neurons.
Kuzum’s team is currently working on two projects, including synaptic electronics for brain-inspired smart technology, and using the material graphene to build sustainable devices which can better help treat and detect neurological disorders.
Synaptic electronics, according to Kuzum, is one of the most innovative ways of simulating the brain without using as much power as a nuclear power plant. 
Taking her cue from how neurons communicate within the human body (primarily through synapses, which are connections between neurons through which information flows from one neuron to another), Kuzum’s team has manufactured synaptic nanoelectronic devices which are capable of storing, processing, and relating information at the same speed as somatic neurons and at about one millionth of the power produced by a nuclear power plant. However, there is still a long way to go. These nanochips, consisting of nanoelectronics representing close to a million neurons, still need to be trained to create new intelligence, instead of only acting on learned material.
Kuzum’s team is also focusing on using graphene to build and simulate brain tissue, which can help scientists better understand and determine the cause of various neurological disorders and provide a solid foundation for future treatments of those disorders. 
Graphene is a thin layer of pure carbon, the atoms of which are tightly bound together in a honeycomb-like lattice. The material’s structure, according to Kuzum’s work in lab, has properties which enable scientists to observe brain signals and patterns with minimal noise, helping optimize their results. In addition, graphene is extremely flexible and resistant to corrosion, proving useful in the production of surgical electrodes, which can be inserted within the cranium to simulate damaged brain tissue or even to track disorders such as seizures.
The use of nanoelectronics in the production of synaptic electronic devices and the use of graphene to simulate brain tissue can completely revolutionize mankind’s attempt to create artificial intelligence equivalent to — even surpassing — the human brain. So far, the use of graphene has helped scientists observe patterns in neural signaling, but the material’s capabilities combined with nanotechnology gives us hope that very soon we will be able to understand and combat disorders like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s.

A multidisciplinary team comprising researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has developed a microfluidic device to assess cell-level processes influencing the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that results in sickle hemoglobin, which causes red blood cells to mutate from their normal, doughnut shape to a rigid, crescent shape. According to Gregory Kato, MD, director of the Adult Sickle Cell Center of Excellence and Professor of Medicine at the Vascular Medicine Institute at UPMC, “these rigid sickle red blood cells interfere with blood circulation and can cause agonizing pain in these patients.”
For example, these symptoms are common in cases of vaso-occlusive crises in which sickle cells block blood flow to tissues.
In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this past December, titled, “Kinetics of sickle cell biorheology and implications for painful vasoocclusive crisis,” the team discussed their in vitro model, which enables quantitative investigations of the kinetics of cell sickling, unsickling, and cell rheology.
This new microfluidics device “can detect the changes in red blood cell rigidity that occurs as the cells flow into low-oxygen conditions and give up oxygen, which allows us to study the red blood cell under flow conditions with low oxygen more closely than ever before,” said Kato, a member of the multidisciplinary team. “With this new device, we were able to detect exquisitely the anti-sickling effect of Aes-103, a new experimental agent we are testing in clinical trials, currently known under the name Bax-555. This shows that we can use this device to test new experimental anti-sickling agents to look for drugs that can control sickle cell disease at its roots.”
In support of the device improving diagnostics of sickle cell disease, Ming Dao, part of the research team and principle research scientist in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, stated, “Currently there is no reliable method for doctors to predict when vaso-occlusive painful crisis will happen, or how severe it may be. Our new device is capable of mimicking gas exchanges in human body in a controlled manner and quantifying cell sickling and impaired cell deformability due to sickle cell disease. The methods developed and parameters measured in this study offer new ways for improving diagnostics and for efficiently evaluating the effectiveness of anti-sickling drugs, such as FDA approved hydroxyurea or Aes-103 currently in phase II clinical trial.”
The team also presented evidence showing that this model could be used as a diagnostic indicator of disease severity. The team examined sickle hemoglobin (levels ranged from 64 percent to 90.1 percent) from blood samples of 25 patients with sickle cell disease. Using these samples, the team investigated the correlations between cell biophysical alterations during blood flow and hematological parameters, sickle hemoglobin level, and hydroxyurea therapy. Based on their results, the team identified two severe cases of sickle cell disease that were also independently identified as severe using a genotype-based disease severity classification.
University President Subra Suresh was also a key member of the interdisciplinary team. 
Commenting on the importance of this work, Suresh said, “By bringing engineering, biology and medicine together with the design of microfluidic devices with controlled microenvironments, this work provides unique cell-level perspectives of patho-physical processes of sickle cell disease. It could lead to new diagnostic indicators of painful vaso-occlusive crisis and disease severity in sickle cell patients. This work could also facilitate supplemental pathways to improve clinical practices.”
Currently, the team is filing a patent on the work presented in their paper. Research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and Carnegie Mellon University.

SCS4ALL, a Carnegie Mellon University organization dedicated to broadening interest in computing among underrepresented groups, hosted a panel about women in technology last week. The panel and presentation, sponsored by Capital One, were led by Julie Elberfeld, divisional Chief Intelligence Officer for Capital One and board member of the Richmond Technology Foundation board. The panel focused on issues regarding women currently in and entering the technical workforce, as well as the benefits and necessities of a gender-diverse workplace.
Elberfeld began the presentation with a story — a question from her husband: “Does it really matter if there are only, say, 25 percent women in the tech field?” This question prompted her to do some research. She began to search for statistics, studies, and real-world data which would provide some practical answer beyond “the obvious social answer.” What she stumbled upon were several statistics which, though exciting for women in general, were worrisome for the female presence in the technical industry.
Elberfeld cited a recent study performed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon which focused on overall “group intelligence,” a prediction of a given group’s performance in any given situation. This group intelligence, or synergy, is largely correlated to the group’s ability to cooperate as a whole, and the level of cooperation is linked to the number of women present in the group. The study correlates social sensitivity to presence of women. “Women are better able to read between the lines and judge the social dynamics within the group,” said Elberfeld. This sensitivity is conducive to financial success. “Gender-balanced companies perform better financially and demonstrate superior team dynamics and increased productivity,” Elberfeld explained.
The problem facing the technical industry, however, is not a woman’s inability to bolster the effectiveness of a company — a gender-diverse workplace is far more synergetic than the alternative. The problem is that women are not taking up technical vocations at a rate comparable to their male counterparts. “More girls than boys are taking AP tests,” said Elberfeld, “but only 19 percent of the AP Computer Science test-takers are girls. 57 percent of all undergraduate college students are women. 42 percent of undergraduate math and statistics degrees are women, yet only 18 percent of all undergraduate computer and information sciences degrees are earned by women.”
Not only are women not entering the tech field at a comparable rate, but more than half are dropping out mid-career. “Back when I was in school, when we started this industry, most computer programmers were women. Now, 56 percent of women that go into tech are dropping out — just when they’re trained and seasoned, when they’re ready to become future leaders, they’re dropping out.”
This dropout rate can be due to any number of factors, the most obvious one being parenthood. Elberfeld shared her personal experience with the subject. “I’ve had to give up promotions, tell my bosses it just wasn’t the right time.” As a working mother of three kids, Elberfeld advocated for the option to work part-time and from home, and when she did it successfully, she went to the company’s management and advocated for other women in her former position.
“When you’re a coder, you can code from anywhere,” she said. “Being understanding of employees’ needs and accommodating them will make them more loyal and hardworking.” This holds true for the women of Capital One; four out of the five panelists have been in the industry for at least ten years.
In addition to motherhood, the workplace environment and culture might have some bearing on the number of women leaving the tech industry. The discussion which followed Elberfeld’s presentation focused largely on the subject of microaggressions: Small, unconscious biases which come out in our everyday speech and mannerisms.
Each of the five panelists spoke of their own experiences with microaggression. “If there’s a note-taking role, or it’s time to buy presents during the holidays, since I’m the woman on the team, it’s just assumed that these are the kinds of things I’d want to do,” said Belinda Ragonese, a senior director at Capital One.
“Subtle sexism might end up making women feel ostracized over time,” said Elberfeld. “Eye contact can be huge. If we were having a meeting, and the subject shifted to a big technical project we were working on, I could feel the eyes in the room shift to the men.” 
Katie Smith, a new addition to the field of Android mobile development, added that “[People who are being subtly sexist] don’t recognize it. Bring it to their attention — the best thing is just to have a nice conversation.”
Perhaps the biggest piece of advice to emerging women in technology was to pick and choose when to envision oneself as “the woman in the room.” In one sense, being the only women on a team of technicians is a very important role. In other ways, it can be alienating. When there is a job better tackled by the female mind, tackle it. It is important for women to embrace their unique skill sets and bring them full-force to their workplaces. Gender-diversity breeds acceptance and breaks down social barriers, whether they are conscious or not.

At last week’s Pugwash meeting, the group examined the moral and social implications of practicing genetic engineering in humans.
Last week, the United Kingdom approved the first procedure involving the manipulation of human DNA. The procedure allows women with diseases encoded in their mitochondrial DNA to replace that DNA in their child’s embryo with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a third person. The procedure would result in the first children with DNA from more than two parents, and has highlighted a debate on if, and how, genetic modification should be applied to humans.
Certain diseases, such as Huntington’s, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, and cystic fibrosis, are caused by known genetic mutations. Is it morally responsible to allow children to be born with these diseases, when it is possible to detect and repair the genetic mutations that cause them?
If genetically modifying humans is acceptable for preventing diseases, it raises the issue of who decides what is to be considered a disease. If certain genes were correlated with being gay, would it be acceptable to choose whether those genes would be a part of your child? If preventing disease with genetic engineering is acceptable, is enhancing people beyond disease prevention also acceptable, and is there a clean line between the two? It is possible that genes correlated with lower rates of ADHD are also correlated with a higher overall focus. Similarly, genes that reduce the risk of mental retardation may also be correlated with higher levels of intelligence more generally.
Many members of the group expressed concern about the safety of modifying human’s DNA. 
The workings of DNA and gene expression are still not fully understood. Illustrative of this, the entire phenomenon of epigenetics was not discovered until recently. 
Before this point, scientists were unaware of the importance of structural details of DNA strands, besides their nucleotide sequence. Experimenting in new fields is inherently risky, because of the potential for unknowns. Additionally, the potential negative ramifications of genetically engineering humans are huge. Diseases unintentionally caused by genetic engineering would not only hurt the generation who received the intervention, but potentially all of their decedents. It may be worth being cautious when there is the potential of introducing new genetic disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, into our genetic pool.
Being able to choose only genes known to be beneficial may also lead to decreased diversity in human DNA. Less diversity leaves us more open to the risk of widespread disease susceptibility, a potential catastrophe that played out during the great potato famine. With the loss of diversity, we might also lose out on the contributions of outliers in our civilization.
On a social level, human genetic modification also has the potential to relegate non-modified humans to second-class status. 
People without genetic modification might be unable to compete with their modified counterparts and might not be given equal consideration by schools and employers. This future is examined memorably in the 1997 film Gattaca.
However, even if the benefits from the new technology are not equally distributed, the effects of a more capable workforce might benefit everyone. Also, such segregation might be short-lived, as genetic modifications become more affordable.
There is an abundance of issues to consider regarding the potential benefits and dangers of human genetic engineering. As the technology is coming closer to reality, it may be time to start discussing these questions.

Imagine that you are a rock star, performing at what may be one of the biggest gigs of your career. The melodious growl of your electric guitar, paired with booming speakers, allows your music to stay afloat in the sea of screaming voices of your adoring fans. Most likely, it is largely thanks to this instrument that you have managed to reach the height of your career.
Interestingly, the excited reaction of your hypothetical, modern day audience is a huge contrast to the reaction of the skeptical public in the 1930s when the electric guitar first arrived on the music scene. Initially emerging into obscurity, it wasn’t until the 1950s and 1960s that the electric guitar entered the realm of popular American culture.
But how are electric guitars different from acoustic ones? Like acoustic guitars, electric guitars contain six strings that can be altered by tuning pegs. Embedded along the neck of an electric guitar are strips of metal called frets, which allow you to adjust the amplitude of vibration of the strings. It is the composition of the body that distinguishes an electric guitar from an acoustic one; while some share the hollow or semi-hollowness of acoustic guitars, most electric guitars have solid bodies.
Without a resonating cavity, what makes an electric guitar produce its strikingly eccentric sound? In 1924, Lloyd Loar, an engineer at the Gibson Guitar company, invented an electric magnetic pickup. Four years later, the design was later applied to the creation of the first, commercially advertised electric guitar by the Stromberg-Voisinet company.
According to ehow.com, the magnetic pickup electronically detects the vibration of the guitar strings. It consists of a bar magnet wrapped in thousands of turns of wire that are thinner than human hair. This allows it to act as both an electromagnet and a transducer, which is a device that converts physical signals into electrical signals. Surrounding the pickup is a stable electromagnetic field, which can be disrupted by the vibration of a string at a specific frequency. For example, if you pluck a string that vibrates with a frequency of 400 Hz, the pickup will receive a current of the same frequency. The electrical signal is then relayed to an amplifier.
Pickups can come in different forms, and are located at different parts of the guitar body. Some are single long magnets under all of the guitar strings, while others have a single pole-like piece of magnet under each string. A guitarist can create a variety of different sounds using different pickups.
From the pickup coil, electrical signals are sent through a simple circuit, with both wire and electric components. Circuits regulate the amount of flowing electricity through components called resistors. One kind of resistor helps to filter out specific frequencies. Another kind of resistor regulates the amplitude, or volume, of the signal that gets sent to the jack, which is the connection between the guitar and the amplifier.
Generally, the electric guitar itself does not consume any power. Instead, power is directed to an amplifier, which is composed of three basic parts: a preamplifier, a power amplifier, and a speaker.
Preamplifiers are necessary to ensure that the electrical signal is strong enough to be sent to the power amplifiers. The power-amplifiers then boost the signal in order for it to be strong enough to trigger the speaker. Without amplifiers, an electric guitar would only be able to produce weak sounds.
Unlike a stereo amplifier, the amplifier of an electric guitar often distorts signals, creating the signature growling, edgy sound. Distortions occur when the electrical signals are too strong for the circuit. Whether the amplifiers uses vacuum tubes or a transistor will also influence the distorting effect.
Also a transducer, the speaker will convert the electrical signal into an audible sound. Inside a speaker an electromagnet is positioned in front of the permanent magnet. The electromagnet has the ability to move around while the permanent magnet remains in a fixed position. As the electric pulses travel through coils of wire, the electromagnet vibrates back and forth due to rapidly altering directions of the magnetic field. The sound waves coming from these vibrations are further amplified by an attached cone, made of flexible material. In turn, these amplified vibrations create fluctuations in air pressure that pound against our eardrums, which results in the sensation of sound.
With the creation of electric guitars, you can now play the guitar at a significantly higher volume. Combine the guitar with the intriguing effects of amplifiers and speakers, and you are left with a unique instrument that has helped to develop many genres, namely rock ‘n’ roll. Through its ability to pluck at human emotion, the electric guitar has provided limitless variations that have changed the face of American music.

Shots of stem cells restore learning ability in rats
Recently, researchers reported that stem cells may be able to heal long-term brain damage in rats blasted with radiation. While radiation therapy is very effective in lots of areas, such as treating cancer, it has also been proven to generate many side effects such as detriments to one’s learning ability. 
Radiation obliterates the cells of the myelin sheath, which coats the message-carrying part of nerve cells with protective insulation. Without the myelin sheath, nerve cells cannot transmit any information.
Researchers have attempted to solve this problem using human stem cells. They injected the precursor cells into different areas of the brains of 18 rats, which were exposed to radiation prior to the injection. The rats given the new cells in different areas all improved in their ability to learn. But still, the researchers say that they need to repeat the experiment with a larger sample size to draw a final conclusion.

Burials thwart efforts to curb spread of Ebola
Efforts to stamp out the serious situation in West Africa due to the Ebola epidemic are being threatened as local villagers contract the disease by touching the bodies of Ebola victims while burying them, according to U.N. officials. Officials believe this is the most common way Ebola is being spread.
The issue is not one-sided; for local people in nations like Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, those rituals are indispensable for the departed’s spirit, so it is hard to ask them to give up such a practice.The World Health Organization (WHO) reported recently that 124 new cases of Ebola were recorded the week of February 1st, which is a 25 percent increase from the previous week as well as the first time this number has risen in 2015. 
The most effective method, according to a WHO representative, is to isolate individuals as soon as they become sick to avoid spreading the disease. This proves difficult since most burials occur in secret.

E-cigarettes found to lower immunity to flu in mice
A new study in mice finds that electronic cigarette vapors can trigger inflammation in the lung, making animals more susceptible to bacteria or virus-related infections, such as flu. 
Inhaling free radicals, biologically detrimental molecular fragments, may be the reason for the inflammation and protein damage. According to Thomas Sussan, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, each vaping puff contains 700 billion free radicals, leading to a “significant increase in oxidative stress.”
Compared with the mice that were not exposed to the vaping condition, the mice that inhale free radicals from vapor were far less able to resist infection, the researchers found. The researchers conclude that, besides the factor of nicotine in vapor, even nicotine-free vaping may be a source of danger, since the liquid solvent used to deliver nicotine can also be very toxic to lungs’ functioning.

Large gap exists between public and scientists
A pair of surveys by the Pew Research Center and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) released last Thursday showed that the general public and scientists have very different views on science-related issues. 
For example, 87 percent of scientists believe that humans are a main cause of climate change, but only 50 percent of the public agree with this. Also, 88 percent of scientists think that genetically modified foods are safe to eat, but only 37 percent of the public think they are safe. 89 percent of scientists favor animal research, but only 47 percent of the public support it.
Alan Leshner, chief executive of the AAAS, stated that the chasm stems from the fact that the public’s views are being influenced by other factors such as religion, politics, and lack of scientific understanding. He also noted that it is the responsibility of scientists to educate the public about polarized scientific issues.

Endangered Sierra Nevada red fox spotted
The Sierra Nevada red fox, a subspecies of the red fox and one of the most endangered mammals in North America, was recently spotted in Yosemite National Park for the first time in almost 100 years. The animal was seen through cameras set up by wildlife biologists around the park as part of a study funded by the Yosemite Conservancy.
The Sierra Nevada red fox, which is genetically different from other red foxes, once had a natural habitat which ranged from Oregon across California, but now fewer than 50 of the animals are believed to exist in the wild. 
Researchers belive that the population of this particular species was always small. The reason for the dwindling population of Sierra Nevada red foxes is unclear, but scientists speculate that the cause could be loss of prey, genetic inbreeding, and loss of habitiat. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be announcing the fox’s status under the Endangered Species Act this year.

Biological clock predicts life spans
Researchers at the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology have discovered a biological clock that allows them to predict a person’s life span. 
The biological clocks of almost 5,000 people in four independent studies were measured by studying a chemical modification to their DNA. After an initial blood test, the researchers periodically followed up with subjects. 
By tracking the lives of these people for up to 14 years and comparing their biological clock age to their actual age, the researchers found that people whose biological clock indicated an older age than their actual age were more likely to die sooner. They also found that this fact was true even after adjusting the results to account for other conditions such as smoking and diabetes.This study was recently published in the journal Genome Biology.

Lunar Gala — the annual student-run, student-designed, and student-produced fashion show — pumped Wiegand Gymnasium full of fog and thumping beats on Saturday. The theme was Vestige, marked by broken-looking, 8-bit text and trippy, stuttering images on the screens behind the runway. The (admittedly very difficult to read) program was a list of the lines’ titles and designers in Vestige’s signature broken font.
This year’s models were top-notch, reflecting the hours of rehearsal dedicated to Lunar Gala since the beginning of the fall semester. The producers of the show also outdid themselves, with on-point lighting and evocative music.
Many of the lines in Vestige matched Lunar Gala’s traditionally edgy aesthetic, like one that featured industrial metal work inspired by the torture devices in the movie Saw, (“Mashinka” by human computer interaction and architecture double major Madeline Chen and fourth-year architecture major Jean Kim) or another that showed models with geometric, origami-like garments meant to mimic the interiors of geodes (“Lustre,” by third-year architecture majors Rehan Butt, Alyssa Hamilton, and Carolina Tamayo).
Other lines were impressively innovative, like sophomore costume design major Keith Kelly’s “Morph,” a line of three pieces, made of colorful molded plastic. “Menagerie,” by senior design major Jane Yoon, had models wearing black garments accented with gold and crowned by beautiful, animal-inspired headdresses.
Sometimes Vestige got a little too edgy for it’s own good — one line (“Uncover,” by math and art major Laurel Michel-Schottman) was made up of business casual clothing for women with puzzling, transparent cutouts. Another line, “The Wealthy Slums,” by first-year undeclared Dietrich College student Lanre Adetola, took boho-chic perhaps too far with patchwork clothing that, according to the event’s program, was “the artful amassing of discarded clothing and fabric scraps.”
Some designers also trended toward whimsical and colorful, like senior design majors Emmy Hacker and Chanda Patel’s “Cakery,” which was “inspired by the elaborate shapes and decorations of high-end cakes.” Models in the line strutted to the beat of Fifth Harmony’s “Sledgehammer” — in contrast to the EDM and liquid dubstep backing the rest of Vestige — and showed off their glitter-coated lips and jewel-toned outfits. “Mas-querade,” by senior design major Keith Joseph, was inspired by Trinidad’s carnival and had models in summery, brightly patterned dresses and shorts.
Lunar Gala also had interludes by several of the university’s dance troupes, including Soulstylz, Infra, and Bourgeois. The dancers did a good job with the unusual stage of the right-angle runway, and complemented the show’s theme.
This year’s Lunar Gala was, if possible, bigger and more hyped than last year’s show. It continued a long Carnegie Mellon tradition that lets students strut their stuff, literally.

The Andy Warhol Museum opened Time Capsule 524 in Warhol’s 610-part series last Friday. This “Out of the Box” event was led by Warhol Museum chief archivist Matt Wrbican and Time Capsules Cataloguer Erin Byrne in the Warhol museum’s small theater. The real star, however, was special guest Benjamin Liu. Liu worked with Warhol for many years as an assistant, and provided commentary on the various items as they were pulled from the box.
The purpose of the Out of the Box series is not to open individual boxes of the Time Capsules series for the first time. They have already been cataloged and archived, and the documents and photos have been placed in Mylar sleeves inside of acid-free folders. Rather, the series is intended to show the box’s contents to the public, relive portions of Warhol’s life, and reflect on the era. Liu had not seen the contents of the box before the event. He was likable and excited to see the things that “Andy” had left. It was fun to see him refer to his old friend so casually. He reminisced when they pulled out a bag with mementos from a tennis tournament they had attended together, and Liu told funny stories about their group of friends throughout the evening, including one story about flying across the country on a converted toilet seat in a Lear jet.
Time Capsule 524 documents September to November 1984. Much of the contents were clothing, including special prints on t-shirts from Warhol’s contemporaries and members of his cohort. There were also letters and photos from friends and celebrities. Liu name-dropped so often that I lost count, and I only recognized one in every ten names or so. I did recognize Yoko Ono and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, both of whom had contributed items to this box, which is also one of the few with Warhol’s own writing on it.
While the subject matter was interesting, I found myself wishing the presentation had been more refined. The contents were gently unpacked by Byrne and handed to Liu, but the items were difficult to see from the audience, and Liu and Wrbican sometimes struggled to place them on the document camera. At times, Wrbican talked over Liu, and they often seemed to be competing in a weird way: Liu often responding from an anecdotal perspective, and Wrbican from a scholarly one. Still, Liu was entertaining and kept the mood light, and I appreciated what he had to say. Liu’s presence made the idea of Warhol’s life more believable, as much of the pop artist’s stories and experiences are extravagant and over-the-top. It was reassuring to have them confirmed by the anecdotes of a flesh-and-blood person.
The Andy Warhol museum was open late, and the Time Capsule presentation’s audience was then able to venture through the many floors of Warhol’s own work, photographs, and information from the rest of his life. This was helpful for putting the items from the box in the context of Warhol’s own work, relationships, and lifestyle. It was also helpful because names that had been mentioned so frequently in the presentation seemed to be recurring in the Warhol narrative, and some were even members of his inner circle. For those who haven’t taken the trip to Warhol’s museum, I highly recommend it. Beside his artwork, the photographs of Warhol in studio at Carnegie Tech and hanging out in Schenley with his friends are eerie and completely cool.
Part of the charm of the time capsules is that Warhol compiled them without including much of his own work; they’re a collection of items he liked and thought were important. For instance, an album signed by the likes of Roseanne Cash and Elvis Costello was placed in the time capsule, as was a signed napkin from one of his favorite restaurants and a slew of Julio Iglesias Long Play records. In Warhol’s legacy, so much emphasis is placed on his own work that it was exciting to see his inspiration instead.

This year’s Academy Award list of Best Actress nominees reads like a well worn catalogue of Hollywood’s most established talents. Nearly every leading lady in the running has been nominated for an Oscar before, and some have won as well. There is one exception to this trend though — Rosamund Pike. Pike was nominated for her stunning portrayal of Amy Elliot Dunne in Davd Fincher’s Gone Girl. Amy is a demanding character to play — serene, collected, and charming on the surface, but a narcissistic sociopath on the inside. Rosamund Pike is a stranger not just to the Academy Awards, but some would argue to Hollywood itself. As the emotional core of an all-lights-flashing Hollywood juggernaut, she takes on a role that one would typically expect to go to an Angelina Jolie, or an Emily Blunt, or Pike’s co-nominee Reese Witherspoon. This makes it all the more remarkable, or perhaps explains why she plays Amy with the unique blend of subtlety and hysteria that she does.
Pike has had something of an on-off relationship with Hollywood for the past two decades. A natural actor right from the start, and incredibly bright to boot, she started her undergraduate education in English at Oxford, only to drop out halfway through and try for drama school. She returned to Oxford eventually, chastised by the entire experience, since no drama school wanted her.
Her next big brush with Hollywood was a few years later, when, out of nowhere, she was cast as Bond Girl Miranda Frost in 2002’s Die Another Day. An innocent newcomer to the industry, she was cast opposite Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry in a commercial film. This must have had a massive psychological impact on her highly impressionable recent-college-graduate self at the time.
One would assume she’d use a massive Bond movie as a launchpad into Hollywood central. Instead she did quite the opposite: She disappeared for nearly two years. Even when she returned in 2004, it was for a small independent Israeli film called Promised Land. And thus Pike proceeded for nearly the next decade, taking on a small indie film every once in a while, doing a documentary or two every now and then, and very occasionally taking on supporting roles in mainstream cinema such as 2005’s Pride & Prejudice, or 2012’s Jack Reacher. And even though she never entered the big leagues of Hollywood, she was always reputed as a brilliant actor, if not a star. For example, she received rave reviews for her performance as the stunning, if adorably silly, Helen in 2009’s An Education.
All of this changed, however, when David Fincher cast her in Gone Girl last year. Here she was, being asked by one of the greatest directors of the past decade to carry the emotional weight of one of his most challenging projects to date. To hear her say it, she was more surprised than anyone else at being cast. In an interview with The Guardian, she openly ponders why she deserved the role of “Amazing Amy” over the queue of higher profile actresses who would have traded a limb to be in her place.
Looking at her filmography, one can see her pulling off “cool and collected” Amy without breaking a sweat. Her natural porcelain features, not to mention her voice, can easily charm an audience, or her movie husband Nick (Ben Affleck), into a peaceful trance. Where you really come to respect Rosamund Pike for her craft is further on in the movie, when circumstances force Amy into desperation, and into getting her hands dirty in ways she wasn’t planning on. Uptight, charming Amy is a direct reflection of Pike’s own aloofness. When the charm recedes and is replaced by sociopathic narcissism, Pike really shines as she discovers a darker side of herself that I’d be inclined to believe she didn’t previously know about either.
Gone Girl is undoubtedly one of the coolest, most devastating movies of the year. And if box office registers are to be believed, it is also one of the most successful, having made $368 million worldwide. Suddenly, a generation that had no idea who Rosamund Pike was is now eagerly watching her every move. After nearly two decades in the industry, Rosamund Pike has finally arrived.

Before I left the U.S. for Italy I devoured every piece of advice about studying abroad. I had a plan for money — backup debit cards — and of course travel-sized bath items, so I was ready. But as my departure date got closer and closer I began to panic. What in the world was I doing? I don’t speak Italian! How am I supposed to get by, live, and thrive in Rome? It felt like freshman year all over again.
The most useful piece of advice I received was this: Expect everything to be completely different, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the similarities.
And that is exactly what I did. I got off the plane expecting to have landed in a place that was going to be completely unfamiliar — and it is, to an extent. I am excited every morning to be able to live and learn here in Rome, the birthplace of modern civilization, but the moments that have stood out to me so far are those that combine the unknown and the foreign with the familiar.
The Burger King just down the street from school is always packed at lunchtime with hordes of Italian high school students. Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” is strangely popular, and seems to be playing in every shop I walk into.
And then there’s maybe my favorite thing to relay back to the states: The street peddlers shoving “selfie sticks” in my face whenever I get within fifty feet of a tourist attraction.
This feeling of familiarity, of home, in a place so foreign can be hard to describe. You almost don’t realize it’s there until you run back into something quintessentially Roman, like the musicality of the Italian language surrounding you on the street, street markets selling everything from undergarments to vegetables, or the Colosseum appearing in front of you.
It’s been a month since I started this experience and already I still feel like I’m walking the line between tourist and resident. I want to take in every inch of the city, to get lost in its side streets, drink in its history, but I also want to live here — be a resident — and begin the process of becoming Roman, no matter how short my time as one may be.
These two wishes conflict with each other. In order to be truly Roman, you can’t marvel at the city on your walk to school. To them, this city is home, is normal. They see no discrepancy in the combination of modern and ancient because to them the ancient is the modern. It is the backdrop of the bus ride to work, the everyday views on the way to the store.
And so I have found myself playing two parts. During the week I am the student, the everyday person living life in Rome. I take the metro; I take my cappuccino standing up at the counter; I grab un panino for lunch and eat dinner at 9 p.m.
On the weekends, though, I am the tourist. I walk the streets, only vaguely taking note of how to get back; I wear the headsets provided by tourist attractions; I acknowledge my surroundings as the marvels they are.
Little by little, in these four weeks, I have started to pick up the language of the everyday, enough to at least make an effort when buying groceries or paying for a meal. I have started to look past the big attractions that draw most people to the city and begun to see the smaller details that make it truly remarkable.
I think what I have realized most strongly since being in Rome is that in order to gain the most authentic experience, you have to play the part of visitor for a least a little while. The Romans don’t walk past ancient wonders because they don’t find them interesting. They walk past them because they have the appreciation instilled in them, after a lifetime of walking past them.
Once you can be instilled with a fraction of that appreciation, you can be free to find your own rhythm in the life of the city.

As if I had to restate the obvious, it is winter and it is miserable — especially around Valentine’s Day. I love to fight off the cold first with a warm bubble bath and then with something rich, hot, smooth, and mouthwatering: chocolate lava cakes. Nothing could be more satisfying than cutting open the mini cake with the side of a fork, then watching the molten middle spill out on to your plate. With every mouthful, you can feel your body getting warmer, starting in your stomach and radiating out to your fingers and toes. It’s delicious, it’s warm, and it’s perfect for this time of year.
Whether you’re making dinner for your sweetheart or celebrating Galentine’s Day (or the male equivalent) with your single friends, these fantastic little chocolate volcanoes are sure to impress, and with minimal effort! The process of making these is so simple you’ll be surprised by how quickly they’re done. 
Chocolate Lava Cakes
6 ounces of semi-sweet baking chocolate, chopped
1 stick plus 2 additional tablespoons of unsalted butter, cubed
3 whole eggs
3 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, plus some extra for dusting
1/2 cup of flour
Cocoa powder for dusting
Real-life people with real-life kitchen equipment would make these cakes in these fancy things called ramekins, but since this is college and the standard is slightly lower, as long as you have a cupcake tin you’ll be just fine! This recipe makes about 9 cakes in the cupcake tin, depending on how you distribute the batter (or 6 cakes in 6 oz ramekins for real people). These are meant to be free-standing, so instead of cupcake liners, butter the walls of each cupcake well and sprinkle some cocoa powder around so the cake doesn’t stick. Also, don’t forget to preheat the oven to 450 degrees!
Place all the chocolate and butter in a pot over fairly low heat. Stir it until it all melts and turns into this velvety, shiny chocolate sauce. Then pull it off the heat and let it cool for a little bit. Meanwhile, whisk together all of the eggs and powdered sugar. If you have access to a strainer, it would be a really great idea to push the powdered sugar through it. Powdered sugar tends to be a little lumpy, especially when it’s stored in more humid environments, and if you put it in the eggs without straining it, the lumps may never go away! After the sugar and eggs are incorporated, pour in the chocolate mixture and flour all at once. Stir this all up, and that’s the batter! 
Divide it equally between the 9-ish greased up cupcake wells and bake them for 12 minutes. After they come out, let them sit for around 3 minutes, then take them out of the tins. If they’re a little bit stuck to the pan, run a knife along the sides to loosen them up and flip them out. These taste the best when you serve them fresh out of the oven, but it’s not the end of the world if they hang out over night. Just pop them in the microwave for about 30 seconds right before it’s time to serve. Garnish them with a sprinkle of powdered sugar, or even some caramel sauce or ice cream if you’re feeling adventurous! Finally, sit down, take a bite, and drift off into warm, chocolatey bliss.

Dear reader: I hate musicals. Their corniness, cheesiness, and general pep usually makes me want to run screaming from the theater. But the production of My Fair Lady currently showing in the O’Reilly Theatre, for all its froofy looking posters, is actually kick-ass. Do you like witty jokes? Do you like cleverly cloaked social commentary? Do you like stupidly catchy songs? If you said yes, no, or maybe to any of these questions then you should go buy your ticket right now. I’ll wait. Go. Right now.
Done? Good. If you had waited till the end of the article you may have missed it. Now that all that is taken care of we can get down to business. Anyway, you’re probably curious what you just signed up for.
As the curtain rises we meet Eliza Doolittle (Kimberly Doreen), a homeless flower seller outside Covent Gardens in London. As she peddles her sad flowers to the exiting opera attendees, we meet Colonel Pickering (John Little) and a curious man who seems to be an undercover cop watching the homeless. In fact this is Professor Henry Higgins, played by Benjamin Howes, who is analyzing the speech patterns of the London homeless. Colonel Pickering, also a professor of phonetics, enters into a bet with Higgins on whether the cocky Higgins can turn Eliza from a street rat to a duchess (and trick all the British aristocrats in the process). The rest of the musical consists of the hilarious failures and successes of their ambitious plan.
The set is fantastic, especially given the interesting arrangement of the O’Reilly Theatre. Because the theater lacked a curtain, all scene changes had to happen within the view of the audience. But in aristocratic England, what could be more fitting than butlers changing chairs as the characters move from Covent Gardens to Higgins’ home to Ascot and beyond? The two story wall of library books, which makes the backdrop, highlights the lightly intellectual nature of the show. The staging of the first scenes outside Covent Gardens seems a bit contrived, but as the musical progresses the actors develop an excellent rhythm and their movements become natural once they leave the first scene.
Little and Howes both shine as the colonel and the professor, respectively. Doreen, as Eliza, knocks it out of the park. She glides seamlessly between the many accents Eliza takes on throughout and continues these into the musical numbers. Speaking of the musical numbers, Doreen has one of those knock ‘em dead voices that shines in the role and makes “I Could Have Danced All Night” a smash hit. But Eliza’s ne’er-do-well father, played by Bill Nolte, almost steals the show. Nolte’s brilliant comedic timing and rich, deep vocals make the show go from really, really good to really, really, REALLY good. Like, really.
The rest of the ensemble is also smashing. Powerful vocals and subtle hilarity in their actions make you smile throughout, like the staging of “Ascot Gavotte,” which highlights the insanity of the British aristocrats. Part of what makes the performance so wonderful is that no one is safe, be it street rat or duchess, as the play makes a bit of a fool of everyone. In the process of providing the audience with aural and visual entertainment, as well as frequent comedy, the production brings up a brilliant social commentary just as accurate today as it would have been 60 years ago when it first hit the stage.
If you leave the show without a smile on your face I would consult a physician — your funny bone might be broken. Aren’t you glad you got your tickets already? You’re welcome.
My Fair Lady is in the O’Reilly Theatre until February 22nd.

If you’re searching for a warm, exotic haven from Pittsburgh winter, look no further: This past weekend, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens said goodbye to its exhibit featuring Indian flora, and welcomed in its place the tropical forests of the Congo. Though the plants were truly phenomenal, they are not the number one highlight. The true star of the show is really the ingenious display of humans’ interactions with nature in the Congo. The signs explaining the surroundings that line the pathways through the exhibit highlight all the ways that the plants of the Congo are necessary for the survival of the indigenous people. They emphasize that to these tribes; trees, bushes, and flowers are not just decoration; they are food, shelter, medicine, and tools. Educational stations along the way offer hands-on demonstrations showing how useful these plants can be. A market full of coffee, peanuts, plums, and other goods explains how their diets are almost entirely dependent on what grows around them. Further down the path, visitors find an interactive exhibit showcasing two examples of typical shelters built from plants by the indigenous people. There, a volunteer points to a vine looped around the plant canopy. She explains that the people of the Baka tribe crush up the vine so that when they dip it in the water, it releases a chemical then prevents fish from absorbing any oxygen. They float to the top and dinner is served.
The volunteer also explained that the entire exhibit — the product of years of research — came together in just a week. This room in Phipps Conservatory rotates exhibits only once every four years so that the rest of the time can be spent preparing for the next one. Years of studying both people and plants led up to a trip to Cameroon where Curator of Horticulture Ben Dunigan and Exhibit Coordinator Jordyn Melino spent time learning about the area. It was important for the accuracy of the exhibit that both Dunigan and Melino developed an intimate understanding of the region’s plant life and people. They then amassed seeds and plants from nurseries all over the country, and even some from Nigeria, to complete the collection of plants to display. Finally, teams spent the past week bringing it all together.
Phipps celebrated the opening with an array of activities and shows that accommodated visitors of all ages and interests. There were children in strollers, older people using walkers, and every age group in between. Every hour brought new fun including a drum show, a discussion on herbal medicine, and dance performances. Some attractions were available all throughout the day. There were masks to decorate, plants to pot, and food to sample, including some citrus water, coffee, bites of pineapple, and — the star — an authentic African Jambalaya. But you don’t need all the activities to appreciate the beauty of the exhibit. The next time you’re desperate to escape the tundra that is Pittsburgh in the winter, take a trip to Phipps — admission is free for Carnegie Mellon students — and treat yourself to an afternoon in the Congo.

Dear Evan,
I’ve never been bothered by cold. I’m from northern Vermont, and we’re much more worried about heroin addiction than blizzards. But I’ve never experienced such a dry climate as I have my first winter in Pittsburgh.
I’ve gone through entire bottles of moisturizer in days, my face has shriveled up beyond recognition, and I bought a different-colored neti pot for every day of the week. Even when I use toilet paper to wipe my makeup off my face every night, my skin is still as dry as… well, no, that’s a disgusting analogy.
Do you have any secrets on how to survive these terrible times?
Shriveledly, 
Lotion Is Keeping Everything Almost Reasonable, Although Inclement Situation Is Not Ideal, Need Therapeutic Help for Epidermis Soon, Until Nonessential
Dear LIKE A RAISIN IN THE SUN,
Well, you’ve at least got your nose and sinuses covered — most singers I know swear by the neti pot as devoutly as my friends freshman year swore by eating at least three bagels on a hangover morning, except neti pots actually work. I personally dip two fingers in my water bottle and stick them up my nostrils every five minutes, but if you’re a nut about keeping sanitary, then I guess that’s not a proper way to deal with a dry nose. So, good on you.
The bad news is that there’s no easy solution here. You could lug a bucket of water around with you everywhere you go, and splash yourself periodically, but then everyone would want some, and the rest would evaporate before you knew it. You could spend every spare moment of your day in the University Center’s pool or sauna, but community pools personally turn me off — imagine how much pee is in there! — and when you eventually have to leave, you’ll be back to epidermal hell, this time with shriveled fingertips.
You could also hibernate through the winter. I personally view this as the best option: You get to sleep through the most fretful months of the school year, and I’m pretty sure it’s a viable excuse for missing class — unless those large, hairy, shambling creatures you see around campus aren’t actually bears.
Or move to Florida,
Evan Kahn

Ever since January, when all ten seasons of the classic ’90s sitcom were posted on Netflix, a lot of people have been rediscovering Friends. I’m currently halfway through the second season, so I’ll include myself in that group.
As opposed to many now watching the show for the first time, Friends has long held a special place in my heart. I often cite it as the first television show I ever experienced featuring real, adult people with real, adult issues. I can’t exactly pinpoint when I started watching it with my mom on Thursday nights, since the first episode aired in 1994, a year before I was born. But I do recall the airing of the finale ten years later, when I was about nine years old. My mom and I were two of 54.2 million American viewers of the single most popular television episode of the decade. Mom cried, and — even though I didn’t entirely understand what was going on — I remember that bittersweet sense of the end of an era.
Now, the era is experiencing a revival. College students everywhere are intimately acquainted with the joys of binge watching, and have capitalized on this opportunity Netflix has provided to either return to an old love or figure out what the big deal with Friends was to begin with. With so many new initiates, the obvious question is this: How does Friends hold up, more than 20 years since its inception?
From my angle, it holds up pretty well. I was initially reluctant to click “play” on the pilot, as we all know the pain of a childhood favorite destroyed upon re-watching. To my pleasant surprise, Friends is still funny. When Chandler fails spectacularly with women or when Phoebe demonstrates her unique lyrical talents, I find myself laughing along with the laugh track rather than scoffing at it. I also still care about the characters — that core group of codependent 20-somethings navigating careers, family issues, and complicated love lives. The premise sounds cliché in retrospect, but Friends was the first sitcom to pull off the formula well. Even decades later, Friends remains a funny show with a lot of heart.
There are certain things that date Friends, expectedly. From brick-like cell phones to the museum-grade laptop that Chandler flaunts, I’m reminded how far technology has come in the years since the show aired. The fashion is almost as much a blast from the past; I’m afraid my mother sported “The Rachel” hairdo through the first half decade of the new millennia. This kind of anachronism is a hard thing for any show to avoid, since the more “modern” it attempts to be, the faster society will leave it behind.
A less forgivable hallmark of time gone by is Friends’ occasionally shocking moments of misogyny and homophobia, as many news sources have already observed. Though the show was progressive for the ’90s, it can be hard to stomach Chandler’s desperate attempts to manipulate women, Ross’s continuous devaluing of his ex-wife’s lesbian relationship, or the running joke of Monica’s former “fatness.” While Joey and Chandler are equally women crazy, Joey maintains a kind of sweetness while Chandler’s bitterness often comes across more creepy than comical. Also, in what I would not cite as its most valuable cultural contribution, Friends is credited with popularizing the term “friendzone” in its first season.
Ultimately, Friends is almost as much worth the watch as it was twenty years ago. Though some aspects are cringe worthy in retrospect, I’m glad to have revitalized my old friendship with a show that genuinely is timeless.

ABC’s new comedy series Fresh Off the Boat, an adaptation of the book that chef Eddie Huang wrote about his own experiences, premiered last Thursday. The star of the show is 11-year-old, rap-obsessed Eddie who faces difficulties assimilating into a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood after his family moves from Washington, D.C.’s Chinatown to Orlando, Florida. The show allows viewers to reminisce on their younger days (the show takes place in 1995 — that’s 20 years ago!) and highlights the struggles that many immigrants face when coming into American society. Every immigrant faces the dilemma of retaining one’s culture, yet assimilating with the people around them, and this show really accents that dilemma through the tween experiences of the main character, Eddie. 
The parents in the show provide much of the comic relief, with the father portraying an extreme optimist in pursuit of the American dream and the mom’s caring yet assertive attitude that emulates the average overbearing Asian mother.
The show addresses Asian-American struggles in a lighthearted manner, to raise the awareness of the difficulties and perseverance with no intention to offend viewers. What impresses me the most is that this show manages to share these experiences with the general public and add some racial humor into the mix. One of the highlights of the pilot episode was when Eddie gets into a fight with an African-American boy who has a 40-year-old best friend. The boy calls Eddie a racial slur in the middle of the cafeteria and Eddie decides to start a fight. The next scene shows Eddie sitting outside of the principal’s office with both of his parents discussing the situation with his principal. Eddie braces himself to hear his parents agree with the administration’s decision on his behavior, but they surprise him by standing up for their son. Yes, Eddie started the fight but didn’t the African-American boy first call him a slur? Why was Eddie the only kid sitting outside the principal’s office and not the both of them? In this episode, we learned that family always has your back and that you should always stand up for yourself. Fresh Off the Boat will be on ABC every Tuesday night at 8 p.m.; tune in to witness the fun!

Need a late night ride? Soon when you take an Uber, your ride may be fitted with technology created by members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
The university announced a partnership on Feb. 2 with ride-sharing service Uber Technologies, Inc. to found the Uber Advanced Technologies Center. Members of the center, which will be located near campus, will aim to develop safe and reliable transportation technologies.
“The robotics technology over the past decade has really matured to a level where it’s ready for transfer to industry,” said Martial Hebert, director of Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. “Uber is ready to do big things with robotics technology and the Robotics Institute.”
Uber, a ride-sharing service which now operates in over 270 cities, allows users to request a ride from a participating driver through an app, which also handles the rate charged and payment.
Hebert framed the creation of the center as part of a bigger picture, saying, “beyond this specific partnership, I would expect to see a lot more development of robotics industry in Pittsburgh.”
“This is part of a larger trend, and the Robotics Institute is at the center of that trend,” he continued.
As part of the creation of the center, a number of members from the Robotics Institute’s National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) will be leaving NREC for the new center, according to an email sent to members of the School of Computer Science by the school’s dean, Andrew Moore. 
Moore did not note the number of members moving in the email, but stated that more detail will be provided “when we’re together for the Founder’s Day SCS events in March.”
Molly Spaeth, a spokesperson for Uber, said via email that those at the company are “excited to join the community of Pittsburgh and partner with the experts at Carnegie Mellon University, whose breadth and depth of technical expertise, particularly in robotics, are unmatched.”
Spaeth also noted that, as part of the agreement, Uber will provide funding for faculty chairs and graduate students.
While a number of media sources report that researchers at the Uber Advanced Technologies Center will focus specifically on self-driving cars, both Hebert and Byron Spice, director of media relations for the School of Computer Science, said no specific research plans or goals have been discussed between Uber and the Robotics Institute.
“A lot of that is part of the company plans, and we’re not necessarily privy to the detail of the projects,” Hebert said.
“What you see a lot in the external media is reporters taking two and two and coming up with a four or a five,” Spice added. “Uber has made certain statements about their interests, and then there have been speculations on top of that.”
According to a post on Uber’s blog, the partnership will allow Uber leadership to work with members of Carnegie Mellon “to do research and development, primarily in the areas of mapping and vehicle safety and autonomy technology.”
Hebert also says that while the center will be located in Pittsburgh, there are no concrete plans for its location, nor a timeline for its official opening. “Many of the particular details have to be worked out still,” he said.
Uber will be holding an event in Pittsburgh to celebrate this partnership in the coming weeks, according to Spaeth. 
The company currently holds an experimental license to operate in Pittsburgh, one it obtained after a series of legal hearings involving the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC). 
Concerns regarding insurance and to what extent ridesharing services function as taxis were cited by the PUC when they filed a cease-and-desist order against the company last year. 
The experimental license is set to expire after two years.
Hebert summarized the partnership by saying, “From my perspective, the important thing ... is that this company has demonstrated to the world just how important robotics skills are.”

Halfway through any politician’s term, they can expect to be evaluated by their constituents and the media to gauge how effective their efforts have been and how much of their platforms they have achieved. And the university’s student body president and vice president are no different.
As election season looms on campus, it’s time for senior electrical and computer engineering and business administration  double major and Student Body President Ian Glasner, as well as his cabinet, to reflect on what they’ve accomplished and the work ahead, both for them and the executive body that will follow.
Last March, during the debates, Glasner and his running mate, senior biological sciences major and first year accelerated master’s candidate Shalini Ray, ran on a platform that focused on the student experience and how students could have a greater hand at influencing campus affairs.
Part of his ongoing effort to gauge student interest is a website that allows students to both submit new ideas for initiatives and to vote on five rotating initiatives. “Looking at the student body and its preferences last year, I found it hard to gauge what students were interested in and what they wanted. I wanted a tool to help create a better understanding of how student government could more appropriately address students’ needs,” Glasner said. According to Glasner, the soft launch at the end of last semester yielded approximately 400 student votes. 
“We used the last launch to gauge how well it would work for the student body and plan to advertise it further this semester,” he said.
On Thursday, Glasner reached out to the campus community via email to officially launch the website, asking that students “take 30 seconds” to login and indicate which ideas they supported, which include dormitory alcohol policy, shuttle and escort services, the university’s moratorium policy, cross registration programs, and a healthy campus no-smoking initiative. Glasner and his administration will use the votes to help indicate which areas of their platform they need to focus on in their term’s second half.
According to Glasner, he’s focused on the policy behind the practice — or why the university is run the way that it is — and how that can be made more efficient and consistent across campus. One of the most important issues, both to him and to his constituents, is the revision of the dormitory alcohol policy that governs campus. The initiative currently has the highest number of votes on the website, at 374 at the time of publication, compared to the second highest number of votes at 368 for expanded shuttle services to local neighborhoods during non-peak hours.
“Last year, when I took office, [we] found discrepancies in how each dorm executes the policies set forth by the administration, and are now working with the administration and student life to put everyone back on the same page. Everyone is governed by the same policies and therefore should be implementing the same practices,” Glasner said. Glasner’s administration has also been focused on the housing and dining prices and policies.
“I’m very excited about the improvements that housing and dining have made to their facilities, but prices need to be lowered,” Glasner said. Through student advisory counsels and lots of conversations with administration, Glasner feels that the dining services on campus have seen a vast improvement during his tenure in office, citing longer hours, healthier options, and a more open channel of communication with Pascal Petter, the new director of dining services.
Glasner hopes that the website will remind students that student government is working for them, and that the future student body presidents will continue to use the site.
“This website will increase awareness of what student government is doing for you. I would hope that this will change people’s attitudes toward student government. In the past, student government has targeted issues that students don’t necessarily care about, so I felt that we needed a way to concretely establish students’ needs,” Glasner said.
The new student government website can be accessed here.

What will Carnegie Mellon be like 20 or 30 years from now? A matter of increasing interest and significance in light of today’s rapidly evolving world, this question was raised by one of the university community’s newest members as food for thought during a recent strategic planning town hall meeting.
Dr. K. Jimmy Hsia, the new vice provost for international programs and strategy as of Jan. 1, is a man with a vision to increase the university’s global footprint. Though he’s only been on campus for a short period of time, Dr. Hsia, who is also a professor of biomedical and mechanical engineering in the College of Engineering, seems to be having no trouble integrating himself into the Carnegie Mellon community.
Hsia received his Bachelor of Science from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China and his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He is a fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and was the W. Grafton and Lillian B. Wilkins Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
During his time at UIUC, Dr. Hsia worked to develop worldwide opportunities in research and education for faculty and students in a number of countries in the Asian continent. He has served as chair of the UIUC-Zhejiang University Joint Institute Working Group. In addition to playing a role in nurturing global partnerships, he also aided students and faculty members in establishing dynamic relationships with other educational institutions and corporations across China.
Additionally, Dr. Hsia served as founding director of the Nano and Bio Mechanics Program at the National Science Foundation from 2005–07, associate dean of the Graduate College at UIUC from 2009–10, and associate vice chancellor for research for new initiatives at UIUC from 2011–13.
To Dr. Hsia, “having an international strategy is not a luxury, it is survival,” as he said at the recent town hall, adding that, in recent years, the university has done well in establishing its footprints internationally.
Dr. Hsia believes that the core of international strategy lies with the students, faculty and staff. In his words, “These are the people doing international things — faculty students and staff. Without them, there is no international strategy.”
Moving forward, Dr. Hsia intends to work toward maintaining the university’s high quality of education while simultaneously preparing students for future worldwide challenges. He ultimately aims for the university to become a global hub of knowledge, culture, and technology, all the while upholding a position amongst the world’s top educational institutions. Moreover, he aims to achieve results through a collective effort, with individuals across the Carnegie Mellon community coming together and working as one.
So, what will Carnegie Mellon be like 20 or 30 years from now? 
For Dr. Jimmy Hsia, a school with an even larger international footprint is in reach.

New head of history department named
Professor of history Donna Harsch has been selected to succeed Caroline Acker as head of Carnegie Mellon’s history department.
“Professor Harsch will be an excellent successor to Caroline Acker, who did a terrific job of quite selflessly leading the department for the last four years of her career at Carnegie Mellon,” said Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, in a university press release.
Harsch is a social and political historian of modern Germany, and “she has proved to be a versatile and wide-ranging scholar of the 20th century,” said Scheines in the press release, adding that he is “excited to work with her.” Harsch joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon in 1990.
Harsch’s goals as department head include “to continue the department’s focus on social, cultural, and policy history, its strongly global scholarly orientation, and its inclusion of interdisciplinary methodologies, especially anthropology,” according to the news release. She also hopes to encourage interdepartmental collaboration among Dietrich faculty and to increase the history department’s international exposure.
“It’s an exciting time for the History Department,” said Harsch in the release. “As we continue to shape our research profile, there is [an] opportunity to revamp our policy work and bring the department together through shared interests such as social movements, resistance to inequalities and resisting the powers that be.”
Former head Acker has held the position since 2011 and plans to retire. The transition will be effective beginning July 1.
Robotics Institute develops new quadrotor
A small quadrotor developed by Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, in conjunction with spin-off company Sensible Machines, demonstrated its potential to aid firefighting efforts in confined naval spaces.
The demonstration was held aboard a former U.S. Navy ship as part of the Office of Naval Research (ONR)’s Damage Control Technologies for the 21st Century (DC-21) project. In the demonstration, the quadrotor “flew autonomously through dark, smoke-filled compartments to map fires and locate victims,” according to a university press release. “With the micro-flyer, we wanted to show that it could autonomously navigate through the narrow hallways and doors — even in dense fire smoke — and locate fires,” said DC-21 program manager Thomas McKenna, according to the press release. “It succeeded at all those tasks.”
The drone has the capability of “fast lightweight autonomy,” and it uses a RGB-D camera, or depth camera, as its primary sensor for use in building a map of fire areas.
In addition to its utility in managing shipboard fires, the drone will also assist “investigation of building fires and inspection of hazardous chemical tanks and power plant cooling towers,” according to Sebastian Scherer, systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, in the press release.

New finance allocation form 
The Finance Committee presented a new version of the form for finance allocation requests to Senate at Thursday’s meeting. 
The new form, unlike the old finance allocation form, does not show the organization’s previous allocations and has more white space to make it easier to read at a glance. The Finance Committee took suggestions from Senate for improvements that can be made to the form.
Special allocation: Tennis Club 
Senate voted to allocate $885 to the university’s Tennis Club, which was requested to help the club go to a tournament. The Tennis Club did not expect to go to the tournament when they laid out their budget for this year, but ended up doing better than expected.
Election Board presentation 
Student Body president, and senior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner presented the members of this year’s Election Board to Senate, and laid out the elections timeline. Senate did not find any issue with the proposed Election Board members.

After never even seeing the floor in the House last fall, the bill to legalize medical marijuana in Pennsylvania may see a comeback this year.
Since the ultra-conservative Governor Tom Corbett has been replaced by pro-legalization Governor Tom Wolf, the bill definitely has much more hope of making it further in the legislative process and getting passed. While its passage would be a great step in such a traditionally right-leaning state, closer reading of the bill should confound supporters of legalization. While the idea of medical marijuana is progressive by its nature, the bill reflects fairly conservative — or at least narrow-minded — ideals.
The list of conditions that the bill covers is shockingly small: cancer, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s, traumatic brain injury/post-concussion syndrome, multiple sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia, cachexia (unintended extreme weight loss), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), muscle spasms, and severe fibromyalgia. With the exception of PTSD (perhaps a political move intended to get the veterans’ support), there’s a shocking absence of mental disorders on the list. Why should issues like anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s, and anorexia be bypassed under the legislation, when many of these are stigmatized enough without the government’s help?
Researchers have found that marijuana use is effective in the treatment of mood disorders because it helps to restore levels of a chemical in our brains called [endocannabinoids]((http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1361971-overview), which can stabilize mood and help fight off the effects of depression, anxiety, and others mental disorders. The increase in endocannabinoid levels also causes the “munchies,” or a larger appetite resulting from marijuana use, that not only makes the user want food, but increases the pleasure factor of eating by causing a release of dopamine. This helps to treat anorexia patients by conditioning them to equate eating and happiness. Tellingly, only unintended weight loss, not anorexia, is covered under the bill.
Pennsylvania doesn’t want to provide medical marijuana to those with mental disorders, yet the drugs currently being prescribed to treat many mental disorders — those approved by the FDA — come with side effects that can be worse than the disorders they treat. Some common ones include weight loss, headaches, muscle spasms, nausea, seizures, or even the worsening of anxiety and depression. Coincidentally, all of these side effects are conditions that can be treated with marijuana use.
Moreover, many drugs prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disorders, and so on have been known to be highly addictive, even when they aren’t intentionally abused. The most common unwanted side effects of marijuana use include dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and fatigue. With much milder side effects and no evidence of physical dependence, marijuana is a much safer solution.
Additionally, marijuana treatment can be personalized more easily than prescription drug treatment. There exist hundreds of different strains of marijuana, each with unique qualities. The two main categories are sativa and indica. Sativa is associated with more energizing effects, making the user feel uplifted or euphoric, while indicas (“in da couch”) causes a much more relaxed, sleepy feeling. There are also hybrids in between the two that can be modified for specific results.
There are several case studies out there proving the medical benefits of marijuana for a wide spectrum of disorders, mental as well as physical. Although it’s definitely encouraging that legislators are starting somewhere, I am in favor of a bill that includes a much more comprehensive list of conditions, taking more factors into account than what may be seen as socially appropriate.

About a year ago, Carnegie Mellon announced a new program, Proud to Be Plaid, which “works to encourage higher rates of giving among Carnegie Mellon students by unifying colleges, classes, and organizations,” according to the Student Initiatives website. The program was part of a larger push from the administration to raise the annual giving threshold for the entire school.
These donations would help the overall ranking of our school, according to the Why We Give page on the Alumni/Giving website for Carnegie Mellon. In fact, according to the US News & World Report, alumni giving accounts for 5 percent of a school’s ranking in their “best colleges” report.
Alumni giving is important because it indicates that alumni feel their experience at the college or university has been worthwhile. Statistically, more alumni give with higher frequency to schools that satisfied them, and Carnegie Mellon is attempting to stay competitive by rolling out these new fundraising programs.
Naturally, some students have been unsettled and even angered when the school they are paying tens of thousands of dollars to attend asks them to donate more money. However, The Tartan feels that it is important to see both sides of this issue.
While it is certainly upsetting to be asked to spare more from the meager student budget, Carnegie Mellon is trying to better the school as a whole. An increased ranking could improve potential for employment after our time here is done, improve the respect that the university’s name garners all over the world, and — somewhat ironically — improve alumni giving. 
Greater donations from alumni would improve student life here on campus, from scholarship opportunities to building improvements. These donations clearly have a lot of value, both for students still in the midst of their Carnegie Mellon experience and for alumni who are out in the world representing the education they received here.
It remains, however, that students just don’t see all of the benefits from this program. In the middle of strenuous semesters when money is tight, it hurts to be asked to tighten pursestrings even more, especially for abstract reasons.
Perhaps, to compromise, the university should concentrate more on soliciting alumni donations from those who are done with their Carnegie experience and out in the real world. 
Current students could help fundraising efforts by showing off their accomplishments to alumni, proving that the school would use their donations to fund students who deserve it.
The program could still raise the bar for alumni giving while taking the strain off of current students, and the university could show that they sympathize with the student body. Furthermore, increased transparency and openness from the administration, including communications detailing why these donations are important and the true benefit that they will have for students is incredibly important for the success of this program.
The alumni giving rate at Carnegie Mellon isn’t competitive with that of its peer universities, and there are ways to change that. But simply rolling out new programs and new expectations isn’t enough: there must be a cooperative effort between alumni, students, and administration to make this program a success.

As the first month of 2015 drew to a close, one of the most prominent news stories of 2014 made its way back onto the front pages. When the Ukrainian government stabilized itself last summer, with Petro Poroshenko taking the presidential office, many expected the violence in eastern Ukraine, centered around Donetsk, to slowly fade away.
However, the conflict has festered. The regional Euromaidan protests gave way to an even larger international conflict between the Ukrainian national government and Russian-backed separatist rebels. Many analysts point to a return to an American-Russian conflict much like the Cold War. Even the man who is earmarked to be the next Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, said that he was very much “inclined” to send aid to Ukraine, even if the aid could be labeled “lethal” in nature. CNN has suggested that possible American arming of the Ukrainian armed forces against the Russian-led rebels would take “the worst East-West confrontation since the Cold War into a new and unpredictable stage.”
Such a Cold War-reminiscent framework of the conflict is flawed, with the White House keen to clarify rumors on American involvement in the region. “A decision like this will be made by the Commander-in-Chief,” said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. The American debate over Ukrainian aid is sparked by reports of a heavy Ukrainian defeat in the East.
The Ukrainian rebels have often been labelled “Russian Proxies.” With a return to Cold War tactics, a group of hawkish Senators led by Senator John McCain have called for the shipment of offensive weapons and arms to Ukraine in order to deter the rebels. America has supplied defensive equipment, such as night vision goggles, to the Ukrainian government, but never military equipment to attack the rebel forces. Such a move could only provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian forces as they would see the need to further attack Ukraine.
According to the Wall Street Journal, a silent peace agreement drafted by the Kremlin was sent to European governments calling for peace in addition to increased autonomy and territory. It was rejected, however, and German and French leaders Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have traveled to Kiev and Moscow in hopes of hashing out a peace deal. 
From a Russian point of view, a ceasefire would be optimal. Putin faces disaster as the funds of oligarchs and politicians who have kept him in power, due to Russia’s economic rise a decade ago and the boom of Russia’s natural gas and oil industry, dry up. The Russian ruble lies in tatters, and the annexation of Crimea and the conflict with Ukrainian forces continue to pile pressure on the Russian government.
Putin also knows that a further push towards Kiev could be disastrous with international powers watching Russia’s every move. Moreover, Ukraine’s economic fate is tied to that of Russia. “He has no way to erode Ukraine’s economy without simultaneously destroying Russia’s,” according to Alexander Motyl, a Rutgers Univesity political science professor, in Foreign Affairs.
These factors must and should be played into negotiations, which suggest that Ukraine can soon reach some sort of ceasefire. Ukraine is a country that needs to be rebuilt. Its government infrastructure lacks stability and anti-corruption measures, and its government is constantly edging near default. The next few days could be key to determining the future of Russia, Ukraine, and all of Europe.

In the wake of a spat with al Qaeda leadership over a merge with another arm in the organization, al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) refused to restrict their operations solely within Iraqi territory. AQI broke off and formed the group called the Islamic State (IS).
This group is often referred to by its former name, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), since the name “IS” wrongly associates Islam with the group’s despicable actions. The change in name, in addition to ISIS’s methods of mobilizing against “the near enemy” instead of the West, led to the belief that al Qaeda broke off relations because ISIS was “too extreme.”
While that is a bit of an oversimplification, al Qaeda did believe that ISIS was unnecessarily brutal, to the point of hurting their cause. However, current events seem to suggest that ISIS has been and will continue to be successful. Its fairly extensive network of captured territories signifies what might be one of the most well-designed radical groups in history, and radical is an extremely accurate descriptor. Just this week, ISIS released a video of a Jordanian pilot burning to death and the last American hostage was, according to ISIS, killed in a Jordanian airstrike (this claim is highly questionable, according to The Atlantic). This set off another round of debate as to what America should do.
ISIS’s ample funding and savvy organization have produced quick and stunning success. Overnight, ISIS took control of a strip of land that extends from Syria’s northern border with Turkey to the northeastern areas of Iraq. ISIS’s rapid rise to power went conspicuously unimpeded by Western forces, particularly America.
America has been extraordinarily hands-on in the region over the past decade, supporting rebellions and generally imposing its political will. ISIS is based on vicious religious oppression and systematic violence against those who disagree with its views. It is uncontroversial to say they pose a threat to the interests of both citizen and state, in both America and the northern stretches of the Levant. Why was this the moment America chose to turn its back?
One reason often cited is that ISIS happened to be fighting Iran’s strongest allies in the region, Iraq and Syria. This is a pretty questionable reason for America to leave ISIS alone. A destabilized Middle East is bad for both American interests and its allies in the region, including Israel.
The fact that ISIS was attacking Iran’s allies means nothing unless America sees ISIS as either an ally or neutral. However, the potential of ISIS being considered neutral is more likely the issue. ISIS’s obsession with destroying “the near enemy” before they tackle the West is favorable to the American government because ISIS wants to localize its battles instead of coming here.
While decades of pro-democracy and pro-freedom rhetoric certainly felt hollow and self-interested, the United States’ inaction has strongly confirmed these feelings. America initially went into Iraq with the stated goal of spreading democracy. 
Cut to mid 2014, and an organization staunchly opposed to democracy rules the land America “liberated.” Since ISIS’s target has not been the United States, the American government dragged its feet, allowing ISIS to become a major international threat before America did anything meaningful. Eventually, public executions of American citizens forced the government’s hand, and Americans have been launching air strikes on ISIS, but that does not cut to the heart of the problem. America has a publicly stated foreign policy goal of intervening when governments become oppressive. It needs to either drop this fairly imperialist policy or start taking it at face value rather than using “oppressive” as code for “not an ally”. If America wanted to lend legitimacy to its policy of spreading democracy, it would not have stalled until Americans feared for their domestic security.
Countless people have been killed or injured both mentally and physically by ISIS, and even more have been displaced from their homes. People continue to be brutalized as the organization ravages their homelands. America’s sudden silence on spreading democracy and the notable hole in its often philosophically cosmopolitan rhetoric speaks volumes more than empty platitudes about Iraq’s first breaths of freedom ever did.

Last Monday, Carnegie Mellon announced a partnership with Uber in building the Uber Advanced Technologies Center. Most of the media focus has surrounded the possibility of self-driving cars, which promise to increase the safe, reliable transportation offered by Uber.
While this partnership offers a bright view into the future, there are also reasons to be wary of the potential consequences of Carnegie Mellon teaming up with a company constantly in the news for all the wrong reasons.
There are always reasons to be excited about technological partnerships. The final results are often enough to make life better for large swaths of the population, but intermediary discoveries in both software and hardware occasionally have the same effect.
Driverless cars in particular offer a rosy look to the future. Optimized driving routes and significantly better reaction times could improve highway safety and even minimize traffic. A world with fewer automobile accident deaths would be excellent, and if we reduce smog in the process that would be a major plus.
Unfortunately, there is some reason to question the prudence in partnering with Uber. Several claims have been publicly levied against Uber in recent months, and it would be naïve to simply ignore what has been said about the company.
One claim is that Uber undercuts taxi workers, specialized union workers who provide an important service. Undermining their job security by putting Uber cars on the market functionally busts the union, since Uber drivers are not unionized.
The partnership between Uber and CMU seems to respond to this in two ways. 
The first is listed on the Carnegie Mellon press release on the partnership, stating that the center could create jobs in the innovation sector, an increasingly important component of Pittsburgh’s economy. Second, driverless cars theoretically will make cabs much safer, improving the quality of the service, which is good for consumers.
Another issue with the partnership is a moral qualm with Uber’s business practices. The most significant of Uber’s questionable practices was when an executive floated the idea of running smear campaigns against critical journalists, in what he believed to be an off-the-record discussion.
Another common qualm has to do with its interaction with competitors. Uber has been accused of ordering large numbers of cars from Lyft — its main competitor — and then canceling them, wasting the drivers’ time. Uber has also falsely told its drivers that working for both Uber and Lyft is banned by city ordinances in areas such as New York City.
It is always exciting to see Carnegie Mellon engaging the companies we hear about every day in an effort to increase the technological capabilities of the average citizen, but it is important to be aware of whom the university is working with. The potential returns on a partnership with Uber are large, but Uber will have to change their tune before we will be truly comfortable to be affiliated with it.

Last week, Apple Inc. reported the most profitable quarter of any company in corporate history.
For Q1, going from Oct.–Dec. 2014, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $74.6 billion and quarterly net profit of $18 billion at a gross margin of 39.9 percent. Numbers like these are unheard of for even the largest, most successful companies in the world.
For some perspective, if you combine the revenue of Apple’s three biggest competitors — Microsoft, Amazon, and Google — over the same period, it amounts to $73.9 billion, less than Apple’s by millions. Even more impressive, however, is the fact that despite being so much bigger than its competitors, Apple is growing far more quickly; its sales grew 30 percent year over year, as opposed to 8 percent for Microsoft and 15 percent for both Amazon and Google.
Apple seems to be defying the laws of what should be possible for any business. Perhaps for this reason, despite it being the most successful company in the world, the dominant narrative around Apple is that it is barely hanging on by the skin of its teeth.
From the looks of it, outside of the now irrelevant mp3 player market, Apple doesn’t dominate a single market it is in. From smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops, Apple routinely fights it out for high single-digit to low double-digit market shares. It seems paradoxical to think of Apple as an industry leader. Furthermore, Apple only competes for the highest income bracket, apparently going after none but the most affluent consumers. As markets commodify with time and trend toward cheaper goods of lesser quality, how does Apple compete?
Juan Pablo Vazquez Sampere of the Harvard Business Review writes that “we shouldn’t be dazzled by Apple’s earnings report,” arguing that Apple isn’t revolutionizing industries anymore. Even Larry Ellison, Steve Job’s old friend, argues that Apple without Steve Jobs is doomed to repeat its mistakes from the 90s.
The general public doesn’t seem to buy into Apple’s future either. Apple has a price-to-earnings Ratio of 16, lower than Google’s at 27.25, and far lower than Amazon’s obscene 869.51. Furthermore, the narrative of doom and gloom around Apple has been consistent for the past 5–6 years, and Apple has consistently proved its naysayers wrong.
Why is the majority so skeptical of Apple’s success? I believe this is because very few people truly understand Apple’s business model. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were roundly criticized, much like the previous four models, for not being particularly revolutionary. Yet, the iPhone sold 74.5 million units this past quarter.
The critics are right. The iPhone, much like the iPad or the Mac, isn’t particularly revolutionary any more. To me, however, this just makes Apple’s record-shattering results all the more remarkable. If people aren’t buying these products because they’re ahead of the curve, they can only be buying them for the one differentiator that these products have: great design.
In a sense, Apple’s greatest achievement isn’t the iPod, iPhone, iPad, or any of its hit products. I believe that, far more importantly, it has established beyond all doubt that people are willing to pay for good design. 
While the majority of the market will race toward the lowest price range, there will always remain a sizable niche of customers who are willing to pay a handsome premium for products that add up to more than their competitors in tangible ways: how a product feels in one’s hand, how much fun it is to use, how easy it is to understand, and, yes, how “cool” it makes one feel. Great design is the secret behind Apple’s spectacular success.
The problem that we face when we try to comprehend Apple’s success is that it seems to fly in the face of conventional disruption theory, which states that innovation will necessarily interrupt existing markets and drive out earlier technology.
Instead of trying to fit Apple’s success to an established narrative, we need to accept this success as evidence that disruption theory doesn’t apply to consumer markets where people value great design and integration. Instead of denying what is happening, we would do well to study and understand how Apple is disrupting conventional business wisdom far more than any industry.
