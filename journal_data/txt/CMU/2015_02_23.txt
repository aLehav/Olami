“College is something you want to remember for your whole lifetime,” sprinter and hurdler Sasha Spalding said, retelling the words that changed not only her Carnegie Mellon experience, but also her life, for the better. The senior business administration major and global systems and management minor gave advice that every student still buried nose-deep in homework ought to notice.
The Springhill, Fla. native first became interested in sports in first grade, when she would wait for the lunch tables to be removed from the gym before launching into hours of basketball. Even though few of her friends played and her parents weren’t exactly enthusiastic about the amount of time she spent on the sport, she found herself continuing to play for the sheer fun of it. Although she had intended to continue playing basketball on her high school’s team, her athletic ability was noticed by Coach Joel Myers of the track team as she played, and Myers enlisted the team to convince her to give track and field a try.
“It took them a while to convince me,” Spalding said. While she was passionate about basketball, many of her friends were on the track team, and they eventually wore her down. Spalding quickly became hooked on the sport. Her prowess as a basketball player translated to both speed and endurance on the track. During her high school years, the team went to the state championships every year, and she was an integral part of the team’s success.
When the time came to apply for college, both academics and athletics were on her mind. She was initially interested in joining a Division I school in order to be part of an already established program, but none of them fit the academic rigor she was looking for. In Carnegie Mellon, she finally found what she was looking for: an academically rigorous school with a track program that offered her the opportunity to play an important role.
At first, like many first-year students discovering for the first time what it means to be a Tartan, she found herself swamped by the workload her classes gave her. As a result, she was unable to join the cross country team because she spent all her time on academics. Needless to say, she was not happy with these circumstances and went to her adviser, the Business Administration Program’s Executive Director Dr. Milton Cofield, for the advice that changed everything. “School is more than academics,” he told her, encouraging her to get out and do things at which she’d be able to look back and smile fondly.
Taking his advice to heart, Spalding decided that she would join the track team for the spring semester, despite the intense workload. “It was awesome,” she said of her first days with the team. She quickly realized that this was something she wanted to do throughout school. “Everyone was really welcoming.” She appreciated most how many people from different backgrounds and majors came together, united by the sport and the coaching staff.
Her proudest track accomplishment was her performance at a University of Chicago meet last year. It was a 30 degree day with howling winds — not the best of circumstances. In addition, Spalding wasn’t exactly in the best shape possible. “I was injured pretty much all season,” she said. Despite the ominous atmosphere, everything came together for her as she finished second in the long jump and third in shot put.
Spalding’s athletic accomplishments have only grown more impressive since then. In the past few weeks, she was named University Athletic Association (UAA) Women’s Field Athlete of the Week, not once, but twice. On Feb. 2, she earned the honor with her performance at Case Western Reserve University in the long jump, shot put, 200-meter dash, and 4X400 relay. Two weeks later, she was chosen again, this time for her performance at Tiffin University on Valentines Day. During the meet, she set a new Carnegie Mellon record with a long jump of 5.31 meters.
While she highly values her athletic achievements, she has given equal value to her academics, and has almost completed her education. After she graduates, Spalding will become a project manager at Capital One, but she also plans on becoming a personal trainer. “I’m not going to be one-dimensional,” she said, remembering the time before joining the track team. “I plan on living life to the fullest.”

In their Friday night double header at home, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s basketball teams played in a set of nail bitters that each came down to the final minute. The women were on the wrong side of the late game heroics as they were sunk by a last second basket by the University of Rochester Yellowjackets, and senior guard MacKenzie Boyd’s desperate half-court heave was offline. On the other hand, the men were able to maintain their lead down the stretch, with three-pointers by sophomore forward Jack Serbin and junior guard Jason Sebak to seal the deal.
Opening the game, the women tried their best to break their eight game conference losing streak, with their last University Athletic Association (UAA) win against Rochester on Jan. 23. With the Tartans determined to get a win in their second-to-last home game of the season, junior forward Liza Otto and sophomore center Lisa Murphy fought hard to keep the game within reach and combined for 20 of Carnegie Mellon’s 29 first half points. Murphy, Otto, and Boyd, along with senior guard Chandler Caufield, were pressed into heavy minutes with the Tartans only playing with two reserves. All four played at least 33 minutes with Caufield and Murphy getting less than 2 minutes each on the bench all game with each getting one short stint on the bench in each half.
After going into the half down 2, 31–29, it looked like the Tartans were going to fade in the second half as they had for most of the season. The Yellowjackets quickly pushed their lead to double digits, just over five minutes into the second half.
Otto and Murphy responded by combining to cut the deficit to 5, before Caufield hit three straight threes to keep up with Rochester’s offense down the stretch.
Finally, with just under 3 minutes to go, Murphy was fouled as she made a layup, and hit the ensuing free throw to tie the game up at 56. On the next Yellowjackets’ possession, Boyd got the steal and passed up to Otto, who was fouled and made both of her subsequent free throws. This gave the Tartans their first lead since the first half. Rochester went up 3 with 1:16 remaining on a 3–pointer before Otto hit another pair of free throws to make it a one point game. After running down the shot clock, the Yellowjackets missed a long three and failed to convert on the put back attempt on the offensive rebound. Coming out of a timeout with under 30 seconds left, Otto tried to take the lead but missed her jump shot, only to have Boyd recover the offensive rebound and kick it out to Caufield, who faked out the defender on the three point line and drove to just behind the free throw line, where she hit the jump shot and gave the Tartans the lead with 11 seconds left. Without taking a timeout and giving Carnegie Mellon a chance to organize, Rochester quickly got the ball up court and into the far corner, where a tough off dribble jumper from just inside the three point line gave the Yellowjackets the final lead at 63–62. The Tartans tried to heave up a Hail Mary shot, but with no time outs, they were only able to get up to the half-court and lob it in the general direction of their basket.
The loss knocks the women down to 11–12 on the season and 2–10 in UAA play.
The men’s game had fewer late-game theatrics, although that’s probably for the best, as the Tartans controlled the game from the opening minutes with Serbin scoring the first points of the game. The first half saw Carnegie Mellon open up an early double digit lead — pushing their advantage all the way to 11 on a Sebak three pointer with less than 5 minutes to go in the half — before the Yellowjackets found their shooting stroke and cut the lead down to two with just over a minute left in the opening half.
Any momentum Rochester could have carried into the half was quickly negated, however, when in the final seconds Serbin stole the ball and went coast to coast. The half ended with a powerful two-handed slam to put the Tartans up 4, 30–26, going into the locker room.
Coming out into the second half, Carnegie Mellon quickly pushed the lead back to the comfortable multiple possession cushion they had before the Yellowjacket run. Serbin and senior guard Seth Cordts ran the offense as they had much of the year, with each alternating attacking the rim and shooting long range jumpers and threes.
With just 10:25 left in the half, Rochester managed to tie the game back up. However, a lay–up by sophomore center Chris Shkil followed by his block on the defensive end set the stage for the Tartans to put the game away once and for all, along with a three by sophomore guard Matt Hillman. Down the stretch, the Tartans played tough, aggressive defense while making their free throws and getting a pair of threes from Sebak to make sure the game was never in serious doubt again. Carnegie Mellon eventually cruised to the 64–55 victory.
With the win, the men improve to 13–10 on the season and 4–8 in UAA play. The victory also guaranteed the Tartans their first winning season since 2009.
Both Carnegie Mellon squads finished up their home seasons with a double header on Sunday, and will play their season finales at Case Western on Saturday.

Last weekend was an extremely special one for the world. It was one of the few times in the year when passion rose above all and freakishly scary things happened. Last weekend was the “All-Star Weekend” for the National Basketball Association (NBA) — not to mention Valentine’s Day and Friday the 13th. Our story begins on Sunday night: Up until that point, the West had dominated the weekend, with Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry winning the Three-Point Contest, Houston Rockets guard Patrick Beverley trumping the Skills Challenge and Minnesota Timberwolves guard Zach LaVine conquering the Slam Dunk Contest. The East had one more chance to come out of the weekend with some dignity and silverware — the All-Star Game.
The fascination surrounding the All-Star Game is captured best by the words of the Western Conference Coach Steve Kerr. “What I was thinking today was just how cool it is for each one of you: your own unique story and how you got here and for the next couple of hours here we are in the Mecca, the Garden, and this is what it is all about.”
The stage was set for an iconic game. To heighten the magic of the moment, Pau and Marc Gasol, brothers and centers for the Chicago Bulls and Memphis grizzlies respectively, would make history by being the first brothers to start an All-Star game and face each other at the tipoff.
Coach Kerr told his players exactly how the first play would be: “One of you guys get it and like throw it to one of the other guys and then you throw it to someone else and then you shoot.” Funnily enough, that’s what it was all game long. Having players of such stature compete on such a glorified field, nobody is interested in strategic plays or pressuring defense. The focus instead is on a flamboyant offense, and this game would have no shortage of that.
The East was putting on a show with the likes of Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving, Cavaliers small forward LeBron James and Washington Wizards point guard John Wall. It hardly seems fathomable that in a game comparable to a compilation of highlight reels, James could actually be outshone. But that’s exactly what happened with all the credit going to the West’s backcourt. Curry was showing off his ball handling and assisting skills galore with phenomenal offensive rebounds and assists. One of his many recipients was Rockets guard James Harden, who put on a fierce display all game long, from drilling a step-back three pointer against James to notching some vicious finishes at the rim. However, neither player could make nearly as much of an impact as Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook. Westbrook has always possessed a seemingly bottomless reserve of athleticism and energy.
This All-Star game was a prime example of what happens when Westbrook starts finding his inner “Splash Brother.” Whenever the West asked, he delivered. His performance was nothing short of dazzling, from scoring at will from behind the arc to hitting his head on the backboard while throwing the ball down. It comes as no surprise then that he broke the record for most points scored in a half in an All-Star game, with a whopping 27. However, that was not enough to make King James shy away, and he held his own with 22 points in the first half, leading the East to a comeback before the break. At halftime, the West were in the lead by the skin of their teeth, with the scores at 83-82.
The second half provided plenty of excitement as things started to get more competitive with the time winding down. The game’s second half featured 12 lead changes and nine tie games as the East struggled to get back into the game with points shared across the board for an impressive combined team performance. No player from the East scored in double digits in the second half. 
The West, on the other hand, were strongly led by the individual performances of Harden, Westbrook, Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul and Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins, all of whom had double digit performances in the half. Ex-MVP Paul ended the night with a game-high 15 assists — something that seems quite normal given his exceptional understanding of the game. No matter how hard the East tried to achieve a lead of more than three points, the West kept mounting their own offensive plays, which were not only more numerous but also had a greater rate of success. Fate had made up its mind and the West were not going to be trumped.
If All-Star games had nicknames, this game would be called the “Alley-oop Game of 2015.” In a game with high-flying players (both literally and metaphorically) why would anyone finish with a floater when they could instead lob it to a teammate for a rim-rocking dunk that would ignite the 17,198 people in attendance.
Sky-walkers like James, Harden, and Westbrook and bigs like San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan and Atlanta Hawks center Al Horford were the main source of these displays. However, an All Star Game is not complete without a memorable moment or two and in this case they were the dunks by Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki and Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry. Nowitzki’s display came when Curry, the West’s chief leader of alley-oop assists crossed over the defense and executed a perfect lob to a cutting Nowitzki who finished with both hands before pointing to the sky, a reference to 2000 dunk contest champion Vince Carter.
Curry telling Irving at the start of the game to “Get more cardio in” all of a sudden makes sense as the West kept up their barrage of brilliance. It would not be so easy to forget about the East, however, as Lowry showed off his hops with a fantastic put back slam to achieve his first dunk since 2009.
Having said all that, the fabulous performances were not limited to finishes inside the paint. If Lowry was right when he said from the bench that all anybody wanted from the All Star game was to watch Kyle Korver shoot threes, then the audience definitely was  not left disappointed as Korver finished the game with all his points coming from 3’s, shooting 7 for 12 from behind the arc.
Although Korver was in a league of his own, Westbrook did not have a poor showing either, achieving his whopping 41 points on the game on 5 of 9 shooting from 3-point range. 
Curry and Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson, known as the Splash Brothers, on the other hand, exhausted all their 3 pointers in the contest earlier in the weekend and so had very little to contribute to this game.
It seems only appropriate that the man who scored the most points — the man who soared the highest (as evidenced by his head on the backboard), the man with all the answers for the West — should be the man who would be awarded the MVP in this game of champions. And so as Westbrook went home with his own silverware, the West went home victorious (both for the game and the weekend) yet again.

Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams travelled to Columbus, Ohio on Saturday for the Ohio State Tune Up in preparation for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships next weekend. While up against many large programs, including Division I (DI) host Ohio State, the Tartans performed well with the men finishing tied for 6th out of 21 schools and the women finishing 12th out of 27 competing groups.
Despite being up against a lot of top DI competition, senior Thomas Vandenberg continued his domination of the 800 meter run, finishing first with a time of 1:53.48 as he sets his sights on defending his UAA Championship in the event and earning a return invite to the NCAA Championships. In the 3000 meter run, senior George Degen took advantage of the increased competition to set a career best in the event with a 8:22.89 finishing time. That time places him 9th in the nation and sets him up for a possible NCAA Championship bid as well.
For the women, senior Erin Kiekhaefer finished fourth in the mile run with a time of 5:07.33, setting a new career record, while sophomore Rebecca Fortner cleared the 1.53 meter bar in the high jump, which was good enough for third. Senior Sasha Spalding continued her strong season as she set a new school record in the long jump with a 5.51 meter leap. Unfortunately this was only good enough for 7th against the tough competition, although she was only .18 meters from first and .07 meters from third.
Next up for the teams is the UAA Championships, hosted by University of Chicago. The championships will take place over two days starting on Saturday and finishing up on Sunday.
Men’s Tennis
Starting on Friday, the ninth ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team competed in the ITA Indoor Championship hosted by Gustavus Adolphus College.
In their first match in the Championship Quarterfinals, the Tartans faced off against sixth-ranked UAA rival Emory. In the opening doubles matches, the Tartans dropped two of the three matches with only the pair of sophomores, Jack Kasbeer and Kenny Zheng, pulling out a victory with a 8–6 comeback. In the singles matches, Carnegie Mellon quickly fell behind 4–1 after losing the first two matches, but fought back with senior Christian Heaney-Secord, sophomore Kunal Wadwani and Kasbeer pulling out victories before the Tartans ultimately lost 5–4 to the conference rivals. Wadwani won his match in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2 while Heaney-Secord needed three sets 6–2, 6–7, 6–4 and Kasbeer needed a third set tiebreaker for his victory, 7–5, 3–6, 10–7.
With the loss, Carnegie Mellon moved into the Consolation bracket Saturday morning, taking on twelfth-ranked Kenyon College. Again the Tartans fell into an early hole going 1–2 in the doubles matches, this time with senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar pulling out the sole doubles victory, 8–2.
In singles, Carnegie Mellon struggled mightily, with several players losing in straight sets. Zheng and Wadwani were to only solo victors for the Tartans with Wadwani again winning in straight sets 6–1, 7–6 (7–1) and Zheng pulling out the tough win 7–6 (7–2), 6–7 (2–7), 6–4.
Saturday evening, the Tartans tried to avoid a complete sweep of the weekend as they took on fourteenth ranked host Gustavus Adolphus College in the 7th place match. In the name of consistency, Carnegie Mellon quickly fell behind again going 1–2 after doubles with the second pair winning — this time it was Beisswanger and Kumar with an 8–1 win.
With the threat of a third straight defeat, the Tartans finally regained their edge in singles play with Heaney-Secord, Wadwani, and first year Tommy Cheng all pulling out straight set victories with Heaney-Secord and Cheng each winning 6–3, 6–4 and Wadwani showing them both up with his 6–3, 6–3 win. Junior Abhishek Alla, who struggled all tournament in the top seeded singles slot, pulled out the come from behind victory to give Carnegie Mellon the edge in their final match of the weekend, winning 4–6, 6–4, 6–1.
The team will next play over spring break when they travel to Claremont, Calif. for a series of games over the week off from school.

On Sunday, Carnegie Mellon finished its home basketball season as both the men’s and women’s teams faced off against Emory University during their senior games. While the squads split the midday double header, both teams saw their single season blocks records fall as they closed out their home schedules in front of the Carnegie Mellon faithful.
The men started off the double header, and had an honorary starting lineup with all four seniors — guard Jasen Blakney, forwards Matt Loebbaka and Kevin Stursberg, and captain and guard Seth Cordts — and played meaningful minutes throughout the game to celebrate the years each gave the program.
With sophomore forward Jack Serbin rounding out the starting line up, the Tartans played the Eagles close, with Cordts, Serbin, and sophomore center Chris Shkil getting all but four of the Tartans’ 29 points in the first half as a pair of Cordts free throws combined to put the Tartans down only 1 going in to half.
A Serbin jump shot, only 11 seconds out of half, gave Carnegie Mellon their first lead while the combo of Serbin, Shkil and Cordts continued their domination, scoring another 21 points for the Tartans before the halfway mark in the second half, and scoring all but 2 points in the second half. Unfortunately, relying on just three players for the hefty majority of the scoring left the Tartans vulnerable to a cold streak by their offensive weapons and with 10 minutes to go in the half, all three went cold leading to deep freeze by the Tartans offense and a 15–4 run by the Eagles to put the game away down the stretch. Although the final tally of 75–63 Emory may demoralizing for the Tartans, the guarantee of a winning record for the first time in the tenures of any of the players plus the new single season block record by Serbin with 70 and a chance to increase his record with a game remaining, will act as a spring board toward next years’ success.
The loss drops the men to 13–11 on the season and 4–9 in conference play.
In the second game of the double header, the women tried to honor their seniors, guards MacKenzie Boyd and Chandler Caufield, with their first University Athletic Association (UAA) victory in over a month in a half.
Starting with a three pointer by first-year Anna Novak to take an early 3–0 lead, the Tartans made their objectives known and only trailed once the entire game, which was quickly rectified by a Boyd three pointer. For the game Carnegie Mellon lived off of the three, which rewarded their trust by allowing a 66.7 shooting percentage for the game, driving the Tartan offense to an easy victory, 84–74.
Playing another small bench lineup where each starter played over 30 minutes, each starter was rewarded for her commitment by shooting at least 50 percent from both the field and behind the arc, with both junior forward Liza Otto and sophomore center Lisa Murphy recording double-doubles with 10 rebounds and 17 points for Otto and a game high 29 points and 11 rebounds for Murphy.
Murphy also set the single season blocks record for the women’s team with 66 on the season before her final game of the season on the road.
With the win, the women push to 12–12 on the season and 3–10 in UAA play with a chance to improve both records when both Carnegie Mellon squads travel to Case Western Reserve University on Saturday to finish out their seasons.

Carnegie Mellon’s Human Computer Interaction Institute hosted a lecture by Gerhard Fischer, a professor in the Department of Computer Science and director of the Center for Lifelong Learning and Design at the University of Colorado Boulder last Wednesday. Fischer presented his talk on Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and their impacts on the structure of education in the future. His research predominantly tries to develop  “a more theoretical grounded view of what MOOCs are and what they can be.”
In the fall of 2011, two professors from Stanford University, Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig, offered interactive webcasts to their “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” class. Only 175 students physically attended the lectures at Stanford, but over 100,000 virtual users participated in this academic activity. Although the concept of Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) had been introduced in 2008, Norvig and Thrun popularized this concept that now spans over six thousand free and accessible online classes.
As MOOCs gained popularity over the past two years, more universities showed increasing support of them. If a professor chooses to offer his or her class to the open environment of the internet, companies such as Udacity, Coursera, and EdX serve as platforms for professors to present class materials to interested candidates. As companies that serve as vehicles to MOOCs gained prominence, prestigious universities all over the nation more willingly assisted in their developments. The balance of the two kinds of institutions continually pushed forward the developments of MOOCs. In the research realm of education, many have recently focused on MOOCs and their benefits to future structures of education. “I have been interested in rethinking and envisioning what learning in education in the 21st century might be,” Fischer said. “I think that schools will not go away, but we may rethink the function of schools in such an environment since online activities have become very prominent.”
Fischer’s focus on MOOCs relates to the concept of a “flipped classroom.” Instead of a traditional classroom setting where students attend lectures to learn the material needed for a set curriculum, flipped classrooms reverse the roles in the sense that the understanding of a subject based on learning materials has already been achieved before class. Then, when class actually takes place, the professor can interact with students based on a discussion-type learning. With MOOCs, well-known academic sources can be distributed to students as a resource to learn before class. 
Because MOOCs take on a more technological and innovative shape, many students seem to prefer the incorporation of MOOCs outside of classes to mere traditional papers and textbooks.
Fischer has conducted the last ten years of his research while keeping in mind the concept of flipped classrooms. His findings derive from his own experiences as a professor and his desire to motivate students to engage in classes. “I would give them small assignments beforehand, for example, a paper to read on a certain subject,” Fischer said. “I would then ask them to consider the strengths, weaknesses, and the most interesting ideas of the topic.” 
Fischer would then create a course information environment where students would share their own thoughts. Instead of spending the first few minutes in class studying this material, he would extract the most interesting comments from his students and put them on slides so that class time could be spent on discussing more controversial issues. “I found that this method was considerably more effort, and I found that the students get more out of it,” Fischer said.
Despite their benefits, MOOCs are often criticized due to their association with high dropout rates. About 90 percent of the people who sign up for these online classes end up not completing them. However, the important message that Fischer wishes to reinforce is that MOOCs impact a considerably larger number of students than regular universities do. Although the retention rate may be low, the actual amount of students that they impact is rather impressive.
Many students in these courses drop out because MOOCs are seen as less legitimate by many entities. When asked about the legitimization of MOOCs onto the same platforms of universities in the future, Fischer responded, “How these things will develop is at this moment unclear, but I would include institutions offering MOOCs finding ways to make their educational efforts more legitimate and verifiable.” His research has found that the “self-motivational” qualities of completing MOOCs attract certain professionals in industries, but, as of right now, the credentials gained from MOOCs are not as acceptable as actual degrees from universities.
As technology advances the way society approaches education, researchers and professors continue to seek out new methods of communicating and learning. Currently, MOOCs have gained momentum from only a few years of prominence, and it is clear that the future landscape of education will continue to adapt to developments involving MOOCs.

This month, senior mathematical sciences major Tomer Reiter was selected to study at the University of Cambridge in England as a 2015 recipient of the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, one of the most prestigious international scholarships.
The Gates Cambridge Scholarships program was established in 2000 by a donation of 210 million dollars to the University of Cambridge from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest single donation to any university in the United Kingdom. Students are selected based on their outstanding intellectual ability, leadership potential, and commitment to improving the lives of others. Students awarded this scholarship study a vast range of subjects at the University of Cambridge, and alumni of the program take on leadership roles and apply their knowledge and skills to better the lives of others.
Reiter is the second Carnegie Mellon student to receive a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. “Carnegie Mellon seemed like a great place to be if you wanted to do mathematics. After I got here, I found that this was definitely the case,” Reiter said in an interview with Jocelyn Duffy, Director of Media Relations at the Mellon College of Science. “Math is beautiful. One of the most satisfying things is when you have a strong intuition about why a statement should be true, and you finally find a proof,” Reiter said. “Carnegie Mellon has taught me how to tackle those difficult problems.”
At Cambridge, Reiter will complete a one-year course called “Part III of the Mathematical Tripos” to obtain a Master of Advanced Study degree in pure mathematics. Afterward, Reiter plans on returning to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree in mathematics.
Reiter, who was born in Israel and raised in Newton, Mass., discovered his love of mathematics while attending the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists (PROMYS). PROMYS is a six-week summer program in Boston where high school students learn about mathematics, specifically number theory. 
“I found my passion for number theory and mathematics at PROMYS. I returned as a counselor and eventually served as head counselor. Through this I realized how excited I am to mentor and teach mathematics,” Reiter said in his scholarship profile. “At Carnegie Mellon University, I completed a major in mathematics and minor in computer science, further fueling my interest in mathematics and mentoring.”
Reiter hopes to one day become a professor. “All the while, I hope to make contributions through teaching and mentoring, just as PROMYS has made an impact on me,” Reiter said.
Along with completing a major in mathematics and a minor in computer science, Reiter is a former president and former philanthropy chair of Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, studies Japanese, and is a part of the Math Club.

When you hear about a scientific discovery, it usually comes to you second- or even third-hand through various news sources. The media serves as a middleman between scientists and the public, and this week, Pugwash discussed that connection.
The meeting started with the question of whether we thought there were problems in the current way the media handles science. Members were quick to point out that there are many cases in which the media takes a stronger stance, exaggerates the results of certain studies, or neglects to report on inconclusive results.
For example, in 2011 a team of scientists reported that they seemed to observe subatomic particles traveling faster than the speed of light. This result was highly anomalous and unexpected, as it contradicted Einstein’s laws of special relativity. In their own publication, the researchers reported that they were looking for an error in their equipment. However, mainstream news sources spread the news that special relativity was on the rocks. Headlines announced that “Particles break light-speed limit,” a much stronger assertion than the scientists themselves made. It turned out the equipment was faulty after all, but the media had already spread the (false) news that there were faster-than-light particles.
A member of Pugwash brought up that news sources can’t be expected to be experts in every field, and they only have a limited amount of space to represent new scientific discoveries. A 15-second sound bite might not be enough to explain all the nuances, and the public should rely on long-form journalism to give a more accurate picture, instead of the morning news roundup.
Something else that makes portraying scientific results accurately difficult is the statistical idea of certainty. Most studies are held with 95 percent certainty, which sounds pretty good. However, that five percent can cause problems. If you do 20 studies on the same problem, and each study is done at 95 percent certainty, then one study (one-twentieth, or 5 percent) will generally report faulty results.
In a field like climate science, there are enough studies being done that some are showing that there is no climate change. It is generally accepted in the scientific community that these results are part of the 5 percent, because there are many other studies. However, because news stories are usually about single studies, they often miss the larger picture, and do not cover the entire body of research that has been done on the topic. It is more interesting to report on a controversy or an outlier, even if it isn’t statistically significant.
Some of the issues of media portrayal of science also come from the media’s mission: Is it truth, or is it entertainment? If it is truth, then they have a responsibility to dig into the reasons why outlying studies might be mistaken, and to always report on new and exciting studies in the context of the past work that has been done in the field. 
However, most members felt that problems arise when the media’s goal shifts towards entertainment, which means results are exaggerated and given more weight than they may actually have.
One final topic revolved around the portrayal of scientists themselves, instead of their studies. In many cases, scientists are shown as a separate class who are unable to connect with regular people. Shows like The Big Bang Theory reinforce the idea that the scientists are all socially inept geniuses. 
It is true that teaching or communicating is a separate skill from actually doing science, and that some really great researchers are terrible professors. However, there are people who can do both, like Neil deGrasse Tyson. If the scientific community wants their image to improve and for science to be communicated more accurately, it is up to the community to make those changes.

Sometimes it is best to immediately address the elephant in the room: It’s cold outside.
Some public and private schools in Pittsburgh were closed on Friday not because of the potential snow accumulation, but because of the bitter cold. A rush of icy arctic air caused temperatures from the Eastern Seaboard through the Midwest to drop to record lows. Many U.S. cities experienced temperatures in the negative teens, including Pittsburgh. The frigid conditions have had many negative impacts, affecting everything from air travel to our desire to venture outside.
Meteorologists explain the most recent drop in temperatures this past week through the displacement of the polar vortex, a pocket of cold air that sits above the polar region.
The Earth contains two polar vortices, one at each pole, that are are defined as persistent circulations of cold, low-pressure air that strengthen in the winter and weaken in the summer. They generally exist in the middle to upper troposphere, the lowest atmospheric layer, and extend into the lower stratosphere, the second lowest atmospheric layer.
Meteorologists defined this phenomenon in the early 1850s, but the term “polar vortex” has only recently garnered significant attention. Its newfound familiarity, however, has led to some using the term incorrectly to describe all severe drops in temperature in the United States. Understanding a polar vortex can help explain how a polar vortex may contribute to some of the lower temperatures such as the drop we all recently experienced.
The northern and southern polar vortices are slightly different; the air in the north generally circulates in a counter-clockwise fashion, while the air in the south rotates clockwise. 
In addition, the southern polar vortex is larger and more powerful than its northern counterpart. The presence of more landmasses and a larger land-sea contrast in the north results in large-scale waves that move upward from the troposphere to the stratosphere, erode the vortex, and increase its internal temperature.
The northern polar vortex is circled by a strong west to east jet stream referred to as the polar night jet. This jet stream separates the polar region from the midlatitudes, acting as a barrier that keeps the polar vortex from shifting downwards. Occasionally, unstable planetary waves in the early winter can cause the polar air to break the barrier and mix with the midlatitudes, causing cooling.
Conversely, the current cooling phenomenon is due to the natural warming cycle of the polar vortex that leads to its eventual breakup. As the earth begins its transition from winter to spring, the first warming period occurs between late February to mid-March. 
This warming causes a piece of the polar vortex to break-off, displace the polar night jet, and plunge into Canada and a large portion of the United States.
This, however, is not a very common event for several reasons. First, it is not very likely for cold air to push past a powerful jet stream. Second, the chuck of the vortex that splits off must be large enough to cover a wide portion of land in order for us to see effects in the Northeastern United States. The occurrence of both of these factors is considered an anomaly of stratospheric circulation.
Research is currently ongoing to explore whether global warming may play a role in an increased frequency of polar bursts into the midlatitudes. A rise in the earth’s temperature is already known to produce anomalies such as the distortion of the jet stream, which allows the polar vortex to escape. Current scientific observations regarding this phenomenon are considered short-term, starting only 13 years ago. In order to make confident conclusions, scientists need several decades of data to distinguish between natural variability and climate trends.
The polar vortex is an intriguing concept for climatologists, not due to its potential to deliver us cold air, but because its presence can have a negative effect on the ozone layer. The ozone layer is found in the stratosphere and plays a large role in shielding us from potentially harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. As temperatures drop in the polar vortex, polar stratospheric clouds form. Chemical reactions on these clouds due to the presence of of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) release chlorine that can rapidly destroy ozone.
Over the past several years, the polar vortex has made itself more relevant and moved beyond purely scientific importance by sneaking into the midlatitudes and impacting the public’s way of life in the Northeastern United States.

Dogs understand and respond to facial expressions
Cognitive scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna have shown that dogs can distinguish between happy and angry human faces. This is the first study to date that credibly demonstrates a dog’s ability to differentiate human expressions, and the results of this study will be published in Current Biology.
Photos of happy and angry women’s faces were presented on a touch screen to 20 dogs. Some of the dogs had been trained to touch the happy faces, while others were trained to touch the angry faces. To ensure that the dogs were making their decisions based on facial expressions and not obvious features, such as teeth or frown lines, the images were split in half during the training phase so that the dogs only saw either the bottom half or the top half of a face at once. 
Interestingly, the dogs trained to recognize happy faces were able to learn more quickly than the dogs trained to recognize angry faces.

User names found to be the secret to online dating
Sameer Chaudhry, an internist at the University of North Texas, and Khalid Khan, professor of women’s health and clinical epidemiology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, conducted a study regarding the factors that garner success in the world of online dating. By poring through 86 studies on the relationship between computer-mediated interactions and in-person dates, Chaudhry and Khan discovered that the key to online dating is picking the right user name. Chaudhry and Kahn have concluded that men are attracted to usernames related to physical traits, such as “Cutie,” and women are attracted to usernames that suggest intelligence, such as “Cultured.” They also found that all users respond positively to playful names, such as “Fun2bwith,” and precedence goes to names that begin with the first half of the alphabet. These findings have been published in the journal Evidence Based Medicine.

Munchies from marijuana stem from neuroscience
Scientists at Yale University have uncovered the science behind why marijuana users have food cravings. The researchers focused on molecules called receptors that bind to cannabinoids, the active ingredient in marijuana. They were expecting to find that, after binding to cannabinoids, the receptors would send out a signal to subdue appetite-suppressing neurons. Instead, in an experiment conducted on mice, they found that the receptors actually increased the activity of these neurons. The appetite-suppressing neurons began to emit different kinds of neurochemicals that promote appetite instead, thereby causing the munchies. In other words, marijuana reverses the function of the appetite-suppressing part of the brain.
This study has medical applications as well, such as increasing appetite in cancer patients or patients with other illnesses that cause the patient to lose their appetite.

U.S. approves new genetically modified apples
Despite criticism from opponents of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recently approved two genetically engineered apple varieties. These apples, which were developed by the Canadian company Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc., will be marketed as Arctic Granny and Arctic Golden and were designed to resist browning. These apples will become available to the public in 2016 in small quantities, although it will be several years before they become widely distributed.
Meanwhile, groups such as the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) are pressuring food companies not to sell the fruit. Although Okanagan claims the apples have been rigorously tested, the OCA is still skeptical about their effects on humans as well as ecosystems. The OCA also believes that genetic manipulation will allow for more pesticide treatment than normal.

Scientists create drug as possible vaccine for HIV
Scientists from the Jupiter, Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) recently announced the creation of a new drug candidate that could be used as an HIV vaccine. While the HIV usually fuses with the CD4 lymphocyte, an important cell in the immune system, the novel drug candidate developed at TSRI binds to two sites on the surface of the HIV, preventing it from entering a host cell. 
The drug has potential as a vaccine namely due to its universiality. The drug was shown to be effective against every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) that has been isolated from humans and rhesus macaques, a species of monkey. The drug also appears to work for at least eight months after injection.
The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, and the study was published last Wednesday in the journal Nature.

Telescopic contact lenses improve modern ocular care
Swedish optics researchers recently presented a new type of contact lens at the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual meeting. 
These novel contact lenses have the capability to zoom in on objects, magnifying them up to 2.8 times. The lenses are paired with electronic glasses that respond to winks from the user. Winking one eye causes a polarized filter in the glasses to direct light into the zooming section of the contact lens; winking the other eye causes light to pass through regularly, returning vision back to normal. Eye irritation is reduced by air channels that allow oxygen to reach the underside of the contact lens. 
These contacts lenses have the potential to help patients with macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness and visual impairment from old age. These contacts have currently only been tested on mechanical models.

Lorrie Cranor, computer science and engineering and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, led a seminar hosted by Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institution on the study of password security on Feb. 11. 
This past January, the national health insurance company Anthem noticed that their cyber systems had been breached, and that the security of over 80 million records ranging from the names of customers to their social security numbers had been compromised. In this digital age, where virtual information can be unlocked with a simple password consisting of numbers, alphabetical characters, and occasional symbols, cyber attacks are very dangerous for anyone who has ever used an internet service.
Companies that hold critical information about their clients depend on some form of password protection for their databases. Although their security systems may not simply be a line of characters, the idea of passwords exists in every database to protect businesses. Personal information, including credit card and social security numbers, is often stolen due to cyber attacks. These hackers are able to implement effective cracking algorithms that allow them to make billions of guesses offline. The most obvious question that researchers in cyber security and privacy look to is the question of “How can we prevent cyber attacks?” But how exactly do these researchers find information about passwords since they are kept so hidden from the public? 
It turns out that pursuing research in the subject of passwords proves rather challenging and questionable. The fact that people are told to not disclose their passwords makes the study of them complicated. Most studies that ask for people to create passwords often receive superficial or questionable responses.
Cranor's research at Carnegie Mellon was able to bypass this obstacle by successfully producing a study on actual data sets of passwords. After negotiating for two years with Carnegie Mellon’s Information Security Office (ISO), her research team was able to access data from Student Information Online (SIO) indirectly, meaning over 25,000 personal and active passwords of faculty, staff, and students and over 17,000 deactivated passwords under Carnegie Mellon’s system contributed to Cranor’s study on passwords. However, in order to not violate ethical codes and the personal privacy of people, their research team developed a system that accesses this data in an atypical manner. 
The data set of passwords never actually reached the eyes of any researcher in Cranor’s department. Instead, a black box system consisting of analytic algorithms were installed into a locked up computer, isolated from both virtual and physical contact. This system was only audited by the Information Security Office (ISO) director who, after reviewing and gathering the necessary data, provided Cranor and her staff the findings on paper. Statistics on the vulnerability, otherwise known as the “guessability,” of passwords were derived from this study. For example, the findings showed that business majors created passwords 1.8 times weaker than computer science majors, and males made passwords 1.1 times stronger than females. With demographic data upheld in SIO’s database, many statistical facts can be easily accessed and contributed to this study. 
Cranor’s research team also approached this study with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (M-Turk) program, which gives researchers, developers, and businesses a scalable, on-demand workforce. By conducting a public survey involving specific conditions, their team found information on the strengths of different types of passwords. Essentially, participants of this survey were asked to come in, create a password, and answer survey questions about the passwords that they made. Specific conditions were given to participants, dictating how their passwords could be made. Some requirements included users making passwords sixteen characters long, a standard known as basic16, while some others were required to make a password stretching eight characters long with the inclusion of a special character and a number, known as comprehensive8. After the survey was conducted, the participant was asked to return two days later to recall their passwords and take another survey. 
The statistics derived from M-Turk resembled the statistics discovered from the SIO study, revealing that this method of data collection achieves similar levels of accuracy compared to actual password studies. Cranor’s involvement with M-Turk gathered information not only on the strengths of people’s passwords, but also their usability. The surveys cross-compared the usability and security of different password requirements, finding the most efficient and effective balance between the two. The results showed that basic16 and comprehensive8 balanced the two sectors well compared to the other conditions. From Cranor’s personal findings over the years and preference, however, she states that “12 character passwords with at least two character classes, no keyboard patterns, and some special characters not at the beginning or end” are ideal standards for maximizing security and minimizing discomfort. 
When Carnegie Mellon altered their password policies a few years ago, Cranor tuned her focus and research towards passwords. She leads research and teaches a course on “Usable Privacy and Security” opened to both undergraduate and graduate students. Although the study using Carnegie Mellon passwords is complete, Cranor continues to use M-Turk to conduct studies more focused on mobile devices and password strength misconceptions.

Before I left to study abroad in Paris for a semester, whenever I would tell someone about my plans, I would often receive a very similar reaction from everyone: “Don’t you know that the French hate Americans”?
This is perhaps the stereotype that frightened me the most before I arrived, as well as the one that, for me at least, has been disproved during my time here. The French do not hate Americans. What they hate is when you are rude, expect others to instantly speak English, and not lack self-control. Unfortunately, those are three things that Americans seem apt to do when they are in Paris. But avoiding French anger is easy — all you have to do are three things:
Greet each cashier, security guard, waiter, bartender, etc. with a smile and a “bonjour!” or “bonsoir!” and leave with a “Merci, au revoir!” Politeness is vital to how you are treated, and in general makes the world a better place.
Try to speak French. Use whatever French you have, even if that is just the ability to say that you do not speak French. Most people you encounter can, in fact, speak English, and are more than willing to if you ask, but they do not want to be forced to use it. Imagine if someone came into your workplace and instantly expected you to speak their language. I’m going to bet you would not be happy. So instead, make an effort, try something new, and show some respect to the country that you are visiting.
Control yourself. The French hate public intoxication, to the point where even a taxi will not take you home if you are very visibly inebriated. The French drink to enjoy themselves, not to get drunk. Perhaps Americans would be better off if they did the same.
These three rules have helped me through every situation I have been in since arriving in Paris, and surprisingly I have yet to encounter any genuinely rude French people. While other American students complained about how they could not get service at the bar (probably because they refused to speak French and yelled for the bartender), I sipped my drink that the waitress had happily suggested. When I accidentally swiped my Metro card twice and had to wait for eight minutes, a helpful older French woman showed me how to sneak in when she swiped her own card. And while I have had to deal with a definite language barrier, the only things necessary are a simple “bonjour” and some patience.
Though I have not been in this beautiful country and around Parisians for very long, I have learned that kindness is a universal language that can open any door, as long as you are willing to put yourself out there and try.

Have you ever been mindlessly scrolling through pages and pages of food on Pinterest when one dish jumps out at you? You pin it on your "omg yummy" board and definitely plan to make it for that one party coming up in a few weeks. But a few weeks isn't soon enough. You need it. You literally need it right now. You can't stop thinking about it because it is the stuff of dreams, the nectar of the gods, the greatest good of all.
Maybe that's never happened to you, but it's a feeling I know all too well, and it happened when I found these gooey cookie dough butter bars. Yes. Gooey butter. And cookie dough. Baked together into a tasty dream bar, and with a generous dusting of powdered sugar on top. It's got all the buzzwords.
So maybe you just had your first midterm and it didn't really go well. You'd like to eat to forget. You should make these.
Or maybe you went to the EOC last week and scored an insane internship. You deserve a celebration. I recommend making these.
It's too cold. You need to start putting on more weight to stay warm. I am confident these will do the trick.
Or maybe you're just hungry and have great taste. Make them. No matter who you are, make them or I will find you and I will make them for you.
Cookie Dough Gooey Butter Bars
Base
1 box of yellow cake mix
½ cup of butter, melted
1 egg
Cookie Dough Layer
½ cup of butter, room temperature
1 cup of light brown sugar
2 tablespoons of milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla
½ teaspoon of salt
1 cup of flour
1 cup of chocolate chips
Gooey Butter Layer
8 ounces of cream cheese, room temperature
1 cup of light brown sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla
2 eggs
1½ cups of powdered sugar
I know there are a lot of ingredients, and there are going to be a lot of steps, but I promise it's easier than you think. So bear with me; it's completely worth it. 
Before you get started, line a 9-in.-by-13-in. baking pan with aluminum foil and spray it with nonstick spray. If you use a glass pan, heat the oven to 325, or 350 degrees Fahrenheit if you use a metal pan. Now comes the fun part. First, just mix together the melted butter, egg, and cake mix. If you happen to forget to melt the butter and wonder ­"what on earth is this sandy mess," which I definitely didn't do both times that I've made these, you can always throw the mixing bowl in the microwave to soften it all up. This stuff is super tasty, so do yourself a favor and lick the beaters. Using your hands and treating this mixture kind of like Play-Doh, press it down into an even layer on the bottom of the pan.
Next, for the cookie dough layer, mix the butter and brown sugar together. When they're all yummy and fluffy, add the milk and vanilla. Mix in the flour and salt, and finally stir in the chocolate chips. Play with Play-Doh again and press this layer on top of the base, but leave about a half inch on all sides. Also, definitely save a little spoonful for yourself.
And it's finally time for the gooey butter layer. Mix up the softened cream cheese and brown sugar. Add in the eggs and vanilla. Then mix in the powdered sugar. Pour that over the top of the cookie dough layer and bake it for 30 minutes.
When you pull it out of the oven, let it cool for about a half hour. In order for it to set the whole way, put it in the fridge for at least two hours. But if you choose not to wait, it won't be as pretty but it will still taste great. I wouldn't blame you.
To finish it all off, you've got to do sprinkle powdered sugar on the top. It only takes a little bit of effort, but it goes a long way toward making it prettier and tastier.
Finally, get a glass of milk, sit down with some friends (or Netflix) and try not to get drool on your shirt.

It isn’t common to see both philharmonic and choir billed on the same program, but visitors to Oakland’s Carnegie Music Hall had the rare treat of enjoying vocal and instrumental student talent on Thursday night. The addition of Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) music director Manfred Honeck as guest conductor — ultimately the biggest selling point for the event — sealed the deal on a crowd-drawing and star-studded evening.
Thanks to dogged advertising by the School of Music, the combination of choir and orchestra, and Honeck’s loyal Pittsburgh fan base, the hall was filled up to the second balcony, with available seating on the orchestra level scarce if existent at all. Community members older than Carnegie Mellon affiliates poured through the doors at the concert’s beginning, populating the seats with greying perms and combovers.
The evening began with a surprise announcement: The two pieces on the program were to be switched, Dvorák’s New World Symphony performed first rather than Mozart’s Requiem — a wise choice on the part of the program organizers. Though both works are well known and promised excellent execution by student performers, it isn’t unreasonable to think that if the Mozart was performed first, the audience might have thinned after intermission.
President Suresh took the stage next to introduce Honeck and expressed his appreciation of continued collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, citing the 25 PSO musicians currently mentoring Carnegie Mellon students. “We very much appreciate the partnership,” Suresh said.
Without a word, Honeck launched the Dvorák with a performance that immediately distinguished itself with crisp phrasing in the violins and unified, moving dynamics. Honeck took the famous second movement at a faster tempo than usual — unsettling, at first, but ultimately refreshing: No one could even remotely accuse the rendition of dragging. Meanwhile, master’s student in music performance Ian Woodworth established himself as star soloist of the night with enchanting renderings of classic passages on English horn.
Honeck proved himself an emotive and engaged leader of the orchestra, unafraid to crouch to the musicians’ level rather than conducting from above and afar. During the gentle prairie-reminiscent theme of the third movement, he fell into a kind of jovial, folksy, swaying dance, flicking his baton as if the musicians were wagonners rather than string and brass players.
While it generally met our expectations of excellence from the School of Music, the performance wasn’t perfect: There were more than a couple missteps, the most prominent from solo talent in the horn section. And the third movement came to a shaky, uncertain conclusion as an overzealous violinist played a wrong line.
Despite the rocky end to the third movement, the orchestra compensated in the fourth, shaking off the transition and entering blaring, stomping, and strong, with well-controlled crescendos building toward a confident finish. The piece ended thunderously in an explosion of timpani and brass.
While the Dvorák featured minimal adaptation or embellishment, the Mozart infused a number of new elements. Between sections, CBS sportscaster Verne Lundquist read an excerpt of a letter from Mozart to his father (a welcome and chilling addition that richened the performance) and passages from the Book of Revelation (interesting but a bit overdone). The Requiem also brought professional vocal talent to the stage: soprano Lianne Coble, mezzo-soprano Amanda Crider, bass Tom McNichols, and tenor Kyle Stegall — by far the best and most musically self-aware of the four.
The overabundance of professional talent brings into question why more students weren’t given the spotlight: Any vocal performance major would surely have jumped at the opportunity for a solo, and even the narrator’s role could have been filled by any of the gifted orators in the School of Drama. Here, the School of Music appeared to serve its own image more than the educational needs of its students. The professional element certainly seized more public attention for the concert, but seemed to deprive students of opportunities to learn and shine.
The student vocalists, however, didn’t waste their limelight. Despite occasional imbalance with the orchestra and a little over enunciation (the sharp repetition of “et lux perpetua” pierced the soundscape with every pointed consonant), the choir excelled with controlled dynamics and rehearsed technique. The end of the “Requiem aeternam” dropped to a beautiful pianissimo, while the “Dies irae” made a thundering, unhesitating entrance on the heels of a reading from the Book of Revelation. In “Confutatis,” the women’s voices hovered lovely and angelic above the din, while the men gained vigor over time.
The most famous and best performed section, “Lacrimosa,” was perhaps a little fast and stunted in its phrasing, but stylistic differences aside, it sounded impeccable.
After a high-energy, tumbling “Offertorium,” Honeck concluded by signaling a series of solemn, solitary, barely audible chimes, offering only a gentle open and close of his fingers as a gesture to the percussionist, reveling in the drama in silence. This silence didn’t last long, though, as Honeck lowered his arm and the audience erupted in standing cheers.

A TV program that has spawned three separate spin-off fake news TV programs is now desperately trying to save itself after Jon Stewart announced that he would be leaving his gig hosting of the program. His reasons for leaving the show after 16 years of manning the desk are related to his need for flexibility with his schedule. He has said that he needs to make more time for his family and that he wants to focus his efforts on his children for the next few years. He has explicitly said he is not retiring; he has been a producer for the show for a long time and he is likely staying on in that role. He is not the first host of the program and will not be the last, and Comedy Central is actively seeking a new host for the program. The network had to deal with a similar situation in the recent past after The Colbert Report ended when Stephen Colbert (an alum of The Daily Show) left to host the Late Show on CBS.
Many different contributors to The Daily Show have gone on to host their own shows that focused on the same, or similar, topics, such as Stephen Colbert, John Oliver (with HBO’s Last Week Tonight,) and now Larry Wilmore (with the new The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on Comedy Central). It is ironic that the show is looking to find a new host after losing two potential hosts (Oliver and Wimore) less than a year ago. Still, various outlets have been speculating on who might replace Jon Stewart. These possible replacements include many high-profile names in media as well as current contributors to the show and writers for other programs. 
Most outlets have focused on Jessica Williams as a possibility for hosting the show, but through a series of Tweets (@msjwilly), Williams denied that she would be hosting and said that at this point in time she was under-qualified for the job. Although some people are disappointed that she would not host the show, it is true that she is very young and could go for it later in her life. If The Daily Show were to hire her as host, she would be the youngest host of any late night television show, and she would be the only woman in the late night arena.
If Jon had left the show, Seth Meyers might have been the person I would have seen manning the desk; however, since he is the new host of Late Night at NBC it is safe to assume he will not be asked to host The Daily Show. Meyers is just getting used to hosting Late Night and will continue to adjust, just as Fallon did before him. I would have also been looking at past Weekend Update anchors since they have experience with the style of comedy and could bring in a new style for the show, but Jimmy Fallon is hosting The Tonight Show, Amy Poehler is finishing Parks & Recreation, and Tina Fey is busy with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, the new Netflix comedy she’s developing. The nature and complexity of The Daily Show calls for writers that are experienced with writing political comedy on a daily basis, a difficult task not everyone can handle. The team of writers for the show is not changing, so it should remain consistent with the new host, but the host does contribute to the format of the program and has the tough task of delivery.
With all the names being presented as possible hosts for the show, I think the possibility of having co-anchors or an interim host in order to assist with the transition process is very likely. One possibility is Brian Williams now that he has been suspended for six months from NBC. The idea of having an experienced and respected anchor of one of the highest rated news programs in the nation go to Comedy Central to host a satirical news program is unconventional and is not something that most people would think of. However, Brian Williams has been a guest on the show many times, is the only news anchor to ever host Saturday Night Live, has slow-jammed the news with Jimmy Fallon, and has been a guest for countless other TV sitcoms; he has all the qualities one would need for hosting the show and would be able to give Comedy Central the time it needs to find a more permanent host for the program.
The fact that a lot of the show’s staff could pull off the hosting gig is good and bad, because the main problem with them is that they don’t have the experience or the gravitas necessary to deliver the fake news properly. Still, having them co-anchor with Williams or split the time with him could give Comedy Central a better idea of who is the right person for the job since the network cannot simply let them develop into it over time. Having to replace two main programs in so little time has put the network on a very thin tightrope because they need to find a balance between giving a new person a chance, and keeping their ratings high in order to keep the shows alive. 
A similar thing happened at NBC twice in the last decade; both times they pushed their Late Night host into The Tonight Show and found a replacement for Late Night because the host promoted had already proven himself and they were not worried they would lose ratings. However, during that time the new Late Night host could experiment and find his way of hosting the program. Comedy Central’s predicament is that their Late Night counterpart (The Colbert Report) just got replaced and is in the process of transitioning to the Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, so they cannot afford to also lose The Daily Show audience and the show's rating as one of the highest rated programs for the timeslot. This leaves Comedy Central with big shoes to fill and no clear-cut option for replacing Jon Stewart.

I'm studying abroad in Spain this semester, so I'm trying to take it easy with my relentless TV obsession. I tell you this because Agent Carter is one of the two shows from back home that I'm still following, and I'm sticking with it because it's that good.
“SNAFU,” the penultimate episode of Agent Carter's eight-episode first season, aired on Tuesday this week. The episode deals with the consequences of Agent Peggy Carter's (Hayley Atwell) arrest by her colleagues at the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) for aiding and abetting the wanted criminal Howard Stark. Carter realizes that Dr. Ivchenko, a supposed witness, is actually working for the villains, and convinces her co-workers to let her help them. The show builds up a slow, pervasive sense of dread, and then delivers on that buildup with Captain Dooley's choice to sacrifice his own life to save everyone else in the SSR office from a bomb. A few examples of the pure-gold dialogue in this episode:
Carter to her SSR coworkers, on how she could possibly be handling such delicate situations on her own: “I conducted my own investigation because no one listens to me. I got away with it because no one looks at me. Because unless I have your reports, your coffee, or your lunch, I am invisible.” This was a succinct, on-the-nose example of how Agent Carter calls out the sexism of its era — in an awesome mic-drop moment, too.
Peggy on hiding Steve's blood: “I suppose I wanted a second chance at keeping him safe.” Just a note here: I am far, far more emotionally invested in Carter's loss of Steve and her grief for him than I ever was in their actual relationship. In the Captain America movie, there was hardly any depth or emotional nuance in their relationship. But Agent Carter the television show plays it much more subtly, which makes it much more emotionally powerful. Though the show can be a trifle heavy-handed with the “everyone misses Steve” trope, when the writers keep it delicate, like they do with this line, it's gorgeously awful: “We're still attached to a table.”
I loved this episode. Hell, I love this show. It's got so many things that are right up my alley, stylistically speaking: a cool-headed, kick-ass heroine, a late ‘40s visual aesthetic, campy science fiction, and melodramatic villains. Atwell sells Carter as a smart, tough lady who refuses to take anything lying down, and James D'Arcy is hilarious as Mr. Jarvis, who is impeccably gracious and bitingly sardonic by turns. Bridget Regan as Dottie Underwood has both the take-no-prisoners attitude and the “who, me?” innocent eyes down cold. 
The show is fast, charming fun that never lags and I think that the 8-episode cap on the first season is a large reason for that precision in storytelling. It adroitly tackles the casual sexism of the era and calls it out, without ever making that the forefront of an episode.
My one major critique of the show is the overwhelmingly white cast. Agent Carter exhibits a major flaw of many historical (well, semi-historical, in this case) television programs, in that the show seems to forget that people of color existed back then, too. The show portrays the struggles faced by white women extremely well, and some of those issues — losing the hard-won autonomy and respect of the war years, for example — were absolutely felt by men and women of color just as much as white women. Agent Carter is uniquely poised to portray and discuss those experiences, and its writers should take that opportunity — all the more reason to hope for a second season!

This week, Carnegie Mellon’s Purnell School Of Drama continues performances of a The Wizard Of Oz adaptation known as The Wiz. Based on a book by William F. Brown, directed and choreographed by Tomé Cousin, with music and lyrics written by Charlie Smalls, the production is a high octane musical full of vibrant sets, rambunctious musical numbers and elaborately choreographed dances. Loud and brash on the surface, but with significant meaning underneath, this adaptation of a classic put forth by Carnegie Mellon’s School Of Drama makes for a rollicking good time and also leads to some pensive reflection.
The core story of Oz is one of the greatest ever told — a simple Kansas girl goes on a magical adventure through the land of Oz. With a kind heart, she makes friends and wins over the people of Oz, banishing evil in the process. Most importantly, she comes to learn that whatever she seeks cannot be given to her by an outsider, because it is already within her. It is nothing short of incredible that this idea carries so much weight, and resonates so universally more than a hundred years after The Wizard Of Oz was first written.
The big difference with The Wiz is the way that story is delivered to the audience. Saucy, colorful, and full of unbridled energy, The Wiz is a red-hot, white-knuckled journey through Oz that leaves the audience in wonder or in splits multiple times every minute.
The musical numbers are heavily influenced by R&B, funk and the Blues. With shuffling, tappable rhythms and big sing-along choruses, the music is designed to stay in your head long after the show is over. Some of the songs, such as “Brand New Day,” which comes after the defeat of the Wicked Witch Of The West, are huge and elaborate, with nearly the entire cast on stage singing and dancing at the same time. Others, such as “So You Wanted To Meet The Wizard,” are carried singlehandedly by the namesake character. The standout song, however, is “Be A Lion.” Sung by Dorothy and The Lion, the song is by far the most touching of the lot. This song is the first time Dorothy really blooms as a character; furthermore, one can really feel for The Lion’s plight.
The casting is spot on as well. Every character is more than sufficient, and a few stand out as truly brilliant. Senior musical theatre major Alexis Floyd makes for an incredible Dorothy. Playing an innocent rural girl with a heart of gold, Floyd successfully takes this sparse set of traits and builds a character that the audience comes to love. Senior musical theatre major Jean G. Floradin as The Lion is another great choice. Floradin is captivating in every scene he dominates, and ends up dominating most scenes he is in. It is The Wiz himself, however, played by senior musical theatre major Erron Crawford, that is the play’s proverbial ace in the hole. From his Act One scenes as his all powerful avatar to his Second Act unravelling, Erron is incredibly versatile, going from threatening to sermonizing, from being a hapless victim to a sleazy liar, through the course of the play.
All in all, The Wiz is what you’d expect when one of the finest drama schools in the country does an adaptation of one of the greatest stories of the modern era — mostly excellent, with tiny flaws here and there. Parts of Act One, such as those with Addaperle, The Good Witch Of The North, sometimes feel overdone. Act Two seems a little rushed. The Wicked Witch Of The West is vanquished within ten minutes of the show’s reconvening. That said, the show’s strengths handily outweigh its weaknesses and cumulatively make for a pleasant and enjoyable two hours.

The Maids is a one-act play with all the highbrow intellectualism, interpretative dancing, and incestuous undertones an unsuspecting theater-goer could ask for.
The first word that came to my mind upon entering the theater was “intimate.” The moderately-sized performance space, laid out like a lavish bedroom, was lit in soft purple and overhung with metallic arches. The most striking thing about the set was the tinfoil partially covering the arches and much of the bedroom furniture. The thin layer of silvery tinfoil over rusting metal and dull wood suggested to me a façade of glamorousness, peeling to reveal the corruption beneath.
The Maids is, after all, centered around the idea of false, assumed identity. Though I went into this production familiar with Jean Genet’s 1947 play about sister maids plotting to murder their employer, I can imagine the confusion of unacquainted audience members. The relationship between the sisters, Solange, played by junior acting major Cara Ronzetti, and Claire, played by senior acting major Cathryn Dylan, is difficult to pin down. It shifts rapidly from sisterly to maternal to sexual, keeping the audience constantly in a state of unease.
The performative nature of Solange and Claire’s relationship becomes most evident in their “Ceremony.” In this role-playing game, each in turn assumes the role of the dominant “Madame” and the submissive “Claire,” the former prancing around in their mistress’s best gown and abusing the other in a way that can only be described as sadomasochistic. The culmination of the game — the final, quite literally sexual release at play’s end — shifts their power dynamics once more as “Claire” rises up and acts upon her homicidal urges toward “Madame.”
Both lead actresses shone in their dynamic roles, and junior acting major Caroline Pluta was a breath of fresh air as the self-absorbed but well-intentioned Madame. Solange showed off her fantastic range during Solange’s final monologue. For the five-minute-long speech, during which a mentally-unhinged Solange addresses a variety of characters in a variety of roles, Solange was the car crash the audience simply could not look away from.
As suggested by the role playing at the core of its plot, The Maids tackles a host of complicated issues including identity, sexuality, gender, and class, and how they are all essentially “performed” in society. Essentially, this play is so ripe for analysis that it’s a Sparknotes dream come true.
The audience is introduced to the play’s multitude of themes when the two main actresses dawdle onstage in their underthings, before donning their respective costumes and launching into performance. Prior to the first line being spoken, they perform a bizarre, blank-faced interpretative dance to the oppressive beat of The Velvet Underground. The meaning behind this interesting stylistic choice was unclear until the same dance sequence was performed upon the first entrance of Madame about midway through the play. It clicked all at once that the dance was a necessary step for each character — and actress — to assume their “roles.”
The Velvet Underground music that played throughout (most notably “I’ll Be Your Mirror”) was one facet of the production’s intriguing blend of time periods. The juxtaposition of decades was also suggested by the program, which featured fictionalized correspondence between Andy Warhol and Genet dated 1969. While Madame’s smart blue suit and coiffed up-do is true to the play’s year of setting and to her stature, the maids sport ’60s bobs and bangs that only serve to highlight the separation between them and Madame.
The Maids is an ambitious play that is perhaps literary to a fault, but nevertheless this production of it was undoubtedly skillful. You may leave the theater uncomfortable and a little bit confused by the substance of this play, but you will leave without a doubt entranced in the artistry of those who brought it to life.

The Phantom of the Opera, currently being performed at the Benedum Center, is a fantastic production. It's a part of PNC Broadway Across America and certainly lived up to the glitz and talent the Broadway label would suggest. The Phantom of the Opera first opened in 1986 and still continues to be shown on and off-Broadway today. It is the longest running musical on Broadway, with over 10,000 total shows.
The musical is centered around a Phantom who is haunting an opera house in late 19th century France. He has such deep love for a woman named Christine that he begins to control all the shows and productions being performed by this opera house in order to give Christine an opportunity to sing in the spotlight. His love becomes possessive of her and frightens all those who visit the opera house. The climax of the first act occurs with the famous chandelier fall, which is the Phantom’s response to Christine not starring in a show. The second act features a duel between the Phantom and Christine’s long-time friend and fiancé, Raoul. In the end, Christine shows the Phantom affection through a passionate kiss that takes place in his dungeon below the Opera house. It is this kiss and her gift of the engagement ring from Raoul that make the Phantom realize what a monster he has become and inspire him to turn himself in, though he disappears when the authorities come to arrest him. Christine and Raoul escape to live happily ever after.
The music of The Phantom of the Opera is incredibly beautiful and needs very strong, powerful voices to give the music the execution it deserves. Chris Mann, who plays the Phantom, and Katie Travis, playing Christine, had perfect voices for the parts. Chris Mann's vocal chops have been widely lauded, as he gained his initial claim to fame through NBC’s The Voice. He graduated from Vanderbilt University with a Vocal Performance degree and has always dreamed of being in the role of the Phantom. His voice will send shivers up your spine. Katie Travis has spent much of her life on the stage. She recently played Cosette in a national tour of Les Misérables Like Chris, she has always wanted to be Christine in The Phantom of the Opera. Her voice has such purity and grace that it was impossible not to fall in love with the music she sings.
The Phantom of the Opera has several scenes where impressive special effects are needed in order to communicate the terrifying extent of the Phantom's anger and emotional angst. In past productions, the Benedum has not been known for its special effects. However this show really demonstrated the Benedum's crew and production designers' ability to implement an awe-inspiring special effect-filled production. For instance, the chandelier drop was completely believable, as was the fire the caused by the Phantom throughout the musical. It was done on stage in a beautiful and captivating way. The Benedum also had speakers spread throughout the audience to make sure that the Phantom’s powerful voice surrounded everyone in the crowd.
The Phantom of the Opera was a very enjoyable and striking production in downtown Pittsburgh. The classic story, beautiful music, and lifelike special effects made for a wonderful show. The musical will be at The Benedum Center until March 1.

Above and Beyond, the famous Trance trio composed of Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness, and Paavo Siljamäki, have always made music in a bubble of their own. From the genre’s humble subcultural beginnings in the early 2000s to the massive raves of today, Above and Beyond has always been somewhat left of center. They’ve written and recorded on their own terms, unaffected by the larger industry trends.
In a sense, Above and Beyond has come to symbolize the anti-EDM group. Intricate, lush melodies blend perfectly into one another. Vocals and lyrics aren’t tacked on at the end, rather they are the focal point of the entire creative process. Instead of massive buildups to stadium sized drops, their music has traditionally relied on subtler, smoother techniques to get people’s hands in the air. Paavo and Jono have often spoken about how they compose in a classical-acoustic setting before giving their songs an electronic backdrop, and this approach has served them well. Their 2006 debut album, Tri-State, is arguably the greatest Trance record of all time. Their second album, 2010’s Group Therapy, went on to to receive rave reviews as well.
Their newly released third album, We Are All We Need, follows a similar template to equally great, if somewhat predictable conclusions. Featuring the group’s signature blend of highly layered synth lines, silky smooth reverb-heavy vocals, classical touches and razor sharp production, it’s difficult to find fault with the album. Guest vocalists and producers abound: Singing duties are divided between Alex Vargas, Zoë Johnston, and Richard Bedford. As for production, the supremely talented Andrew Bayer lends his own unique touch to several of the songs. As a whole, each guest spot ends up carrying a slightly different flavor, while cohesively fitting in with the group’s overall sound.
The album opens on a high note, with the simple piano and strings driven “Quieter is Louder.” Carried by a beautifully minimalist riff, the song lives up to its name and sets a precedent for a record that is built around the idea that “less is more.” Next up is the title track, and the first to be fronted by Zoë Johnston, “We Are All We Need.” She sings of love, finding solace from sorrow, and running away with her lover. As such, the song begins the narrative of a relationship that will go on to find its way into almost every song henceforth, from its birth to its highs and lows to its ultimate demise.
And so the music continues for the next fourteen tracks: gleaming and smooth on the surface, and yet not without substance underneath. One of the lowest points of the album is it’s most commercial track, “Blue Sky Action”, sung by Alex Vargas. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with the song, it feels bland and hastily put together when compared to the intricacy that permeates the rest of the record. That being said, this one song shouldn’t be a commentary on Alex Vargas, who does a spectacular job for the majority of the record. Of all his tracks, one that deserves special mention is “All Over The World.” His voice carries a delicacy, an indescribable vulnerability, that single handedly carries the song’s theme of a son losing his father.
The real standout song however, is “Fly To New York.” Sung by Zoë Johnston, this is one of the lesser promoted tracks that hasn’t received much attention online or on radio. A cozy and warm song, this isn’t going to be setting any dance floors on fire. That said, the song perfectly captures so many of the things that make Above & Beyond as good as they are. From Zoë’s spectacular, soaring vocals to the soft, pulsating beat, “Fly To New York” is the perfect song to pick you up and put a smile on your face and a spring in your step.
As a whole, We Are All We Need is far more hopeful than any previous Above & Beyond record, or really any previous Trance record. Euphoric and uplifting, the album is a celebration of a great group that is at its peak in a genre that has taken the musical world by storm over the past few years. Above & Beyond play to their strengths in the album, allowing the guests on the record to bring in the requisite diversity to their sound. All in all, while We Are All We Need is nothing new, its sheer quality puts it above reproach and makes for a thoroughly enjoyable, if somewhat unsurprising, listening experience.

Dear Evan,
I love Idris Elba more than any other actor ever. He’s just been getting more and more attention for his work recently, and Luther has got to be one of the best, most intense series of all time.
There’s been a lot of hype for a while now about who the next James Bond is going to be, and Idris is number one on a lot of people’s list to take over that timeless role — myself included, of course. He’s just too perfect for it: buff, tall, menacing but also suave, gorgeous, and English. Plus, it would be so great to have a black James Bond. And Pierce Brosnan thinks Idris would be a great Bond!
What do you think the chances are of Idris getting the slot?
Expectantly,
Can’t Let Anyone Steal his Show, Yelling For Action, Need to Get Idris Running Lengths (of trains)
Dear CLASSY FANGIRL,
You’re not the only one: Since at least 2011, nearly everyone who cares about the Bond franchise wants Idrissa Akuna “Idris” Elba — best known as the star corrupt cop on Luther, the savvy drug kingpin on The Wire, and Nelson Mandela in that biopic no one saw — to be the next beloved 007. Heck, even Sony wants him, if Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal’s leaked emails from the notorious hack are any indication (which, I mean, how much more clear can you be?) 
Naysayers do exist, however. Idris is black, and Rush Limbaugh doesn’t seem to like that, but he doesn’t appear to like anything that might dent the white patriarchy — well, really, he doesn’t seem to like much of anything or anyone with post-Civil War ideologies. Esquire gave Idris a snub, too, when their list of possible new Bond actors saw him conspicuously excluded.
Well, Esquire, you can take back your Christian Bale and Jon Hamm (not even remotely European, Esquire! Get it together). All we want is Idris.
That said, TJ Ramini would make a great Bond as well, but no one knows who he is — he had a brief role as “Crane Thug No. 1” in Batman Begins, so I guess that’s a start.
You have good taste,
Evan Kahn

These are the times in life when it’s all right to hate the Harry Potter franchise. If it hadn’t been for the successful division of the last installment, then there wouldn’t be these other Hollywood franchises following suit and failing. First there was the Twilight franchise, now the Hunger Games, and the Divergent series has yet to come. So I'm going to be honest: it was completely unnecessary in Twilight, and the same goes for The Hunger Games' third installment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1. This movie just serves as a prolonged lead up to the final installment. It follows Katniss Everdeen (my queen, Jennifer Lawrence) as she prepares to rebel against The Capitol. Because it is only half of the third book, it lacks plot and their signature action sequences. So if you just want to stare at beautiful people that don’t really do much for a couple hours, then this movie is for you. But just be warned, this is an “adventure” movie with very little adventure.

On a campus widely considered to be apolitical, a Student Senate initiative sought to start politically charged conversation and disagreement with the first iteration of Pizza + Politics on Wednesday.
The event, which garnered 177 responses out of nearly 1,300 invites on Facebook, filled two-thirds of the roundtables in Rangos 3, with each table designated a student or faculty facilitator to engage and mediate participant discussion with guided questions, and a box of pizza.
Facilitators included adjunct professor Mary Jo Miller, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Renee Camerlengo, junior chemical engineering major Michael Wesley Booker II, junior history major Ashley Sobhani, junior psychology and French double major Siriana Abboud, Senate Chair and junior information systems major Evan Wineland, senior global studies major Julia Constantine, Assistant Director of Student Life David Chickering, Coordinator of Gender Programs and Sexual Violence Prevention Jess Klein, adjunct professor Colin Clarke, and Teaching Professor of Political Science and International Relations Silvia Borzutzky.
The topic of the event was “The Right to be Offensive: What can we take away from Charlie Hebdo and The Interview?” and discussion launched right away and lasted the full hour, with each table taking a different track in group conversation.
Students pondered Sony’s The Interview as an example of free speech and North Korea’s response as a threat to that expression.
“These regimes survive on keeping tight control on their image,” said junior economics and statistics major Guillermo Marce-Santurio. “This movie makes them seem weak.”
Conversation also focused on the attack at Charlie Hebdo. Facilitator Abboud posed the question, when making an incendiary statement, “Do I have a responsibility to the safety of the people around me?”
Junior mechanical engineering major Paul Kioko echoed Abboud’s question: “Before you say something, are you thinking about possible reactions?”
Toward the end of discussion, facilitators shifted conversation toward expression on campus: Should college students enjoy the same rights on campus as the rest of America?
“This is a private institution, and when I agreed to come to CMU, I agreed to follow the rules they have,” Marce-Santurio said.
“Being in society has an inherent loss of rights to it,” said junior business major Hodei García. “I will give up my right to kill you so you don’t kill me.”
According to Wineland, who spearheaded the event, Pizza + Politics is a response to Herbert Simon’s concept of “poverty of attention,” by which an overabundance of external stimuli causes people to tune out important global events.
“There is a culture of apathy on campus,” Wineland said. But beyond tackling political inattention, Wineland said the program is also an attempt to foster connections between Senate and the student body.
“We’ve always sought to engage with students,” Wineland said, comparing Pizza + Politics to past town hall meetings, which he said were not as well received. About achieving this level of engagement, Wineland said, “It doesn’t have to be that complicated. It can be simple — as simple as a conversation.”
“We were all excited and we got the word out,” said junior computer science major and School of Computer Science senator Gail Wilson, who attended and helped organize the event. “We got great facilitators.”
“I thought it was encouraging,” Wilson said. “I learned a lot from it.”

Bill Moushey was once a reporter who just covered bad guys.
“For the first 20 years of my career, I basically put people in jail,” he said.
His work as a reporter includes covering the first impeachment of former sitting Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Rolf Larsen and the conviction of former Pittsburgh City Council president, among other notable investigations detailing organized crime. During his time working as an investigative reporter with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, he noticed the injustice present within the justice system.
“I started seeing horrible things happen to people of color, people in poverty, and those who could not receive adequate legal representation,” he said. “They would just get gobbled up by the federal government.”
Today, Moushey aims to bring Point Park University’s Innocence Institute, which he founded in 2001 to help those wrongfully convicted in western Pennsylvania, to Carnegie Mellon. Last Monday in Baker Hall’s Giant Eagle Auditorium, Moushey talked about his work with the institute and his plans for its future.
Working as investigative journalists at Point Park, Moushey and his students have been responsible for freeing 17 wrongly convicted individuals in 10 years.
Both a nonprofit investigative journalism program and a university curriculum at Point Park, the Innocence Institute’s approach has two primary focuses: the students and social injustice. The institute’s objective is to aid students in navigating the ropes of the criminal justice system while simultaneously making a social difference.
“There is no constituency for people who are wrongfully convicted,” Moushey said. “Nobody wants to hear them.”
Since its inception 14 years ago, the Innocence Institute and its journalists have received numerous awards including regional and national awards, from the National Society of Professional Journalists.
Before founding the institute, Moushey used his observations of the justice system led him to publish in the Post-Gazette the investigative series Protected Witnesses, which examines the misconduct involved with the federal witness protection program, and Win at All Costs, hard-hitting documentation of overzealous officials breaking the law in their efforts to enforce it.
At Carnegie Mellon, Moushey spoke of past cases and his vision of establishing a multidisciplinary Innocence Institute at Carnegie Mellon.
“At CMU, we would be on the forefront of advances that change the way wrongly convicted cases are viewed,” Moushey said.
He encouraged the involvement of students from all fields.
“This is without a doubt the best experience that [Point Park] ever offered. No classes even come close to the Innocence Institute,” said senior Point Park mass communications major Kaitlyn Castelli, who has worked closely with Moushey and the Innocence Institute since her first year of college.
A native of Canton, Ohio and an expert on crime and punishment issues, Moushey is a nationally recognized journalist who earned his bachelor of arts in journalism from Kent State University and his master’s of science in criminal justice administration from Point Park. Moushey is a recipient of the 1997 National Press Club’s Freedom of Information Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1997 for his expose of an out-of-control federal witness protection program.
For Moushey, the years of effort pay off the moment when the wrongfully convicted walk out of prison.
During his talk, he narrated an experience in which his client, after being released, looked him in the eye and said, “You guys are my heroes.”

On Thursday morning, ex-Carnegie Mellon student Daniel Jorge was arrested on invasion of privacy charges for allegedly taking photos and videos of fellow Morewood E-Tower residents in the shower and bathrooms.
Jorge, who was a live-in mentor on the sixth floor of the first-year dormitory, was expelled last semester after students accused him of holding his cell phone above the showers they occupied. The first accusations came in early September, according to WPXI.com.
At the beginning of this semester, residents on the sixth floor of E-Tower received an email from their resident assistant saying that “this [floor meeting] was not just a typical start of semester floor meeting. In last nights [sic] meeting we talked about a very serious incident that occurred last semester on our floor.”
According to the email, the floor meeting addressed the incident. Students were then handed a letter which explained the timeline of the incident investigation.
University police opened an investigation after the accusations were made, according to the letter. Jorge’s access to Morewood E-Tower was revoked the day he admitted to the crime. He was permanently removed from campus the day after and will not be returning.
University police then enlisted the help of forensics specialists at the Pennsylvania State Police crime lab. The specialists analyzed data from electronic devices confiscated from Jorge. The analysis revealed videos of eleven men.
“Among these, three videos include partial or full images from the neck up that positioned University Police and Student Life to successfully identify three of the men whose images were captured on video,” the letter says. “The remaining eight video clips include images of torsos, waists, legs, and/or feet that do not enable the viewer to ascertain the identity of the person in the video.”
The letter ends with a statement assuring residents that there is no evidence that the videos and images were shared online and encourages residents to seek out help from their resident assistant, community adviser, housefellow, Associate Dean of Student Affairs John Hannon, Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Coordinator of Sexual Violence Prevention Jess Klein.
The university released a media statement on Thursday afternoon, once the arrest was made public, but most university affiliates have declined to comment, redirecting inquiries to media relations staff or to Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno.
“In our media statement, we were clear that for any of the individuals impacted by this incident, we have offered the support of the student life staff and the university staff,” Casalegno said in an interview with The Tartan. “We’ve advised the individual victims of their rights to the criminal process and ensured that they have the knowledge and information necessary to make decisions for themselves about what they wish to do.”
Casalegno also explained why a campuswide email was not sent out about this incident: “Cases [with] forensic evidence take time.... We were aware of a concern, investigation was promptly initiated, the individual involved was identified, immediately thereafter left campus, and from my vantage point at that point, investigation is important to be ongoing so we can bring the matter to resolution. But the impact or potential risk to campus was immediately mitigated.”
As for general campus communications, Casalegno said not to expect a campus-wide email regarding the situation.
“We don’t routinely send campuswide emails about any matter that involves the confidential student record, and this situation involves more than one of those records. This situation is one that involves protecting the privacy of individuals, which is our utmost concern. If it relates to anything that involves the safety of our community — if we believe that there is any reason the safety of our community could be compromised — then we will send a campuswide message,” she said. “In a case like this one, because of the immediacy of the former student’s departure from campus, there wasn’t a threat to the community. There wasn’t a situation that we were concerned put anybody at risk.”
Casalegno said that on Thursday morning when the story broke, her office had communicated with the residents of E-Tower to make sure that they knew that they had a choice to make regarding whether or not to speak to the media, stressing that the dormitory is a private building that the media may not enter.
The university was not aware that Jorge was turning himself in to the Pennsylvania State Police or would be arrested on Thursday, and they currently have no insight into how the details of the arrest and incident were obtained by the press, according to Casalegno.
Jorge is slated for trial on March 5.

Carnegie Mellon joined the likes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Johns Hopkins University last Monday when about 800 applicants to the school’s master’s in computer science program were informed via email that they had been accepted, only to find out seven hours later in another email that the acceptances were a mistake.
Monday afternoon, many applicants received an email with “CMU Admissions Decision” in the subject line that told them, “Congratulations on your acceptance into the Master of Science program in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. You are one of the select few, less than 9% of the more than 1200 applicants, that we are inviting. We’re convinced this is the right place for you. Welcome to Carnegie Mellon!”
The email continues with a list of “bragging points” that applicants could take advantage of, such as Carnegie Mellon’s number one ranking in the field of computer science by U.S. News & World Report.
Seven hours later, applicants received a second email: “Earlier this morning, we mistakenly sent you an offer of admission to Carnegie Mellon’s MS in CS program. This was an error on our part. While we certainly appreciate your interest in our program, we regret that we are unable to offer you admission this year.” This email, sent by Frank Pfenning, president’s professor of computer science and department head, asked that recipients acknowledged that they got the second email.
Some mistakenly accepted applicants had already made plans in the seven hours between the two emails; Ben Leibowitz went out to dinner with his parents and called his relatives before he found out about the miscommunication.
“It was brutal. I didn’t get much sleep last night,” Leibowitz said to the Associated Press. “Now I have to clean up the mess. I’m calling all my relatives, I’m going, ‘I’m sorry it’s not happening.’ ”
In December, almost 300 applicants to Johns Hopkins University underwent a similar emotional rollercoaster when they were informed of their acceptance only to find out a few hours later that it was a mistake. MIT made a comprable mistake a year ago; a blog post from their Office of Admission blamed the mail delivery system that they use to email applicants.
Incidents like these go back years — in 2013, Fordham University falsely notified about 2,500 applicants that they had been accepted, and in 2012 the University of California, Los Angeles told almost 900 applicants the same.
According to a press release on the School of Computer Science’s website, Monday’s error “was the result of serious mistakes in our process for generating acceptance letters. Once the error was discovered, the university moved quickly to notify affected applicants.”
“We understand the disappointment created by this mistake, and deeply apologize to the applicants for this miscommunication,” the release continues, then going on to reassure applicants that no future mistakes take place. 
“We are currently reviewing our notification process to help ensure this does not happen in the future.”

The university recently announced two new faculty appointments: Farnam Jahanian as university provost, effective at the end of the academic year, and Steve Kloehn as vice president for marketing and communications, effective April 7.
Farnam Jahanian began his career at Carnegie Mellon last year as the vice president for research, where he, according to a campus-wide email sent out from university President Subra Suresh, “garnered uncommon praise internally and externally for his vision, work ethic, and passion for what Carnegie Mellon is and what we aspire to be.”
Before he came to Carnegie Mellon, Jahanian worked at the National Science Foundation Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), controlling a $900 million budget and leading research on cyber infrastructure. 
Prior to his work at the foundation, Jahanian was the Edward S. Davidson collegiate professor at the University of Michigan, where he served as chair for Computer Science and Engineering from 2007 to 2011, and as director of the Software Systems Laboratory from 1997 to 2000. 
Jahanian earned his master’s degree and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin.
Jahanian is replacing the Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz Distinguished Professor of Life Sciences and Interim Provost Nathan Urban.
“Nathan is a distinguished academic who has had success throughout his tenure at the university, and his taking on this role was a clear indication of his great dedication to this community,” Suresh wrote in his email.
Steve Kloehn comes to Carnegie Mellon from the University of Chicago, where he is associate vice president for news and public affairs. Before that, Kloehn was a writer, columnist, and editor for over 20 years the Chicago Tribune and at various newspapers in New England, Kloehn received his bachelor’s degree in English from Princeton University.
“Steve brings to this role extensive experience in spearheading strategic integrated communications and marketing campaigns that have led to raising national and global visibility,” President Suresh said in a university press release. “His reputation as a hands-on, innovative leader and communicator make him a perfect fit for this new role and CMU.”
The university created Kloehn’s position as part of the Strategic Plan; in an email last semester, Suresh called the search for a vice president for marketing and communications a “critical step toward enhancing our reputation nationally and globally to match our extraordinary achievements.”
“CMU has a long history of innovation that changes lives and enriches the world,” Kloehn said in a university press release. 
“As a communicator, I am excited to have the opportunity to tell the CMU story. I look forward to working in partnership with CMU’s scholars, students and alumni around the globe to shine a light on their outstanding and far-reaching work. I am honored, too, to join CMU’s outstanding leadership team and its talented staff.”

** American Heart Association gives CMU grant**
The American Heart Association has given a grant to the department of biomedical engineering to found a program in which undergraduate students will be trained to apply their knowledge of the field to developing technologies for clinical cardiovascular medicine.
Many of the existing cardiovascular programs are at schools with medical schools. The Carnegie Mellon program will focus on the application of engineering and technology to this field.
“The hope is that this initial experience will lead students on a career path in biomedical engineering,” said Keith Cook, associate professor of biomedical engineering who is co-leading the initiative, in a university press release. “Our biomedical engineering department has a very strong core in cardiovascular research, so we sensed an opportunity with this program.”
The program will start in May. Students will then spend ten weeks working with Carnegie Mellon faculty on a project that applies biomedical engineering to cardiovascular research, in addition to shadowing clinicians at Allegheny General Hospital for one day every two weeks.
Director of the cardiovascular MRI program at Allegheny General Hospital Robert Biederman said in the press release, “Many of our young students that spend the summer with us go on to medical school and become independent clinicians trained with unique understandings of how to perform and interpret medical research.”
“In order for students to be effective researchers in this area, the students should understand cardiovascular medicine in general,” Cook added. “It is important that they see the application of clinical cardiovascular medicine, from imaging or catheter-based diagnosis to pharmacological or surgical treatment.”
UN gives honorable mention to ETC game
A game developed by students at the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) has received an honorable mention by the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations PEACEapp competition.
The game, titled, Triangle of Life, was developed for children who have experienced trauma. Students developed the game while paired with doctors from the Allegheny Health Network who were looking for new ways for children to understand Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT).
The doctors “were very interested in seeing if there was something the students could do to help with one particular area — the triangle of thoughts, feelings and behaviors that children have a difficult time with,” said Scott Stevens, a professor at the ETC and one of the project’s advisors. “All they had were pieces of paper with a diagram. They wanted something that was more impactful.”
The game involves a character named Lion, who tries to figure out why other animals are discontent. “You have to jump from platform to platform and categorize ideas as thoughts, feelings or behaviors to unlock access to additional platforms until you are eventually able to reach the exit and solve a story-relevant TF-CBT question to complete the level,” said lead programmer and game designer Eric Chang of the gameplay.
The team that developed the game met weekly with the developers of TF-CBT, doctors Anthony Mannarino and Judith Cohen.
“Working with the team from the Entertainment Technology Center was a terrific experience for us,” Cohen said in the release. “We were impressed with their interdisciplinary talents and how quickly they meshed together as a team. The African jungle theme was wonderful. When I first saw the prototype for the Lion character, I thought, ‘Kids are going to love this!’ The game does a great job of helping children learn how to use cognitive processing.”
Triangle of Life is expected to be released on multiple platforms in March.

Each year, the Career and Professional Development Center at Carnegie Mellon collects information about post-graduation salaries and job destinations for students. Students graduating in 2014 with a Master of Science in Computer Science went to a number of prominent companies, including Amazon, Dropbox, and Google. They ended up highly concentrated in western states such as California, Nevada, and Hawaii. In light of School of Computer Science’s mistake in sending out approximately 800 false acceptances, below is a breakdown of graduates from the master’s program:
$125,000: The maximum starting salary received by a student that earned a master of science in computer science.
$80,000: The minimum salary received by a student that earned a master of science in computer science. 
$101,833: The average salary received by students upon graduation from the master's program.
67%: The percentage of students who settled in the west after graduating from the program.
$100,000: The median salary received by students graduating with a bachelor of science from the School of Computer Science.

Special allocation: The Frame gallery 
Senate voted to allocate $2,760 to The Frame gallery, the only student-run art gallery on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. 
The Frame gallery is trying to become more of a focal point for campus discussion, and will use the money to have Facilities Management Services refurbish their wooden floors.
JFC Presentation: Student payment with student activity fee funds 
The Joint Funding Committee presented to Senate on how the student activity fee is used. Senate receives 10 percent of the money from the undergraduate student activities fee, while the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) gets 70 percent of graduate student activities fees.
The discussion in Senate focused on whether or not student organizations could pay student salaries with JFC-allocated funds originally from the student activities fee. The JFC must now approve salaries paid by student organizations from JFC fees.
Benchmarking Committee report 
The Benchmarking Committee gave a report on the student government situation at some of Carnegie Mellon’s peer institutions, including Cornell University, Princeton University, and Duke University. 
The committee discussed different facets of student government, including how student representatives at other universities communicate effectively with their constituents.
Ex officio report: Gina Casalegno and Amy Burkert 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert gave a presentation to Senate on the major focus areas in the university’s strategic plan. 
The university wants to provide a transformative Carnegie Mellon experience comprising transformative research and transformative teaching at both the graduate and undergraduate level.
There will be another university-wide town hall meeting on a date to be determined in March, Casalegno and Burkert said.

This week, the legislative committee on education in Oklahoma voted to ban Advanced Placement (AP) United States History. Since the College Board updated the curriculum for the course in the middle of 2014, Republican lawmaker and the bill’s sponsor Dan Fischer has claimed that the curriculum is too critical of America. His bill, in addition to the ban, proposes a new curriculum for American history courses in Oklahoma that aims to promote a more “patriotic” memory.
Fischer says that under the new AP curriculum, the emphasis is “on America as a nation of oppressors and exploiters,” and his proposal for a new educational framework promotes a more positive spin on American history. The proposal also mandates the inclusion of the Ten Commandments, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” three separate speeches by Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush’s speech immediately following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
According to the bill, any school not in compliance with the new curriculum during the 2014-2015 school year will not receive Oklahoma state funding for their programs. 
Many critics of the AP framework claim that it includes a liberal slant and denounce it for politicizing history. However, this counter-proposal is truly no better, as it undeniably has its own biases. Not only is there a conservative slant, but also a religious one.
Representative Fischer is a member of the Black Robe Regiment. This is a group of Americans named after ministers from the colonial era whose mission is to end the division between Church and State. The foundation of this belief goes back to pre-Revolutionary history. They claim that, at America’s conception, these two entities were fundamentally connected, and the activism of ministers helped Americans win independence when political efforts failed.
Therefore, since our nation’s existence is thanks to these ministers, the Church should regain the same influence it had during the Revolution. One of their missions, as stated on their web page, is “to provide educational materials for use in the Church and for the American Public to restore our American History and the History of the American Church, so as to restore what has been lost by way of deception and historical revision.”
Even though the Americans that fought for and won independence were religious people, they left England in order to escape religious oppression. They wanted independence from a monarchical government so that they could form a decentralized government with increased liberties.
The idea of American Exceptionalism is based heavily on our nation’s freedoms, guaranteed by our constitution. They are not just freedoms; they are rights that all American people are entitled to. Fan favorites include free speech, freedom to bear arms, freedom to a fair trial, and freedom from illegal search and seizure. But what about our First Amendment right to speak freely about our grievances against the government?
Being proud to be an American does not require us as citizens to pledge blind allegiance. It is possible to be patriotic and still have a critical understanding of what our history truly looks like. The AP U.S. History framework encourages students to look at the events that compose our full timeline from an objective perspective, allowing students to see what has worked for the nation and what has set us back. This is an investment in our political future. If students were to learn a whitewashed version of history that lacks the truth, they cannot be expected to grow up and become effective citizens. Their understanding of cause and effect in the context of history wouldn’t be realistic. 
The implication that this bill has for our freedom is tremendous. Because these lawmakers believe that being critical of America’s past is a bad thing, they’re effectively taking away students’ rights to speak openly about America. Historical revisionism is a tactic that has been used effectively by nations such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea, and Serbia. It’s a propaganda tactic that uses deception to essentially brainwash citizens into believing whatever version of history is most convenient to the ruling party.
What’s at risk here is much bigger than just education reform; it’s our free will. As Americans who support educational freedom, we need to stand up to legislation like this. It is our right to have access to history that is correct and will benefit us as critical thinkers, and it is my hope that this bill will not survive the legislative process.

Mars One, a non-profit organization founded in 2011, has pledged to create and populate a settlement on Mars. Mars One will launch crews of four settlers every two years starting in 2024, after a series of unmanned missions starting in 2018 intended to give the astronauts the supplies they need to found the colony. According to its website, Mars One started the search for colonizers in April 2013 and received over 200,000 applications in their first round.
We already know a lot about the Red Planet — there have been four robotic rovers successfully launched to Mars, most recently Curiosity. From this research, we know that Mars — the fourth planet from the sun — has a rocky surface covered mostly in iron oxide (rust) with an atmosphere almost completely made up of carbon dioxide. While these conditions cannot foster human life, or life of any kind, Mars One claims that current technology can support a colony on Mars.
The idea of a human colony on another planet is exciting and could present a major opportunity for the human race. However, it is also a prospect fraught with unknowns. The colonization process will be broadcast as a reality TV show, according to Mars One, raising a host of ethical dilemmas: Does this mission prioritize entertainment value over science and research? What if people die, a very real possibility in a foreign environment so hostile to human life?
While Mars One’s mission could have enormous value and unprecedented impact on the human race, the voyeurism inherent in using the mission as entertainment raises some qualms. 
Mars One should be cautious moving forward, and take care that the so-called “Mars One Hundred” — those selected to start the colony on Mars — are prepared for their journey and the many dangers intrinsic to it.

The first time I heard about ABC’s new show Fresh Off the Boat, I cringed.
For years, “fresh off the boat” has been used as a degrading term for Asians who don’t quite fit in with American culture. “Fresh off the boat” was something you would never want to be. When I heard about the new ABC sitcom I thought, “Great, another excuse for people to make Asian jokes.”
But after reading a couple positive reviews and an interview with Constance Wu, who plays the main character’s mother Jessica on Fresh Off the Boat, I relented and watched two episodes. And, to my surprise, the show hit home.
Here’s the thing: You don’t see a lot of Asian-American families portrayed on American television. In fact, the last American television show that focused on an Asian family was comedian Margaret Cho’s All-American Girl, which was received so poorly that it was canceled before I was even born.
Fresh Off the Boat depicts aspects of my childhood, as well as that of many other Asian-Americans, that I’d never seen on television before. Serious scenes scattered throughout are all too familiar: when Eddie Huang, the main character of the show, is excommunicated from a table of cool, white kids because of the way his home-cooked meal looks and smells; the racial slur another kid throws at Eddie in the middle the lunchroom; when Jessica, Eddie’s mother, smiles through her so-called friends’ racist remarks to avoid seeming like a stickler.
Of course, there are also some relatable, comedic scenes, such as Eddie having a difficult time fitting in at school, while his siblings seem to effortlessly rise to the top of their own social ranks or Jessica taking a whole bowl of chips in a supermarket because she misunderstands the concept of free samples.
While these scenes aren’t exactly how my childhood panned out, seeing characters experience something similar to my experience on television is important. In the words of Constance Wu: “To see Asians in leading roles changes what I’m calling the heteronormative status of TV.”
Fresh Off the Boat isn’t perfect. Eddie Huang, whose Fresh Off the Boat: A Memoir inspired the sitcom, has gone on record to criticize the show and how the producers stray from his original story, and even how they water down his life story. Other critics have called Jessica’s accent and jokes stereotypical.
But the show reaches out to an important audience of American television that has been ignored for a long time. Accents are part of the reality that people assimilating into American culture must experience. They’re natural consequences of learning another language, and oftentimes an impressive sign that someone is familiar with more than one language.
There are no stereotypes in the show; stereotypes are harmful and oversimplified. What we see on screen are real characters who face difficulty when put in an unfamiliar situation. What we see on screen are real characters who minorities, long ignored in the American television industry, can relate to. 
Of course, not everyone’s stories are the same, but being able to empathize with a character onscreen who isn’t white and has shared even remotely similar experiences makes a difference.
For the first time in years, Asian-American minorities have been given a major voice on television. Fresh Off the Boat is an important step in allowing unique, non-white voices and stories to be heard.

Robotics in general, and drones in particular, are becoming not the stuff of science fiction but of everyday life. However, it seems that we are at a crossroads both in the development of this technology and the laws surrounding its use. In science fiction, drones are almost always just tools. However, the United States’ current drone record suggests a future dystopia with a sky full of relentless kill-droids rather than a utopia full of helpful robots making deliveries and watching over crops.
This may sound like hyperbole, but two important developments occurred last week, both of which are poised to change the way American drones are sold and used. First, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a report detailing a proposal for overly restrictive rules on the private use of drones. The FAA would require drones used by civilians to remain below 500 feet and in visual range of a fully-in-control operator at all times.
While flying devices need rules and regulations for the safety of the general public, the FAA’s proposal would prevent most drone-related businesses or services from taking off, especially since recreational use of radio control (RC) planes and non-professional drone use remains unrestricted for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under 55 pounds.
Delivery drones would have to routinely be out of visual range of an operator, and the proposed rules make no allowance for the use of GPS or camera systems to make up for being outside of visual range. While a height ceiling is necessary, especially when the drone may be near manned aircraft, 500 feet is a relatively low ceiling and may interfere with the proposed use of drones to monitor large crop fields for signs of disease or drought.
While the FAA was proposing a potentially too-tight set of rules for domestic drone operators to adhere to, just a few days later the State Department announced a handful of restrictions on the export of armed drones to allied nations. While drone technology has been independently developed in many countries, and numerous unarmed drones are exported by the United States and other countries, armed American drones such as the MQ-9 Predator remain the most battle-tested and field-proven options.
Drones are much cheaper to purchase and to operate than conventional aircraft, and the investment in training a pilot isn’t lost whenever one is shot down. Like it or not, drones are an important emerging tool in warfare, and exporting armed drones is in some ways very similar to other military technology. However, the State Department guidelines indicate that drones can only be sold to nations that will not use them in unlawful circumstances — an interesting development given our current government’s penchant for illegal drone use.
There is little doubt that drone technology will become widespread in the near future, and that society will be changed in both positive and negative ways by its presence. But when it comes to directing technological developments and society’s use of drone technology, the government needs to devote more attention to creating an environment that allows Americans to benefit from drones, rather than making it easier for foreign governments to fight their wars.

Tuesday marks the series finale of Parks and Recreation on NBC, and I’ll be very sorry to say goodbye to Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). While Parks and Rec has a strong ensemble cast and witty writing, it is Leslie’s strength that drives the show. The town of Pawnee, Indiana is flawed and absurd, but Leslie shows us what a feminist can look like in 21st Century middle America.
Initial reviews of the show construed Leslie as ditzy, but show writers quickly corrected that perception. By the third season, Leslie had earned our respect as a smart, talented, impressive woman. The show has continued to grow in popularity, with icons like Ron Swanson. While I adore Ron, you can’t talk about Parks and Recreation without talking about Leslie Knope. While Ron advises to “never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing,” Leslie “whole-asses” everything she does.
Leslie is unapologetic in her pursuits. She typifies servant leadership as a member of the local parks department, then as a city councilor, and eventually as the head of the National Parks Service in the Midwest. Her progression is met with adversity and small defeats, but she deals with obstacles as they appear. She perseveres in the face of workplace sexism. The show doesn’t shy away from difficult topics, like the racist murals on the walls of city hall that were some of my favorite recurring items in its first two seasons.
This final season takes place in 2017, a 3-year jump from the end of season six. Leslie has had triplets in the meantime (named after Supreme Court justices!), but the season is not about Leslie’s struggle balancing family with her career. She acknowledges it, but the season arc is more about Leslie’s work and friends. Motherhood becomes a part of who she is, and not a definition of what she is. When Ben launches a campaign for Congress, the pair recognizes the ridiculous cultural expectations related to the “campaign wife” image, and instead maintains their egalitarian relationship dynamic.
As a human being, Leslie is flawed. Over the course of the series, we learn that her home is a “scary hoarder’s nest” and that she has neurotic tendencies about binders. Sometimes her insanely high standards are unfairly projected onto others. What makes Leslie admirable is that she attains professional success while maintaining her status a real person. She is unashamed of her love for breakfast food and has a wall of inspirational women in her office. These hidden passions make Leslie’s enthusiasm seem a little less exhausting and a lot more believable.
Leslie supports her lady friends, and not just on Galentine’s Day. She fights for their happiness in a way that television shows rarely display, instead preferring the jealousy narrative or putting women into stereotyped supporting roles. In my own life, female best friends have been irreplaceable bastions of support. It is reassuring that Leslie is never self-conscious about showing her affection for her best friend or hoping that it is reciprocated. The devotion between Leslie and Ann (Rashida Jones) is immensely validating.
Other women on the show demonstrate that empowerment can mean something unique for everyone. Donna (Retta) pursues business ownership while recognizing the importance of taking time to “treat yo’ self.” April’s (Aubrey Plaza) façade of hating the world actually demonstrates how fiercely she feels about those she loves. Just as importantly, the men on the show recognize the power of the women in their lives. They support them as individuals, not as objects or inferiors.
Most importantly, Leslie Knope exemplifies the modern feminist. She is aggressive and passionate, but as a #bossbitch and not a #bitchboss (to use Donna’s turn of phrase). She is an actual boss — people report to her and respect her ideas. She surrounds herself with a team that respects her as a human being. She is the hardest worker in Pawnee and loves what she does. Still, she asks us to remember what’s important in life: “Friends, waffles, work. Or waffles, friends, work. But work is third.” Goodbye, Leslie. Ovaries before brovaries.

Friends, Liberals, Progressives,
Last week, President Obama asked Congress for war powers to combat in Iraq and Syria. Last week, I also participated in a discussion — “Nonviolence and Social Change” — in which humanists at Carnegie Mellon arrived short of committing to nonviolence, accepting instead that violence can be needed.
This is hardly insulated. Who right now is committed to nonviolence, opposes war, and is pro-peace? We all did detest the War in Iraq once, and not without cause. What cause withholds us then from still detesting it?
The multi-nationality of our coalition? On Feb. 6, the Jordanian bombs killed as indiscriminately as ours. The limited, pointedness of our efforts? On Feb. 15, no precision bombing in Iraq was able to prevent atrocities in Libya.
Is ISIS more threatening to the United States and more brutal than Saddam Hussein? Hardly — only more public. The politics, party, or prizes of the new commander-in-chief? I hope not.
Violence does not prevent violence. Do two decades of continuous war against these people not illustrate this? Violence only causes more violence. 
Do the atrocities in every day’s headlines not illustrate this? The question is not, “How do we destroy violence?” but rather, “What causes these atrocities?”
I was born in 1996. In 1990, they had bombed my uncle. In 1998, they bombed my older brother. In 2003, they bombed my school. But they stuck around, so I trusted them, even though they killed two people from my church. In 2011, they left and things only got worse. And now they’re bombing us again? I’m 19, Iraqi, I know death from them, and I hate them for it.
If humanists do not sympathize with our fellow humans, who will? If liberals don’t resist the force of violence, who will? If progressives revert to war, who will lead the peace?
We say the words. On Jan 19, we said: “Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.” On Oct 2, we said: “My religion is based on truth and non-violence.” On Sept. 2, 2013, we said: “War never again! Never again war!” On July 3, 2008, we said: “I am absolutely committed to ending this war.”
If we are anti-war, let us be anti-this war. If we are non-violent, let us be against this violence. And if we are pro-peace, let us be peaceful.
End this War!

Since Russia’s formal annexation of Crimea last March, the United States has had a tenuous stance on intervention in Ukraine. It has been easy to characterize Russian President Vladimir Putin as a bully in these proceedings, but there looms a greater worry: Could Ukraine become a symbol for international conflict in a new Cold War between the United States and Russia?
The ceasefire last week failed even as it was being signed, with fighting continuing in Eastern Ukraine. This region has generally separatist sympathies. Ukrainian troops are withdrawing from the city of Debaltseve, which has been under siege for weeks. Now Ukrainians are requesting U.N. Peacekeepers, while Russia maintains that U.N. involvement would violate the terms of the ceasefire.
Assisting the Ukrainian rebels has its own complications. Failures like Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq have shown that American intervention is often unwanted and unhelpful in international civil conflicts. More recently, the Arab Spring has shown just how complex and challenging international intervention may become. Dictators are easy targets, but establishing a new system of governance in a country without a history of democracy is much more difficult.
One of the most salient fears about assisting the Ukrainian rebels is weapons possession. President Barack Obama has said that the United States is considering “lethal defensive weapons” if diplomacy fails. Should the United States consider this strategy that has failed in other conflicts? 
The Tartan agrees that a diplomatic solution is still ideal, but it seems to be increasingly unlikely. American aid to Ukraine is a calculated step that should be approached with caution.

On Feb. 15, John Oliver turned his attention to the tobacco industry on his show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.
The host criticized major corporations, particularly Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco, for threatening to sue smaller nations trying to pass public health laws that would help reduce smoking rates. These laws include “plain packaging laws” that replace logos and other trademarks on cigarette packaging with clear warnings and graphic illustrations of health problems that arise from smoking tobacco.
In 2011, Australia introduced plain packaging laws that banned company branding from tobacco packages and included what Oliver could only refer to as “upsetting photos.” The photos depict a toe-tag on a corpse, a cancerous mouth, a “nightmarish” eyeball, and a diseased lung. The purpose of these images is to deter people from purchasing or using tobacco products, and with good reason. According to the World Health Organization, nearly six million people die annually from tobacco-related causes.
Total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in Australia fell to record lows since these laws were implemented. To achieve this feat, the Australian government had to deal with a number of lawsuits from tobacco companies: two sued Australia’s highest court in an attempt to stop plain packaging laws. In 2012, the high court tossed the case and required the companies to pay all legal costs associated with the case.
However, rather than abiding by the court’s decision, the tobacco companies have aggressively tried to prevent smaller countries from adopting legislation similar to Austrailia’s. At least four countries — Namibia, Gabon, Togo, and Uganda — have received warnings from large tobacco corporations. Philip Morris threatened to sue Togo, one of the 10 poorest countries on earth, after the country’s government required packs of cigarettes to include written warnings about the health risks of smoking. Only 40 percent of Togo’s adult population is literate. Furthermore, Philip Morris had net revenues of over $80 billion in 2013, while Togo’s GDP estimated just a little over $4 billion the same year.
This form of intimidation by the tobacco industry toward smaller countries is unacceptable. As smoking rates in these nations increase and become major public health concerns, John Oliver’s initiative to improve the situation is both admirable and just.

Aries have a lot of energy and have trouble sleeping. Their dreams are often intense and vivid so it's difficult to wind down at night. Sleeping on your side may improve your night's rest.
Sleep can be very fitful for Taurus if they are not comfortable. They are especially sensitive to their environment and sleep best in company. 
Gemini can survive on fairly minimal amounts of sleep, but it eventually catches up with them. Their minds are always on overdrive, so sleep doesn't come easily. Sleep may seem like an inconvenience.
Cancer have restless sleep patterns because they are likely to suffer nightmares. Bedtime is especially volatile for Cancer because they dwell on their troubles before sleeping. 
Most Leo are back sleepers, and tend to fall asleep quite easily if they aren't stressed. They appreciate bed time and like to sleep amongst the most luxurious and sensuous of sheets and linen. 
Virgo cannot sleep if they are stressed or in an environment of disorder. They have a chronic habit of overthinking, which makes it difficult to relax. They function best when they have obtained a sleeping schedule. 
Libra alternate between sleeping too much and not enough. They can survive on minimal sleep for a short period, then literally spend days in bed. 
Scorpio's sleep is directed by their state of moods. A [ITAL]lifted[ITAL] Scorpio will survive on minimal sleep, pushing bed time back as late as possible as they fall into their concentrated obsessions. An unhappy Scorpio needs a lot a sleep. 
Sagittarius can survive on a minimal sleep arrangement, but tend to naturally exhaust themselves throughput the day. However, less sleep means more restless dreams. 
Capricorn appreciate their sleep and try to get as much as possible. A stressed Capricorn will have pronounced sleep troubles — insomnia is an indicator of great inner distress for this sign. 
Aquarius have pronounced sleep troubles and tend to be restless and uncomfortable. Their racing thoughts tend to make it difficult for them to fall asleep at night. 
Sleep is essential for Pisces. Out of all the zodiac, they need the most hours. Their receptive nature means they are drained by others, and sleep restores their energy reserves.
