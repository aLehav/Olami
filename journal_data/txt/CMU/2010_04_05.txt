The Carnegie Mellon track and field team found themselves competing in yet another invitational on Saturday, April 3. Located at Washington and Jefferson College, the Tartans competed against 14 challenging teams, with the women coming in third place and the men dominating in first.
Major contributors to the women's third-place finish included junior Courtney Baker, who won the 800-meter run for the second year in a row with a new meet record of 2:17.15. Junior teammate Laura McKee was not far behind, snagging third in the event with a time of 2:25.0. Other contributors included senior Crystal LeePow, who claimed fourth in the 400-meter hurdles in a time of 1:09.14, and first-year Emily Wobb, who took fourth in the 1500-meter run in 5:02.45.
Sophomore Ivana Moses also achieved excellence in the field by winning the triple jump with a distance of 10.76 meters. Moses also saw success in the long jump, grabbing third with an impressive 5.02 meter leap. Junior Morgan Faer stole the spotlight in the hammer throw, with a second-place finish and a commendable 37.31 meter clearance.
On the men's side, the team's depth led them to victory. On the track, the distance events were the strongest by far. In the 800-meter run, junior Nate Bussiere captured first place by 0.19 seconds with a time of 1:55.05. In the 1500-meter run, the Tartans grabbed third through sixth in the event when sophomore Matt Jacob, junior J.P. Allera, sophomore Kyle Andrews and junior Dan Addis finished with times of 4:06.74, 4:07.26, 4:07.74, and 4:08.10, respectively. In addition, senior Chris Rizzo claimed third in the 3000-meter run with a time of 10:31.51.
Sophomore Ryan Kissel led the way in the field events when he achieved a personal record of 6.81 meters in the long jump to earn first place. Teammate senior Chris Bridgman won the pole vault with a clearance of 4.40 meters. For the throwers, senior James Hulley took second in the shot put in 16.22 meters, while senior Chirs Fornataro came in second in the hammer throw in 48.45 meters. 
Look for the Tartans next when they travel to the Bucknell invitational on Friday, before hosting their own quad meet the next day.

The 11th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team upset number-nine Johns Hopkins University last Sunday, 7–2, in a thrilling home match. The Tartans continue to be a threat against top-10 teams, and this win improves their record to 12–4.
The Tartans started the match with excellent serving and volleying, as they swept all three doubles against the Blue Jays. The second doubles tandem of juniors Bobby MacTaggart and Alex Nemerov shut down their opponents 8–5, followed by a solid 8–6 win by the third doubles team of junior Niko Ljuboja and first-year Duke Miller. 
With first doubles still on, the Tartans were facing an encouraging 2–0 lead against one of the best teams in the country. Having a home-court advantage on their side, the new doubles duo of James Muliawan and sophomore Jeremy King took out Hopkins’ top team 9–7 to give the Tartans tremendous momentum heading into singles play.
“We made adjustments in doubles and it worked well,” senior Jon Spero said. “If we play like this every match, we have a good shot to compete for a national championship this year.”
To close out the match, the Tartans only needed two more wins to clinch the victory. Spero, playing fifth singles, finished first, dominating his opponent 6–4, 6–0. Nemerov followed suit and dropped only three games against top-ranked David Maldow to win 6–2, 6–1, giving the Tartans the fifth point for a victory. Muliawan and first-year Harsha Rao each pulled out third-set wins to bring the total points to seven.
For the Tartans, this was one of the best upsets of the year. “This win certainly ranks up there as one of the biggest in the program’s history.” Spero added. “We didn’t just win, we won comfortably. Hopkins has beaten us three times in a row, including six weeks ago, so I was proud of the team. Next weekend, we will play some tough teams, so we have to make sure we stay focused.”
“This was a good day for us,” Muliawan said. “My matches were close, but I’m glad Jeremy and I were able to pull it out. Hopkins is a top-10 team, so this just shows we can battle with the best.”
The Tartans have a few days off before gearing up for the Great Lakes Colleges Association Tournament on April 9 and 10. With confidence from this win and stronger doubles teams, the Tartans look to improve.

Ah, baseball season. Hope springs eternal. The crack of the bat, the pop of the mitt, the uninhibited stream of profanity coming from everyone in my family’s mouth toward the TV...
I believe baseball was the main reason we stopped trying to “keep it clean” in front of my baby brother.
Today marks the true beginning of the 2010 baseball season. Twenty-eight of 30 Major League teams play their season openers, many while we’re still in class, but with technology these days it’s impossible not to follow the game even without a TV or a ticket. If you like baseball, you’ll find a way.
True, the “official” beginning of the season was Sunday night, when major league baseball’s overzealous schedulers pitted the New York Yankees against the Boston Red Sox in the first game of 2010. Putting such a fierce rivalry front and center may be great for ESPN’s ratings, but season-opening series aren’t meant for that kind of intense history. Save those matchups and pile them on as much as possible later in the season, when both teams are playing must-win games, and there’s your rivalry.
That’s what it came down to last year, as the Red Sox won all eight of their meetings against the Yankees from April to June before the Yanks won nine of the 10 remaining games in August and September en route to clinching the American League East title and, eventually, winning the World Series.
When my team, the New York Mets, open their season at 1:10 p.m. against the Florida Marlins, it’ll begin their 162-game chance to prove that their dismal 2009 season was a fluke, that they can stay healthy (they had 17 players on the disabled list last year), and that they can go back to being a serious contender. The Marlins will not be out to prove much; rather, like every year, they’ll hope to surprise. The Marlins, much like the Pittsburgh Pirates, Kansas City Royals, Washington Nationals, and Baltimore Orioles, tend not to have much in the expectation department each year; however, unlike the others, the Marlins have winning seasons every now and again. That’s where the surprise comes in.
Some Pirates were quoted in the off-season as considering the playoffs a pretty reasonable goal for the club. Others claim finally having any winning percentage at or over .500 is reasonable. After a professional sports record of 17 straight losing seasons and a relatively quiet off-season — acquiring infielder Akinori Iwamura was their one really big move — it’s hard to believe anything good at all will come from this season. But the season has yet to begin, and optimism is always the best option.
After all, stranger things have happened; the aforementioned low-to-no-expectations group of teams used to be larger. The 2003 Detroit Tigers lost an American League record of 119 games and were the laughingstock of the league until they came out of nowhere in 2006 to make it all the way to the World Series. The Tampa Bay Rays played losing baseball from their inception into the majors in 1998 through 2007 before similarly making the World Series in 2008. 
Even the Nationals, when they moved to Washington in 2005, were in first place for the first half of the season before they remembered that they were the former Montreal Expos and fell completely off the map in the second half.
Then there are teams like the Cincinnati Reds, who played shoddy baseball last year but made significant enough improvements in the off-season to put them on most people’s comeback list. The Seattle Mariners, who played laughably in 2008, went back into the win column last year and made a plethora of significant acquisitions over the winter. They are now the favorites to unseat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as the AL West champions.
Unfortunately, the ball can roll the other way, as perhaps the new favorite to have the worst season in baseball is the Toronto Blue Jays. Formerly a sure choice for third place in the AL East behind Boston and New York, they fell behind the Rays in 2008 and 2009. Over the off-season, though, they traded their ace Roy Halladay and, combined with the Orioles’ minor 
improvements, enter this season with the unofficial motto of “The Rebuilding Has Begun.” Joining them as newer members in the written-off club are the Oakland A’s, the Cleveland Indians, and the San Diego Padres; the only bets people are placing on the Padres involve if and when they trade star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to the Red Sox.
But again, hope springs eternal. No club, not even Toronto, goes into the season thinking they’ve made their team worse. Who will be this year’s Tampa Bay? Who will be this year’s A’s? Who will be this year’s Pirates? At least that one’s easy. Here are my predictions for this year’s division champs and chumps:
AL East: Champs — Yankees, Chumps — Blue Jays; 
AL Central: Champs — Twins, Chumps — Indians; 
AL West: Champs — Mariners, Chumps — A’s; 
NL East: Champs — Phillies, Chumps — Marlins; 
NL Central: Champs — Cubs, Chumps — Pirates; 
NL West: Champs — Giants, Chumps — Padres.
Happy baseball, everybody!

After once again hitting the top-10 board in Division III last week, the Carnegie Mellon women's tennis team earned their spot and defeated number-16 University of Mary Washington 8–1. The rebound win after two losses from last week put the Tartans at 9–5 for the season.
The Tartans wasted no time getting down to business. With quick 8–1 wins by the first doubles team of junior Ashley Herrick and sophomore Laura Chen and the third doubles team of sophomore Cze-Ja Tam and junior Jennifer Chui, the Tartans took a 2–0 lead. Sophomore Courtney Chin and first-year Alex Tapak had a streaky match, blowing a 3–0 lead before rallying to win 9–7 to give the Tartans their first doubles sweep since March 12. 
Without breaking a step, the Tartans continued their domination by taking five of the six singles. Chen dropped only two games against Eagles top singles player Courtney Goimarac to win 6–1, 6–1. Chin didn't play as well at second singles, but battled to a third-set victory after being down a set, with a score of 5–7, 7–5, 1–0. Tapak was a trooper and also took out her opponent at third singles in a thrilling third set, 6–4, 3–6, 1–0. New to the singles lineup was junior Kelly Hart at the last singles position, who easily took out her opponent 6–2, 6–3.
"This was a good win for us," Hart said. "[Mary Washington] is a tough team, but I'm glad everyone was able to pull it out."
The Tartans took on number-17 Johns Hopkins University Sunday. Results will be posted online.

After finishing fourth in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference for the indoor season, Carnegie Mellon’s track and field team is forging ahead into outdoor competition. Recently, junior middle distance runner Nate Bussiere was named the UAA’s Track and Field Athlete of the Week. Bussiere finished third in the mile run at the indoor championship meet. He has since stepped up his performance by provisionally qualifying for the National Collegiate Athletic Association  Outdoor Championships in the very first meet of the outdoor season at Washington and Lee last weekend.
Bussiere is a pioneering student. He petitioned for a track team to be instituted at his high school in Canton, Conn. during his sophomore year. Since it was such a young program, Bussiere didn’t find his niche in middle distance running until his senior season. 
While he had originally planned to play soccer at Carnegie Mellon, Bussiere picked up track — as well as cross country — on a whim and maintains that it was a great decision.
Bussiere claims that his true spark for running was ignited this past fall. He was inspired by his high-caliber team: “Being on such a gifted team and competing at the national level changed the way I run every race now.”
While majoring in chemical engineering, Bussiere likes to stay active by playing soccer, racquetball, and Frisbee. Because of his interest in jazz music, Bussiere has auditioned for and been offered a part in Carnegie Mellon’s jazz ensemble. Time constraints with school and running commitments keep Bussiere from playing with the ensemble, but he remains an avid supporter. He would like to keep running in the future, participating in road races and marathons. 
For now, he wants to concentrate on the task at hand: bringing the team back to a victorious conference championship, and urging some breakthrough performances from himself and his talented teammates.

The Carnegie Mellon golf team hit the greens last week at the Bridges Golf Club for the McDaniel Spring Invitational and shot 661 total to tie with Keystone College for 12th place.
Sophomore Michael Cheng was the top contender for the Tartans, shooting 15 over par (81, 78, 159) to take 17th in the individual standings. Close behind in 18th place was senior Brett Cannaday (80, 81, 161), who shot two strokes more than Cheng.
The last three members of the team were seniors Nick Burkholder (84, 86, 170), Christopher Lee (90, 83, 173), and Adam Klein (88, 91, 179).
Still fresh, the Tartans headed to the New Castle Country Club the next day and dominated the Titan Invitational, taking second in a tournament of 12 teams. After two rounds of par-72 play, the Tartans ended with 321 points, just four points behind first-place team Gannon University.
The top scorer for the Tartans was Lee (40, 37, 77), who took fourth individually. Sophomore Terence Einhorn (42, 38, 80) and Cannaday (44, 37, 81) took 11th and 12th, respectively. 
The last two team members were junior Brent Driscoll (41, 42, 83) and Klein (44, 42, 86). Sophomore Alex Cohen and first-year Steven Nguyen competed individually and tallied 84 and 89, respectively.
The Tartans hit the links again yesterday and today at the Mid-Atlantic Regional, held at the Hershey Country Club.

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a popular pen-andpaper role-playing game. Part of the reason people enjoy playing it as much as they do is that it leaves almost everything to the imagination. 
The game is not really played out on the table in front of you, but in your mind’s eye, and this aspect, along with the game’s many rules and complex setup process, often turns away newcomers. Many attempts have been made to integrate D&D with modern graphics, but this causes it to lose the interactivity and physicality of the tabletop game. Fortunately, the students at the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon have come up with a proof-of-concept project that combines the ease of use of a computer game with the pen-and-paper charm of D&D.
Called Surfacescapes, this project is run by Whitney Babcock-McConnell, Michael Cole, Stephen Dewhurst, Bulut Karakaya, Dyala Kattan-Wright, and Maokai Xiao, all master’s students at the ETC. 
Surfacescapes is a version of D&D that can be played on a Microsoft Surface, a type of touchscreen table that can literally combine a table and a computer.
Every ETC student is required to complete a project in order to graduate, and this can either be a client project working for an external contractor or a project of the students’ own design. According to Babcock-McConnell, he and two other team members were “working on a client project for Lockheed Martin ... in which we were working with a Surface table.” One of the creators of the webcomic Penny Arcade, Mike Krahulik, was visiting the group and offhandedly suggested that they should put D&D on the table. They loved the idea, switched projects, and assembled a team to work on it.
The system has two software parts, both written in various Microsoft programming languages. One runs on a laptop or desktop and allows the person running the game — the Dungeon Master, or DM — to control every aspect of the game being played. The other part of the software runs on the Surface itself and allows the other players to interact with the game. Players interact with the game through the touchscreen and by using special game pieces that represent their game characters. These pieces can be identified by the Surface and are used to navigate the game world.
A useful way to visualize the game is to look at it as a board game where the board is constantly changing to reflect the results of the game. All of the dice rolling and computation can be done painlessly by the computer, though purists can also play through the game without assistance. Babcock-McConnell pointed out that the team “wanted to take away as little as possible from the original game.” They “did not want to take away any of the role playing and storytelling.” They simply wanted to make it easier to avoid the tedium that such games can involve, including keeping track of the many pieces. They also included features that, according to Babcock-McConnell, “allow you to pull up the rules and allows the game to act as a reference.”
Unfortunately, Babcock-McConnell said that “there is no future beyond the end of the semester.” He noted that “the team is going to become fractured” as they start getting jobs in the industry. Also, he points out that “we have no right to the Dungeons & Dragons intellectual property.... The moment we stop being students we would run into all sorts of legal trouble with the IP.” The group also noted that Surfacescapes technology will not be put up for sale. However, they will be showcasing their project at the Penny Arcade Expo this April.
The fact that surface tables are very expensive and can only be purchased by businesses also reduces opportunities, although it is definitely worth keeping an eye out for the technology in the future.

The evolution of war, by necessity, encouraged the advancement of technology. However, society has also changed — weapons in the past were created to kill and maim more effectively, but weapons of the future will have a more humane side.
It might seem like a paradox — a humane weapon — but researchers are looking to create weapons that will be able to subdue enemies effectively without causing permanent physical harm. 
One such weapon being developed is a kind of military pain beam that will hopefully reduce civilian casualties in future conflicts. This has already been tested on subjects and shown to be effective.
Pain is an unpleasant but necessary sensation that notifies the body of harm. It is a natural response that allows an organism to know when damage is occuring so that it may alter its behavior to reduce further damage. People born with the inability to feel pain may bite their own tongues constantly or break their arms and not realize it. The pain beam will exploit the body’s natural response to pain, which is to move away from the source.
The more formal term for the military pain beam is an Active-Denial System, or ADS. It works by exploiting pain receptors in human skin. According to www.howstuffworks.com, a beam of electromagnetic energy is sent out from something that looks like a satellite dish. An article on www.wired.com states that the beam is comprised of millimeter waves, which have wavelengths between X-rays and microwaves.
The beam moves at the speed of light — instantaneously compared to modern weapons like bullets, missiles, or bombs — and acts over great distances. The actual distance is classified information, although it is known to work at a distance of 500 meters. The energy beam heats the skin of anyone in the path of the beam, and the skin absorbs most of the emitted radiation. This causes a feeling of intense burning. The beam will not be able to penetrate the skin far enough to damage internal organs. Experts note that some activities like tanning will have a more damaging effect to the body in the long run than an ADS. However, the long-term effects have not  been extensively studied.
According to www.bbc.co.uk, a Reuters journalist volunteered to be shot by the beam. He described the effect “as similar to a blast from a very hot oven — too painful to bear without diving for cover.”
Because the ADS looks like a satellite dish, it can be mounted on top of military vehicles, including ships and planes. This will allow for mobility of the ADS, an important feature for any weapon.
The military currently envisions the major use of the ADS as crowd control. According to www.wired.com, test subjects reached their pain thresholds in three seconds, and the site also noted that none of the subjects managed to stay in the beam for more than five seconds. This would be enough to make any crowd scatter.
The beam can penetrate through many objects, but not those made of stone or metal. This has prompted some to believe that wearing a metal suit may help protect soldiers against this beam. The United States Air Force has tested aluminum clothing, but it is only when absolutely no part of the body is exposed that ADS is ineffective.
While ADS may seem like a welcome technology to the military, human rights activists have concerns over the legitimacy of the claims concerning the technology’s safety. The long-term health effects have not been fully studied, and in some mock situations in which ADS was tested, some subjects emerged with burns and blisters. A case of second-degree burns was reported in one instance. In addition, according to www.boston.com, having a weapon marked as non-lethal might prompt troops to use the weapon inappropriately, and in intense battle situations they might become forgetful of proper procedure. This may mean pointing the beam at a crowd of people for more time than is necessary or for more time than testing has shown to be safe.
ADS is not the only technology being developed for non-lethal usage. Another type of device emits a loud, disorienting noise that can be used for crowd control. Researchers have also considered using high-tech stinkbombs and flashbang grenades — grenades that emit a bright light upon explosion — to remove people from a certain area.
Wartime will always prompt the development of weapons. It is fortunate that researchers are actively promoting the development of non-lethal weapons.

In most cultures, including our own, we are raised to think of depression as a taboo topic. It is not difficult to see why this is the case, considering the number of different preconceptions people have about the disease. From the notion that having depression is just a normal part of life to the notion that the ability to overcome depression is a measurement of willpower, it is safe to say that there are misconceptions about the condition, making it difficult for people to get a real sense of the illness.
Because of this, it may not be hard to believe that the majority of people with depression never seek help, even though research has shown that most people with the condition will respond to treatment. As convenient as it is for most people to neglect depression, it truly is a severe illness and, like any other illness, has significant negative effects on a person’s family and friends, and the people he or she might encounter throughout his or her daily life. Additionally, depression affects the quality of a person’s work and may even lead to the deterioration of the person’s overall health.
So what exactly is depression? Before we attempt to answer this, it may be important to first point out that the word “depression” has two different meanings. The website www.healthcentral.com defines depression as a state in which a person has a low mood and generally lacks the will to engage in activity. According to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), someone who is depressed will experience feelings of sadness, helplessness, and hopelessness, but will return to a neutral state with time and support.
Depression, however, can also be used as a more general term for Major Depressive Disorder, a mental disorder in which a person constantly experiences an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem and a loss of interest in activities they usually enjoy. This type of depression can seriously change a person’s lifestyle.
It is also known as clinical depression, major depression, unipolar depression, or unipolar disorder. This form of depression is more than just a state of mind; rather, it is the result of physical changes in the brain, connected to an imbalance of one or more different types of neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry signals throughout the brain and the nervous system.
Someone who has major depression is suffering from more than just “the blues” and may not be able to overcome the problem on their own. They may dismiss their condition as nothing serious, but this form of depression is the form that is often misunderstood and at times underestimated. It may be surprising to find that 16 percent, or around 1 in 6 Americans, consisting of men and women of all ages and coming from different kinds of backgrounds, have or will have this type of depression during their lifetime.
According to www.psycom.net, depression is the combined result of numerous biological, psychological, and social factors. These factors include family history, past or existing trauma and stress, a pessimistic personality, physical conditions or ailments, and even the presence of other psychological disorders. Although some of these factors may appear to have a greater effect on an individual than others, depression is different for everyone and must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
The signs of depression are numerous. Aside from gathering information about a patient regarding the factors listed above, doctors diagnose depression by looking for a list of different symptoms. 
Symptoms of depression vary greatly among individuals, and they manifest in different ways. Some of these symptoms include constant feelings of sadness, irritability, or tension, loss of energy or feeling tired despite lack of activity, a change in appetite or significant weight loss or weight gain, irregular sleeping patterns, and a decreased ability to make decisions or concentrate. More emotional signs include constant feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and hopelessness, and in extreme cases, thoughts of suicide and death. For anyone who may be experiencing one or several of these symptoms, it is imperative that he or she talk to a doctor about potentially suffering from depression.
There are many different treatments used to combat depression, one of which is antidepressants. This type of treatment aims to improve the symptoms of depression by targeting chemicals in the brain that are out of balance and restoring them to a more equilibrated state. Depending on the type of depression, a doctor may choose to use different types of medication. As this is the case, some treatments may take longer than others, and different patients may experience different side effects. Alternatively, doctors may suggest forms of treatment, such as psychotherapy (“talk therapy”) or even electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but only for more extreme cases. Ultimately, one should never make decisions without the proper consultation from a professional.
Although depression carries a negative connotation when viewed in the context of a mental disorder, the fact remains that it is a prevalent and very critical condition, but one that can be treated easily.
It is important that we learn to approach depression more intelligently, so that we can eradicate unrealistic notions and take steps to prevent an illness that affects such a vast number of people worldwide.

CERN creates record particle collision
On March 30, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) made a huge leap in the field of quantum physics. Using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator, scientists achieved energies from the collision of two protons at speeds nearly 3.5 times higher than previously recorded, making it the largest ever release of energy by a particle accelerator.
The protons were sped through CERN’s 27-kilometer-long LHC tunnel near Geneva, reaching speeds close to light speed at the point of impact, over a course of almost two weeks. The entire process took 7 trillion electronvolts (TeVs) — the energy gained by one trillion electrons as they travel through a potential of one volt — and almost two years of research.
Researchers are hoping to use this discovery to gain greater insight into the creation of the universe, realize why matter has mass, and explore new fields of fundamental quantum physics. Some hope that the debris from another such collision will shed light on the elusive Higgs boson, the theoretical elementary particle of mass. In any case, CERN hopes to soon utilize the LHC’s full capacity — 14 TeVs — in its experiments.
As CERN director Rolf Heur put it, “It’s a great day to be a particle physicist.”

Quantum mechanics keep time
Currently, atomic clocks run on the cesium scale, which measures the number of vibrations of a set of cesium atoms per second. There are certain inaccuracies in the measurement of the vibrations, so there have been suggestions to use quantum physics to increase the precision of these clocks’ time-telling.
Two teams, one headed by Philipp Treutlein, assistant professor of physics at the University of Basel, and the other by Markus Oberthaler, professor of physics at Heidelberg University, manipulated quantum mechanics in order to improve the accuracy of atomic clocks. There is a quantum phase of matter called the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which the atoms are placed in multiple energy states simultaneously (known as a “superstate”) and then snapped permanently into one of the states after their original state is measured. The inaccuracies arise when many trials of the experiment are done; the number of atoms in each energy state begins to differ in each run.
Treutlein’s group used a chip with a microwave pulse to make sure that only those atoms of the same energy state interacted. Oberthaler’s applied a magnetic field to the BEC in order to strengthen and weaken collisions between atoms depending on their states.

Cell phones may not affect driving
Although countless people have been cautioned about using a cell phone while driving, a new study indicates that driving ability might not be as impaired by cell phone use as previously believed. 
Jason Watson and David Stayer, psychologists at the University of Utah, conducted an experiment with young drivers (ages 18–43) and their ability to drive, perform simple math equations, and recall words while simultaneously talking on a phone.
The study showed that the ability to perform these tasks declined dramatically while driving. However, a number of subjects actually improved their performance. These people, called “supertaskers,” contradict the accepted views on attention and mental control, which is that doing two tasks at once lowers performance in each. The cause of this anomaly, whether specific mental mechanisms or personal tendencies, remains unknown.

As the sun begins to remind us of its greatness and the number of weeks left of classes can be counted on a single hand, many things are happening in Pittsburgh to welcome spring. As we break out the flip-flops and ditch the hot chocolate, music venues both small and large are welcoming a range of musical talent in the coming months. Musicians from across the country will be coming to the ’Burgh, occupying venues to satisfy the tastes of those hungry to hear some good tunes.
The Five Percent, Caleb Lovely
Saturday, April 10 at 10:30 p.m.
Club Café
$5
Coming from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area in northeastern Pennsylvania, The Five Percent has grown to national fame. Their most recent release was their June 2009 album A Summer Sunday Morning at Dawn. 
Caleb Lovely is a Pittsburgh native and already a triple threat at just 21. He writes, sings, and plays all the instruments in his songs. His honest lyrics and folksy riffs serve for great easy-listening tunes, which are featured on his self-titled LP released in May 2009.
Wilco
Sunday, April 11 at 8 p.m.
Carnegie Music Hall
$70–$110
Their most recent release came in June 2009, titled Wilco. Members of the band are Jeff Tweedy, John Stirratt, Glenn Kotche, Nels Cline, Pat Sansone, and Mikael Jorgensen. One critic gave an incredibly colorful description, calling them “alt-country, Americana, neo-folk, quasi-experimental, and, if you insist, dad rock.” Sometimes they sound like Spoon, sometimes like Bright Eyes, but mostly they’ve captured a unique sound that’s bound to give your ears a good feeling.
The Used
Sunday, April 18 at 7 p.m.
Club Zoo
$25
Lead singer Burt McCracken’s voice is pretty identifiable, and he joins up with bandmates Quinn Allman, Jeph Howard, and Dan Whitesides as they come to Pittsburgh in mid-April. Their latest release, Artwork, came out in late August 2009. Though they’re most appropriately labeled as punk rock meets emo, they’ve been known to garner some fans from mainstream radio-only sounds.
Straight No Chaser
Wednesday, April 21 at 7:30 p.m. 
Byham Theater
Price TBA
What started out as an a cappella group at Indiana University soon developed into a record deal and a national tour. This less-crazy form of Gnarls Barkley has covered popular songs like “Rehab,” “I’m Yours,” “The Man Who Can’t Be Moved,” and “Wonderwall.”
Raul Malo
Friday, April 23 at 10:30 p.m.
Hard Rock Café
$20
Having started out in the music biz as lead singer of the country band The Mavericks, Raul Malo knows how to write simple yet poetic words and pair them with beautiful strings of music to create pleasant songs. Born in Hawaii to Cuban parents, Malo lets an obvious Caribbean vibe color his music. 
Brand New
Club Zoo
Sunday, April 25 at 7:30 p.m.
$25
One of the biggest names to hit Pittsburgh this spring, Brand New has had a great deal of success. Their fourth and most recent album, Daisy, hit the shelves in September 2009. The rock quintet consists of Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney, Brian Lane, Vincent Accardi, and Derrick Sherman.
Miss May I
Thursday, April 29 at 6:30 p.m.
Smiling Moose
$10 
Their debut, Apologies Are for the Weak, came out in late June 2009. Members Levi Benton, Jerod Boyd, B.J. Stead, Justin Aufdenkampe, and Ryan Neff are enjoying the national touring that comes with being a band.
Their music isn’t for everyone, and unless you crave unidentifiable lyrics and hardcore screaming, Miss May I may not be your cup of tea. But for those who enjoy metal core, they’ve got heavy riffs and energy that’ll surely put on an entertaining show.
We the Kings, The Maine
Thursday, April 29 at 6:30 p.m.
Altar Bar
$18
We the Kings is a pop-punk band that’s hit mainstream radio a few times. You probably heard “Check Yes, Juliet” on MTV a few years ago, or “Heaven Can Wait” more recently. Their second album was released about four months ago. Though their sophomore album was considered a repeat of their debut, if you were originally a fan of Travis Clark, Hunter Thomsen, Drew Thomsen, and Dan Duncan, then you won’t be disappointed by their performance. 
The Maine is made up of John O’Callaghan, Garrett Nickelsen, Pat Kirch, Kennedy Brock, and Jared Monaco. Their last album was released back in July 2008, but their recent efforts have gone into publishing a book of memoirs titled This Is Real Life. 
Jason Reeves
Hard Rock Café
Sunday, May 2 at 8:30 p.m.
$10
Jason Reeves gained independent fame only recently with his 2007 album The Magnificent Adventures of Heartbreak (And Other Frightening Tales). After writing every single lyric on the album and producing a quality CD, Reeves was picked up by Warner Bros. Records. Reeves has been best friends with Colbie Caillat since before his solo debut, frequently writing songs with her and occasionally providing background vocals on her songs.
The AP Tour (Never Shout Never, Hey Monday, The Cab, Every Avenue, The Summer Set)
Tuesday, May 4 at 6:30 p.m.
Altar Bar
$15
Piano- and ukulele-playing Christofer Ingle, working under the alias Never Shout Never, has released six EPs and is currently putting the final touches on its debut full-length album.
Hey Monday, a quartet that’s three parts guy and one part girl, tours while singing songs from their 2008 debut, Hold On Tight. Reminiscent of Paramore due to their lineup and pop-punk style, Cassadee Pope, Mike Gentile, Alex Lipshaw, and Michael Moriarty are nonetheless able to put together solid tunes.
The Cab, dubbed “The Band You Need to Know” in 2008’s Alternative Press, just released their debut album, Whisper War. The Las Vegas quartet consists of Alex DeLeon, Alex Marshall, Alex Johnson, and Joey Thunder.
Every Avenue, made up of David Strauchman, Joshua Randall, Jimmie Deeghan, Matt Black, and Dennis Wilson, may seem like any other pop-punk group out there today, but their music is quite refreshing.
The Summer Set, a power pop group comprised of Brian Dales, Stephen Gomez, Jess Bowen, John Gomez, and Josh Montgomery, debuted their first full-length album, Love Like This, in October 2009.
Sky Eats Airplane, Drop Dead, Gorgeous
Wednesday, May 5 at 7 p.m.
Altar Bar
$12
In July 2008, the charmingly named Sky Eats Airplane was introduced to the music scene. Their self-titled debut CD displayed Bryan Zimmerman, Lee Duck, Elliot Coleman, Zack Ordway, and Travis Orbin as members of a band combining screamo and metal core verse with pop-punk and emo choruses.
Drop Dead, Gorgeous released their third album, The Hot N’ Heavy, on June 2, 2009, and have since toured with over a dozen other bands. Drop Dead, Gorgeous consists of Danny Stillman, Kyle Browning, Jake Hansen, and Danny Cooper.
As I Lay Dying
Mr. Small’s Theater & Funhouse
Saturday, May 8 at 8 p.m.
Sunday, May 9 at 8 p.m. 
Price TBA
As most of the shows Pittsburgh is hosting this spring are by up-and-coming metal core bands, As I Lay Dying is one of the most successful of them. They were Grammy nominees in 2008 for their song “Nothing Left.” The quintet of Tim Lambesis, Jordan Mancino, Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Hilpert will be releasing their fifth studio album, titled The Powerless Rise, in May.
Lovebettie
Saturday, May 15 at 10:30 p.m.
Hard Rock Café
$7
And if you’re around in Pittsburgh this summer, there are certainly some big names, both new and old, coming through the area. The hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse comes May 23. A trio of alternative pop-rock bands (Daughtry, Lifehouse, and Cavo) plays on June 2. The mellow men of the Dave Matthews Band — who manage to demand extremely high prices for tickets, but still sell out arenas and pavilions — play at PNC Park on July 10. The Amphitheatre at Station Square will host two great performers over the summer: on July 13, BB King performs, while on August 6, the Ladies of Heart will play.
Keep an eye out for the beginning of the school year next year, as Pittsburgh will be hosting big names like Rascal Flatts, Kings of Leon, and yes… Lady Gaga.

The fraternity Sigma Nu, along with members of the Activities Board and Student Dormitory Council, sponsored a charity concert Thursday night featuring Chester French. Unlike many other fundraisers, the concert allowed the audience to have direct input as to where the proceeds were donated. This included organizations that focused on fighting poverty, improving health care, and expanding access to education.
From the moment you were greeted by the brothers of Sigma Nu with CDs disguised as super-sized condoms, you knew you were in for quite an experience. The show opened with Pet Leviathan, an experimental band that originated at Carnegie Mellon and includes sophomore BHA student and guitarist Mark Palantoni, sophomore English major and drummer Aaron Bernkopt, and sophomore University of North Carolina student and vocalist Bobby Allan. With inspiration derived from Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Jimi Hendrix, the band expressed their energy. Many members of the audience eventually reached a point where they could no longer withstand all the yelling and decided to take a break.
Following Pet Leviathan was the much-anticipated performance by Chester French, comprising lead vocalist and songwriter David-Andrew “D.A.” Wallach and multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Maxwell Drummey. The group originally formed in 2003 as a five-piece comedy rock group while the two were first-years at Harvard University. A year later, the duo became involved as recording engineers for Harvard’s Quad Studios. It was during that time that Wallach and Drummey wrote, produced, and engineered Love the Future, their first demo, which caught the attention of Kanye West in 2007. With priorities that Carnegie Mellon students understand all too well, Wallach and Drummey felt compelled to take their game theory and social anthropology exams, respectively, before leaving for Los Angeles, where they met with managers, agents, and, of course, West to discuss their musical careers. Chester French has now been signed by Pharrell Williams to Interscope Records, home to U2, Eminem, and Gwen Stefani. Additionally, since the release of their first album, the duo has toured and collaborated on projects with Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, West, Talib Kweli, Blink-182, Weezer, and Asher Roth.
For Carnegie Mellon students to see Chester French in such a personal and informal manner was truly a privilege. After performing on MTV, as well as on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Rangos Hall must not have seemed exceptionally glamorous. So how exactly did Carnegie Mellon elicit such an opportunity, especially considering the fact that Chester French is currently recording their new album and is therefore not performing in any shows?
Saptarshi Ghose, a first-year Sigma Nu brother pursuing an ethics, history, and public policy major, tapped into his resources in order to contribute to both a meaningful philanthropic cause and the reputation of his fraternity. Wallach and Ghose attended the same high school, the University School of Milwaukee. Wallach graduated with Ghose’s brother, one of his best friends, in 2003. Therefore, it was possible for the two to keep in touch, even after they entered college.
“I pitched the idea to D.A. during my senior year in high school, and he was genuinely interested in playing,” Ghose recalled. “I asked him if he and Max would be able to play at a benefit concert at CMU. And, despite being occupied with recording their new album and not being able to tour for several months, D.A. and Max were incredibly kind to come to Pittsburgh and play a one-of-a-kind show.” This held true when Chester French was unable to bring their full band to Pittsburgh, but they performed in a more informal manner, complete with a guitar, tambourine, and Wallach’s impeccable beat-boxing abilities.
The band’s performance included a variety of songs, ranging from “The Jimmy Choos” and “Beneath the Veil” to “She Loves Everybody” and “Two Mans.” Each contained a different message, such as the band’s expression of interest in girls who were down to earth, the description of a sexual experience, and a girl who took the mentality of experimenting freely too far. Moreover, the music had broad appeal. Amid the blend of hip-hop and pop, there was something that everyone could enjoy. Wallach also entertained the audience with tidbits about the band’s creation and musical inspiration, as well as provided pieces of advice that he believed would be applicable to nerds just like him — “C++ is hot in this recession, so don’t be shy!”
Overall, Chester French was tremendously talented and incredibly charismatic, as exhibited by the multiple shrieks of adoration from the females in the audience and after the show when the duo agreed to answer questions, sign autographs, and pose for photographs. Additionally, while the event turned out a small audience, the support of the Carnegie Mellon community greatly contributed to charity.
“Chester French really doesn’t remind me of any other band, and that may be why I think they’re such a fantastic group,” Ghose said. “While it is clear that they are well learned in all types of music, their sound is one and their own. With every one of their releases, I feel like they are stretching the boundaries of the norm in pop music, and doing so remarkably well.”

For many, jazz has always been like the taste of an expensive wine: something adults have taken the time to appreciate, something that we should learn to love. I regret to tell you that I haven’t taken enough time to enjoy either one; the legs of a white wine are still as unimpressive as the poetic meter inherent in jazz. 
Given my own disinterest in adult sophistication, it was surprising to see that a group of kids my age were passionate enough to perform at Carnegie Music Hall last Wednesday. Even more surprising: that I slowly became excited to see those kids (Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School, Carnegie Mellon’s 6:30 Jazz Ensemble, and Virginia Wesleyan College) play. Would they be the ones able to break the stuffy spell looming over poor instrumental music’s head? Could one finally look past the whispers of the acoustic guitar to which many have grown so accustomed?
The concert was not the idealistic showing of young support I had imagined, especially for a traditionally experimental, raunchy form of music. It seemed as if the intellectual, incomprehensible stigma I had attached to jazz was not mine alone. Less than a hundred students had said they were attending the event on Facebook, and even fewer seemed to fill the auditorium. Given that the tickets were free with a Carnegie Mellon ID, this was a little disappointing.
Those participating in the performance, however, lived up to lofty expectations. All the gears that make up the musical machine called jazz — call and response, instrumental poetry, cool cats — were present and turning, springing the formerly hollow machine to life. The musicians were totally immersed in what they were playing.
As a visual learner, the easiest way to express the appeal of jazz I discovered that night is by likening it to modern art. Most outsiders are made uncomfortable by the thought of a Jackson Pollock selling for millions. Most protests are along the lines of “I could do that” or “that’s just scribbles — there’s no real meaning in it.” 
Discounting the fact that most musicians practice for years to be able to perform at a venue like Carnegie Music Hall, you could make the argument that free-flowing solos could be done by almost anyone, or that because jazz usually isn’t dripping with melodramatic lyrics about lost love, it’s not charged with enough meaning or emotion. Your argument wouldn’t go very far. In the performance last Wednesday, each verse was filled with well-rehearsed precision, each solo with creative, clever improvisation. 
Terence Einhorn, a sophomore in decision science and a performer in the Carnegie Mellon 6:30 Jazz Ensemble, summed up his experience. “It was nice,” he said. “No one showed up, but whatever.” Maybe jazz will always be foreign to young people looking for the next easy-to-swallow pop song. But to those who take the time to appreciate it, jazz can be quite enjoyable.

During your current walks between classes, you may have noticed black and white posters featuring a woman’s face covered by a scarf. If not, then surely you have noticed this picture while spending countless hours on Facebook. Either way, with all the buzz around campus, many have heard about Sleigh Bells, the noise pop band set to perform Wednesday night at the CFA Alumni Concert Hall.
If you have heard the chatter, you might be wondering what the fuss is really about. 
Guitarist and songwriter Derek E. Miller, a former member of the metal-core band Poison the Well, met vocalist Alexis Krauss in 2008 while serving Krauss and her mother at a restaurant. When he mentioned that he was looking for a female vocalist, Krauss’ mother immediately nominated her daughter. Krauss was a schoolteacher who had spent some of her teen years singing on pop records. A few weeks after their initial meeting, they became Sleigh Bells.  
They recently signed to M.I.A.’s label N.E.E.T. and have made plans to release their debut album, Treats, on May 11, 2010. They have released several tracks online, the most popular of these being “Crown on the Ground,” which Pitchfork named the 57th best track of 2009. Sleigh Bells has been named a “band to watch” on numerous music sources and blogs, including Stereogum. 
Their music is high in volume and energy, using synthesized sounds, strong beats, and decibel overloading. With pop undertones, their songs are catchy and exciting; however, the tracks remain distinct from pop songs because of their background sounds, grainy noises, and rumbles from Miller’s guitar and an iPod. 
The duo recently played at South by Southwest, one of the largest music festivals in the United States, which takes place every spring in Austin, Texas. They garnered a lot of attention from multiple media sources after their performance. 
Entertainment Weekly said they “pulled off one of the most contagious, sloppy fun moments of the festival so far” and described their music as “kind of like NWA meets Le Tigre, with Sabbath riffs and ESG on backup.”
With all of the hype, it would be a shame to miss their performance in such an intimate setting as the Alumni Concert Hall. Tickets are $5 and are only sold at the door. Doors open Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and the show starts at 8 p.m. Get there early because the show might sell out. Be prepared to dance the night away.

Kohli’s is an Indian grocery on South Craig Street, hidden between Union Grill and Lucca’s. Initially, my trip to Kohli’s was focused on getting a gallon of milk. Then, with milk off my list, I began to collect more groceries that I would usually get from Giant Eagle.
As I wasn’t familiar with Indian cuisine, wandering around Kohli’s was an entirely new experience for me. Rather than going to Kohli’s for just a gallon of milk or some onions and shallots, I went through Kohli’s for a vacation.
Opened in 1989 as a strictly Indian grocery, Sanjeev Kohli’s South Craig Street store later expanded into a general store; however, Indian and Middle Eastern ingredients are still the primary sale items.
To most students, Kohli’s is probably well known for their samosas. You can get a samosa — a fried dough snack stuffed with spiced potato — for only 90 cents. Even when it’s a little colder than you might prefer, this over-stuffed, spice-filled pocket is an affordable between-meal snack and is very filling.
Besides samosas, Kohli’s carries other ready-to-eat foods. Another big draw is their popular chicken lunch: About 150 chicken lunches are sold each day. Many of their top-selling foods are shipped from various Indian restaurants in New York or Washington D.C.
Imported goods are also shipped to Kohli’s from major Indian importers in Detroit and other cities. The spice packs they sell are the same as those used in traditional kitchens throughout India.
A well-known Indian dish is chicken tikka masala, a dish which writer Shoba Narayan called “Britain’s national dish” because it is so popular in England. With tikka masala mix purchased from Kohli’s and a cut of chicken, you are ready to create a delicious meal.
For those who pass Kohli’s on their way home, it can be a great last-minute grocery stop before making dinner. At Kohli’s you can get basics like ginger, onion, eggplant, or exotic long squashes. Kohli, the store’s owner, said that all of the store’s fresh produce is shipped from Florida.
Kohli also has a regular American grocery selection — providing customers with jars of pickles, trash bags, dish detergent, and even lasagna. Kohli’s is definitely more accessible than you’d think. In terms of business, Kohli said that the store expands and grows with the needs of customers.
Kohli’s is not just an Indian grocery store; it is a grocery store with a strong focus on Indian and other Asian cuisine, since Indians share a culinary background with some other Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern regions. Indian students may find comfort in familiar surroundings, but to me, walking into the unfamiliar setting with different aromas was like a micro-vacation. The charm of traveling is getting away from the usual routine. In this case, I found it by working my way through an unfamiliar aisle.

The 10 of us made it to Nicaragua. After a year of planning for the unexpected, having long discussions about sustainability, panicking about the seemingly insurmountable amount of funds to raise, selling donuts, cookies, pizza, donuts, soup, Rita’s, raffles tickets, donuts, donuts, and even more donuts… we finally made it to Nicaragua.
Even after all the planning and preparation, I still think that I wasn’t prepared for what we would learn, the bonds we would make with the community, or the experiences that would make me long to return.
After a night in a small motel, we traveled in a tiny 12-passenger plane that swayed and rocked with every gust of wind. Hidden behind the mountainous ridges was a small gravel landing strip that marked our entrance to the place we would spend the next week — Siuna. We spent some time in Siuna touring through the local hospital, marketplace, and university. Siuna is one of the poorest cities in Nicaragua, a city that had its local water resources destroyed by American and Canadian mining during the first half of the 20th century. Although they have had to deal with a failing infrastructure, the community has been able to make progress with the help of the university and community organizations, such as our partner organization Bridges to Community.
After a canoe ride through the jungle, we finally made it to a rural village called Amparo. We received a warm welcome from the community and began unpacking our bags and mosquito nets in the community church.
We spent the week in Amparo in order to learn how we could successfully work with the community on sustainable projects. During the week, we built latrines and clean-burning stoves with a lot of help from the locals. The stoves we built would reduce the danger of smoke inhalation. During the rainy season, the latrines would promote a more sanitary living environment for families.
We also had the opportunity to have art workshops with a local elementary school. The school was more like a room in which the teachers had to educate all the first- to fifth-graders in the community. Needless to say, their resources were spread thin. We were able to give these children a chance to explore art and provide them with the materials to pursue this outlet. Our workshops culminated in a wonderful mural of the school painted by all the children. We had some of our best moments, however, with the kids playing “Simone dice” (my impromptu translation of “Simon Says”) and breaking the language barrier by running, jumping, and crashing into each other.
Even though we spent the week without running water or electricity, we loved every minute of it. At night we would be able to walk from under the overhang of the church and gaze upwards towards the sky. Having spent my whole life in the city, I can remember few other times in my life when I saw so many stars. Cooling off by bathing in the river after a long day of building latrines and stoves was always gratifying.
All pleasantries aside, we spent each day working ourselves to the bone. At certain points, we would feel incapable of doing half the amount of work that our comrades Don Margarito, Don Luis, or Hugo could do within 10 minutes. This humbled even the most capable of our group.
I remember one specific example when I was gathering gravel to help construct the latrine. As I packed a 50-pound bag of gravel on top of a pack mule, I looked over to Sebastian, the owner of the soon-to-be-built latrine, to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything. Although it really was a simple task — grab the bag, fill it with gravel, lift it on top of the mule, pack it on, repeat — I was nervous. I didn’t want to look like an idiot in front this guy who, at the age of 20, had a 20-acre plot of land, a three-year-old child, a wife, 30 cows, and 10 chickens. For all intents and purposes, this guy was a cowboy. At 20! Kind of makes you feel unaccomplished, doesn’t it?
Even though I was intimidated, he didn’t shy away from conversation. We were able to joke about scary movies we had seen (he loves scary movies), baseball teams, and different types of girls we like. I forget sometimes that even though people may have grown from entirely different backgrounds, there is always some sort of common ground among us. Over the course of the week we played baseball with the boys in the community, enjoyed long discussions about the history of Nicaragua and Siuna, and really began looking at what we could possibly do working side by side with the members of this community in the next few years.
I still find it hard to describe my trip in Siuna. It is easy to show a person a picture of the dense jungles we were in, the boat that capsized during one of our expeditions to Amparo, the friendly community who rarely seemed to smile for pictures, but it is hard to explain the sense of belonging I felt and my hope that we can do something good with these people. I loved my trip, and all the donuts that I still have to sell can’t change my mind.

Dear Rohit,
Senior slide is starting to kick in. I’m usually extremely productive, but I seem to spend all my time procrastinating, waiting for the day when I can get out of here. How can I finish strongly this semester?
—Taken by Senioritis
Dear Taken,
I can relate. My friends have senioritis cases so advanced that it took a lot of effort to find time to crank out this article in between listening to their symptoms. Hour-long lectures seem to last for weeks. Homework assignments feel like they should be illegal under the Geneva Convention. In short, everything is harder.
Whatever causes this malady, there’s only one thing that I can suggest to combat it. Just keep plugging away at it. They call it a senior slide for a reason. Once you start sliding, it’s hard to stop. Try to cure this disease before it’s too late. If this means planning weekly study hours or even working on the weekends, then so be it. 
If there’s anything to work toward, it’s post-college laziness. I’ve heard from several sources that the work after Carnegie Mellon is comparatively a breeze.  So look forward to brighter, lazier days ahead. Just don’t do it here. It doesn’t work, regardless of your year.
With a D (for diploma),
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
**I decided the other day that I’m going on a diet. I’m currently about 40 or 50 pounds overweight and would like to know some suggestions about how to lose some inches. **
—Lean in Wean
Dear Lean,
Often I hear disbelief from the skinny crowd as to how obese people can’t just stop eating and lose weight. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. It’s not so much about quantity as it is about quality. The hardest part of your dieting won’t be the bad taste of healthy food, or even hunger. The real challenge is remembering you’re on a diet in the first place.
Think about it. For the past 20 years, you’ve probably developed some pretty nasty eating habits that are sabotaging any plans you have for losing weight. My downfall is French fries. I would eat them night and day if I didn’t care about the social consequences. Your job is to find your “French fries” equivalent. 
In the end, the question will come down to whether you want to give up your habits. Personally, if I had to choose between French fries and the perfect body, I would pick French fries even before knowing what else I had to choose from. Hopefully, you’re better than that.
Don’t fry it up,
— Rohit

What is music criticism? What has it been? What is it now?
What is music criticism? What has it been? What is it now? Music criticism is tied into social class, race, and politics as much as it is tied into novelty and modernity. So, in one word, music criticism is, has been and always will be convoluted. 
Case in point: I once criticized the song “Mr. November” by The National as being “bad.” I didn’t give any reason. The next thing I knew, I was being called a right-leaning moderate who was criticizing a song that was, among many, an anthem of change for the Obama/Biden elections. It was an honest mistake; in truth, I just disapproved of the excessive screaming and profanity.
At this point, no one cares about my opinions on “Mr. November.” In fact, I would guess that most would agree with me in saying that the song is not one of The National’s best — I should know; I’m one of their biggest fans. The funniest part of this entire episode: I am a moderate who often leans right on economic policy, and The National is a band that leans hard left. Classifying me based on the music I like and dislike is not entirely inappropriate.
Now, I don’t know how I feel about being so easily labeled by genre. I really hate being labeled a hipster for liking indie music, but I am pretty hip. 
I would like to blame this all on an opportunistic and exploitative music industry, but that excuse has run its course with the meteoric rise in independent labels. What we accomplish now by criticizing music is anybody’s guess.

The Antique</ b >
Tuesday, April 6</ br>
8
You’re in for a treat here as AB presents a free pre-screening of The Antique, a spooky film that the studio is audience-testing before it hits theaters nationwide. The film, which runs just 65 minutes, is a horror story about a momma’s boy who starts to see and hear things after he finds an antique picture frame. Everything gets a little bit creepier as the main character wonders whether he is going insane or a ghost is actually haunting him and his family.
A Serious Man</ br>
Thursday, April 8</ br>
8 10 12
Noted directors Joel and Ethan Cohen penned this flick about a Midwestern professor whose life begins to go down the tubes after a series of bizarre and inexplicable events. The dark comedy, which has earned rave reviews from critics across the country, focuses on men and women trying to make some sense of the events that unfold. The story is loosely based on the life of Job from the Bible, not Will Arnett’s character from Arrested Development.
Up in the Air</ br>
Friday, April 9</ br>
10 12:30
Up in the Air is a stellar film from director Jason Reitman, famous for Juno. George Clooney and newcomer Anna Kendrick star in this trendy movie that focuses on people whose job it is to break the news to the thousands of people who are fired every day. An extremely timely movie due to the recent recession, Up in the Air is a funny, yet thoughtful, look at the ups and downs of everyday working life.
Sherlock Holmes</ br>
Saturday, April 10</ br>
10 12:30
Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law star as Holmes and Watson in this frenetic and brawny update of the well-known detective. With a recent spate of movies getting gritty reboots nowadays, Sherlock Holmes is one of few that does not disappoint, largely thanks to Downey Jr.’s incredible charm on the big screen. Fun fact: Sherlock Holmes has been played by more actors than any other character in the history of cinema.
Boondock Saints II</ br>
Sunday, April 11</ br>
7:30 10 12:30
Even though the original Boondock Saints never needed a sequel due to its status as one of the greatest cult classic movies ever made, director Troy Duffy chose to make one. The sequel is another revenge thriller, bringing the MacManus brothers back to Boston on a killing spree after their priest is murdered by mobsters. Fun fact: This flick is arguably tamer than the original, with the F-word being used 136 times, as opposed to 247 in the first Boondock Saints.

Zeta Lambda Epsilon was founded this year to much fanfare from the campus community. The fact that they are no longer around and I have never heard of such a fraternity that can lead me to assume that ZLE was filled with ghosts.

Apparently, staff mutilations were growing increasingly popular at Hunt Library, as impatient students were taking out their frustration on workers with the aid of sharp objects. I almost didn’t realize this was the April Fool’s issue — it doesn’t seem too out of character.

A Sports article took an in-depth look into the pitching staff of the Pittsburgh Pirates and noted that they would have to rely on strong pitching to win games. As hilarious as that last sentence is by itself, I’d also like to point out that none of the players mentioned in the article are still with the team.

A News article told us that the “Walk a Mile in Her Shoes” event, where men wore high heels and walk around the Cut to support women’s awareness, would be occurring this week. And if some of the guys just happen to like the way they look, there’s nothing wrong with that at all.

The director of the United States Census, Robert Groves, gave a lecture at Carnegie Mellon on Thursday, March 25. The lecture took place a week and a half before the census forms were to be distributed throughout campus dorms on April 6. This continued a series of campus-wide initiatives to encourage census response, including a freshman seminar on the census taught by statistics professor Stephen Fienberg.
Groves’ lecture, titled “A Society Measuring Itself: Census 2000” focused largely on the bureau’s current ad campaigns, specifically highlighting the attempt to reach a diverse audience. Groves explained, “There are very few products where your target audience is everyone in the country.” The 2000 Census was the first where paid advertising was used. It was also the first year with a recorded increase in response rate between censuses since 1960. In 2010, the bureau invested in advertisements targeting specific groups in the U.S., most notably with ads in Spanish.
Students rank among the more difficult groups to count. Most current undergraduate students lived at home during the 2000 census, and many are confused as to where they should be counted in 2010. All students at Carnegie Mellon will have the opportunity to be counted within Pittsburgh’s distribution of the census. Dorm students will receive their forms from and return  them to to their resident assistants. Groves joked that while the student form is different from those sent to the majority of Americans, it is very similar to the one used in prisons. He noted, however, that off-campus students have lower response rates than do their dorm counterparts.
Senior mechanical engineering student Kay Csuri sent her form in before the April 1 non-dorm deadline. “I think it is our civic duty and I like the idea that I am going to be counted.”
Many universities have organized programs to increase knowledge of the census process and to increase student response rates. Colleges across Boston have started a cross-collegiate competition aimed at having the highest census response rate.
Carnegie Mellon held its freshman seminar focused on the census for the first time this year. Fienberg believes the course is “especially interesting because we get to read and hear about what is happening in the census — in the field nationally, locally, and on campus — and we get to combine this with history, action projects, and technical details about statistical issues.” Students in the course not only got to meet the current bureau director, but also met Barbara Everitt Bryant and Kenneth Prewitt, the directors from 1990 and 2000, respectively.
Pittsburgh has organized numerous events, including “March to the Mailbox,” an event where community members walk across Pittsburgh encouraging those in low-response areas to return their forms. For every 1 percent increase in forms mailed back, the United States saves about $85 million.
This fiscal year, the 2010 Census budget came in around $7.2 billion. However, if everyone in the country returned their forms, the government would save about $1.5 billion. Mailing the form costs about 42 cents, minimal in comparison to the $60 it would cost to send a census employee to a citizen’s door — something the bureau is required to do when individuals fail to respond. The money saved is sent back to the U.S. Treasury and, as Groves highlighted, mailing in your form means “you’ve done your own little part in attacking the deficit.”
This year, the bureau is sending replacement forms during the first weeks of April, hoping to increase response rates of those who might have lost or misplaced their original census forms. One concern for this year’s census, however, is that there are currently a larger number of vacant homes in the U.S. than in 2000, due to the economic recession.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon’s response rate is at about 56 percent, about even with the nation’s 54 percent. 
Current response rates, complete census information, and directions for submitting the census can be found on the official government website: www.2010census.gov.

The current chair of Staff Council stepped down last Wednesday. In an e-mail to Staff Council representatives, Joseph Pastorik, the director of building operations and facilities for the Tepper School of Business, announced he would be ending his term as chair, as well as leaving the university.
Pastorik announced his decision to step down without prior notice, simply citing that his “need to care for a family member has become acute, and the decision to create a work/life balance has become increasingly difficult.” He also praised Staff Council’s current leadership, including Vice Chair Joe Imbimbo and past chair Jennifer Cox.
Staff Council has existed for over a decade at Carnegie Mellon. It was established to provide a representative body and voice to advocate the issues of staff members across the university. 
As stated in the group’s constitution, its chief purpose is to “examine matters related to all staff, and to formulate recommendations” as well as representing “all persons holding full or part time staff appointments.” Staff Council is for the staff what student government is for students at Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartan spoke with Cox, the financial manager for the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the past chair of Staff Council. 
While she recognized Pastorik’s departure as surprising, she is confident that Staff Council will work through this transition. Cox believes that the leadership change will pass without turmoil, but she did wish that the campus could be more aware of Staff Council. “I don’t think people on campus realize that we are here to advocate for them,” she said.
Just last year, with Cox at the helm, Staff Council adopted a new slogan: “Advocacy. Involvement. Impact.” Yet many on campus may not realize that Staff Council sponsors a number of prominent campus activities, including Kennywood Day, Take your Sons and Daughters to Work Day, a food drive, and President’s Forums. “Most importantly, we are here to address concerns of staff,” Cox said.
In several recent Forum articles, The Tartan has focused on the lack of involvement and awareness from students about what student government actually does, and there are similar concerns with Staff Council. While currently down to six vacant seats, Cox believes “part of the problem is that many staff members are unaware of Staff Council, or, if they are aware, they are unsure of what we do.” 
She also said “some supervisors are less supportive of staff involvement on council.” To address this, Staff Council members have been reaching out to deans and vice presidents to promote their divisions’ participation in addressing the needs of staff across the university — needs that do exist and are not without controversy.
Earlier this academic year, staff on a monthly pay schedule were informed that they would be switched to bi-weekly pay. This change was mandatory, and staff were informed that in December 2009 they would not be paid the full monthly amount. Many individuals disagreed with the adjustment, arguing that the timing was unfair: Right before the holiday season, staff would receive approximately half of their expected pay, with the remainder not being distributed until April. 
With Cox’s work as financial manager for Student Affairs, she was actively involved in the issue and believes that the administration in the end was “understanding of the hardship it caused, and responded very well with a supplement to the income of the affected staff members.”
Staff Council has also recently dealt with the reduced budget cuts around campus, especially concerning involuntary staff terminations over the past two years. Imbimbo, a principal software engineer in Computing Services and the current vice chair of Staff Council, pointed to Staff Council’s work allowing debit card use in conjunction with staff flex accounts.
He stated that this would “allow staff to use the card … to pay for over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, and co-pays,” something many staff members have asked for.
Imbimbo also confirmed that he has now assumed the position of chair, a job he will continue for the remainder of Pastorik’s term plus next year’s term, for which he was slated to serve as chair.
From Pastorik’s e-mail to the staff, it was clear his decision was not taken lightly, saying he would “surely miss the CMU staff, but remain inspired by [the staff’s] demonstrated commitment to higher education, particularly through the mission of Staff Council.” 
His trust is now in Imbimbo, Cox, and all of Staff Council’s members to continue his work and promote the activities, voice, and mission of better representing staff at Carnegie Mellon.
For more information about Staff Council, including news, meeting times, and upcoming events, see the group’s website at www.cmu.edu/staff-council.

The first phase of the Port Authority’s Transit Development Plan took effect yesterday, as approximately 50 Allegheny County bus routes were re-numbered, re-routed, or discontinued.
Sunday’s changes represented the first service modifications carried out under the authority’s new development plan, the result of an 18-month study announced in June 2007. The study included public open houses and hearings, and it garnered more than 5000 comments from residents.
Port Authority CEO Stephen Bland said in a February Rider Report that the authority hadn’t experienced such an overhaul in about 50 years, but that it was required now for a variety of reasons. “Riders and leaders repeatedly have called for better transit options — something more convenient, efficient, and easier to understand,” he stated. “The state funding formula adopted two years ago requires us to pursue a more efficient system.”
Several routes passing near the Carnegie Mellon campus were affected by Sunday’s realignment.
The popular 59U route, previously serving the SouthSide Works at one end and the Waterfront at the other, has been split into a separate route for each endpoint. A new 75 bus now runs between Bakery Square in East Liberty and the SouthSide Works via Fifth Avenue, with the closest campus-area stop at Fifth Avenue and Craig Street.  Meanwhile, the existing 61D on Forbes Avenue has been re-routed to serve the Waterfront, with the campus stops remaining the same. Riders from north of campus can also reach the Waterfront via the new 64 route, which replaces the 64A and travels from Lawrenceville via Bloomfield, Friendship, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill.
Airport service from Carnegie Mellon is still provided by the 28X, but its new route no longer passes through Robinson Town Center. Instead, those coming from Oakland can ride1 the G2, labeled “West Busway–Oakland,” to the shopping center.
Despite the numerous changes across the county, Bland stressed that the Transit Development Plan was a simplification and not a reduction in service.
“We’re simply matching demand with service,” he said. “The number of weekday bus trips, for example, will increase by 6 percent even though the number of overall routes will drop from 186 to 122.”
While many have expressed concern over the changes, specifically the removal of the the 59U route, students have generally responded positively to the re-routing of lines.
“I think this could be a very positive change,” said Peter Versteeg, a doctoral candidate in the engineering and public policy department.
“Bus systems sometimes aren’t used as much as they should be. Transit systems cost the city a lot of money, so citizens should really be taking advantage of the bus lines. I could see how it could be frustrating and inconvenient to change your route, but in general, I think it can only be a good thing.”
After this week’s route changes, the Transit Development Plan calls for several more rounds of service updates over the next two years. 
Among the planned additions is a new Rapid Bus service — similar to concepts in place in Boston, Los Angeles, and Cleveland — featuring fewer stops and simpler routes for faster travel. Rapid Bus is set to be phased in on the 28X, 61 series, and 71 series routes, but a statement by the Port Authority said that conversion to the system would depend on funding and planning coordination with the Pittsburgh city government. 
In the meantime, campus-area riders will see an increase in the frequency of 61A and 61B buses.
For a full list of Sunday’s service changes and an overall picture of the post-Transit Development Plan bus routes, see the Port Authority’s website at http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/CustomerInfo/RouteChanges/tabid/512/Default.aspx.
The website also allows visitors to sign up for e-mail alerts for when specific routes change in the future. 
A second round of transportation changes from the Port Authority is due in June.

Carnegie Mellon’s cricket team hosted a benefit match last Saturday at noon for three Pittsburgh police officers who lost their lives last year.
The three officers, Eric G. Kelly, Stephen J. Mayhle, and Paul J. Sciullo II, lost their lives in April 2009 while answering a domestic call in the Stanton Heights neighborhood. It was the first on-duty death of Pittsburgh officers in 18 years. 
All three of the officers loved baseball and had been interested in cricket due to the similarities between the two sports. With this in mind, the police department approached Carnegie Mellon’s cricket team to play the memorial match. The team members were deeply affected and determined to do something to help honor the sacrifices of those individuals. With the help of CIT Public Relations Director Chriss Swaney, who organized the ceremony, they put on an exhibition cricket match honoring the fallen officers.
“[The Pittsburgh police] keep our city safe,” said Sagar Shah, a junior electrical and computer engineering major and the president of the Cricket Club. “We feel really safe when we see a policeman standing in the corner, patrolling the area, and it is because of their efforts that the campus community is a much more safe and fun place to be.” 
Shah has been impressed by the service of the officers, especially in comparison to college campuses in India, where many of the team’s members are originally from.
Last Saturday’s  match began with a bagpipe gala by sponsored performer Patrick Regan, followed by a presentation of awards to both Pittsburgh deputy George Sugar and University Police officer Paul Helffrich to thank them for their service.
“We had never anticipated the amount of support,” said Sugar as he accepted his plaque. He spoke briefly on the police force’s dedication to community and family that remains unwavering despite the risks. “Every time they put on that badge and walk out that door, it may be the last time.”
As further tribute to the officers, eight of the cricket team members released eight doves symbolizing peace. Regan followed the release with a bagpipe rendition of “Amazing Grace.”
After this, the game began. The team split into two groups and played a modified version of a typical cricket match, without padding and with the standard leather ball replaced with a duct-taped tennis ball.
Cricket has similar mechanics to baseball, but with notable differences. Most of the action takes place on a strip of field called the pitch. There are two batsmen at opposite sides of the pitch, and the pitcher (known as the bowler) throws the ball toward one of the batsmen from the opposite side of the pitch. The bowler’s goal is to knock over the wickets, in this game represented by a stack of plastic crates, to get the batsman out. When the ball is hit, the fieldsmen — everyone else on the bowler’s team — try to catch the ball to knock over the opponent’s wickets, while the two batsmen switch sides, called a run, and score the batting team points.
At the match’s conclusion, Police Chief Nathan E. Harper arrived to accept three plaques officially honoring the fallen officers. “It’s been a struggling year,” Harper said. “At every [police] event, we have to deal with challenges. It’s been a humbling experience when you see groups pull together.”
After the exhibition, the Carnegie Mellon team departed to Wooster College, where they competed in a four-day tournament. The tournament consisted of three competing teams from colleges and universities. The Carnegie Mellon team returned victorious, winning all of their matches.

A Conversation with Anne Applebaum
Tuesday, April 6 at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing, Baker Hall 136A
From 1988 to 1991, Anne Applebaum covered the collapse of communism as the Warsaw correspondent of The Economist magazine. Since then, she has worked as a columnist at several British newspapers and as the foreign and deputy editor of London’s Spectator magazine, and she currently works as a columnist for the Washington Post and Slate.
Her 2004 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Gulag: A History, narrates the history of and daily life in the Soviet concentration camps. In producing the book, Applebaum had permission to view recently opened Russian archives, memoirs, and interviews. Currently, she is researching the Stalinization of post-war Central Europe for a new book.
Global Health and the Global Economic Crisis
Thursday, April 8 at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter 100)
Solomon Benatar will talk about the ever-changing global financial crisis and how it reveals both the state of the fragile global economy as well as major long-term implications of the economy being unfair for global health and human flourishing. 
According to Benatar, it is a critical time in world history, as our relationship to understanding and working to counteract the negative effects of modern life on climate change and our natural environment is more important than ever. If we want to have a large impact regarding global health and environmental security, it is necessary that we become more deeply introspective about our value system and also reconsider what needs to be done to ensure long-lasting human flourishing. 
One proposed theory says that belief in endless economic growth and an emphasis on a completely medicalized approach to health needs must be replaced by a vision of healthy human life that is achievable and sustainable for more of the world’s population.
Benatar is a professor emeritus of medicine and the director of the Joint Bioethics Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. He is also a professor in the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

The Comet and the Tornado
A book authored by Carnegie Mellon professor Don Marinelli featuring the late Randy Pausch has been released. Called The Comet and the Tornado, it is an account of the author’s time working with Pausch, the inspiring Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and co-author of The Last Lecture. Marinelli, the current executive producer of the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), writes of his personal experiences during his time as an assistant head of the drama department at Carnegie Mellon and after he helped to co-found the ETC with Pausch. The book’s events focus on the time that he and Pausch worked together in the ETC. 
The roots of the book’s title stem from a nickname — a “tornado” — Pausch called Marinelli during the Last Lecture he gave at Carnegie Mellon, and Marinelli decided that “the comet” was an appropriate description for Paush’s life and work. 
A unique feature of the book is that each copy comes with a synthetic interview, created by the ETC and the computer science department, where the reader is able to hold a conversation with a person “as if they were available in real time.”
The Carnegie Mellon bookstore is presenting a reading and book signing session with Marinelli on April 16, from noon to 2 p.m. in the University Center.
Amy Burkert to succeed Nair
On August 1, Amy Burkert will transition from her current positions in the Mellon College of Sciences to the vice provost for education. 
Burkert’s work at Carnegie Mellon has been significant, including accomplishments in the biological science field and in helping to create interdisciplinary programs such as the Science and Humanities Scholars program and the Bachelor of Science and Arts. She has also had a role in creating the major in biological sciences and psychology, a biomedical engineering minor for non-engineering students, and a minor in health care policy and management. Burkert currently serves as assistant dean for the Health Professions Program and Educational Initiatives and as a professor in the department of biological sciences.
Other initiatives have included working with others to create the first-year course “Eureka,” which combines knowledge and skills in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematical sciences. She was a key participant in developing the course “Biotechnology Impacting Our Selves, Societies, and Spheres.” 
Burkert will be succeeding Indira Nair, a professor in engineering and public policy, who is retiring after having worked at Carnegie Mellon for the past 32 years.

Balancing homework, jobs, and extracurricular activities simultaneously, the average Carnegie Mellon student is no stranger to stress. As the school year wraps up and exams approach — along with numerous other obligations, assignments, and responsibilities — students may find it interesting to learn that April is National Anxiety and Stress Awareness Month. With this in mind, let's set aside the textbooks and take a look at the numbers concerning stress in the United States:
The number of American adults ages 18 and older who have an anxiety disorder: 40 million
The percentage of Americans who would welcome help in dealing with stress in their lives: 66 percent
The percentage of American workers who are unhappy in their current job environment due to work-related stress: 70 percent
The percentage of Americans who leave their jobs due to stress at the workplace: 33 percent

Endorsements are tricky.
We at The Tartan have read the candidates’ platforms, interviewed each of them, hosted the debates, and worked with many of the candidates within our own organization and through covering student government over the past year. An endorsement of a candidate compiles all of this knowledge and provides an additional, or possibly the only, reason for a student to vote for a candidate.
We have already described in recent issues the lack of general student body interest in student government and the vacancies in Undergraduate Student Senate this year, and we attempted early in the election season to convince you that student government is in fact important and worth paying attention to. Whether or not we have succeeded in these goals, we will now explain our own evaluation of the candidates and the reasons for the following endorsements.
You might cynically say: Well, of course we should endorse Gross; he is the only candidate running for this position. We would not endorse him if we were not confident that he deserved our votes. Gross has been an active member of a number of clubs and organizations on campus, as well as an excellent leader for Undergraduate Student Senate. He is thorough, meticulous, and organized, and he has a strong and compelling vision for the role of the VPO. Moreover, he is extremely personable and will be easily approachable for all of the varied student organizations that will benefit from his direction next year. 
All of these things are evidenced in his long and detailed platform. While we believe that setting forth 14 different platform initiatives — many of which are large and complex projects in their own right — presents a challenge for a candidate to live up to, if anyone can accomplish most of these projects, it is certainly Gross. We have complete faith that he is the perfect person to define the future for organizations at Carnegie Mellon.
With Robert Piston withdrawing from the race, we are left with two remaining VPF candidates to select from: Shanel Buchanan and Eric Wu. While Buchanan and Wu have both served on the Joint Funding Committee, a major component of the role of the VPF, their other work differentiates them. Buchanan’s platform was nearly non-existent; her answers at the debate, while competent, were lacking vision; and she has not solidly pulled from her experience as the treasurer of other organizations. 
On the other hand, Wu’s experience with Student Senate as well as his clear vision for continuing current VPF Nara Kasbergen’s goals of growing the JFC are well prepared, and we believe he will provide strong leadership for the JFC. We do question his plan to interview JFC reps as a part of the application process, as it is already difficult to find potential representatives. However, we are interested to see how he will work to separate the role of VPF from solely chair of the JFC to a larger student-advocacy role regarding university finances.
Finally, for the role of student body president, we have decided not to endorse a candidate. As described, we endorse candidates whom we believe deserve your votes. Unfortunately, this year we believe none of the three tickets has presented a compelling case for their candidacy. Each of the three has advantages and disadvantages, with none standing significantly above the others.
Casey Brander and Matt Sandler have provided a spectacle we have not witnessed in recent years. They are stark, honest, derisive, and pro-cyborg. While some have attacked them for mocking the process or turning democracy into performance art, they have followed every rule and made their method work within the system. They have brought a fresh perspective to the elections, but they have not shown a clear grasp of the issues or a commitment to the goals of the student body. As much as we actually would enjoy two-ply bathroom toilet paper, we don’t believe their platform or their experience is enough to back them in this election.
Michael Surh and Micah Rosa excelled in the debate. They were well spoken, able to explain their innovative platform, and showed an understanding of this campus as well as student government. However, even with new and creative ideas, we are not sure a website and employment opportunities are what we need student government to focus on over the next year. Their platform and background is different, also in a way we haven’t seen before. It is conservative, fiscally focused, and likely not what the student body is seeking.
Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith should have captured our endorsement easily. With Adams’ student government experience (the only candidate with any) and Smith’s committed involvement in Greek life, the pair seems to be the obvious choice. However, their performance at the debates was weak, their answers vague, and their ideas even less clear. Reading their extensive platform is an exercise in double-speak. They want reform but give no examples; they want more lectures, more Greek involvement, more unity, and more transparency, but at no point do they explain how they will achieve any of these goals. They might have the most experience, but they have the least substance.

You just might have heard about Apple’s newest device, the iPad. This device has polarized the high-tech industry, with people either loving it or hating it, and few standing in the middle ground. Now that the much-anticipated device has actually debuted, it is time to end the wild speculation that has filled the media for the last three months and consider the opposing viewpoints on the device and its impact on the tech market.
The major selling point of the iPad has been users’ ability to consume text content in new and innovative ways. After using the iPad, we came to the consensus that it does perform its role as a magazine- or book-replacement device very well. Magazine content, particularly the Popular Science application, has been re-rendered in a way that pushes the boundaries of the traditional magazine. In particular, articles are contiguous, rather than being shattered and cast about the pages, and while there are still some kinks to work out, the innovation is clear. Another great leap into the future comes from the Marvel Comics application, which displays comic books at the full resolution of the device, rather than limiting rendering to the resolution of the printer. In addition, the application allows the user to zoom in on a particular panel, enlarging it and allowing the reader to catch more detail and appreciate the hard work that goes into the art of a comic book.
As impressive as all of this is, there are, inevitably, drawbacks. The brightness of the screen may preclude reading for extended periods of time, but without the brightness the rendering of the Popular Science and Marvel Comics applications would be lost. The device is also very difficult to use outdoors for the same reasons. Thus, the iPad will not replace physical books or other e-reader devices. The design of the Popular Science and Marvel Comics applications is not anything that couldn’t be implemented using Flash or HTML5, but the iPad is bringing these new designs from concept into reality.
There are some things that the iPad has significantly improved. The Brushes application, initially produced for the iPhone, will be undeniably improved by the larger surface area of the iPad. Similarly, there is little question that casual games popularized by the iPhone will benefit from the increased screen size. However, this does not mean that existing iPhone applications will automatically be improved on the iPad. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The iPad allows existing applications to be used either in a mode that emulates the iPhone screen size or in a mode that expands the application to take up the entire screen. In the former mode, the applications seem shrunken and insufficient, and the iPad fails to live up the expectations of a new device. In the latter mode, the application becomes blocky and pixelated, stretched beyond its means to fill a role it was never meant to have. 
For the full promise of gaming on the device to be reached, iPad games need to be designed with the larger screen in mind. Even then, there is no expectation that the iPad will replace full computer systems for the “hardcore” gaming crowd.
One of the great advantages that Apple continues to leverage in their product design is their willingness to make decisions that, though restricting for consumers, allow them to simplify the design of the product. For example, Apple continues to produce hand-held devices that are not user-serviceable. Like the iPod and iPhone, there is no easy way to change the battery in the iPad. In fact, if you go to the Apple Store and request a battery change, a “service” that will cost $100, they will not take your device into the back and change the battery — they will just hand you an entirely new device. Though many decry this as a great detriment to the long-term usefulness of the device, this policy allows Apple to pack their devices with more technology in less space. This gives Apple a competitive edge in a market that demands smaller and smaller devices but refuses to sacrifice functionality.
One restriction that should be lifted is the requirement to own an additional computer to use the device. After pulling an iPad out of the box, it will not do anything until it has been tethered to a computer with iTunes. Requiring an increasingly over-bloated iTunes to simply fill out a registration form is a fantastically stupid choice, destroying the possible market of people who could get by with an iPad as their primary computer. All Apple needs to do is update their software and add a registration form, requiring an iTunes account, to remove this barrier.
In summary, the iPad is an excellent device on its technical merits. It is also clear that the device will change the way we think about some print media. However, its impact on other markets is still unclear, even after launch day. The talk about the iPad continues to be about its potential and not about the difference it has made.

“There is a thin curtain between invasion and cooperation-assistance.”
So said Afghan President Hamid Karzai in a speech last Thursday. But, if there is also a thin curtain between political necessity in a war-torn nation and abuse of power, Karzai is dangerously close to the wrong side. The past months have seen a cooling of his relationship with the United States, but more importantly they have seen an increasing trend toward the centralization of power. Signs of corruption in his government have been present for years, but they seem particularly dire in light of recent events. 
Karzai must reform his administration and accept the balance of power or he will lose all legitimacy — and, with it, any hope of a stable government in Afghanistan.
Though several of Karzai’s actions over the past months warrant concern, a few are particularly egregious. The first of these was the widespread fraud in Afghanistan’s presidential election last year. In the first ballot, Karzai received over 54 percent of the vote, but the election commission investigated nearly 20 percent of polling stations for fraud. Karzai initially refused a run-off vote, and though he eventually allowed one, it never occurred because his opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, withdrew from the race. Abdullah cited his lack of faith in a fair election when he left the race.
It is easy to cynically assert that fair and free elections are simply impossible in Afghanistan, a country that suffered under the Taliban for seven years and has since experienced over eight years of conflict. And while truly democratic elections with high turnout may be idealistic, the future of Afghanistan is not so bleak that we should accept fraud without complaint. Some pre-election opinion polls gave Abdullah over 30 percent of the vote. The Afghan people are not blind to the events in their country, but they must be able to have their opinions heard.
In fact, the problems Karzai is creating within Afghanistan pose as much of a threat as his foreign policy failures. Many in Afghanistan blame him for economic problems as well as government corruption. He has not taken firm steps to control the poppy trade that funds Taliban fighters. The hope of a prosperous and reborn Afghanistan that existed after the fall of the Taliban government has only partially come to pass, and Karzai’s is the most recognizable face associated with this failure.
As if the widespread election fraud in 2009 were not enough, in February Karzai audaciously changed the composition of an electoral commission that investigates allegations of fraud. Previously, three of the five members were appointed by the United Nations and two were appointed by the president. Karzai now appoints the entire commission.
The lower house of the Afghan Parliament rejected the change last Wednesday, though questions remain as to if and when the commission will return to its former composition. In the meantime, the dispute has already destroyed much of the little legitimacy Karzai still had. Western nations were outraged after the February announcement, with President Barack Obama revoking a diplomatic invitation to his Afghan counterpart. Karzai responded by extending a diplomatic invitation to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Relations between the US and Afghanistan have been low for the last few months, though Obama visited Afghanistan and met with Karzai last week.
It’s possible that there is some reasonable explanation for all of these events. Karzai has an incredibly difficult job. He deserves, perhaps, the benefit of the doubt when it comes to Afghan politics. Fortunately, he explained his views on the election fraud and his reasons for changing the election commission.
“There is no doubt that the fraud was very widespread, but this fraud was not committed by Afghans — it was committed by foreigners,” Karzai said, according to The New York Times. “There is a thin curtain between invasion and cooperation-assistance.”
The next time American agents commit voter fraud in Afghanistan, perhaps they’ll have the foresight to elect someone else.

Last Thursday, April 1, Google changed its name to Topeka for the day. 
This tongue-in-cheek humor recognized one of the most absurd of a number of desperate attempts by cities across the nation to win Google’s contest for free high-speed broadband. 
For the entire month of March, the city of Topeka, Kan. unofficially changed its name to Google. Topeka is not the only community to take extreme measures to draw the search giant’s attention. One city executive in Minnesota jumped into the freezing waters of Lake Superior to show his dedication. Another official promised in jest (we hope) to start naming babies after the company.
Here in Pittsburgh, there is a concerted “Pittsburgh Goes Google” movement. You probably received the official communication e-mail from President Cohon asking for your support. Perhaps you participated in the stunt to spell “Google” in the middle of Downtown.
Efforts like these draw laughter, but they also indicate a deeper concern. Google — a corporation with a responsibility to its shareholders, not the public — is exerting tremendous influence in American society. Local governments across the United States are going to extreme lengths to appease the company.
We are concerned that these actions end up serving private interests over those of the public.
Political lobbying by corporate entities is an established feature of American politics. Google’s lobbying budget exceeds $1 million. The role of lobbyists has been examined and criticized for decades, but the influence Google has on government today extends far beyond its teams of lawyers. Instead of Google lobbying city governments, these leaders are lobbying Google. We wonder how many resources are being used to appeal to Google that could be better used improving the lives of ordinary Americans.
There is no doubt that Google’s broadband initiative will do wonders wherever it is installed. But cities with Google mania overlook the company’s ultimate goal of profit. The private and public sectors do not share the same priorities. 
While The Tartan appreciates the many innovations Google has brought to us, we believe that governments should be accountable to their constituents, not to a corporate giant.

In 1965, Mikhail Bakhtin defined the often-misunderstood and subversive term “the carnivalesque” in Rabelais and His World. It is the temporary overturning of the dominant culture governing a space — in this case, academics at Carnegie Mellon.
But I’m not here to sell you on Carnival. You already know that the four days of relaxation are a welcome reprieve from the normal hustle and bustle of classes, especially this far into the school year. I’m writing to you — the staff, faculty, students, and others of the campus community — to explain to you just how much you’ll regret it if you don’t make it out to watch the Buggy races this year.
Like Bakhtin’s term, the students who live and breathe Buggy are often misunderstood. What are they doing on Frew Street at 2 a.m. on a Wednesday? Why is there duct tape stuck to their shoes? Why didn’t they sleep last night — and what is in their hair?
But Carnival is your chance to learn. Two years ago, Pi Kappa Alpha, the team with the longest winning streak in Buggy history, broke a 20-year course record set by SPIRIT Racing Systems in 1988. Last year, Student Dormitory Council broke that record by a full second — a huge chunk of time in a two-minute race. This year’s races are anyone’s game, and this is the best year yet to come out and watch records being shattered.
Buggy is unquestionably Carnegie Mellon’s strongest and most unique tradition. It is perhaps the strongest pull bringing alumni — both recent and of yore — back to campus. It is largely the reason why many class reunions were moved from Homecoming to Carnival this year. 
And on this race day, we celebrate Buggy’s 90th anniversary with more pomp and circumstance than ever before. There will be two huge Jumbotron screens — one at the top of Tech Street and one at the corner of Schenley Drive and Frew Street, in the Chute — to make it easier for you to watch the whole race from your favorite spot around the course. We have a brand new timing system to increase the accuracy and integrity of the races, and to underscore how technologically advanced the sport has become over the last 90 years.
I invite you to witness this incredible tradition this year, regardless of how well you understand mechanical engineering, pushing technology, or petite female drivers (not that the Buggy mechanics themselves do, even after all this time). I promise you won’t regret it.
Jessica Thurston is 2010 Buggy chair.
