To battle the dual pandemics of racism and COVID-19, it takes all of us. 
We've got to meet in the middle and work together. Meeting in the middle might mean splitting the difference with the 17 percent of adults who believe QAnon. It might mean sharing with the majority of Republicans who still believe the election was stolen. But everybody could be a little kinder!
So, this Super Bowl, be sure to hug your neighbor. We've all got to just turn the temperature down and relax.
Now is the time when we should be celebrating, not fighting. Our healthcare workers have been working so hard to battle the pandemic. We appreciate them so much that we wanted to gather thousands of them and our fans from across the country to show how much we care. This is what it's really all about.
And what better place to honor our healthcare workers, help fight against COVID, and recommit ourselves to ending racism than the Super Bowl. This year, of course, there were a lot of changes. We wrote "end racism" in the endzones (don't mind "Chiefs" written in bold under it). We offered all the NFL stadiums for use as vaccination centers. But just in case you thought we were being too nice, we even invited anti-mask Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. I'm sure he can smell the championship coming for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
For everybody watching from home, make sure to wear a mask. Remember how I said it takes all of us? Well, as I said, some of us aren't going to be wearing masks. You know, exercising our freedom and all. So, some of you have to double up to make up for that. But it's worth it! 
Just think of all the joy the NFL brings to this country. This is going to be great! But, for you scoundrels going to Super Bowl parties: how dare you. In a pandemic? I can't think of a worse thing to do when COVID is running wild. Anyways, there's no way the big game could backfire. And if it does, it wasn't me or the fans. It's those college kids who always celebrate afterward. 
I can't foresee that happening at all.

The 2021 International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) World Championships were held in Altenberg, Germany last week. Originally scheduled to be held in Lake Placid, New York, the competition was moved to its 2020 host because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A number of athletes were familiar with the Altenberg track, including American Kaillie Humphries, the defending champion of the two-woman bobsleigh from the 2020 IBSF World Championships. After two runs, Humphries and teammate Lolo Jones found themselves leading by just over a third of a second. While their run three time was third overall, their lead, coupled with a very strong run four, secured Humphries and Jones the gold in two-woman bobsleigh — Humphries’ fourth gold and her second in two years, won on the same track.
Humphries then added to her medal collection in the women’s monobob (single-person bobsleigh) — the event debuting for the first time at a World Championships. Although she started with a fourth-place run one, three successive table-topping runs gave her a fifth gold medal, ahead of her closest competitor by half a second and the only athlete in the competition to total a time of fewer than four minutes.
Having become the first woman to win four World Championships (and then quickly topping it with a fifth), Humphries will likely look to tie the record for the most Olympic medals won by an individual bobsled athlete in the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) hosted the previously-postponed 2020 Club World Cup in Qatar this past week, in which the winners of each continental league — the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League, the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Champions League, the Copa Libertadores, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) Champions League, and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League — along with the champions of the host nation’s league played against each other in a knockout competition.
Originally meant to be played in December of last year, the competition was delayed in consideration of the ongoing pandemic. New Zealand’s quarantine measures also resulted in OFC champions Auckland City withdrawing from the tournament, with the first round win being awarded to their would-be opponents, host Qatar’s Al-Duhail.
In the second round, Al-Duhail found themselves unable to capitalize on their chances and, despite registering 15 shots to CAF champions Al Ahly’s seven, a mistake by the Al-Duhail defense in the 30th minute gave the Egyptian side’s Hussein El Shahat the chance to put a well-placed goal into the back of the net — the only goal of the game. Concurrently, CONCACAF champions Tigres UANL faced AFC champions Ulsan Hyundai. Kim Kee-hee opened the scoring for Ulsan with a powerful header in the 24th minute, but two goals by Tigres’ André-Pierre Gignac put the Mexican side through to the next round.
Gignac would prove vital in the semi-final, as the French national scored the game-winning penalty against Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras after a foul in the box. Meanwhile, some lovely teamwork by UEFA champions Bayern Munich gave Robert Lewandowski two goals, putting them past Al Ahly.
Bayern continued to put up a strong performance in the final, and despite a valiant performance, Tigres UANL found themselves having a hard time getting past Bayern’s defense, totaling only a single shot on target in comparison to Bayern’s nine. The tournament-winning goal came in the 59th minute courtesy of Benjamin Pavard, securing the sextuple for the German side.
The 2020 FIFA Club World Cup was a host of achievements — Brazilian official Edina Alves Batista became the first woman to officiate at a senior FIFA men’s tournament, Tigres UANL became the first CONCACAF side to reach the FIFA Club World Cup finals, and champions Bayern Munich became the second-ever European team in history to win all six titles — the domestic treble, plus the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and the V — in a single calendar year.

This past Wednesday, The Tartan hosted Douglas Borthwick, a Carnegie Mellon University alumnus and the chief marketing and business development officer of INX Limited, a cryptocurrency trading company. Borthwick spoke to students about his robust experience in the finance industry, his perspective on cryptocurrencies and their exchanges, and his advice to the future generation of potential traders.
He opened his talk by touching on his experience in the conventional finance industry. Having worked on both the New York and London Exchanges, as well as at Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, Borthwick is no stranger to the intricacies of the industry. But as time went on and his job in proprietary risk-taking was outlawed, he began looking for new opportunities.
“I was growing tired of foreign exchange,” Borthwick said. “I had to find something new to do, and so I was looking around and figured that the crypto space is very interesting.”
At the time, the cryptocurrency space, however lucrative, had no regulation. This led to companies using initial coin offerings (ICOs) to illegally raise billions of dollars from American citizens. But Borthwick and his now CEO were looking for more regulation.
They spent three years and $3.5 million working with lawyers and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create the first-ever digital security that retailers could buy, Borthwick said. INX Limited is also setting up a cryptocurrency trading business and a novel security token trading business.
“People want to have more control over the securities they own, and we have created the exact security to let that happen," Borthwick said. "On the way out the door, the chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton, said that he could see all assets moving onto the blockchain.”
Borthwick believes that due to the rise of cryptocurrencies, people do not need to use banks anymore. He says that although there is skepticism regarding cryptocurrency, skepticism always follows new technology. He believes there are huge opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, especially for the younger generation since they are constantly exposed to new technology. As he claimed, “When you grasp it and when you jump on it, you can actually do very very well for yourself."
"Believe in yourself," Borthwick said. "Take a view and go with it because there is a huge change about to happen in the U.S. banking system, and you have the power to actually benefit from it.”

Carnegie Mellon students and faculty are always engaged in some awesome research projects, and this section of SciTech is intended to highlight some of the work happening right on campus! Read on to learn about a few of the recent developments that might have flown under your radar.
Carnegie Mellon University students train AI to write book of limericks
With all the rhyming, witty phrasing, and creative imagery that goes into every verse, it’s hard to come up with good poetry. That’s why, as a way to assess the creativity of machines, it’s common to try and get artificial intelligence to write coherent poetry after analyzing thousands of human examples. 
Using the open-source language model GPT-2, Mitch Fogelson, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering, along with Xinkai Chen, who completed the Master of Information Systems Management program in December 2020; Qifei Dong, a master's degree candidate in electrical and computer engineering; Christopher Dare, a master's degree candidate in information and communication technology; and Tony Qin, a junior artificial intelligence major, generated thousands of limericks after training on a database of 90,000 human-written ones. Picking the top 100 to 200 limericks from the whole collection, they have since published it in the first book of AI-generated limericks called For You, Humans. Read more about it here
Sloan Foundation provides funding for Robot Archive
Robotics has come a long way, and as with any developing area of study, it’s important to remember the historical breakthroughs and pioneers that made today's technologies possible. To better preserve the history of robotics, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has awarded $150,000 to the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries to fund the research into the creation of the Robot Archive, a multiphase, multiyear program to create the preeminent archive dedicated to the preservation and curation of the history of robotics. Though online for the first phase, the Robot Archive hopes to eventually hold exhibitions and conferences, as well as create a laboratory-style museum to display their collection.
This is a massive undertaking that will involve the School of Computer Science, cross-campus partners, and a team of multidisciplinary archivists and information professionals. Read more about it here.
Understanding the forces that shape an organ
The human body is a complicated biological machine replete with countless interdependent systems. Understanding these systems is crucial, especially as we look towards a future where living tissue can be bioengineered for specific use cases, such as for organ transplants.
One area that has stumped researchers is how complex three-dimensional physiological forces direct and affect organ development. Thanks to the work of biomedical engineering and materials science engineering professor Adam Feinberg, along with postdoctoral fellow Dan Shiwarski and graduate student Joshua Tashman, we now have a better understanding of such forces through their novel nanomechanical biosensor. Read more about it here.
Direct access to the human brain
The brain is one of the most important organs in the human body, being the seat of sensation, thought, reason, and emotion. As expected of an organ so incredibly complicated in its design and operation, studying it is an astronomical feat in and of itself.
That has not stopped some from trying to develop better methods for this undertaking, and recently, Maysam Chamanzar of Carnegie Mellon University and Azadeh Yazdan of the University of Washington have received a National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 grant to create a dura smart port that will allow direct access to the brain using optical and electrical stimulation. This new technology will allow for better recording of cortical areas while minimizing the risk to exposed brain tissue. Read more about it here.

A note for the reader: please read this in a dry, monotone, depressed voice in your head or out loud. That’s the mood I was in when I wrote this.
Valentine’s Day is one of the worst times of the year, and like the masochist I am, I like to make myself feel worse by watching bad romantic movies. It’s all the fantasies you can never even fathom having, but terrible. Anyway, I watched two of these trash heap movies to really double my pain this weekend. At this point, I am just trying to weaken my heart at an exponential rate. 
Malcolm and Marie
There’s a line in this movie where Zendaya’s character says, “Do you think that the movie would be as good as it is if we weren’t together?” to John David Washington’s character. Upon having watched this twice to determine if this was good or not, I think that was just Zendaya genuinely asking that question to her co-star. 
This movie is bizarre. I have seen comparisons of this movie to Marriage Story, but I think that’s a disservice to Marriage Story and a disservice to the actors because they’re not in a movie as good as Marriage Story. The dialogue is just unbearable. The only things that kept my eyes glued to the screen were Zendaya and John David Washington’s magnetic performances and the admittedly beautiful cinematography and editing. There is clearly a good visual direction and I was expecting more from writer/director Sam Levinson given how good Euphoria is. Upon watching this, it’s very apparent that he has a great visual eye but that he just can’t write or work alone.
The best way to describe this script is that it’s a bad knockoff of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? That play, similar to this movie, also has a story about two characters in their house arguing for the entire duration of the play, which ultimately reveals how horrible their relationship is. At least the play the movie is ripping off has a story, an arc with personable characters, and good dialogue. Honestly, Malcolm and Marie was not too bad in the beginning. But the further the movie goes along, it just looks like Sam Levinson gave up writing. It’s like he told a bot to look in a dictionary and automatically generate sentences that are supposed to sound genuine but are actually just pretentious art student garbage. 
The conflict in this story literally does not matter. What makes Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Marriage Story so good is that the small petty arguments that characters have about random things have stakes involved. These stakes are derived from larger and deeper conflicts, such as the characters getting divorced, that are influencing those small petty ones. That is what emphasizes the depth to which the relationships in those stories were flawed. 
Unfortunately, the conflict here is barely developed. Frankly, I don’t even remember it. I guess it’s something vague about John David Washington forgetting to thank Zendaya in his award speech, so she gets mad that he doesn’t respect her, which is then supposed to develop into this really deep thing about toxic relationships. Except the whole story forgot to do the developing part and the deep part. Real people don’t argue as these characters do in this movie. It comes off so pathetic because the whole time, I did not give a single unit of care for what they were arguing about, and everything they said to each other was so repetitive and one-note. 
On top of that, we also never really see either character do anything that makes us actually believe they love each other or question why the relationship is so toxic. To make another comparison, both Marriage Story and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? show the characters doing things out of their love for each other. Both stories also show the awful things they do that are rooted in their hatred for each other and how that hatred comes from a painful place of former love. I suppose this movie couldn’t do that due to the filming constraints during the pandemic. But in that case, write a movie around those constraints instead of writing whatever this was. 
Despite all this, I can’t say I hated the movie. I found that if I turned off the volume and imagined my own dialogue and story to supplement the visuals, it’s a good movie. Sam Levinson should not write. He should be behind the camera where he belongs, telling the people what to do. This movie reminds me of Harry’s Quidditch game in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when Lockhart accidentally removes his bones. Sure, Harry’s still got the arm, but it’s absolutely useless without the bones. 
Not Cool
I think I found it y’all. I found the worst movie ever made. 
I am honestly in shock with this. I suppose it makes sense this is super bad considering this is a YouTube movie directed by and starring Shane Dawson, who is also one of the worst kinds of people. But, my god, this is somehow awful even by his standards. For those who don’t know, Shane Dawson is an awful YouTuber whose career was built around shocking and offensive content, such as saying racial slurs and inappropriate comments about pedophilia. He was also extremely toxic to everyone on the set of this movie and every other thing he’s worked on. Naturally, his career was canceled due to that, and he absolutely deserves it. 
It is without a shadow of a doubt that Not Cool is the most insulting thing I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe that the movie is nearly seven years old, and, despite Shane Dawson’s career dying, YouTube still expects us to pay money for this crap (don’t worry, I didn’t pay for it). 
Unlike the film masterpiece Love on a Leash, which has a gripping story with a lot of character action, this movie has none, so it feels like you’re being waterboarded with incessant screaming for 10 hours. I think 70 percent of the dialogue is delivered with just a bunch of screaming. It’s like a bad YouTube sketch forced into a feature-length movie, which makes sense because it’s Shane Dawson.
It is every cliché of the high school romantic comedy wrapped into a directionless package where no one does anything, and every single character is just the worst human ever. I criticized Malcolm and Marie for not having good characters, but at least half the characters in Not Cool should be imprisoned. I say this as someone who is a prison abolitionist. It’s also weird how everyone in this movie is obsessed with how attractive Shane Dawson looks even though he looks exactly like the kind of guy who kicks puppies and says racial slurs for fun. Which, again, makes sense because it’s Shane Dawson.
For this next bit, I would like to offer a trigger warning for the poor readers reading this because I am about to discuss just how grossly offensive this movie is regarding every possible topic you can think of. It’s, unfortunately, a necessity to do this because it’s the biggest reason why this movie is as terrible as it is. I would also like to remind the reader here that the main ensemble of this movie is supposed to consist of high school students. It’s easy to forget that since all of the actors are clearly in their mid-20s. If you don’t want to read this part, please skip the next four paragraphs.
One of my favorite shows is It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which has a notoriously dark and pretty messed up sense of humor. Yet it generally skirts the line and makes it funny because the jokes provide commentary and generally don’t punch down. There’s a joke in the first episode where one of the guys, Charlie, doesn’t understand that he isn’t supposed to say the N-word out loud in any context, which he accidentally says in public when trying to prove to his friends and to the waitress he likes that he isn’t racist. His friends react appropriately to Charlie’s gaffe, but what’s funny is that both of his friends are also unaware of how racist they are. The joke is very extreme and admittedly isn’t the best of the jokes in the show. But it is also entirely at the expense of the idiotic main characters, and there are plenty of other very messed up jokes like that that are much funnier. This movie is trying to be a high school romantic comedy combined with elements of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s type of humor, but it’s honestly just the worst thing ever. 
There’s a joke that a Black, homeless man is eating his own poop out of a cup in the lobby of a high school. There’s nothing else to it. That’s the joke. In fact, there are three jokes about this “character.” There is a joke about an Indian guy who harasses everyone at a party but then gets panicked when a classmate throws out his grandmother’s ashes. There’s an extended joke about how the “crazy aunt” is a schizophrenic whose voices in her head are telling her to kill her family. There’s also an extended joke where the mother of Shane Dawson’s romantic interest wants to hook up with Shane Dawson’s high school-aged character. Before that part, there is also a joke where this same mother is sucking the fingers of her older daughter’s fiancé right in front of her, but the older daughter doesn’t notice because she’s a “dumb blonde.” I don’t understand why this movie thinks that predatory behavior towards children is funny. 
It’s even worse when the characters in the movie do abhorrent things, but those actions are treated as comedic moments or as dramatic moments meant to develop the romantic arcs. The characters in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia are all awful people, but the joke is that they’re unaware of how horrible they are and how it ultimately comes back to bite them. For example, in the episode “D.E.N.N.I.S System,” Dennis describes to the gang how he emotionally manipulates women to get laid, which impresses the other guys and horrifies his sister Dee. So for the rest of the episode, the rest of the guys try to copy Dennis’s emotionally manipulative system which culminates in all of them miserably failing in their romantic pursuits. They absolutely deserved to fail due to how horrible they all are and it’s hilarious. In the subsequent episodes, we see them continue to fail at being functioning human beings and continue to destroy everyone around them and themselves. 
In this movie, it’s the complete opposite. There’s an entire sequence where one of the really creepy main characters spills a drink on his romantic interest and is cleaning her up, but the joke is that he is inappropriately touching and harassing her. It’s not funny, and it’s deeply disturbing. But that’s the kicking off point of their romantic arc. There’s another egregious scene that stuck out that’s so bad that I won’t fully describe it. The summary of it is that Shane Dawson’s character is assaulted at a party by his ex-girlfriend and his romantic interest walks in on it and thinks the two are hooking up. That entire sequence is a punchline about sexual assault but yet it also is meant to serve as the emotional low point for the two characters. It is extremely tonally inconsistent and doesn’t work, obviously. Nothing about this movie works, at all. 
The movie is also set in Pittsburgh, or at least there are some scenes with bad green screen backdrops of Pittsburgh, so that’s the final nail in the coffin for this. Don’t watch this. This movie made me angry, and as awful as Valentine’s Day is, it’s certainly not this awful. That’s it for the reviews. 
Unhappy Valentine’s Day to you all. Love is fake. 
P.S: Also, don’t watch To All The Boys: Always and Forever because that’s a terrible movie as well. If you do want to watch a good movie, watch Judas and the Black Messiah. It’s on HBO Max and it’s awesome.

In my sophomore year, I worked on an art film with two friends, and it was a great experience. We smoked cigarettes, shot some footage, and talked for hours about critical theorists like Lacan, Butler, and Derrida (Foucault? More like, Fouc-ko am I right?). Unfortunately, I lack internship experience because I was unable to afford unpaid internships. Plus, I don’t want to do unpaid labor for the corporate system. I’m applying to jobs since I’m graduating in a few months, but the 369 positions I’ve applied to haven’t called me back for an interview. Do you think it’s because I discuss the movie project on my resume as “creating work that directly implicates Hollywood in the perpetuation of phallocentric thinking and the phallus itself?”
-- @ConfusedPenalStudies
Dear @CPS,
It’s important to remember that the Class of 2021 is graduating into an impossible economic situation. Make sure to cut yourself some slack. Personally, I’ve already applied to nearly 30 different positions, and I haven’t heard back from most, with the others sending me their “Thanks, but no thanks” emails.  
While I don’t make reference to certain elements of my own penile education on my own resume (for I too have learned the way of penis theory), it may behoove you to leave it on yours. Ultimately, it will come down to what you look for in a position and what the employer is looking for. Would you want to work for an employer that doesn’t understand the fallacy of the rational man? Does the employer want someone who understands that?
If anyone tries to tell you “the right way” to construct a resume and cover letter, they’re likely selling you snake oil. Take, for example, a college’s career and professional development center which uses a computer algorithm to tell you the success of your resume on a color-coded scale. The right way to construct a resume for that algorithm might not be right for a different algorithm or a different human. Maybe someone will like your chutzpah. Maybe someone will see the word “phallus” and light your resume on fire.
Gainful employment is hard to come by these days. Credentialism and meritocratic thinking run rampant because 36 percent of Americans have completed a Bachelor’s degree or higher and roughly another third have completed some college. However, the last 10 years has seen the rate of labor force participation decrease by 3.1 percent for adults with Bachelor’s degrees and 5.1 percent for adults with some college. 
Sincerely,
Advice for awkward people

Encased in a cage of lattice aluminum strips, Scaife Hall’s appearance was unique. A partially-underground lecture hall with a curved roof, referred to by many as the “Pringle,” or the “chip,” protruded from the building’s rectangular frame. To some, Scaife was a rare example of a building that was as ugly to look at as it was to look out from. To those with a soft spot for mid-century modern quirk, the building had charm. 
When Alan M. Scaife Hall opened in the fall of 1962, it boasted several modern features. It had air conditioning. The basement housed Carnegie Tech’s nuclear engineering lab. The top floor held a newly constructed version of the school’s already famed computation center. Scaife Hall came as part of a $29 million, 10-year development program that resulted in other campus fixtures like Hunt Library and Skibo Gymnasium. 
At the building’s October 1962 dedication, former Mellon Institute President Edward Weidlein expressed excitement in the building’s “outstanding modern facilities.” In a comment to The Tartan, then-University President John Warner said that the building “will enable Carnegie to keep pace with the enormous advances and changes taking place in engineering and the sciences.”
Though Scaife Hall may have been revolutionary in 1962, and perhaps also a mid-century architectural gem, by 2018, the engineering department had outgrown it. A replacement building was announced by University President Farnam Janahian in his 2018 inaugural address, funded partially by a $30 million grant from the Allegheny Foundation, a subsidiary of Scaife Foundations. In his address, Jahanian aired that because of this new facility, much like the original, Carnegie Mellon “will be better able to compete for the best students and faculty, driving Pittsburgh’s reputation as a hub for innovation.” The building’s total cost is expected to be $75 million.
The project is now well underway. Old Scaife Hall’s demolition is complete, and construction has officially begun on what is called New Scaife Hall. 
The new building promises to be as groundbreaking as its predecessor was in 1962 ー a university release touts “technology-rich labs; modern, flexible classrooms; and spaces that facilitate formal and informal collaborations.” The new facility will be twice as large, spilling two stories down into Junction Hollow. The university hopes that New Scaife will “encourage the development of novel areas of research,” and foster the College of Engineering’s “culture of Advanced Collaboration®” (a phrase the university trademarked in 2019). 
Construction of New Scaife is expected to fully conclude in March of 2023 according to Jennifer McDowell, the university’s director of design and construction. In a written response to The Tartan, McDowell stated that the building is set to have classrooms ready for instruction by the Fall semester of 2023.
Expanding the facility’s footprint two-fold in the same location requires some creativity. “The biggest physical challenge is the hillside dropping into Junction Hollow,” McDowell said, as the new building’s design “requires the installation of a number of earth-retaining structures to allow the bulk excavation to begin.” Current mockups of the building have it partitioned roughly in three, with a large rectangular cornerstone overhanging the drop off, a portal entrance that almost connects to Porter Hall, and a courtyard. Like its predecessor, the building will shade the sun with aluminum fins, but this time, no cage. 
One challenge in getting this facility built is its close proximity to both Roberts Hall and Porter Hall. “We must coordinate the new retaining structure adjacent to Roberts Hall and its existing retaining structure, which needs to remain in place,” McDowell said. She also added that “As always, we need to limit the disruption for our campus community.”
Regarding construction during the COVID-19 pandemic, McDowell stated that all “Contractors are required to have procedures and working rules in place to limit exposure between workers on site, in addition to members of our campus community.” She says that the university and its contractors are fully complying with “all laws and regulations, including Governor Wolf’s guidelines and the City of Pittsburgh PLI External Guidelines for Construction.”
McDowell, cutting through the nostalgia, said that “While the chip was an interesting feature of old Scaife, it was not a particularly efficient space for teaching and learning needs.” Still, she says, there is “much excitement for honoring and restoring the Scaife site as a significant campus entry and a destination for all of campus.” 
A live view of the Scaife construction site can be seen at the College of Engineering’s official stream.

Dr. Ibram X. Kendi explained that racism pervades Americans' thinking and emphasized that Americans are still far from achieving racial equality in a question-and-answer session for Carnegie Mellon University's University Lecture Series.
Kendi, the 2016 National Book Award winner for Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America and the founding director of Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research, spoke for the university's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Keynote Lecture. He expressed hopefulness for the future since a majority of Americans believe racism is a problem.
Still, Kendi highlighted areas where he believes Americans are not ready to support "big solutions" to end racism. He recalled the history of gradual abolitionists, saying "They advocated for a more gradual emancipation just as you have Americans today advocating for a more gradual equality."
Kendi further discussed the divide between awareness of, and action against, racism in a discussion on the racial wealth gap. He claimed that reparations, the policy of giving money to the descendants of slaves, "is the only policy that has been put forth in recent memory that has the capacity to eliminate the racial wealth gap." Kendi said Americans who are aware of racism but oppose reparations "say they're committed to racial equality but against the only policy that has the chance to create racial equality."
Kendi said that many Americans do not challenge racism because they are "fooled." He argued that many Americans, including himself, have at times been fooled into thinking "the problem is indeed Black people."
Kendi distinguished between policies that use this racist idea that something is "wrong" with others. He contrasted "segregationist" policies, which he said include deporting and killing marginalized groups, and "assimilationist" policies, which he described as policies that aim to "civilize" people and "make them white." Meanwhile, for the people targeted by these policies, "those Latinx folks, those Black folks, those indigenous folks are like, 'there's actually nothing wrong with us,'" he said.
One question from a viewer asked whether universities should condemn or penalize racist rhetoric, recalling Carnegie Mellon's own struggles over free speech. Kendi responded, "I think that public officials should not have the freedom to dangerously lie to the public." However, he cautioned that restricting dangerous speech "opens the door for others to say that 'there's nothing wrong or inferior about Black people' is a dangerous lie."
Another viewer asked whether Kendi views himself as an "ideological successor" to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "I'm hopefully carrying on King's Legacy," Kendi replied, continuing, "especially the King who, by the time of his death, was indeed recognizing just how systemically pervasive not only racism was, but also poverty." As an example, Kendi highlighted MLK's statement in 1967 that America "must undergo a radical revolution of its values."

“What does Student Senate do?” is one of the most common questions that members of Senate are asked. In the past, Senate has not been as connected as we could be to the 7,000 students who compose the undergraduate community at Carnegie Mellon University. This has been even more challenging in a year where we have not been able to convene in person, and our university community has been scattered across different time zones around the world. So this semester, we want to try new ways of reaching students to provide updates on our initiatives, and — most importantly — to allow for your input. This week, we want to provide a quick recap of some of Senate’s work last fall, some plans for the semester ahead, and how to become a member of Senate this semester.
Last semester, our Academic Affairs committee distributed $1,899 from our budget to students to cover the costs of required course resources that are not covered by financial aid (some examples include software subscriptions and art supplies). Months of discussion between the committee and university leadership led to the implementation of permanent Pass/No Pass vouchers. Simultaneously, our Advocacy committee has been conducting a survey to examine the changes to course learning structures and student accommodations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how these may be changed in the long term to ensure equal accessibility in courses. The Advocacy committee is still collecting responses from students in preparation for making recommendations to the university this semester, and you can share your experiences here. During the Fall semester, the Advocacy committee also pushed for the addition of a question covering inclusive environments to course evaluations.  
In spring 2020, the Business Affairs committee started to look at the issues with student employment at Carnegie Mellon and held a town hall for student employees last April. In December, the committee finished their white paper on the issue, revealing student wages which lag behind our peer universities and systemic issues with workplace culture, which we will spend the rest of this semester working with the university to address (you can sign the white paper here). The Business Affairs committee has also been working to gauge student opinion on all-gender housing at Carnegie Mellon (this survey is still open, and you can contribute here) and with Carnegie Mellon University’s Parking & Transportation Services to improve our school’s shuttle and escort services. 
Throughout the Fall semester, we hosted numerous public discussions at our general body meetings: with senior university leadership, including President Jahanian; with the leaders of Carnegie Mellon University’s COVID-19 coordinating team; with Housing Services; and our Finance committee organized Senate’s first-ever town hall on university finances and financial aid. During the summer, the Finance committee provided funding to Carnegie Mellon students or organizations who took on projects aimed at social and racial justice, and in November, the committee helped assist students who volunteered as poll workers for the 2020 election.
Our meetings, every Thursday at 5:20 p.m., are open to anyone at Carnegie Mellon University. If you aren’t able to attend, notes from previous meetings are always available online. Throughout this spring, we will continue to announce the topics of upcoming meetings a few days in advance on our social media (you can follow us on Instagram @cmusenate!). 
This semester, we are continuing our fund to help with the costs of course resources — you can apply here — and will find more ways to use our resources to directly support fellow students. We are also considering more ways to utilize the media fee to make the campus experience better. The Academic Affairs committee is also beginning a new long-term initiative to examine grading policies at Carnegie Mellon. Every April, our Campus Life committee hosts First Lectures, a program which, in the spirit of Dr. Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture, selects six graduating seniors to give a “first lecture” on their time at Carnegie Mellon (If you know anyone who you think would be a good First Lectures speaker, you can nominate them!). Campus Life is also continuing its work to bring outdoor charging stations to campus. 
However, much of what Senate will work on this spring has not been planned already and will be shaped throughout the semester by our members. This is why it’s very important we have as many members as we possibly can! At our meeting this Thursday, Feb. 18, we will be holding elections to fill our vacant seats. We welcome anyone to run to represent their home college as a Senator and bring their perspective on how we can help change our school for the better (we have the most vacant seats in the College of Fine Arts and Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, so we especially encourage candidates from those schools!). You can find more information about vacancy elections, and how to be a candidate, on our website. This coming semester will undoubtedly pose new challenges for all of us — and so that Senate can be truly representative of our community, and productive at addressing campus issues, we want to fill all of our vacant seats this semester.
Finally, if you experience any issues this semester which we may be able to help with or have any thoughts at all on how we can help the university community, feel free to contact the chairs of Senate’s committees or your college’s representatives. The initiatives mentioned here aren’t an exhaustive list — you are welcome to reach out to any of Senate’s committees to find out more about their work. And you don’t have to be a member of Senate to contribute your ideas! Whether you are joining the university community from Pittsburgh or elsewhere, we hope you have a safe and healthy Spring semester.

Recent asymptomatic COVID-19 tests returned inconclusive results, prompting administrators involved in COVID-19 coordination to change guidelines. Now, students invited to participate in the Tartan COVID-19 Asymptomatic Testing Program, shortened to Tartan Testing, are asked to "not eat, drink, smoke, brush your teeth, and/or chew gum" 60 minutes prior to testing.
This is "to improve the quality of samples," said Vice President for Research Michael McQuade in a statement to The Tartan. "Samples that are contaminated cannot be tested. To further improve the quality of samples, we also added the suggestion that individuals should swish water in their mouth and swallow it 10 minutes before their appointment."
Tartan Testing started in January, testing asymptomatic students on Carnegie Mellon's campus during a "ramp-up" period. Later, with increased staffing and laboratory equipment, the testing program expanded to include randomly selected students in the Pittsburgh area.
Tartan Testing uses saliva tests as opposed to the more common nasal swab tests. These saliva tests are easier to administer but are also more easily contaminated. As a result, in the first few weeks of testing, many students received messages such as "test not performed" or that their test was "invalid." This prompted the change in guidelines to try to minimize the contamination of saliva before testing appointments. 
Carnegie Mellon has tried to ensure that Tartan Testing is as accessible and safe as possible. The university has created a shuttle service that transports students and faculty six stops to the Cohon University Center. Tartan Testing employees are also being tested every week.
In January alone, Tartan Testing tested nearly 2,700 samples from graduate students and approximately 3,400 from undergraduate students. Tartan Testing Operations Director George Innocenzo has been pleased with the response of Carnegie Mellon students to the testing.
"There are outliers, and everywhere you deal with certain communities but with the testing itself, there's been a lot of positive feedback," Innocenzo said. Innocenzo continued, "A lot of students have been very happy to come in and get the test taken care of because obviously it's for them but it's also for the community."
"As far as the community itself and the way students take the mitigation seriously, with wearing the mask and socially distancing, it's actually been kind of nice to see everyone actually trying to follow the rules," Innocenzo explained. "It's actually been a great revelation for us."
As always, it is important to not get complacent and lose caution. As Tartan Testing continues to ramp up, Innocenzo hopes that everyone will take advantage of the appointments that are made available. In addition, administrators hope that students that test negative for COVID-19 do not gain a false sense of security, and advise students to continue the standard protective protocols.
"It is important to remember that a negative COVID-19 test result only represents a moment in time, and that anyone could become infected at any time before or after a test is administered or results are received," McQuade said. He added, "Ongoing adherence to all required mitigation strategies remains critical. Please continue to complete the daily self-assessment, maintain physical distancing, wear facial coverings and consistently wash your hands."

Valentine's Day is the epitome of American consumerism, a glorified marketing tactic businesses nationwide employ to convince consumers to drop boatloads of money on adorable teddy bears, lavish flowers, and delicious chocolates. As many spend the day enriching their significant other with presents and romance, the others are made to sit on the sidelines and watch from the outside. Strangely enough, one’s view of Valentine’s Day is likely to change based upon whether they have a significant other to celebrate the day with. 
The history of Valentine's Day is a tale of Christian and Ancient Roman tradition. Most scholars believe that the namesake Saint Valentine went against a Roman emperor, Emperor Claudius III, due to Claudius’ belief that young men who were not married made better soldiers than those with wives and children. Despite Claudius’ ruling that men could no longer marry, Saint Valentine continued conducting marriage ceremonies in secret. When Claudius learned of Saint Valentine’s actions, he ordered Saint Valentine to be put to death. Saint Valentine died a martyr, and thus, Valentine’s Day was born as a day of love and affection.
In the mid-1800s, Valentine’s Day began to be celebrated with the use of a new invention: the printing press. For the first time, commercially printed Valentine’s Day cards were circulated primarily in Europe throughout the month of February. February is aviation season, which is the main reason why birds and doves are associated with the holiday. Red roses were also added on as a symbol of beauty. Today, Valentine’s Day is celebrated worldwide and is even the most common wedding anniversary date in the Philippines.
While the merits of Valentine's Day can be found in its ancient roots of compassion and care, has America significantly monetized this holiday? Has a day once consumed by hugs and kisses turned into a billionaire's next big paycheck? Is this ethical? 
Valentine’s Day has clearly strayed far from its initial purpose. Noel Lenski, a professor of classics and history at Yale University, observes, “The Romans did it with wine, sex and a bit of violence... Modern Americans do it with a lot of money. Seems reflexive of the cultural differences between then and now.” From a historical perspective, the change in Valentine’s Day festivities seems indicative of modern consumerism and materialism. In fact, U.S. Valentine’s Day spending statistics show that consumers spent $27.4 billion on Valentine’s Day in 2020, far exceeding the daily average and significantly more than in previous years. Therefore, as American businessmen have increasingly monetized Valentine’s Day, the once sweet and romance-filled holiday has become a larger payday for businesses than ever before.
So, do the pros of Valentine’s Day love outweigh the cons of money-seeking CEOs? If you believe they do, then, by all means, go out and spend big to tell your special someone how much they mean to you. If not, there are still ways to celebrate without giving money to big businesses. For example, you can write a card, cook breakfast, or shower your significant other with hugs and kisses. Remember that Valentine’s Day is about love; if there’s one thing the world needs now, it’s more of that.

Since March 2020, the depressing phrases “the new normal” and “these unprecedented/uncertain/trying times,” among others, have been flying around faster than the coronavirus. Accompanying them have been systemic changes. 
As we all know, distance learning has been ubiquitous and damaging to the health and education of students around the world, and Carnegie Mellon University is no exception. It does not help that the traditional on-campus experiences — club socials, the Fair, buggy rolls, Spring Carnival — have either been canceled or transitioned to virtual platforms like Zoom.
Faced with such obstacles and disconcerting transitions, we naturally feel isolated and disconnected from the campus community. For those of us who are fortunate enough to have spent the first few years of our Carnegie Mellon experience in Pittsburgh, the switch to a purely virtual existence has not been as hard as for current first- and second-year students; after all, having established friend groups and shared memories on campus are definitely boons to our mental and social health.
The present challenge facing the university is a daunting one: how do we build a sense of community when we are rarely allowed to even be in the same room with others? How do we ensure that new Carnegie Mellon students, some of whom have never set foot in Pittsburgh, are still able to immerse themselves in our campus culture?
Much to the university administration’s credit, their efforts in converting the Carnegie Mellon experience to a virtual one are commendable. From ensuring that classes are transitioned to an online environment — and designing accommodations for those that cannot be taught virtually — to designing systems for campus resources and facilities to function safely and securely, the simple fact that educational and research objectives can still be pursued is a testament to the hard work and dedication that faculty and staff have put in over the past months.
What’s most refreshing is that the cultural aspects of being a Carnegie Mellon student were not forgotten amidst the shift, and though details are still lacking, it is comforting to know that events like Spring Carnival and the Fair are still around, albeit in virtual incarnations.
However, efforts on the part of the university are only half of the equation. What truly makes virtual classes and events engaging and worthwhile is attendance by the very students for whom they were designed.
Understandably, virtual events are a hard sell. After spending all day watching lectures on your computer, the last thing you want to do is spend another hour or two on Zoom when you could be sleeping or binging Netflix. What’s more, socializing online is awkward as you are often just staring at people in their little squares. Deprived of any physical proximity, human interactions feel distinctly impersonal.
It is hard to argue with those points, but what it ultimately comes down to is a question of effort. Socializing and engaging took initiative before COVID-19 — and it sure is harder now — but despite the isolation-induced fatigue, it is still vital to make an effort to attend events and meet new people. The pandemic is not going away any time soon, and part of adapting to the changed status quo is living with the reality that most of our day-to-day interactions are going to be virtual. Instead of passively embracing that fact, we should make the most of our situation and take advantage of the frequent and instantaneous opportunities for making connections. Besides, in a virtual space where everyone is equidistant, chances are you might just meet someone who you otherwise might never have ever encountered.
It is not to say that you should attend every single event that comes across your radar or aggressively try to make friends with everyone you meet. As we move forward in this semester and the semesters that follow, our singular focus should be on taking care of ourselves physically, mentally, and socially, and to guard ourselves against the burnout that is all too common nowadays. If spending time alone reading a book or catching up on a good TV show is your preferred way of recharging, by all means, indulge in those activities.
However, if you find yourself bored on a Wednesday night just casually scrolling through social media feeds and an event pops up, seriously consider attending. Not only will it brighten up the day of those who put in time and effort to set up the event, but you have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Not only might you learn something new or meet someone new, but it will also help you feel just a little closer to your fellow students and community, all from the comfort of your own home.
Just remember: carpe diem, and you only get out of it what you put into it.
