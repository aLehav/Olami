On Friday and Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams hosted the Carnegie Mellon Mini Invitational at Gesling Stadium. Both teams performed well as they participated in their second meet of the outdoor season.
The men’s team continued its domination, winning the meet on the back of their strong throwing events. 
Senior Zachary Erra-Hernandez continued his success, winning the shot put for the second consecutive week, this time with a 15.75-meter throw. 
The Tartans swept the rest of the podium with junior Gino Pilato and senior Nathan Cheek tossing 13.43 and 13.38 meters, respectively, to take second and third.
In discus, the Tartans repeated the sweep, this time with Cheek winning with a 42.56-meter toss and Pilato and Erra-Hernandez following behind with throws of 42.37 and 42.02 meters, respectively. 
Erra-Hernandez wasn’t done and set a new school record in the hammer throw with a toss of 53.90 meters on the way to a second-place 
finish. 
He broke the previous school record of 52.70 meters set by Tom Matta back in 2006 and is now ranked fifth in the nation for the event.
To round out the Tartan’s dominance in the field events, first-year Kyle Weaver won the pole vault with a 4.20-meter jump, senior David Markowitz took home a third-place finish in javelin with a throw of 50.09 meters.
First-year Matthew Seifu also earned third place with a 6.32-meter-long jump.
“The meet [last weekend] was really awesome. I really didn’t expect to be breaking any records this early in the season. I really wasn’t expecting such a strong start,” Weaver said. 
“This weekend, I wanted to break the record again, but I didn’t think that I would because the weather was so bad. In fact, I kind of went into it not expecting much for that reason,” he said. 
Weaver hopes to continue his streak for the rest of the season. “My coaches are great, so I just have to keep jumping higher,” Weaver said.
“My personal goals for the rest of this season definitely include qualifying for outdoor nationals. And I would love to raise the pole vaulting record time.”
The track portion of the meet still held plenty of opportunity for the Tartans, starting with a third-place finish by junior Elliot Watson in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of 10:04.88. 
Senior Mike Standish also got third in the 800-meter run, crossing the line with a time of 1:58.39.
“I was pleased and surprised with how well I did for my first 800 this season,” Standish said.
Sophomore Ben Neiman grabbed a second-place finish with a 57.53 run in the 400-meter hurdles. The 4x400-meter relay team closed out the meet with a win. 
Senior Jerome Reano, junior Thomas Vandenberg, sophomore Marc Daniel-Julien, and first-year Owen Norley finished with a time of 3:25.97.
The women continued their theme of the season with strong individual performances, but less-than-stellar team showing, as they finished in fourth at the meet. 
Junior Sasha Spalding was one of the bright spots for the Tartans, taking home a first- place title in the long jump with a season best 5.03-meter leap and a third-place and career-best shot put of 10.95 meters.
Two first-years rounded out the field event success for the Carnegie Mellon women, with Rebecca Fortner taking second in the high jump with a 1.47-meter leap, and Grace Yee grabbing third in the pole vault.
Junior Hailey Brown grabbed the second of three Tartan victories, this time in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
Brown crushed the rest of the field, winning by over 15 seconds with a time of 12:16.59. 
Junior Halley Bayer finished third in the 1,500-meter run with a 4:55.55 finish and first-year Ariel Tian crossed the line second in the 400-meter run with a time of 1:02.94.
Senior Jacqueline Guevel continued to dominate on the track with a first place finish in the 100-meter hurdles and a third place finish in the 400-meter hurdles with times of 15.34 and 1:05.65, respectively. Guevel also combined with Tian, senior Kelsey Hallinen, and first-year Emily Swanson to take second in the 4x400 meter relay with a time of 4:21.59.
“We’re really excited for this season,” Weaver said. “Our team wants to win the UAA outdoor conference, and with such a strong team, I think we can do it.” 
The Tartans next compete at home on Saturday in the Carnegie Mellon Quad Meet.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s tennis teams both faced off against Washington and Lee University at home on Saturday. 
The games were scheduled to be played outside, but were shifted inside due to the inclement weather.
The ninth-ranked women’s team took care of business, defeating the 20th-ranked Generals. 
The Tartans were in a hole after the doubles matches, with only junior Angela Pratt and first-year Nicholle Torres winning their match 8–4, but quickly recovered in the singles competition, with only Pratt and sophomore Elizabeth Martin dropping their matches. 
First-year Vanessa Pavia and senior Katie Cecil both won in straight sets 6–0, 6–3 and 6–1, 6–2 respectively, while Torres and sophomore Brooke Tsu both dropped their first sets 4–6 before battling back to win.
The 11th-ranked men also triumphed over 22nd-ranked Washington and Lee. 
Similar to the women, the men quickly fell behind with only first-year Kiril Kirkov and sophomore Joel Lankford winning their doubles match, 8–3. 
The men then rallied, just like the women, and won five of the six singles matches with the only loss coming in three sets by junior Will Duncan.
Sophomores Abhishek Alla, Kirkov, first-years Kenny Zheng, and Kunal Wadwani all won in straight sets, none giving up more than three games in a single set; Wadwani only dropped one game on his way to victory. 
Junior Christian Heaney-Secord had a harder time, eventually winning in three sets after dropping the second one on tiebreak, 6–3,6–7, 7–9, and 6–1.
Both teams face off against Grove City on Friday at Grove City College.

Opening Day is one of the most iconic days in sports. America’s pastime marks the true beginning of spring and signals that summer is just around the corner. Baseball’s faithful are so passionate that several Hall of Famers petitioned Congress earlier this year to make Opening Day a national holiday. While history is certainly a huge part of baseball, Pittsburgh has more immediate reasons to be excited when the Pirates open their season on Monday. This season marks the first time in over 20 years that the Pirates have opened the season coming off a winning season and a playoff berth.
Obviously the Pirates want to meet and surpass the success they had last season, but they are still in the tough NL Central. Below, I recap the offseason moves made by each team in the division in the order that I predict they are going to finish come September.
St. Louis Cardinals
Given their immaculate propensity for constantly reloading their roster from their minor league system, it’s impossible to pick against the Cardinals, especially with them coming off a World Series loss to the Boston Red Sox. With the massive contributions given by 2013 rookies Shelby Miller, Michael Wacha, Trevor Rosenthal, Carlos Martinez and Matt Adams, the Cardinals did not have many holes they needed to fill in free agency. 
Their one spot of weakness was at shortstop, where Pete Kozma was a defense specialist, but a black hole in the lineup. Their signing of former Detroit Tiger Jhonny Peralta hurts them a bit on defense, but turns the shortstop position from a weakness to a strength from a batting perspective.
The Cardinals also did a bit of player shuffling in hopes of shoring up their defense in the outfield. Future Hall of Fame outfielder Carlos Beltrán left but was easily replaced by top prospect Oscar Tavares. 
Tavares is a significant defensive upgrade given his youth and speed, but he won’t be able to fill Beltran’s role in the lineup. The biggest shift was a trade with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, which sent third baseman David Freese to the West Coast in exchange for outfielder Peter Bourjos. 
The trade allowed former second baseman Matt Carpenter to shift to his natural position and speedster Kolten Wong to join the major league lineup. Bourjos also adds to the defensive-minded overhaul of the outfield.     
Pittsburgh Pirates
Last year’s playoff team was a strange combination of emerging youth and wily veterans that caught fire and made Pittsburgh care about baseball again. With the notable exception of ace A.J. Burnett, the Pirates are returning a near identical team to last year. 
Their biggest additions will likely come midseason when their top prospects, pitcher Jameson Taillon and outfielder Gregory Polanco, are both expected to make their major league debuts.
The biggest worry for the Pirates has to be their lineup, with traditional hard-hitting positions — first base and corner outfielder — both remaining awkward time shares between mediocre talents. 
Pittsburgh must be hoping the continuing development of outfielder Starling Marte and third baseman Pedro Álvarez boosts the lineup or center fielder Andrew McCutchen matches or surpasses his MVP season from last year. 
Otherwise, the bullpen better be up to the task of holding on in close games like they did through the stretch last year.
Cincinnati Reds
The Reds did not look good coming out of off-season. They lost two major pieces of their team with leadoff man Shin-Soo Choo signing with the Texas Rangers and former ace Bronson Arroyo moving to the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Cincinnati is trying the fill the holes from within, with Tony Cingrani trying to replace Arroyo as the rotation work horse, and Billy Hamilton likely taking over the center field and leadoff spots. Hamilton is far and away the fastest player in the league, but that speed is only useful if he is able to get on base.
The biggest positive for the Reds was the major statistical hit their core took last year, with several major contributors well off their career 
averages. 
Assuming these players regress to the norm and ace Johnny Cueto comes back healthy, the Reds will be in good shape, but it’s hard to tell if last year was an off-year or the start of the decline for many of the veteran core players and pitchers, who rarely become less injury-prone as time passes. 
If everything clicks, the Reds could easily challenge for the division, but they could just as easily fall out of contention by August.
Milwaukee Brewers
The Brewers have added two major pieces that have the potential to be their former all-star selves or complete busts. Pitcher Matt Garza was signed after an off-year split between the Chicago Cubs and Rangers. It wasn’t that long ago that Garza was a perennial Cy Young candidate, but the last two years have been plagued by injuries and inconsistency. 
The second addition never really left. Right fielder Ryan Braun, the former MVP, will be returning from his season-ending suspension for performance enhancing drugs. There is a lot of speculation that Braun’s great stats were more representative of the drugs than his own performance and that he will only be a shell of his former self.
The Brewers just have too many question marks to compete for a playoff spot, especially given the three solid teams above them in the division. With a limited minor league system, the Brewers are stuck in limbo trying to hit on old veterans and hoping they regain their old sparks. 
Chicago Cubs
No discussion of the basement is complete without the lovable losers. The team forever tied with bad luck looks to finally be on the right path. That being said, the best they can hope for this season is to not finish last in the division. 
Former top prospects shortstop Starlin Castro and first baseman Anthony Rizzo both had down years last season, but their youth gives hope that it was a sophomore slump and not a representation of future potential.
This year’s hot infield prospect comes in the form of third baseman Mike Olt. The center piece of the trade that sent Garza to the Rangers last year, Olt was viewed as the second best prospect in the Texas system until last year, when blurry vision and terrible hitting significantly dropped his stock. 
Now, a year after the winter league beaning that was likely the cause of his vision problems, Olt has made the major league roster out of spring training and looks to be returning to his former self.

It’s the end of March, the time of year when there are fewer than 12 games left for each team in the NBA regular season. Playoff seeding is more or less decided, barring any major upsets, and teams have generally settled into a rhythm and developed an identity for the season, one that they will carry through the playoffs. We know who the real contenders are and who the pretenders are. With the conclusion of the season close by, this time is as good as any to hand out the major regular season awards to those who deserve them.
Sixth Man of the Year
Rather than starting with the big ones first like the MVP, we begin from the other side of the popularity spectrum. The Sixth Man of the Year award rewards those players whose contributions coming off the bench have propelled teams forward and significantly improved them. Who is this year’s best sixth man?
Perennial contender and 2010 Sixth Man of the Year Los Angeles Clippers shooting guard Jamal Crawford has made a case again for himself. He is averaging an essential 18.6 PPG for the Clippers and their fast running offense, ensuring that the team always has reliable scoring off the bench. Crawford has unquestionably been the Clippers’ best player and deserves recognition for it.
Another perennial contender and 2008 Sixth Man of the Year, San Antonio Spurs shooting guard Manu Ginóbili is having a renaissance year. Part of the Spurs’ aging Big Three (also including forward-center Tim Duncan and point guard Tony Parker), it was speculated that Ginóbili would retire at the end of last season after having probably the worst season of his career and being upstaged by the likes of Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard in the Spurs’ rotation. He’s back to being himself; despite lower playing time, Ginóbili has been incredibly efficient and keeps rolling on to potentially the best record in the NBA.
A surprise contender from a pleasantly surprising team is Phoenix Suns forward Markieff Morris. Part of a whole roster of improved players, Morris stands out for his contributions from the bench. Along with his twin brother power forward Marcus Morris, Markieff has carried his team’s second unit time and again, and has stepped up to the cause on several 
occasions.
Winner:
Manu Ginóbili. He’s unquestionably the best player in this conversation, and when the Spurs are rolling like this, no one else deserves it more.
Most Improved Player
The first major contender for this award is Phoenix Suns guard Goran Dragic. Dragic has been nothing short of sensational this season. He has carried a Phoenix team projected to be at the bottom of the Western Conference to legitimate playoff contenders. 
With the help of star acquisition point guard Eric Bledsoe (who mind you, has missed nearly three months of action) and coach Jeff Hornacek, the Suns have been playing thrilling basketball, resembling the Houston Rockets of last season. Much of it is down to Dragic though, who was snubbed from the All-Star Game despite having a career year. 
The second contender is New Orleans Pelicans forward-center Anthony Davis. Such has been Davis’s rise this season that he is being seen by most coaches to be an MVP candidate in the coming years. 
Sporting an absurd PER of 27.10 in just his second year in the league and at only 21 years old, Davis is a star in the making. He leads the league in blocks and currently averages over 20 PPG and over 10 RPG. His PER is also the fourth highest in the league behind only LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kevin Love. Davis is a monster in the making, and the Pelicans have a franchise player on their hands.
Winner
Dragic, only because his rise is more surprising. Davis is also destined for bigger awards.
Defensive Player of the Year
For a while it seemed like absolutely no one could stop Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert from taking this award home. For the first half of the season, Indiana’s defense was one of the most suffocating seen in years and even Tom Thibodeau’s Chicago Bulls weren’t keeping up. His rim protection is impeccable and has been key to Indiana only allowing 91.7 PPG this season.
However, a new contender has emerged over the recent months. Forward-center Joakim Noah has carried the Bulls on his sleeve like no one thought he could. 
Indiana’s PPG allowed was lower than 90 for a while, and the Bulls’s PPG allowed higher than 93. Its now down to 91.9, just 0.2 more than the Pacers. Noah has also brought this number down pretty much alone, as he leads the team in rebounding, assists, and blocks. And all these statistics do not even begin to measure the heart with which Noah plays.
Winner
 Noah. The Pacers have fallen in performance while the Bulls have only become better, and Noah is the reason for that, especially without any other star on the team.
Rookie of the Year
In a draft class being compared to the disastrous 2001 draft, it wouldn’t be too hard to stand out with some high numbers. And yet there is only one player who has shown any true potential of becoming a superstar: Philadelphia 76ers guard Michael Carter-Williams (MCW).
 MCW has been very good on a 76ers team that just tied for the longest losing streak in the history of the NBA. But even he has his flaws, notably his shooting and high turnover rate. But he is averaging 16.7 PPG, 6.0 RPG and 6.3 RPG while being sixth in the league in steals at 1.92 per game. He has major talent, but needs a better supporting cast and coaching.
Honorable mentions go to Orlando Magic shooting guard Victor Oladipo and Utah Jazz point guard Trey Burke.
Winner
MCW. Those numbers might be inflated by pace, but are excellent nevertheless.
Coach of the Year
As the Spurs cruise toward a potential No. 1 overall seed (yet again), Gregg Popovich’s name is being thrown around as possible coach of the year (again). There isn’t much that isn’t known about him, and he is certainly the best coach in the league and in the conversation for one of the greatest ever. He’s also remaining steadfast in performance despite the fact that each of the Spurs’ Big Three have missed rather significant time.
The first surprise contender is Portland Trailblazers coach Terry Stotts. The Trailblazers were not even expected to be in the conversation for the playoffs this year, but after their 24–5 start, they were labeled as potential contenders. While they have fallen off their torrid pace since, they still are in the fifth seed, and Stotts has been doing all he can to squeeze the maximum out of role players like forwards Thomas Robinson and Joel Freeland.
The biggest surprise is from the most surprising team. Jeff Hornacek has coached the Suns, which was expected to be one of the worst teams, but is now one of the most exciting teams. 
Nearly every Suns player is having a career year and the Desert Cinderellas have made a case for themselves to be in the contender picture in the next few years.
Winner
Hornacek. As good as Stotts has been, the Suns are just two-and-a-half games behind the Trailblazers, despite having a significantly poorer roster.
Most Valuable Player
The last two years the MVP trophy has been contended between Miami Heat small forward LeBron James and Oklahoma City Thunder small forward Kevin Durant. Both times Durant has come second, with James taking home the hardware and taking his MVP tally to four. He has begun to establish himself in the Greatest NBA Players of all Time conversation. However, this year may be the one when Durant finally gets his due.
His defense, frequently criticized over the last few years, has improved by leaps and bounds, Durant has been nothing short of sensational.
The race to win this trophy is so close, because James has been no slouch either. He’s averaging 27 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 6.4 APG. 
While these might be lower than his career averages, its because he’s also playing less.
Also, all of this has been with shooting guard Dwyane Wade in and out of the lineup and the Heat having to use seldom-used players like small forward James Jones and guard Toney Douglas in place to start. James is carrying the Heat yet again.
Winner
Durant. It has to be him. But the race is so close, James could still win it if he goes on a tear over the next 10 games or so.

How smart have our smartphones become? So smart that they might know us better than we know ourselves, according to associate professor of the School of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) Jason Hong and associate professor of HCII and the School of Design John Zimmerman. By taking advantage of how much information our smartphones are able to obtain, Hong and Zimmerman are studying how smartphone data can help predict the onset of depression.
The World Economic Forum recently released its Top 10 Emerging Technologies list for 2014. One of these innovations was the quantified self — the idea that data obtained from the monitoring of a person’s daily routines can be usefully analyzed. 
“Quantified self is sort of the idea that there is small data about each individual,” Zimmerman explained. “We’re looking at the small data — what all of the stuff we might know about an individual is and if we can pull relevant and meaningful information.”
The quantified self has been made increasingly possible as smartphones continually advance. For example, there are many applications and devices that allow users to track their exercising and eating habits in a way that can help them improve their health, such as Fitbit or MyFitnessPal. Hong and Zimmerman’s research takes this concept one step further by delving into how smartphone data can reveal symptoms of depression. Originally funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), their research is focused on detecting depression in returning soldiers.
Their main motivation behind this endeavor stems from the fact that it often takes four to six weeks to get a first appointment with a therapist. According to Hong and Zimmeran, installing their app, called Big Black Dog, will allow individuals to self-monitor their habits in a way that will allow them to receive a better diagnosis when they do have their appointment. Between appointments, the app can also be used to track whether or not their treatment has caused a change in their behavior.
Big Black Dog uses sensory data to gather information about the individual. For example, sound levels, brightness of surroundings, whether the screen is on or not, and geotagged data are all types of information that the app will gather. 
It will also look at social interactions, such as how often the individual makes phone calls or converses with people through text messages. The combination of all this data can result in some trends that will show a picture of the person’s health and be a predictor of depression. Two behaviors with which depression is most highly correlated are social isolation and a poor sleep schedule.
“So you probably see there are several trends that are going on here,” Hong noted. “One is that sensors and devices are becoming much cheaper so now we can capture more data. Another trend is that we can capture a lot of data about our health outside of hospitals and outside of clinics more than we could before. These are two trends that are just going to keep on continuing.”
Besides spotting depression in a target audience such as returning soldiers, Hong and Zimmerman also conduct other research that uses the concept of the quantified self. For example, Zimmerman worked with associate professor of HCII Anind K. Dey on an application for busy parents. The application can learn the pickup and drop-off routines of parents for their kids’ events so that if a parent forgets to be somewhere at a certain time, they will be sent a reminder notification.
Similarly, Hong worked with professor in the Institute for Software Research Norman Sadeh on a project called Livehoods, which uses Foursquare check-ins and other geotagged data to create a map that identifies regions in less of a geographical way and more of a cultural way. 
For example, data shows that even though Shadyside is known as one region, it is actually broken down into a more residential side and a more commercial side where there are many restaurants and stores.
Besides these projects, the quantified self can be applied to many different types of studies. Hong expressed interest in exploring the quantified self to learn more about the first-year experience at Carnegie Mellon in a way that will allow future first-year students to learn from the classes that came before them.

Many Carnegie Mellon researchers are currently involved in cutting-edge research focused on understanding the complex ways in which the brain functions. Aryn Gittis, an assistant professor in biological sciences, as well as a member of the joint Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, has received a two-year NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, which she will use to study the mechanisms behind compulsive behavior.
Gittis initially began working with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia — which is located in the base of the forebrain and is primarily associated with action selection — as a post doctoral researcher at the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease. “When I started my post doc, I wanted to start studying the basal ganglia because it was relevant for so many different diseases,” Gittis said. “It was almost serendipitous that I became interested in compulsive behavior because I found some genetic tools to study different populations of neurons in a part of the basal ganglia called the globus pallidus.”
Gittis discovered that when certain populations of neurons in mice were activated, the mice became hyperactive. Along with other research, this finding suggested that the globus pallidus is involved in many compulsive behaviors, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette’s syndrome. “The globus pallidus seems to be a site of convergence for a lot of different pathways that have all been implicated in compulsive behavior,” explained Gittis.
The NARSAD Young Investigator Grant is given to early career scientists who intend to pursue the study of brain and behavior disorders. Gittis and her team, including post doctoral fellow Amelie Soumier, first-year biology major Brandon Rogowski, and senior biology and psychology double major Nick Zuniga, will use the NARSAD grant to conduct follow-up research on her previous findings about the globus pallidus. 
In particular, Gittis notes that Parkinson’s disease is a main focus of her research. They will use optogenetics — a technique which uses light to control neurons in the brain — to determine how behavior changes when cells in the globus pallidus are activated or deactivated. “It’s a way of turning on and off genetically distinct neural circuits so that we are able to see how behavior changes when these [circuits] are on or off,” Gittis said. 
In this way, they will be able to determine which populations of neurons are involved in compulsive behavior.
“We want to figure out if the increase in movement we’re seeing is due to general hyperactivity of neural circuits, or if it’s due to the inability of animals to suppress movements, which would be more like a compulsive behavior,” said Gittis. “We want to expand the behavioral tests that we’ve tested, and in addition to turning cells on, we want to also turn cells off.”
Gittis’ research has the potential to have a large impact in the world of neuroscience. “There’s a huge need in neuroscience to understand how all these different classes of neurons we’ve identified interact with one another and how they are activated — both in normal behavior and in disease states,” explained Gittis. But the research could also have important pharmacological effects. “A lot of the medications we currently use are medications that were discovered decades ago, and we still don’t really understand how they work,” Gittis said. “The hope is that by being able to delve into neural circuits at the cell type level and identify unique classes of neurons, we can then figure out ways to pharmacologically, selectively target those cells.”
Gittis also noted that the way neurons function is an important stepping stone on the way to the development of treatments: “Eventually it will lead to drug development ... but we first need to understand how the neurons work and how they interact with one another.”
This research could help scientists understand the mechanisms behind brain and neuron activity. Once the mechanisms are more clearly understood, researchers will be able to more easily develop new and more effective treatments and therapies to counteract a variety of neurological disorders.

Doctors endure years and years of training to fully understand the human body in order to treat their patients. Nevertheless, collecting all the necessary information and generating an accurate diagnosis can be a daunting task that may cause even the most skilled clinician to run out of breath.
Computers, on the other hand, don’t run out of breath.
Wei Wu, an associate professor and researcher at Carnegie Mellon’s Lane Center for Computational Biology, has used the power of computational techniques to redefine how doctors can diagnose their patients. 
Wu’s findings, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, uses machine-learning algorithms to analyze a wide scope of variables collected from asthma patients to determine the severity of their condition. Wu refers to the project uniquely as “computational medicine” and said that by using these methods, they “were able to characterize asthma patients with around 90 percent accuracy.”
In order to decide the best form of treatment for their patients, doctors first identify a patient’s symptoms and relate them to the severity of the disease. 
Unfortunately, the capacity of the human brain limits the number of factors they can take into account during their analysis. Traditionally, doctors use a small number of variables and rely largely on experience to relate patients who have similar conditions and prescribe them similar treatments.
Wu and physicians agree that “we need to redefine asthma since we can get so many more measurements.”
In collaboration with Sally E. Wenzel, director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Asthma Institute, Wu and Wenzel collected information of 112 variables from 378 patients. Variables ranged from general aspects, such as age of asthma onset, to more specific scientific measurements like lung volumes. They even included other factors, such as the environment and emotion that could be collected from patient questionnaires.
It is an impossible task to expect a doctor to make sense of all of these variables at one time. Wu’s approach can take all the available information to make the best judgement for the severity of the patients’s asthma. The doctor can use this information to treat the patient appropriately. 
Wu explained that initially the algorithm uses an unsupervised learning technique, assuming that nothing is known about the relationships between the variables and the severity of the asthma. 
Using a small sample of the experimental data, the algorithm identifies patterns and uses statistical approaches to generate clusters of patients. Each cluster is related to a different level of severity.
Then, similar to how a doctor will use their knowledge and experience, the algorithm relays the patterns it has identified to take in new experimental data and cluster the patients. Each cluster can then have its own prescribed treatment. 
However, Wu explained that her collaborators are concerned that even though their techniques appear to be successful, “the method is not yet practical because you cannot always expect to collect all 112 variables of information.”
Some of the variables are based on similar measurements, so Wu and her team identified which variables appeared to be redundant. They eliminated the redundant variables and reanalyzed the data. Wu said, “I was very confused when I saw that this time, the accuracy of our predictions dropped to slightly above eighty percent.” She believes that even though these variables appear to overlap, they do not overlap completely. For example, if the information contained in a measurement can be pictured as a circle, two similar measurements have circles that almost completely cover each other. However, the small sections of the circle that are not covered are still useful measurements toward a diagnosis and are necessary for achieving a higher accuracy.
Wu explained, “Another aspect is that the algorithm will rank each variable based on its ability to contribute to the accuracy of a diagnosis,” which can provide insight into which variables are strongly correlated with the disease and allow doctors to focus on these factors when making their diagnosis. Oftentimes in similar research, the conclusions reached by a computer algorithm will make no sense to the physician. However, the highest ranked variables by the program are generally the same variables that physicians would normally focus on during their analysis of a patient. Wu said that seeing a computational and medical agreement helped them feel confident about the robustness of their approach.
Wu is very proud of the way the computational and medical aspects of this project agreed so well and believes that it was directly conducive to their success. Wu and her team hope to further explore reducing the number of variables in their study. The methods they develop can be applied to a number of complex diseases and could take us toward a future of personalized medicine.

The topic of this week’s Pugwash discussion was hydraulic fracturing — more colloquially referred to as fracking. Fracking is a method of extracting natural gas out of shale rock in the ground. It has been in development for decades, but only reached technological maturity in the last five years. Since then, natural gas has rapidly replaced coal fire power plants across the United States, and has accounted for about 81 percent of the nation’s installed electricity capacity in the last decade, according to GRACE Communications Foundation.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to natural gas utilization. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the fuel from natural gas releases about half as much carbon dioxide as coal for the same amount of energy when burned, and even smaller amounts of other dangerous chemicals. The fuel is also extremely economical; for example, an article in Forbes discussed how cheap natural gas led to a boom in the economy of North Dakota. To some, it is the only reasonable way of reducing emissions while maintaining a strong economy. On the other hand, fracking has led to fears of environmental destruction. Videos have appeared online demonstrating how groundwater contamination in the areas around hydraulic fracturing sites has lead to flammable tap water. Additionally, hydraulic fracturing involves catching the methane that escapes from shale rock. Any methane that escapes will leak into the atmosphere, and acts as a greenhouse gas about 20 times as potent as carbon dioxide, according to the EPA. Another concern is that fracking may simply be increasing our reliance on fossil fuels, making clean energy even less of a reality.
Following a general discussion of the pros and cons of fracking, the conversation turned to how these advantages and disadvantages compared to each other in weight. For example, the 2010 documentary Gasland was cited to explain that the most dangerous of the disadvantages to fracking is water contamination. However, it was noted that most policymakers consider the release of methane from fracking sites to be the biggest issue with fracking. If experts consider the methane emission to be worse than the ground water contamination, then we could have a catastrophe on our hands.
While it was pointed out that we cannot make the good the enemy of the perfect, and that fracking is at least preferable to coal in terms of environmental destruction, these points sparked a conversation about how we do not even consider renewables to be options, when, in fact, they are. A century ago, when the infrastructure of the first power plants were put in place, energy innovators did not consider the long-term effects of their decisions and assumed that environmental issues would be solved by now. This mistake is not one that can be made again. As we neglect to set up the infrastructure for renewable energy, we are making it more and more difficult for ourselves in the future to build newer, cleaner energy solutions. If we do not act now, we never will.
However, this urgency for renewable energy sources was subdued a little by a counterargument. It was clarified that when a resource becomes scarce, it will become expensive. Thus, it is in a profit-focused company’s best interest to invest in more nonrenewable energy sources, simply for their long-term economic survival. This point makes fracking seem more reasonable because companies can invest in it now, and then invest in renewable sources when they are inevitably forced to. 
However, we should not consider corporations to be so focused on the long term; by the time these companies decide to change, it may be environmentally too late. These corporations may fail as energy resources are depleted and the world will be in trouble, but we should not wait for this scenario to happen: if they fail, the entire planet fails with them.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on fracking.

Only two percent of all the habitable land on the face of the Earth has not been physically interacted with and touched by humans, according to The Seattle Times. While we as humans like to think that we know as much as possible about the planet that we live on, it turns out that there are a plethora of secrets Mother Nature is keeping from us. One of these hidden treasures is underground rivers.
Underground, or subterranean, rivers are rivers that flow beneath the surface of the Earth. They come in all sorts of forms and sizes, but many underground rivers commonly begin as normal, above-ground rivers that flow into an underground cave and then eventually resurface back into the open.
Before we talk about how other types of these underwater beauties form, it is first important to understand how their above-land cousins come about. The process by which a common river forms is not intuitive or obvious at first. The questions, “Where does it start?” and, “How does the water not just soak into the land?” are the key questions to answer. 
A river begins as a stream that usually originates from a mountain or a glacier. These individual streams will then collide with others that are heading down the mountain, forming a bigger stream. Eventually, a river forms from the combined contributions of multiple streams. Whenever a smaller river converges with a bigger river, the smaller one is called a tributary.
According to OneGeology, the formation of a river is equally dependent on the formation of a riverbed. In order for a riverbed to form, the soil on the ground cannot soak up all the water flowing over it. Soil has a saturation limit, making it possible for the water not to be pulled into the ground. Different soils have different saturation limits, and so there are good riverbed soils and bad riverbed soils. For instance, consider clay and sand. The particles in clay are much smaller than those of sand; when clay particles are packed closely together, there is less space between them. Thus, when the water flows over the clay, less water is lodged between the particles. Sand, on the other hand, would not be an effective riverbed because lots of the water flowing over it could lodge itself into the space in between particles.
Subterranean rivers have very similar properties. In order to form, they need two conditions: a good water supply and a riverbed. The water for underground rivers is usually water that has seeped through all the layers of soil, from above the surface to below the surface, and reached the forming river. The riverbed, similarly, forms when water seeping through the ground reaches an impermeable type of soil. It stops moving downward and begins to move horizontally in the direction of what will become the river. According to The Telegraph, the water in underground rivers has higher salinity; therefore, this denser water flows like a river along the sea bed.
With no markers above the surface, underground rivers have to be uncovered using scientific methods. One such method uses mathematical models to follow the flow of water through the ground. This method works because water initially moves vertically through the earth and then changes direction if it enters an underground river.
Due to their inconspicuous nature, subterranean rivers have been found in all sorts of unexpected places. For instance, in 2011, The Guardian reported that scientists discovered a massive underground river four kilometers below the Amazon river. This river, named the Hamza River after its discoverer, flows for over 6,000 kilometers and ranges from 200 kilometers to 400 kilometers in width. Another famous underground river, referred to by The Huffington Post as “a scuba diver’s dream,” is Cenote Angelita in Mexico and has become a popular tourist attraction.

New technique may save lives at UPMC
Surgeons at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) will test out a new lifesaving technique on 10 patients with gunshot and knife wounds by suspending them between life and death. The process, known as emergency preservation and resuscitation, involves replacing a patient’s blood with a cool saline solution and significantly lowering the patient’s body temperature. The surgeons will then perform operations, and the saline will be replaced again with blood. The idea is to keep the bodies of individuals with severe trauma in a “preserved” state that will keep them from dying.
Cells in this arrested state don’t require oxygen to stay alive because there are no metabolic activities occurring, making the patient clinically dead.  With the technique in place, UPMC surgeons are waiting on-call for their first eligible patient.

CDC says autism prevalence 1 in 68
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that one in 68 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a 30 percent increase from 2008, which stated an autism prevalence of one in 88. Professionals in the field are unsure if the increase is due to increased sensitivity in surveillance, an increase in cases, or a combination of both.
Many agree that the data needs to undergo further analysis. Rates between states varied dramatically, for instance; New Jersey had a prevalence of one in 45 while Alabama had one in 175.

Studies show crows are able to reason
A recent study with New Caledonian crows have shown the birds to have some level of understanding of water displacement. In the study, researchers put Aesop’s fable to a real-world test: Can a crow place objects in a pool in order to make the water level rise and reach a treat?
The results show they could in certain situations. The crows were given six tasks, and were able to complete four of them. They chose to drop stones into water-filled tubes rather than sand; dropped sinking objects rather than floating; dropped dense objects as opposed to hollow ones; and dropped objects into tubes with high water levels rather than lower water levels. 
Although the crows failed two more complicated tasks, the researchers assess their causal reasoning abilities on par with a 5–7 year old human child.

Artificial yeast chromosome made
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have recently created an artificial chromosome for baker’s yeast, the first time that a synthetic chromosome has been created for a eukaryotic organism. The team, which included multiple undergraduate students, was able to create chromosome No. 3 of the yeast. They created sequences of DNA, stitched them together, and then put the sequence into a yeast cell, which used proteins to coil and package the sequence into a chromosome. The researchers left out segments of DNA from the original yeast that they didn’t feel necessary.

Pollutants make male fish feminine
Male fish off the coast of Basque Country, Spain have been found to be undergoing feminization due to pollutants. 
The pollutants, which act as estrogen, have caused the male fish to develop ovocytes. Researchers analyzed thick-lipped gray mullet found in different estuaries around Spain. The pollutants that may be the cause of the feminization are part of a class of chemicals known as endocrine-disrupters.
Although endocrine-disrupters have only been noted recently, they are found in many common products, such as contraceptives, fragrances, detergent, and pesticides. 
In addition to the ovocytes, some male fish tested positive for molecular markers and proteins that are typically only found in female fish. The scientists believe a source of the pollutants may be from a local water treatment plant.

Researchers filter light in new ways
For the first time, light may be able to be filtered depending on what angle or direction it is coming from, adding to the current ability to filter light by color or polarization. The new technique, developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, allows light of any color to pass through a system only if it comes from a certain angle; all other light is reflected. 
This breakthrough could be used for detectors in microscopes, telescopes, and privacy screens for computers.

Miller Gallery opened its doors last Friday evening to viewers wanting a first glimpse of the 2014 MFA thesis exhibition, Lossless. This year’s collection featured the work of three master’s of fine arts students — Carl Bajandas, Oreen Cohen, and Yun Mi Her — and spanned a wide spectrum of moods, media, and subjects.
The exhibit represents a culmination of the artists’ work as fine arts students — yet each artist went further by “exploring new territory,” according to School of Art head John Carson in a Miller Gallery press release.
For each of the three artists, this new territory took them in different directions, leading to a cohesive, yet pleasantly diverse final exhibition.
Carl Bajandas
When viewers step onto the third floor of the gallery, Bajandas’s large-scale piece — titled “Loss / Decay / Recovery” — is easily the first thing they’ll see: The work spans the entire center room. It’s a colorful arched canvas with a gritty, sparkly texture overtop.
Bajandas achieved this effect by creating a solution of copper sulfate crystals in water. As the water evaporates, the solution will continually crystallize over a three-month period, forming the sugary texture on the surface of the canvas.
As the solution crystallizes, the copper oxidizes. As a result, the canvas is discolored in places, showing runny brown and green splotches overtop the original vibrant aqua base.
Once viewers look past the looming canvas, though, they’ll notice a persistent, monotone hum that pervades the space. No, it isn’t the air conditioning; it’s part of the art itself. Bajandas positioned a small computer at the ceiling of the room that registers the darkness of the discolored canvas and emanates a noise accordingly.
At first, the hum is loud and somewhat bothersome, but eventually it blends into the natural sound scape of the space. Slowly, it takes on a hypnotic effect.
“It’s supposed to be a very calm, meditative piece,” Bajandas said.
Since the oxidation is a three-month process, both the colorscape and the soundscape will evolve over the course of the exhibition — and Bajandas wants viewers to engage with this feature of the piece.
“The reaction happens so slowly, and it’s supposed to push the time scale outside the human attention span,” Bajandas explained. “It has to be something you come back to and look at again and sort of sit with.”
The crowded, chatty atmosphere of opening night might not have been conducive to the contemplative environment Bajandas was hoping for the piece. But it’s easy to imagine revisiting the gallery on a quieter day: approaching the vast, larger-than-life canvas, listening to the whirs and hums of the changing soundscape, and looking for hidden patterns in the landscape of crystals.
Oreen Cohen
By contrast to the soothing hum of Bajandas’s piece, it’s quite the opposite experience walking into the center backroom on the second floor. There, projected video clips jump from wall to wall in brief flashes, forcing viewers to whirl around at every sudden change.
Some of these snapshots depict peaceful, wintry scenes: close shots of withering, frost-covered sunflowers and sunflower seeds falling in slow motion onto snowy soil. Others show workers pounding into the earth, lowering a mysterious gold-painted casket into a grave.
And all the while, it’s hard to know where to look next, causing viewers to crane their necks to look around the room from every angle.
The experience is disorienting — but that’s the point, according to artist Cohen. Her thesis project, “Between a Stone and a Shrine,” focuses on current efforts in nearby Braddock, Pa., to bring life back to a fading community. The choppy, whirlwind presentation of the videos plays a role in the narrative Cohen hopes to tell about the Braddock project.
One scene shows a bulldozer eating away at a demolished house, digging into the house’s innards while what remains of the siding of the house flops lifelessly.
“When a building is demolished, everything is sort of fragmented,” Cohen explained. “Our sense of environment — our environment that we’re used to — is totally disoriented.”
That’s the driving motif behind the jarring presentation of the video — the fragmented nature of what’s happening in Braddock. As Cohen describes it, she’s “trying to capture a narrative through multiple screens.”
Ultimately, Cohen hopes to provoke viewers to “look at abandoned spaces with a different perspective.” In finding her place as an artist amid the efforts in Braddock, Cohen wants to turn gentrification into revitalization. As the artist put it, “I wanted to take a space and turn it into a place” — a place with identity, character, and humanity.
Yun Mi Her
Also on the second floor, Her’s work is a tonal marriage of her colleagues’ pieces. Like Cohen, Her’s work relies on video: she captures her subjects with hypnotic, emotional interviews.
Viewers can watch Her’s interviews by clambering into hollow rectangular prisms made of balsa wood: They’re suspended vertically from the ceiling by taut strings, at just the right height for viewers to duck underneath.
Once inside these prisms, viewers are secluded from the rest of the exhibit, left to gaze at the screen before them. On these screens, video interviews play in loops, portraying a variety of subjects discussing everything from their childhoods to the definition of a successful life. The camera captures the subjects head-on, thought it will often zoom in on subjects’ eyes, mouths, and hands.
Like Cohen’s videos, Her’s work is fragmented and puzzling: It jumps between the moments in an interview, rather than playing them chronologically, forcing viewers to paint a narrative out of snapshots. But at the same time, the effect is calming and thought provoking: Viewers wander at their own pace from one prism to the next, moving from story to story.
Her’s work continues upstairs — and there, the mood is different. Instead of merely watching images on a screen, here viewers get to take part in them. In two enclosed rooms on opposite sides of the floor, a lone chair stands in the center of each of the spaces, facing a video camera. Viewers take turns sitting in this chair, looking and waving into the camera.
The trick to the piece lies in the projected image on a wall in each room — a live video recording of the chair in the opposite room, and any of that chair’s inhabitants. Every blink, wave, and move by each subject in the chair is instantly broadcast on the opposite side of the gallery floor.
The setup might not seem so out of the ordinary, but it’s somewhat unsettling. Imagine a Skype session without the little box in the upper corner reflecting your own face back at you.“They can see each other,” Her explained, “but they can’t see themselves.”
Although you might not guess it, according to Her, the third-floor installation is a symbolic realization of the videos downstairs. Her didn’t elaborate on what those symbols were, but it’s possible to imagine that the interview subjects and the gallery visitors have something in common: Both are facing cameras, unable to see themselves yet visible to others. Both find themselves in vulnerable situations, shedding some layer of self-consciousness in the process and showing their unfiltered selves to an unseen audience.
Lossless isn’t an exhibit for the visitor who’s in a rush. At face value, Cohen’s work might seem like a mismatch of beautifully captured, but random snapshots. Without context, viewers might fail to find meaning in the colorful crystals of Bajandas’ oxidizing canvas. If you plan to make the trip, take the time to wander the space; watch the interviews; read the placards on the walls.

Do you hear the people sing? In the Pittsburgh Musical Theater’s production of Les Misérables, the answer is a resounding “yes!” The diverse cast of this classic musical put on a spectacular show that would put the stars of the recent movie production to shame.
For those unfamiliar with the story, Les Misérables is set in France during the failed 1832 June Rebellion and follows the story of Jean Valjean (Peter Matthew Smith) who, after serving 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread, creates a new identity and a new life for himself. Years later, he encounters Fantine (Emily Lynne Miller), a dying woman using any means necessary to provide for her child, Cosette (Kate Toole), and he agrees to take care of the child and raise her as his own. Meanwhile, Javert (Brady Patsy), a policeman with a strict moral code, is after Valjean for violating his parole. And the whole time all of these characters are interacting, the people of France are organizing a revolution.
While it may seem redundant to cite the music as the best part of the musical, the vocals are absolutely what stand out most about this performance. There are very few lines of spoken dialogue in the show; the entire story is told in song. The cast members not only provide the entertainment of beautiful, strong voices, but also convey the characters’ personalities and emotional struggles through their songs. The stars’ voices are especially mind-blowing.
Another remarkable aspect of this production is the cast itself. Performers range from children studying at performing arts academies, to college students from several different universities, to Broadway performers, to professional film actors, and even an award-winning cartoonist. If diversity is indeed the spice of life, perhaps the wide range of backgrounds from the different cast members is part of what makes this performance so fantastic.
One particular star in this production is Tim Hartman, who plays the sticky-fingered, drunken innkeeper, Master Thenardier. Hartman is a native Pittsburgher and is known for his work on Broadway. He has also made his appearance on the silver screen in films including The Silence of the Lambs, The Mothman Prophecies, The Piano Lesson, and the highly anticipated adaptation of the John Green novel that was filmed right in Pittsburgh’s backyard, The Fault in Our Stars. Hartman’s expressive face and tall, lanky figure definitely lend themselves to his comedic role. In an otherwise quite somber story, Hartman and his counterpart, Victoria English, who plays his equally nasty wife, offer moments of comedic relief.
Among the cast members are two Tartans: Emily Carr and Donovan Smith. Smith, a senior vocal performance major, lends his beautiful, operatic vocals to the character Enjorlas, one of the leaders of the revolution. Carr, a sophomore vocal performance major, brings life and passion to her role as a female factory worker. She is also the understudy for Fantine.
When it comes to vocals, however, there are four particularly outstanding performances: those of Peter Matthew Smith, Patsy, Victoria Buchtan, and David Toole.
Smith (Valjean), Toole (Marius), and Patsy (Javert) are all professionals in the creative arts and entertainment industry. Smith has performed on Broadway and worked with the Pittsburgh CLO and Pittsburgh Musical Theater in numerous productions. His vocal range is an outstanding portrayal of Valjean that even rivals that of Hugh Jackman.
Toole also has many productions with the Pittsburgh Musical Theater and Pittsburgh CLO under his belt. His voice rallies the people of France into revolution in one scene and in the next declares his love for Cosette, who, interestingly, was played by his real-life wife Kate Toole. His voice is simply beautiful.
Patsy offers a stark contrast to the voices of both Smith and Toole with his deep, booming vocals. He has more of a hand in the future generations of performers. He is a creative arts administrator at the Propel PITCAIRN charter school in Monroeville and a performing arts teacher at the Richard E. Rauh Conservatory for the performing arts.
Buchtan (Eponine), on the other hand, is a sophomore at Robert Morris University double majoring in communication and theater. Her voice can hardly be described as anything less than perfect — clear, beautiful, and deeply connected to the emotions of her character. Her rendering of unrequited love evokes sympathy and has the ability to even draw tears from the audience.
Of course, the performance is not without its faults. There was an obvious case of opening-night jitters among many of the cast members on March 27 — some forgot words or even entire verses to songs. While die-hard Les Mis fans would have definitely noticed, those not particularly familiar with the musical probably would not have, and still would have enjoyed the musical despite the flaws.
Les Misérables runs at the Byham Theater through April 6.

If you happened to be exploring the empty streets of North Braddock Avenue last weekend, you may have come across an old warehouse, its brick walls splashed with graffiti. Inside this building, if you were to walk through its cavernous rooms to take the lift to the fourth floor, you may have then come across a strange sight: a large white oblong box with silvery string curtains hanging along its sides.
This was not some black monolith from a race of intergalactic higher beings; rather, it was the set of the School of Drama’s production of The Glass Menagerie, one of American playwright Tennessee Williams’ most renowned plays. The Glass Menagerie, based on Williams’ own youth and family life, is an intimate glimpse into the insanity of the dysfunctional Wingfield family, and it is this insanity that stood at the front and center of the production. Directed by John Wells directing program fellow Michelle Sutherland, the production revealed in the abstract that although the dialogue and characters maintained the original script and were grounded and realistic enough, everything else in the production was a stark departure from reality, to offer us “truth in disguise of illusion.”
Senior acting major Claire Chapelli played Amanda, a faded southern belle who becomes a poor single mother after her husband leaves her. Chapelli, who also co-wrote the original music for the production, brought a brilliant performance that evoked both revulsion and sympathy. Senior acting major Joe Mendick played Tom, the sole provider of the family who longs to escape his job at a shoe warehouse and become a poet. Senior acting major Sarah-Nicole Robles played Laura Wingfield, a painfully shy girl of 24 who is content to live in her world of Victrola records and glass animals. Senior acting major Carl Lundstedt played the gentleman caller, Jim O’Connor, a guest who is invited by the Wingfields in the expectation that he will take a liking to Laura.
As for the choreography of actors, each character had their own distinctive poses and movements. For example, Amanda Wingfield, the mother, snapped with both hands, and her son Tom often made motions as if he were drawing a bow at his mother. The actors constantly moved about each other in circular movements; in quarrels and heated engagements, they frantically twirled around each other. Conversations involved bizarre rituals in which a pair of shoes were moved about, hands were raised and then abruptly slapped down again, and there was much pacing back and forth.
The bizarreness of these rituals were only further highlighted when a visitor came to the family’s home and, like a tourist in a foreign city, tried to navigate his way through their social conventions. Like the audience, his confusion was apparent as he accidentally disrupted the family’s rituals and failed in trying to emulate them.
These movements, which had to seem natural but sharply distinctive, added an extra dimension of difficulty in terms of acting, but the actors pulled them off incredibly well.
The aforementioned stage — white frame, pink floor, and string curtains — contained only a few set pieces and felt vast and empty, yet at the same time restrictive and prisonlike. Watching the action on stage from the audience felt like looking into a large aquarium. The curtains along the side of the stage doubled as a screen that projected images and live recordings from two cameras along the sides of the box. The Glass Menagerie was originally written with such a screen to be used in the play, but many productions often leave out the screen, deeming it unnecessary or pretentious. However, the School of Drama’s production put it at the forefront of attention. The way the stage was built, the entirety of the play took place behind the curtain, within the box. The curtain-screen was used to great symbolic, as well as practical, effect.
The screen aided in transitions and created momentary distractions during the course of the play. The actors sometimes traced their fingers on the curtain as they walked along the sides of the box, disrupting the vertical serenity of the curtain strings, and sometimes they brushed it aside, peeking out into the audience. However, the screen was used most effectively when it was used to project close-ups of the actors’ faces, which created a more intimate setting and allowed the audience to see the actors’ expressions better. The screen was also often used to build atmosphere. During the final act of the play, when all the other lights were dimmed, the screen became lit up by sparkles of light, creating a momentary feeling of magic.
Interestingly enough, the production seemed to draw influences from Japanese theater in its use of auditory cues to heighten drama, as well as the exaggerated movements and poses of the actors.
Throughout the production, bells, ominous chimes, whistles, and the crash of broken glass sounded through the performance area. The production also made use of musical sequences, in which the actors sang before the cameras. Psychedelic music and imagery were used in these sequences to offer a look into the characters’ mental states.
The School of Drama production brought a distinctive flavor and energy to an already incredible play. At times brilliant, disturbing, funny, and always deeply rooted within a world of its own, The Glass Menagerie was truly a unique experience to behold.

What does race mean to you? Is it something real, something that defines us and our biological history? Or is it a social construct, created by others to define how they see us in order to organize society into narrow structures?
At the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, a nationally touring exhibition titled “Race: Are We So Different?” explores race in the United States as an evolving, complex issue. The exhibit is a project of the American Anthropological Association and Science Museum of Minnesota, and funded in part by the National Science Foundation and Ford Foundation.
The exhibit combines biological, cultural, and historical points of view to tell a story about what race really means — and why it’s less rooted in science and more rooted in society. Rather than focusing on any single perspective on race, the show was curated to weave together ideas about race from the dawn of the nation to the present, while making explicit connections to current problems impacted by our skewed understanding of race. The exhibit sought to generate and guide discussion in the room, providing broad theoretical questions rather than answers. These prompts ranged from “Can you talk to your friends about race?” to “Does where we come from tell us who we are?”
Education, healthcare, voting, economic inequality, and home ownership were among the key issues explored.
Most compelling about the exhibition was the use of visuals, such as archival photography, documentary videos, and interactive maps, complemented by persuasive and slightly shocking statistics.
Just 100 years ago, much of Western philosophy believed that race was the indicator that all people are inherently unequal, and pointed to biological differences as evidence. Yet while the “science” of racial inequality has largely been discarded, the philosophy, politics, and ideology based on such ideas remain at the core framework of American society.
With clear community-oriented objectives, the Carnegie Museum supplemented the core exhibit with a local section on the history of race in Pittsburgh through a comparison of photojournalism from the 1950s to the present. A city rich with working-class and racial history, Pittsburgh remains one of the most segregated cities: African-American communities and white communities are almost entirely separated from one another. The exhibit aimed to deepen conversation within the city on the impacts of racial inequality. A gallery talk Saturday morning invited Pittsburgh’s diverse community to join the curators of the photographic exhibit to discuss what they found when they asked Pittsburgh residents, “How would you describe race relations in Pittsburgh?”
In many ways, Carnegie Mellon is a diverse campus with students from around the world. While only 11 percent of students are African-American, Hispanic, or Native American, another 15 percent are international, and students and faculty alike tend to perceive the campus as diverse. Yet this diversity should not diminish the importance of understanding that whether we individually feel it all the time or not, defining race is very much a critical issue in understanding the United States and the world in the 21st century.
Powerfully presented, this exhibition demonstrates that by expanding the conversation on race to talk about inequality and prejudice in general, it becomes possible to get past our own limited sense of identity and move toward a global understanding of race.

Montreal native Mac Demarco, one of the unique and off-kilter personalities in indie rock, has released a followup to his breakthrough 2012 record, 2, and it shows an emotional and musical maturity that many never saw coming. Made available for free streaming last Sunday on the National Public Radio website and set to be officially released on Tuesday, Salad Days gives us a Demarco that has invested more of himself into his art than ever before, and the results are commendable.
Recorded mostly in Demarco’s home in Brooklyn, Salad Days features jangly, surf-pop-inspired guitars and bass lines akin to other indie favorites such as Real Estate. The production is also very stark and gives the songs a sense of immediacy; you really feel as if you’re sitting on the floor while Demarco is singing to you from the edge of his bed.
Running throughout the album are themes of growing up, living life in one’s own way, and a fear of loss. “Goodbye Weekend” serves as a “kids are alright”-style PSA to a skeptic that may have good reason to be concerned, but with an attitude that declares that it’s not their life so they should just shut up. Album opener “Salad Days” scoffs at those who tell Demarco to “act your age” and who act as if his “life is already over.”
Demarco’s sound is a mix of pop, indie, and surf that sounds innocent on the surface, until you listen to the accpmpanying lyrics. Radio-ready single “Let Her Go” pairs mopey lyrics with a sunshiny, 60s pop melody and instrumentation. The results are a breakup song that would make a great soundtrack for a drive along the beach.
One thing that makes Salad Days such a significant departure from Demarco’s previous work is how much more personal he’s allowed his songwriting to become.
“Passing Out Pieces” is mediation on his newfound fame and the experiences — good and bad — that have made him who he is today. “It’s all I’ve seen that can’t be wiped clean / It’s hard to believe what it’s made of me.”
“Let My Baby Stay” adds childlike glockenspiels to a tender and blissful love song full of fear. As Demarco explained in an interview with Pitchfork, the song was inspired by his longtime girlfriend Kiera, who lives with him in Brooklyn without a visa.. 
He said in the interview that “Her ability to enter and exit the States is threatened, so that’s a stress for me, and it’s pretty much all my fault.” The song acts as a desperate plea to an unknown force, and it’s a request you can’t help but wish you could grant.
One of the greatest stock characters in music is the “Peter Pan”-like voice of youth; the rock star that won’t grow up no matter how much you try to make him. Those characters give those of us who’ve yielded to the unstoppable flow of human maturation a hope that — if we really wanted to — we could just spend our days like we were 16 forever and do absolutely nothing with no possible consequence. The problem with these characters is that they’re not human, so ultimately, we can only relate to them in limited respects. Demarco was the embodiment of this character, but with Salad Days he has progressed as a serious artist. He proves with this album that he is actually human, and I can’t wait to watch him grow even more.

Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues
Thursday, April 3
10:30
Attention everyone: Ron Burgundy is back at the news desk in an entirely new era. Although it’s no longer the 70s and he’s out of San Diego, Ron (Will Ferrell) is living a sublime life with his new wife Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) and son Walter Burgundy (Judah Nelson) in the Big Apple. When Veronica is chosen to become the full-time anchor, Ron’s life takes a turn for the worse, but he is able to find a second chance by joining the Global News Network and its launch of the world’s first 24/7 news channel. With high hopes, he recruits his old team to transform the world of news and come out on top. Ferrell’s comedic prowess brings a sort of courageous stupidity to Burgundy that makes the film so wonderful and somehow leaves you rooting for him to become the king of news once again.
American Hustle
Saturday, April 5
9:00
Written and directed by David O’Russell, American Hustle is a kooky take on the FBI’s Abscam operation during the late 1970s and 80s. Bronx-born con artist Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) are forced to work under the guide of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) in a political bribe sting. It shouldn’t be surprising that another David O’Russell film has generated magnificent performances from its ensemble cast, with Jennifer Lawrence in particular, shining as Rosenfeld’s nagging wife. While American Hustle is a crime comedy that explores the world of corruption, it is essentially a love story set in the gaudiest era of our time.

Dear Matt and Ryan,
There is one sound that no one knows: What does the fox say?
Sincerely,
Habitually About The Egregious Exaggerations Holding Opulence
Dear HATEE-HO
For the love of a bald and terrified mathematician, how should I know?
Speaking of which, if we examine W. Kroniker’s seminal work, entitled Smoothness on Co-Symmetric Right-Completely Null Paths, we will find every semi-characteristic, free, quasi-combinatorially canonical triangle is locally minimal. It is then trivial to show that the Riemann hypothesis holds, and that pi is smaller than e. By continuity, the sub-composite and quasi-almost surely differentiable path is isomorphic.
Recently, there has been much interest in the derivation of numbers, which is beyond the scope of this review. Therefore, in future work, we plan to address questions of naturality as well as neutrality.
It’s your karma,
Matt & Ryan
Dear Ryan and Matt,
OMIGAWD you guys are seriously so hot like even though I’ve never seen you in person I just like know you’re the ones, and I think we should like get together for drinks or something and you just see where it goes or whatever! Like I don’t even know how to explain myself, but it’s a total personality thing, you know? I can just like tell from your writing that you’re hilarious and so cute and amazingly charming and ugh! I mean you totally don’t have to feel pressured or anything, because that’s like the LAST thing I want, but ohmigod, if we could just hang out, I’m like 300% sure that we’ll hit it off, if only because you’re so sexy when you write advice. 
So hit me up, fellas. I’m single and desperate to mingle.
Sincerely,
A Weird, Klutzy, WARDLY SMITTEN
Dear AWKWARDLY SMITTEN,
Uh … thanks. We guess.
Let’s … let’s just be friends,
Ryan & Matt

Patterned pants are a trend that have been in style for quite a while now, yet most people continue to be wary of them. Though patterned pants can be slightly more challenging to style than solid colors, choosing what to wear with them should become a breeze after reading this article. All you need is a couple of tips and tricks on what you should and shouldn’t wear with patterned pants to ensure that you look cool and unique, but not like you belong to the circus.
Colored jeans fall under the category of patterned pants, and they’re considered an important spring staple for many. Choosing the right color is the first step before you consider styling them. Mint green, pale blue, and coral are common colors of jeans that people tend to wear in the spring and summer. They’re also good for dressing in-season on days that are slightly colder. These jeans can be worn with a variety of tops, including pretty floral tanks and blouses, or a crisp white shirt for a slightly more professional look. These colored jeans would also look good with light sweaters in cream or beige. In terms of shoes, colored jeans look great with ballet flats, a classic example of spring footwear.
Printed pants in general are also very fashion-forward for spring. The floral pattern is a common choice for printed pants. Pairing floral pants with a solid top containing one of the colors that the pants have in them is a great choice. For example, if the flowers that are part of the floral pattern have purple, pink, and blue flowers in them, wear a nice blouse in the same shade of purple (or pink, or blue) to highlight that color. This rule applies even if the print on the pants isn’t floral. Usually, the pants will be white with a pattern or black with a pattern, so it would look better to wear a colored top rather than a top in a neutral color.
The shape of the printed pants is also important. Take, for instance, the bohemian corduroy pants at Free People. These wide-legged pants are especially hard to pull off but can still be attempted by those who are willing to take risks in fashion. Due to their shape, they look better with fitted tops. Add layered necklaces or other bohemian accessories to accessorize and create a complete look. Free People also has skinny printed corduroy pants that can be paired with a billowy top in a neutral color.
Harem pants have also recently come into style and are great for summer because they’re light and comfortable. They always have unique prints and are found in bright colors as well. Wear them with casual T-shirts or tank tops in neutral colors, and choose either sandals or short ankle boots for footwear.
These pants should also be differentiated from printed leggings. While patterned pants give a more dressed-up look and should be worn when you want to look put-together, wear patterned leggings for something more casual. Leggings come in the widest assortment of patterns, but it is necessary to sort the good from the bad. Some patterned leggings can be found in a strange, sheer and shiny pattern, which should be avoided since they’ll probably be somewhat see-through as well. Floral leggings — as in the case of pants — are the most common. However, these should be paired with a neutral tunic or baggy T-shirt with a light, modest pattern on it. Other patterns of leggings can be found, ranging from tribal prints to geometric prints. Note that the printed leggings should be worn with longer, baggy tops; these tops need to have designs that do not clash with the patterns on the leggings.
There are a lot of ways to wear printed pants, especially because of the range in styles in which they’re available. As a result, there’s no need for the idea of printed pants to scare you from trying this trend. Printed pants have been in style for quite a while now, so it’s time for you to join the trend!

With elections now open for Student Senate positions, including student body president (SBP), student body vice president (SBVP), student body vice president for finance (SBVPF), student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO), and more, the candidates for the four major positions participated in debates last week.
Approximately 40 people attended Tuesday’s SBP and SBVP debate in Rangos 2. The event was also live streamed online by cmuTV.
During the debate, each set of candidates had three minutes to make an opening statement, after which there was a question and answer format — the moderator posed a question and the candidates responded. The candidates received 30 seconds to respond to their opponents after each question. The event ended with closing remarks from both sets of candidates.
Running on one ticket are junior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner (for SBP) and junior biological sciences major Shalini Ray (for SBVP). In their platform, they focus on improving student life, with initiatives such as restructuring dining plans, improving campus unity, restructuring Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs), and reforming dorm alcohol policies.
The other ticket is comprised of junior chemistry major Dominic Akerele (for SBP) and junior electrical and computer engineering major Rohan Saigal (for SBVP). In their platform, they focus on increasing student engagement, improving the campus printing system, improving students’ health, and creating a campus homepage for students with a link to Blackboard and information about extracurricular activities occurring around campus.
In his opening statement, Akerele called for greater support for the student body, encouraging a less stressful campus culture and better faculty-student relationships. Saigal summarized their goals, saying, “It’s our job as a student government to help facilitate and make everyday life better and distract from this academic stress.”
Akerele continued his remarks, stating, “We would like to highlight our student body.” He added, “This is supposed to be the best four years of your life; five if you’re an archie.”
Glasner framed his candidacy in terms of improving student representation and participation in student government: “I want to give students a chance to represent themselves.”
Glasner dismissed candidates’ platforms for building school spirit in previous years as “pep rallies,” adding that he and Ray had been in student government for all three years of their time at Carnegie Mellon. He went on to say, “We actually have a plan of attack.”
Akerele and Saigal want to create a spirit week in the fall, which would culminate in a day off for students. Saigal explained, “Carnival is only two to four days out of the year; we want to have a lot of events that the campus can get excited about.” He also said that he would push for greater support of athletic events in student culture, stating that he wished the atmosphere of Carnegie Mellon football games would be akin to the atmosphere at Ohio State University.
In response to an audience question about the feasibility of obtaining a day off from classes in the fall, Akerele responded, “We haven’t really gone through any of the specific details.”
“We want students to be proud of where we go to school,” Akerele continued, describing the “Hump Day Hangouts” initiative in their platform where “Every Wednesday we’d hand out free, healthy snacks.”
Glasner agreed that Carnegie Mellon school spirit is “definitely on the weaker side,” but portrayed the lack of sports and football excitement in a more positive light. Students who come to Carnegie Mellon may value these traits, he said. In terms of building spirit, Glasner said, “We can do more for juniors and sophomores to give them more specific events,” noting that there are a multitude of first-year and senior-oriented events, but very few targeting students in their second and third years.
Glasner also spoke about improving the dining system on campus. Glasner wishes to alter the cost structure of meal plans so that upperclassmen are incentivized to keep meal plans. “Dining is something I’m really passionate about at this school,” he said, recalling a meeting he had with Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy, who did not believe that a block could cost over nine dollars on some meal plans. Glasner recalled doing the math in front of Murphy to prove his point.
In their platform, Glasner and Ray describe an initiative for the creation of blocks that are more desirable to upperclassmen. These block could come without a side or beverage, Glasner said during the debate.
During the response period, Saigal countered their plan by saying that meal blocks are not healthy and that “we want to take the initiative to allocate the budget to free food,” namely healthy food.
Saigal said, “I’ve heard over a hundred complaints … we need to fix Skibo Gym.” Akerele and Saigal want to allocate money for the improvement of athletic facilities to improve student motivation to use the gyms.
Akerele also spoke of their desire to get new university printers at the Intersection housing cluster and off-campus housing locations, such as Webster Hall and Fairfax Apartments. “It would be good to have another printing system in the UC,” he added.
Ray criticized Akerele’s idea, saying, “You would definitely need a lot more help than just from computing services.”
Junior information systems major and Joint Funding Committee (JFC) representative Andrew Schwartz questioned the feasibility of the printer purchases during the audience question period, saying, “Student body presidents are usually given between five and six thousand dollars for the year.” He continued, “a lot of these printers cost between ten and twelve thousand dollars.” Schwartz mentioned that student government recently installed a new printer for the university. The printer had to be rented to make it affordable, according to Schwartz. He also also mentioned that the budget for food would likely be $3,000 to $4,000, which would limit free food initiatives.
Glasner also proposed changes in the university’s underage drinking policy, including a process for internal citations and discipline, in a fashion similar to that adopted by all eight Ivy League schools. 
Glasner explained that current Carnegie Mellon policy is to report underage drinking to the police, after which cited students must appear before a Pennsylvania magistrate and receive a citation from the state.
Glasner acknowledged the potential difficulties of implementing these reforms, saying, “The roadblocks are definitely there.” He noted that he would begin the process with a student referendum or petition.
Saigal responded to the proposed reform: “When it comes to alcohol … our main concern should be safety,” adding, “the real world doesn’t handle issues like this so lightly.”
Glasner responded to people’s ability to clear their records through the court process by recalling his experiences as an RA and CA, saying “almost universally, [I’ve heard] from students that they don’t grow from the process of going to court, and what they do grow from is a meeting with me or their housefellow.” 
He later added, “when you send students to court, they get angry … they don’t learn why they shouldn’t be drinking in a dorm room.” Glasner concluded by saying, “The informal process isn’t there, compared to what our peer universities have.”
Ray echoed this sentiment, saying that “college is supposed to be a stepping stone into the real world.”
Both pairs of candidates also discussed communication between President Suresh and the campus community. Akerele and Saigal said “We’ve been pushing for two speaking sessions, one in the spring and one in the fall.” Regarding the president’s visibility, Glasner responded, “I think he did a very good job this year.” He also said, “I think his reach out to campus could be greater, but I’d attribute that to it being his first year.”
Wednesday’s debates for the SBVPF and SBVPO, held in Doherty 2210, were sparsely attended. The first debate of the evening for the position of SBVPF was among three candidates: junior chemical engineering major Elena Karras, junior economics major Matthew Greenberg, and sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani.
Several questions concerned how the candidates would increase understanding among organization leaders regarding their group’s financial needs, how they would address the problem of organizations going over their allocated JFC budgets, and their thoughts on the current JFC budgeting process and whether they thought it could be improved.
In his answers, Greenberg stressed the various reforms he wishes to institute if elected to the position. “I’m trying to go out there and make significant changes as to how the JFC process works currently,” he said. 
He plans to change the timetable by which JFC representatives are elected and to institute a key performance indicator (KPI) that would make appropriation of funding “completely objective,” according to Greenberg.
Karras and Kothandapani, who both already serve as Senators for their respective colleges and act as representatives for the JFC, expressed many similar ideas regarding what they would like to accomplish in the position. 
Both candidates emphasized their desire to improve current policies and procedures within the JFC budgeting process, as well as to enhance transparency and communication between organizations and their JFC representatives.
Greenberg was asked to answer questions concerning his KPI proposal to objectively determine JFC funding based on the organization’s spending history and impact on campus, the particulars of which he said are still in development.
Many expressed concern over the KPI, particularly regarding its effectiveness and necessity. Senior chemistry major and current chair of Student Senate Lukas Ronner said to The Tartan, “I am critical of the KPI because I’ve never seen an objective way to determine an organization’s impact due to the diversity of organizations here on campus.”
Following the SBVPF debates, the three candidates for student body vice president for organizations took to the podium: first-year chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major Trevor Hadick, sophomore computer science and math double major Jackson Michalak, and sophomore mechanical engineering major Paul Kioko.
Many of the questions posed to the candidates concerned the current recognition process for student organizations and its effectiveness, as well as the SBVPO’s role in running the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO).
Drawing on his current involvement in CoSO, Michalak stressed the need for changes to the current recognition process. “I’ve seen many organizations come to me trying to get recognized, and they struggle. It’s a long process; it’s difficult; we have high standards for our organizations ... so I would like to make these expectations clear up front so that we can help organizations get through this process very quickly.”
Hadick pointed out that he would like the SBVPO to also serve as a resource for students in discovering organizations that would be right for them. “Students want to find their niche, but they don’t know how to do it. They don’t know what organizations are out there or where they’ll fit in ... there are a lot of times during office hours where students should be able to come in and talk to me about their interests and I can inform of the clubs that are on campus to fulfill their interests.”
Fifth year decision science and psychology double major and current SBVPO Corinne Rockoff commented to The Tartan, “When I took office, I found the biggest hindrance to be my lack of experience ... one candidate having an abundance of experience should be a really important factor for voters to consider.”
Voting closes today at 6 p.m. Polling stations are available today from 12–1:30 p.m. and 5–6 p.m. in the UC Kirr Commons. Voters can also vote online at http://www.cmu.edu/studentvote.

At 9 a.m. on Saturday morning, a crew of people wearing orange reflective vests could be seen sweeping Craig Street. 
These workers had not been sentenced to community service, nor were they being paid for their labor — it was a group of Carnegie Mellon students taking part in 1000plus.
The Craig Street team was led by M. Shernell Smith, assistant director within the office of the dean of student affairs. “I’ve always thought it’s great for CMU to get out en masse,” said Smith. “People tend to get bogged down within the bubble.” Smith couldn’t talk long before a new volunteer arrived; she rushed over to give the volunteer a shovel.
This Saturday marked the seventh year of 1000plus, a massive organizational feat which, last year, engaged 1,053 volunteers with 32 charities, 20 buses, and 54 large groups. Although the count has not yet been finalized, this year appears to be even larger.
According to Vivian Chang, the president of the 1000plus executive board and a senior policy and management and psychology double major, the Greek organizations are particularly active in 1000plus. The biggest group this year  was Sigma Alpha Epsilon, with 74 members participating in the event.
“1000plus is a great opportunity for people to volunteer; it’s low commitment so it fits easily into people’s busy schedules,” said Chang, who added that some students learn about charities through 1000plus and continue to volunteer with them for years to come.
This year, alumni in Massachusetts and North Carolina organized their own service projects to coincide with the 1000plus event at the Pittsburgh campus. 
Some 50 alumni took part, a large number given that 1000plus began in 2008, so only recent alumni may be aware of the tradition.
This year also saw the introduction of some interesting new charities like Global Links, a group that sends medical surplus supplies which would be otherwise thrown away to poor countries. Volunteers helped sort and package medical supplies so they could be shipped off to countries in need.
Another new charity, Southside Slopes Neighborhood Association, had volunteers working in Monongahela Park, removing invasive species and picking up litter. “Its amazing how much people can give back in just one day,” said Smith.

As he sat in his office on the lower level of Carnegie Mellon’s Margaret Morrison Hall, Daragh Byrne’s excitement over the IDeATe program was evident.
Byrne, currently a research scientist in the Visible Process Lab at the School of Design and former assistant research professor at Arizona State University’s School of Arts, Media, and Engineering, has been tabbed as the Intel integrative design fellow for the university. He will be coordinating with faculty and students on the program and leading research on optimal methods for integrative design education, as well as on ways in which Intel products can be utilized for innovative, collaborative efforts.
The Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe) program is about combining “technical expertise with design expertise to create a next-generation learning environment for students,” Byrne explained. 
Carnegie Mellon, the fifth school to join the new Intel Design School Network, is the first to announce a program combining integrative design and technological skills for students from a diverse array of majors.
The IDeATe program is meant to support students looking at careers in media design, game design, and more. To Byrne, the partnership is about “exploring next-generation learning environments where students are supported by new and innovative technologies.” 
As part of IDeATe, Intel is gifting hardware and materials to the university, including tablets, laptops, and Galileo development boards, which will be available to students, designers, and faculty who are participating in the curriculum.
“The idea is that we now have a large amount of hardware that will give us a new chance to explore,” Byrne said. “It’s a fantastic opportunity. With the support of the university and of Intel, we can explore how to enhance [students'] integrative design experiences on campus.” 
Participation in the Intel Design School Network also connects students and faculty with Intel staff and individuals at other leading design schools for research projects and idea generation.
Byrne feels that the partnership with Intel is perfect at a school  like Carnegie Mellon. “We are top 10 in technology, design, and the arts, so we bring a great perspective and a lot of expertise to the Design School Network. The combination of technology, arts, and design here positions us to be leaders of innovation in the network and in integrative design.”
IDeATe is meant for the “next generation of designers, of computer scientists,” Byrne said. “Intel is providing classroom and product resources and we’re trying to apply them to students. Our goal is to get this technology in the hands of students and see what they can do with it.”
Launching in Fall 2014, IDeATe will offer over 28 courses covering several different concentrations and minors in areas including animation and special effects, learning media, media design, sound design, physical computing, and entrepreneurship for creative industries.  These will connect students from across Carnegie Mellon with faculty and staff from 25 different departments across Carnegie Mellon.  
A university press release notes that the new IDeATe courses “will focus on cutting-edge themes such as human-machine virtuosity, physical computing, expanded theater, and mobile design.”
Additionally, Byrne feels students from across campus and across many intersecting disciplines will be able to “come together and bridge skills, and move towards new and innovative outcomes.”
Byrne believes the program fits in with the times. “We’ll be trying to observe the evolution of these courses and understand how various experiences can be enhanced. We’ll try to gather and enhance the quality of learning and experiences for students.”
Editor's Note: A previous version of this article stated that the IDeATe program was funded by Intel. The IDeATe program is a university-funded initiative.

Audience Participation
Student Body Vice President Ian Glasner spoke to Student Senate, urging students to vote in the upcoming elections. Elections began on March 27. Glasner is a candidate for student body president; Shalini Ray is his running mate as student body vice president.
Special Allocation: WRCT receives $40,000 for new digital broadcasting equipment
Senate allocated $40,000 to WRCT. Senate initially approved a motion to allocate $23,300 to WRCT, but an amendment was passed to raise the funding to $40,000. This funding comes from the media fee reserve account, which holds the yearly overflow from the unread newspapers provided by the Collegiate Readership Program, which is funded by the media fee, a $10 fee included in students’ tuition. Last year, Senate set a precedent by allocating $65,000 from the media fee reserve account for Activities Board: Films to purchase a new digital 4K projector.
The allocated money will be used by WRCT to buy the equipment needed to upgrade their studio to include digital appliances over the course of the summer and upcoming academic year. The company that made the analog equipment used by WRCT recently stopped producing parts, meaning that if their current analog equipment breaks, the radio station will not be able to broadcast.
Committee Reports

The American millennial has arrived. Born after 1980 and active over the last 15 years, millennials have gone to college in record numbers and piled up more student loan debt than either of the last two generations of Americans. In the wake of 9/11, they fought in the longest war in American history against Afghanistan, as well as in another incomprehensible war in Iraq. In the wake of the Great Recession, they are struggling to enter the workforce. Millennials voted en masse for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, drawn by his post-racial and post-partisan message. Six years into Obama’s presidency, they constitute 27 percent of the adult American population, and are still growing fully into their place in American society. It is imperative that we understand the formative qualities of this generation if we are to forecast the shape of American society in the 21st century.
The millennial is pragmatic. Millennials were raised in an Information Age, and they expect immediate and objective answers to their questions. Privileging information or giving it an ideological slant irritates them, and they seek to flatten, if not obliterate, traditional hierarchies of knowledge. The rise of massive online open courses (MOOCs) in the last five years speaks to this strain in millennial culture. The priest, the businessman, and the representative — these three institutional figures, and the alleged truths that they are privy to — neither impress millennials nor command their allegiance. Only the facts can do that, and in this Information Age, the facts are at their fingertips.
The millennial craves peer-to-peer contact. Having eschewed the communities encoded in the church and the boardroom, millennials invented digital social networks. On platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Skype, they exist in a web of rich and genuine connectivity with their friends, colleagues, and like-minded groups.
These digital natives abhor the artificiality of traditional politicians. They have no automatic respect for the hierarchical nature of American politics. They seek authenticity from their elected officials and from the political process in general. Because we live in a democracy, the chambers of our government have been marginally more responsive than the church and the boardroom to this desire for authenticity.
Barack Obama went from obscurity to presidency in the space of four years because he transcended the usual tribal din of American politics. He spoke of government beyond partisanship. He did not drum up votes by pitting blue against red, urban against rural, white against black. He did not use the color of his skin to seek the White House as a redress for the historical injustice perpetrated upon African-Americans by its white power structure. Many political professionals thought his refusal to indulge either of these impulses bordered on criminal malpractice.
But Barack Obama had correctly perceived one thing: the pragmatic millennial wanted to hear how government would better discharge the duties of governance in a democratic society. Furthermore, the millennial wanted to hear a sound case for how these duties would be discharged. They wanted facts and figures and logical reasoning. To tell them anything else was to step outside the dominion of a man seeking the presidency. The millennial does not see politics as an arena for waging battles for the soul of a nation. Politicians who distort the political process to wage such battles will, if millennials continue exerting their electoral influence, become obsolete creatures.
Roughly half of all millennials today identify themselves as politically independent. Toughened by the ravages of the Great Recession and hardened by the War on Terror, these millennials do not much care for the merits of the free market or the myth of American exceptionalism. However, following the messy rollout of Obamacare, they are also aware of government’s inefficacy in discharging its duties.
Millennials will not be reliably Democratic voters, even though they voted in record numbers for Barack Obama. Future candidates, at every level of government, will be well served by recognizing the pragmatic personality of the millennial generation, and appealing to it at the expense of every other trick in the political playbook. The American millennial has come of age. It is time American politics made room for them at the table.

Earlier this week, the Supreme Court took up an important case regarding the Affordable Care Act requirement detailing that companies provide health insurance that covers IUD’s and morning-after pills, such as Plan B and Ella, to their employees. Certain privately-owned companies —  such as Hobby Lobby, the company bringing the suit before the court — have religious owners who object to the idea of being forced to subsidize actions they believe are tantamount to murder. The court is now forced to make a decision with far-reaching consequences, as a result of the federal overreach contained in the Affordable Care Act, which broaches the sanctity of private contracts and puts the federal government in charge of traditionally state issues.
No matter what the court decides, there are decidedly negative consequences for both decisions. If the court decides in favor of the government, then religious freedom is clearly compromised. It’s reasonable for someone to object to forced subsidization of devices and medication that prevent the further development of a fertilized egg. There are people who hold that all forms of human life should be protected, and while they shouldn’t be able to prevent others from expressing beliefs contrary to those they hold, they also shouldn’t be forced to subsidize something that they think is immoral.
Deciding in favor of the government means that people are confronted with the option of either compromising their religious beliefs or giving up being business owners. This forced decision is an unreasonable affront to religious freedom, because being a principled Christian is totally reasonable, and protection of religious freedom means that religious beliefs shouldn’t prevent a person from going about their daily life.
On the other hand, deciding in favor of Hobby Lobby sets a dangerous precedent. This decision would allow people or corporations to get exemption from the law if they can claim a law is an affront on their religious freedom. Given the obscurity and depth of the world of religions, it’ll be difficult to determine where the legitimacy of religious claims cuts off, and where people start abusing the exemption to just get out of complying to laws they don’t like.
Either way the court decides, religious freedom — a right held near and dear to our country’s history — or the rule of law — another important part of our nation’s history, though one that the Obama Administration has made a habit of compromising — hold much less power than they once did. Our country once held the sanctity of a private contract as an implicit right. If I believe that I and those around me are rational human beings, any contract that they sign should be their business and not mine or the government’s. The government doesn’t know what’s best for you — you do. State governments can restrict this right because they’re given this type of regulatory authority. The federal government has traditionally had no business messing with people’s contracts, and this overreach perfectly illustrates why any federal intrusion into uncharted territory is a slippery slope to abuse.
Intrusion into the sanctity of a private contract started with a minimum wage law, which the Supreme Court actually declared unconstitutional when it was first introduced for this very reason. These intrusions have gradually built up, through taxes and regulations, until today. All of these reforms have been well intentioned, but the increase in federal power has led to something like the Affordable Care Act being thought to be within the scope of what the government can do, putting the court in the place it finds itself today.
The federal government should not violate the sanctity of private contracts for any reason or in any way. Individuals, not the government, are best equipped to make decisions for themselves. If the federal government respected this principle, the Supreme Court would not find itself in a position where either decision that it renders will significantly weaken one of two fundamental pillars of American society.

After raising $2.4 million on Kickstarter a year-and-a-half ago, Oculus VR is finally starting to make mainstream virtual reality a reality. By utilizing the latest in mobile technologies, the company’s product, the Oculus Rift, will be the first consumer product to combine a uniquely immersive experience with a price tag realistic for everyday people. However, many are both praising and condemning this week’s acquisition of Oculus by Facebook, and Oculus’s future remains uncertain.
Initially, the Oculus Rift was envisioned by its developers to change the way people played video games. With stereoscopic 3-D, a 1080p 5-inch OLED display, and six-axis head tracking, the Oculus Rift provides a 360-degree viewing experience that people are describing as so realistic that they forget it is not the real world.
While there already exist virtual reality products on the market, none of them has been a major success, due to the fact that high price tags barred out most consumers, and that a head-movement lag plagued many devices and caused motion sickness.
However, just as Oculus Rift began to gain major attention from the media, the announcement that Facebook had purchased it for $2 billion began to raise much speculation and concern.
Some game developers even withdrew from supporting the Oculus Rift, showing deep dissatisfaction with the acquisition. Mojang owner and Minecraft creator Markus Persson announced that he would no longer be developing a version of his famous video game for Oculus Rift because “Facebook creeps [him] out.” 
In addition, many Kickstarter supporters were angered by this acquisition. One Kickstarter user named Michael Cooper responded with the words that many supporters were thinking: “What in hell was the point of Kickstarter if you sell out to a giant company like Facebook?”
However, while many like to spell doom for Oculus Rift and believe that Facebook will transform it into an ad-blasting 3-D device to display an enhanced News Feed, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees it as something much more than another gaming platform. He describes it as one of the few “candidates to be the next major computing platform.” He believes it could revolutionize the way we socialize, stating that “Oculus has the potential to be the most social platform ever. Imagine not just sharing moments with your friends online but entire experiences.”
Personally, I would bet that he wishes to somehow create some form of immersive video chat, in which those communicating could have 3-D views of each other’s environment. Judging from how he describes his experience using it, Zuckerberg truly believes this product is a revolution.
However, media theorist Nathan Jurgenson may describe another reasonable theory as to why Facebook is currently on a startup spending spree, describing it as “conspicuous acquisition.” He states that a purchase like this “doesn’t exist to make money but is rather a luxury prop to demonstrate a certain type of corporate status.” As The Guardian describes, Facebook bought Oculus for the same reason companies like Google make products like Glass; they want to use them to enhance their coolness factor.
The purchase of Oculus Rift has an uncertain outcome. In the best-case scenario, Facebook will use its technologies to change the way we communicate in a positive manner. In the worst-case scenario, Oculus will simply become one of Mark Zuckerberg’s luxury props, slow down virtual reality’s pace of innovation, and eventually be removed from the market altogether. 
However, no matter what happens, we can speculate that the Facebook acquisition is a loss for the gaming industry. The real question now is whether or not it will be a gain for communications and become the next computing platform, something that could be much more revolutionary than a gaming experience.

Over the past few weeks, as events in Crimea and Ukraine continue to make daily headlines, many have claimed that we are witnessing the rise of the next big geopolitical conflict since the Cold War. Some have made an even more extreme claim, saying that this crisis marks the return of the United States and Russia to the Cold War.
It is hard to believe now that the entire struggle in Ukraine was started by protests in the streets. There has been little word on the status of Russia’s relationship with ousted former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. All eyes are focused on Russian troop movements on the Ukraine border. 
Maybe Russian President Vladimir Putin sees this conflict as a continuation of the Cold War. Putin described Russia’s annexation of Crimea as retribution for “a deeply-held grievance about what he considers to be the loss of the Soviet Union.” As hard as it may be, the United States must lead the so-called Western powers in an effort to tear down the barriers between East and West that have existed since the Cold War.
There are many reasons to support this belief. After all, Russia is trying to bulldoze its way into Ukraine and exert its influence, which has waned ever since the rise of the European Union. Since much of Europe is dependent on Russian natural gas, Russia sees no reason to filter itself and no reason to hold itself back. Putin — always the cunning but brash diplomat — is clearly pushing forward, as reports estimate that 40,000 Russian troops have gathered at the border.
Though a resurgence of the Cold War implies an escalation on the military scale for all nations involved, this criteria has become inaccurate. The world has become much too interconnected and too globalized to have a true Cold War. In fact, just this past week, Obama has been in the Hague and elsewhere in the Netherlands, trying to tie up treaties and deals to denuclearize the world. Obama’s idea in doing so is to secure weapons-grade radioactive material in a manner safe for both the people and the environment, and safe from terrorist thieves. 
Many leaders, especially those who lead smaller nations like Singapore, have reacted to such a summit with relief. As Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong stated, “We would like the work to continue, but we have to consider how, [and] what is the most appropriate way the leaders can get involved,” according to Channel NewsAsia.
It all goes back to the question: who decides who gets nuclear power? As the world evolves to accommodate more and more people, countries are increasingly turning to nuclear power as their “sustainable” energy source. Singapore — a nation with developed infrastructure but lacking nuclear power — is just one example of a major Asian economic hub and productive power that could easily shift toward nuclear energy.
But how is the world supposed to denuclearize itself while facing an increasing shortage of resources? Moreover, how can the world accomplish denuclearization when Russia, one of its counterparts — the one with the most sizable nuclear arsenal of all — has actively partaken in an act of nuclear aggression? Conferences like these are extremely important, but with the United States and other Western nations pursuing a policy of sanctions — which don’t accomplish much — it is hard to see Russia holding ties with such a conference.
President Obama faced backlash when he condemned Russia this past week, but according to The New York Times, he pressed too far forward, and justified the use of force in Iraq, a war that is constantly berated as being imperialistic. Sanctions seem to be the first step in a diplomat’s handbook. They immediately place countries on different sides, as if sanctions lead to isolation, which leads to war. This logical chain of events is hardly wrong — just look at North Korea. After sanction upon sanction, the small Asian state is as alienated as ever.
What the United States needs to do is to maintain its leadership position in condemning Russia. However, while the United States continues to pursue a policy of squeezing Russian leaders out with some sort of economic siege, the world heads closer and closer to Cold War-like relations. 
Still, as the conference in Hague has shown, the world has become much too weaponized and sensitive to the risk of nuclear warfare to ever fall into another Cold War-like nuclear standoff. Meanwhile, Russia — large and distant — has become much too insensitive to ever simply agree to nuclear sanctions. Sanctions will only make relations between Russia and the rest of the world colder, and even if Russia settles with the West, relations will likely be as weak as ever.
In order to strengthen relations with Russia, the United States should look to China, another nation that cannot afford to be alienated by the United States. The United States must, in the long-run, seek better relations with China. As hard as this may sound, the relationship between China and America must extend beyond trade.
China has long admired the United States’ international superiority, but the United States has long eyed China with suspicion. China, as one of Russia’s closest allies — if you can even call them that — has the key to unlock Russia from being a massive, mysterious nation to a more relenting nation that might just be open to negotiations. 
The United States must look past sanctions and pick up Russia along the way, perhaps through China. The conference in the Hague just shows how important diplomacy is, while also showing that the world must avoid alienating any major power, including Russia.

The latest Girl Scouts selling season has unveiled a new cookie queen. Over the past eight weeks, 12-year-old Oklahoma Girl Scout Kate Francis sold over 18,100 boxes of cookies, according to Forbes. Francis — a young girl who, if she wants it, undoubtedly has a very promising future in business— broke the previous cookie-selling record of 18,000, held since 1986. 
Though Francis’s story may seem like the small-scale victory of one highly impressive girl, it speaks to the larger importance of  empowerment through financial literacy to young girls. Girl Scouts places girls in the position to learn valuable life skills, such as money management, time efficiency, interpersonal communication, leadership, and perseverance in pursuit of goals.  
Money management, and personal finance in general, is notoriously neglected in formal elementary and high school education. As the largest female-run business worldwide, the Girl Scouts cookie selling program provides girls with the crucial financial skills that formal education continues to fall short of adequately teaching. 
Programs like the Girl Scouts, and similar initiatives in formal education, should be encouraged and advanced. They may be key to the development of such skills that play a vital role in fostering the next generation of successful female leaders.

The adoption of Pittsburgh’s open data initiative is not only a victory for proponents of open government, but also signals an important and long-needed shift in city governance.
Through the open data law, officially adopted on March 11, the city will require that non-sensitive government data be posted online, encourage open policy standards, and guide departments in releasing their data for public viewing. Open data not only allows for greater transparency between the public and their government, but can also be used in academic studies on public policy issues.
The results from these studies can become valuable to the governments themselves, providing novel analyses which can improve the function of governmental systems and policy implementation. 
Pittsburgh’s new mayor Bill Peduto has shown an extraordinary commitment to 21st century government by embracing Pittsburgh’s potential to have both a tech-friendly city and a tech-friendly government. Additionally, the mayor has sent a strong example by opening Pittsburgh’s mayoral office, posting his schedule online for public viewing, tweeting regarding his location and work, and promoting responsible governance.
These measures come in sharp contrast to Pittsburgh’s previous mayor Luke Ravenstahl, who ran a decidedly closed mayor’s office which was often at odds with the public of Pittsburgh and city government itself. Ravenstahl is currently facing an FBI investigation regarding allegations of the use of taxpayer money for personal purposes. 
A recent article published by CBS Pittsburgh reveals that Ravenstahl left the mayor’s office with over $200,000 in missing or damaged property. This report reveals that this figure includes items such as a Pittsburgh Steelers’ 2006 Super Bowl victory trophy and office repairs, including a damaged painting and four broken chandeliers in the mayor’s office itself.
Peduto told CBS Pittsburgh “I don’t know why the public should have to pay for missing items or damaged items,” explaining that he turned the list of missing and damaged items over to the FBI.
Mayor Peduto’s adoption of an open data initiative not only allows for studies on policy to be conducted for the benefit of both government and taxpayers, but also signals a welcome shift away from the actions of  Luke Ravenstahl.

Last Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard preliminary discussions of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby is a chain of craft stores throughout parts of the United States. Hobby Lobby argues that the company should not have to provide certain types of birth control to their female employees, despite that birth control being included in the employees’ health insurance, because doing so violates the company’s religious beliefs. This argument hinges on the idea that companies have a certain level of personhood and can have religious beliefs at all. 
There are several problems with this argument. First, it prioritizes corporate choice over personal choice. By Hobby Lobby’s logic, the company has the right to restrict the choices of many individuals who work for them, based off the company’s religious beliefs, which are actually the religious beliefs of the owners themselves. Passing this ruling would not lead to an increased allowance of choice in the United States, it would merely narrow the playing field of who is allowed to make those choices. 
Second, restricting access to emergency contraceptives, such as Plan B or ella, in addition to IUDs, discriminates against female employees. 
The company’s owners can feel, however, they like about birth control in their personal lives. Nevertheless, those beliefs absolutely do not give them the right to prevent women from taking a medication that they might require, either for preventing pregnancy or for a myriad of other medical benefits, such relief from excessive acne or severe menstruation pains, as well as a dramatically lower risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. 
Beyond even the medical issue presented by this case, Hobby Lobby’s argument is that the company’s supposed religious freedoms allow for such discrimination against female employees. This ruling would have no effect on male employees; no one is arguing that companies should not have to pay for male employee’s Viagra. 
All of the members of Hobby Lobby have a right to their religious beliefs, including both the owners of the company and the average employees. However, one of those groups does not get to choose for the other.
