The ninth–ranked women’s soccer team hosted 22nd-ranked Lynchburg College in a non-conference match on Sunday, Oct. 22, with the Tartans prevailing 1–0. The win improves the Tartans’ record to 10–2–2 overall while the Hornets fall to 14–2.
In a game played mostly between the 18-yard boxes, the Tartans took advantage of an opportunity in the 21st minute and went on for the 1–0 victory.
Senior midfielder Tori Iatarola scored the goal for the Tartans after junior midfielder Tessa Allen headed a ball across the box. The ball bounced and went under the foot of a defender as she tried to clear it. Iatarola was on the right side of the defender and calmly finished the shot to the opposite post.
Lynchburg did put two shots on goal but first-year goalkeeper Carolyn Botz made the routine saves and registered her eighth shutout of the season.
On Friday, Oct. 27, the Tartans continued University Athletic Association (UAA) play when Emory University visited Pittsburgh. The Tartans earned a 2–1 victory to move to 11–2–2 for the year and 3–1–1 in the UAA while the Eagles fell to 9–5–1 and 1–3–1.
After a scoreless first half, the Tartans got on the board in the 60th minute when senior midfielder Morgan Kontor headed in a free ball in the box after Allen’s throw-in bounced twice in the box and was not secured by the keeper.
Less than two minutes later the Tartans earned a corner kick. Senior forward Sienna Stritter served a low driven ball to the near post where senior defender Alex Moy met it with one strike toward the goal for her first score of the season.
It wasn’t until the 82nd minute that the Eagles were able to cut into the Tartan lead, but the Tartans were able to hold on to the win.

Sophomore midfielder Cooper Tubiana opened the game’s scoring in the 16th minute when he one-timed a shot past the keeper’s right side from the penalty arc. Tubiana was gifted the ball off a defender’s foot after the Tartans strung together three passes starting with junior defender Jack McCambridge playing a ball to Wheaton from the right sideline. Wheaton then played a ball in to junior midfielder Zack Masciopinto. The defender slid to clear it but the ball landed at Tubiana’s foot.
Less than two minutes later, Masciopinto scored his team-leading eighth goal of the season. Wheaton was again involved when he fed the ball in to Masciopinto on the right side. Masciopinto turned, took a touch or two to his left and curled a left-footed shot around the defense and keeper for the two-goal advantage for the Tartans.
Emory cut the deficit in half in the 48th minute. The Eagles then earned a corner kick in the 56th minute and got the ball across the line for the equalizer.
Masciopinto had a chance in the first overtime with a header that was saved after a lofted service by junior forward Anthony Gulli over the defense.
The Eagles nearly put in the golden goal in the 104th minute when a shot went just wide of the left post, but the two teams were unable to score any further.

The Tartan is back for the all-encompassing, ever-important recap of Weeks Six and Seven of fantasy football. In Week Six, contributing editor Lula Beresford had a decisive win over my floundering team to move above .500, publisher Jade Crockem beat staffwriter Josh Andah to notch her first win since Week One, and editor-in-chief India Price fell to sports editor Ian Tanaya.
Now we’ve completed Week Seven. I was surprised to learn that I scored the least points in a 30-point blowout, which is the reason why I am once again presenting the week’s highs and lows. Here they are:
Team Andah over Third-String Team 115.7–85.5
The last time I scored the least points was also in a matchup against Team Andah. At least this time I didn’t lose by over 75 points. Team Andah was bolstered by strong weeks from several players, including 20-point performances from Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans, and Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown had 16.5 points, and Philadelphia Eagles tide end Zach Ertz added 19.9 points.
Though the reliable Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith scored 25.7 for my team, there wasn’t much else to smile about. I forgot to update my lineup to bench Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater, who was on his bye week, Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch scored a measly 0.9 points and is suspended for Week Eight, and my hometown team’s (Baltimore Ravens) defense let me down with just one point. At least my recent acquisition for Ravens running back Javorius Allen wasn’t a total loss.
Easy Breesy over Justin Tucker Must (not) Die 138.1–127.2
With his fifth win, Tanaya moves up to the top of the standings. Easily overcoming a minus-1 game from Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant, Tanaya’s team was stacked with great performances. His team’s namesake, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, ended with a respectable 19.1 points. Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy had 27.2 points. Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones also had a great week, totaling 24.9 points. The Jacksonville Jaguars defense also added 17 points to Easy Breesy’s total.
In her first loss since Week Three, Beresford had a good week but just couldn’t beat Easy Breesy. Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell had his third 30-carry game of October, amassing 22.2 points. Washington Redskins tight end Jordan Reed had a breakout game, adding 26.4 points to Beresford’s total. Her titular player, Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, also had a good week, kicking his way to 14 points. Despite this loss, I still believe Beresford’s team can go the distance to the postseason.
Yes We Cam over Drop it Like it’s Crock 115–109.5
After two consecutive losses, Price’s team returned to form with a win over Crockem’s. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton coughed up a rare bad performance, adding just 7.4 points to Yes We Cam’s total. However, several other players stepped up to the plate: Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill with  25.2 points, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry with 22.3 points, and the Steelers defense with 12 points.
Crockem’s team was the opposite, with a whopping 30-point performance from Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. Saints running back Mark Ingram had 21 points, while Saints kicker Wil Lutz added nine points. Crockem’s usual stable contributors, Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald had off weeks, both with sub-10 performances.
Coming up this week we have Team Andah facing off against Easy Breesy, Yes We Cam battling Justin Tucker Must (not) Die, and the two bottom barrel teams, Drop it Like it’s Crock and Third-String Team going at it. Even though Price’s team has a better record, I expect Beresford’s team to bounce back after this week’s loss and make it competitive. Unfortunately for Tanaya, Andah’s lineup is devoid of bye weeks (though his kicker is on injured reserve), so I wouldn’t bet a mortgage on Tanaya’s win. As for me and Crockem, we’re just along for the ride.

Astronomers detect astroid from outside the solar system
On Oct. 18, the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope discovered the object named A/2017 U1. It was originally thought to be a comet because of its highly titled orbits, however,  more data reveals that it might actually be an asteroid. 
All astroids discovered so far have been from within the solar system and revolve around the sun. Even comets, according to an article on Science News, come from the Oort cloud, and have highly tilted orbits but still orbit the sun.
This object’s path is at a very steep angle as compared to the other objects in this solar system to be orbiting the sun. More data collected by other telescopes from around the world suggest that this asteroid doesn’t originate from this solar system and now, is on its way out of it.
This object presents opportunity for scientists to better understand planets from other systems. It seems to be only 400 meters across and is flying across our solar system at 25.5 kilometers per second. 
These results were announced by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center in a bulletin on Oct. 25.

Climate change critically endangers Madagascar lemurs
The greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) found almost exclusively in Madagascar is a critically endangered species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
They are extremely picky eaters and eat a single species of bamboo throughout the year. They prefer the tender, nutritious shoots. However, during the dry months like pandas, they eat the hard, woody stems called culm. They even have specialized teeth for that purpose. Their highly specific diet makes them vulnerable to starvation as they become increasing dependent on culm as the climate becomes drier, and tender shoots become rarer. 
This dependency is a direct consequence of climate change. Global warming has caused, and if unchecked will continue to cause longer dry seasons, which will force the greater bamboo lemurs to eat culm.
Patricia Wright at Stony Brook University explains in an article on Science Daily, “making the lemurs rely on a suboptimal part of their food for just a bit longer may be enough to tip the balance from existence to extinction.”
The report was published in Current Biology on Oct. 26.

Scientists replace DNA errors instead of deleting them
On Oct. 25, a study published in Nature explained a new genome-editing technique that allowed scientists to replace the DNA base adenine to guanine. 
Previous CRISPR techniques used deletion to get rid of genomic errors. Another study was published by Feng Zhang and his team, also on Oct. 25, in Science journal that explained how to make the same corrections in RNA molecules.
CRISPR/Cas9 is used to make genetic modifications and correct errors in animals and even, human embryos. It uses a guiding RNA that allows the new DNA to reach the target DNA section, and then snip off the offending area.
Gene Yeo, an RNA biologist at the University of California, San Diego says, “we know there are drawbacks to cutting DNA.” Mistakes often arise when cellular machinery attempts to repair DNA breaks. And although accurate, CRISPR sometimes cuts DNA at places similar to the target, raising the possibility of introducing new mutations elsewhere. Such “permanent irreversible edits at the wrong place in the DNA could be bad,” Yeo says. “These two papers have different ways to solve that problem.”

A new artificial intelligence (AI) has reached a new landmark in mastering the strategy game of Go, shattering records using a fraction of its predecessor’s time and processing power.
Go is an ancient Chinese board game several thousand years old, with strategies and goals similar to chess. In Go, the players win by surrounding opponents’ pieces with their own.
AlphaGo, a computer program that plays the board game Go, made revolutionary achievements last year when it beat two of the world’s greatest Go players: South Korea’s Lee Se-dol and China’s Ke Jie. AlphaGo, developed by Google DeepMind in London, has been in the limelight for months, partially because its victory over human players came much earlier than expected. Because Go is an extremely complex mind game with more possible legal moves than there are atoms in the universe, AlphaGo’s win marked a huge milestone in the development of AI.
But just a few days ago, a new program called AlphaGo Zero vastly surpassed the feats made by AlphaGo. AlphaGo Zero “began with a blank Go board and no data apart from the rules, and then played itself,” according to BBC News. Within 72 hours of being given the rules of Go, AlphaGo Zero beat AlphaGo 100 games to zero. While AlphaGo took a few months for it to be developed enough to beat professional Go players, AlphaGo Zero took just three days, despite taking less processing power than its predecessor.
Board games like Go are one of the most effective ways to test the potential of AI software. Because these games involve responding to a separate player’s moves, winning the game requires more than just the average algorithms used in computer software; the software needs to mimic processes that take place in the human brain.
In addition to AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Google DeepMind has also developed another AI: an algorithm known as the deep Q-network. The deep Q-network was presented at the 2016 WIRED event, a large-scale conference for business professionals to present industry developments. DeepMind’s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman showed that the deep Q-network had learned to play 49 Atari 2600 video games given only the bare minimum amount of background information. The AI agent had mastered various types of games, from martial arts games to boxing games to 3D car racing games.
These are all significant improvements in the field of artificial intelligence and computer programming, indicating a more promising future for areas other than just board games where AI can have an influence. According to Demis Hassabis, a DeepMind co-founder and chief executive, researchers’ knowledge of complex algorithms has impacts far beyond beating world-class game professionals. “This is just games, but it could be stock market data,” Hassabis said. “DeepMind has been combining two promising areas of research — a deep neural network and a reinforcement-learning algorithm — in a really fundamental way. We’re interested in algorithms that can use their learning from one domain and apply that knowledge to a new domain.”
From DeepMind’s relatively older efforts in developing artificial intelligence to the more recent achievements by AlphaGo Zero, work done by researchers in AI is yielding results with a clear trend: computer software is beginning to outsmart humans. Earlier versions of Go software based their moves upon human strategies; AlphaGo Zero developed techniques that professional players had never seen before. In other words, the constraints of human knowledge no longer restrict the potential of AI — it is able to create new knowledge from a completely blank slate, with minimal human input.
Though this is a huge achievement deserving worldwide attention and applause, at this point we should be asking ourselves: what does this mean for the future of humanity?

Should scientists be working to revive extinct species?
The movie Jurassic Park makes it seem like a terrible idea. In the iconic 1993 film, dramatically advancing science without waiting to discuss ethics pretty clearly results in tragedy and disaster. “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should,” says Ian Malcolm in one of the movie’s most memorable lines.
The good news is that real-world research on the revival of extinct species includes healthy debates about its ethics and potential consequences. 
The ethical debate is similar to the one presented in Jurassic Park: should we really be trying to bring back species that natural selection eliminated? Is it responsible? If not, what about species who went extinct thanks to human activity, like overhunting or deforestation? Maybe we should try to undo the damage we did. Maybe we’re even obligated to. It’s likely that a consensus will never be reached on whether it’s ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ to bring back extinct species.
The best we can do is try to figure out what the practical consequences might be. And there definitely will be consequences: reinstating extinct creatures on even a modest scale could have big ecological effects. In an ecosystem, every species fills a particular niche, or role: they eat other species, they get eaten by other species, they interact with plants, rocks, and bodies of water. This is why, when a species goes extinct, it can have a disruptive rippling effect on the entire ecosystem.
The woolly mammoth is a popular example: During the last ice age, mammoths “helped maintain the grasslands by knocking down trees and spreading grass seeds in the dung,” according to a 2016 article in Science. When the mammoths went extinct, the grasslands receded, and the loss of plant life encouraged the permafrost to melt more quickly, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Many scientists argue that reinstating a healthy mammoth population would help slow global warming.
However, some feel that we just don’t know enough about the consequences to implement reinstatement right now. “De-extincted” species carry some concerns similar to those surrounding genetically modified organisms: unusual genes from de-extincted species may mix with the genes of extant (current) species, with unpredictable effects. 
On the big-picture side of things, we have far less data on historical ecosystems than on present ones, and there is a significant possibility that either scientists have an incomplete picture of an extinct species’ niche, or that the ecosystem will have changed so much that the reinstated extinct species will no longer be able to fill their old niche. “Forests have fragmented, forests have expanded and contracted,” explains University of California ecologist Douglas McCauley. “A passenger pigeon that hits that forest again is going to be like a middle-aged guy who really wants to go back to high school and then he gets back there and he’s like, ‘Whoa I don’t fit in anymore.’”
Last year, McCauley was the lead author of an article published last year in Scientific Ecology that suggested three criteria for choosing extinct species as candidates for what he calls “de-extinction”: the species has to have a unique niche, filled by no other similar species; the species should have become extinct fairly recently; and the species should only be chosen if it’s able to become abundant enough to make a difference in the ecosystem. The issue here is understanding the specific niche that the animals fill, and the consequnces on picking that particular animal to fill that niche. 
These criteria were developed to offer guidelines for making sure the reinstatement of an extinct species is ecologically meaningful. Perhaps the most concerning complication of the “de-extinction” debate is that the potential consequences aren’t all ecological. 
“Honestly, the thing that scares me most is that the public absorbs the misimpression that extinction is no longer scary,” says McCauley. “That the mindset becomes: Deforest, no biggie, we can reforest. If we drive something extinct, no biggie, we can ‘de-extinct’ it.”
This debate is crucial because the technology needed to bring back extinct species is already here. The last Pyrenean ibex – a sort of European wild goat – died in the year 2000 crushed under a tree. A few years later, a team of Spanish scientists impregnated goats with eggs filled with her genetic material. Six goats miscarried; one gave birth. The ibex clone that was born alive had severe lung defects, and lived for only ten minutes. But she was, for those ten minutes, alive.
If one extinct individual can be brought back, then an entire species can be reinstated. Advances in genetics – most notably the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR – mean that de-extincted species won’t have to be clones, giving ecologists the hope of a stable gene pool. In a few years it might be totally reasonable to bring back the woolly mammoth, or the passenger pigeon, or anything else we have a chance at getting DNA from. However, it might be many years before we see herds of mammoths wandering around idyllic grasslands. 
Scientists like McCauley are working hard to make sure that before we implement this power just because we can, we stop to think  whether we should.

Scotch’n’Soda’s production of Young Frankenstein, a musical adaption of the cult classic comedic-horror film of the same name by Mel Brooks, thrilled audiences this past Hallo-weekend with its hilarious take on a classic horror story. It left most in fits of giggles and guffaws all throughout the show, while also exploring the themes of identity, rediscovering one’s roots, and defying expectations.
Arriving early, I was fortunate enough to beat the massive crowds and got prime seating in McConomy Auditorium. Although it was my first Scotch’n’Soda performance, I had only heard rave reviews about their shows, and as I sat with hundreds of people rapidly filling the theater, my excitement and anticipation only continued to grow.
Right from the opening number, the tone of the show was light and humorous. The villagers of Transylvania appeared, decked out in black for the funeral of Victor Frankenstein, but what should have been a mournful time was not. Instead, they burst into an elaborate and fast-paced song and dance, declaring themselves “The Happiest Town in Town” after hurriedly and haphazardly throwing Frankenstein’s coffin to the ground. Happy to finally be rid of the Frankenstein family and its horrible track record with the undead, constantly wreaking havoc and causing fear throughout the village, the villagers rang in the performance on a high note. Their morbid glee was temporarily halted by Inspector Kemp, played by first-year Julien Buron, who warned that there is still one remaining Frankenstein in America. They quickly resumed their celebration, however, realizing how unlikely it is that Frederick Frankenstein would come all the way from America to Transylvania.
The scene quickly changed, sharply contrasting the villagers and their views of Victor Frankenstein with the fascinated and curious students of Frederick Frankenstein in America. The young Frankenstein, played by sophomore Alec Albright, insists his name is pronounced “Fronkensteen” and wants no connection to his grandfather and his eccentric science experiments. He dodges the questions thrown at him about his ancestry and tries to make a name for himself through pure science. This is short-lived, however, as he is forced to travel to Transylvania when he finds out that he needs to settle his grandfather’s estate.
Despite his efforts to settle things quickly and head back to both his work and his fiancée Elizabeth, played by sophomore Abigale Pfingsten, Frederick quickly becomes fascinated with Victor’s work. He is taken through “Join the Family Business,” the musical number of Frederick’s nightmares by his grandfather Victor, played by first-year JJ Legelis, and later stumbles into his grandfather’s secret laboratory and reads Victor’s aptly named book, “How I Did It.” Along with his wacky companions Igor, Frau Blücher, and Inga, portrayed by junior Grant Seastream, first-year Emily Schneider, and sophomore Bryanna Walker respectively, Frederick attempts to create a morally good and intelligent creature. Soon, an innocent mistake turns disastrous for all and madness quickly ensues when the creature that awakens is not what Frederick imagined.
Filled with fantastically choreographed dance routines that really accentuate the tone of the musical and the unique personalities of the characters, the show left the audience bouncing in their seats and put a new meaning to the phrase “dancing with death.” Frankenstein, in an effort to persuade the village that the creature is not to be feared, quite literally dances with death in a grand, show-stopping performance of “Puttin’ on the Ritz.”
Scotch’n’Soda’s performance of Young Frankenstein left me awed by not only the talented and realistic portrayal of the characters the actors were playing but also all the work and dedication of Scotch’n’Soda members towards putting together such a superb performance. From the brilliant choreography and amazing music to the mood-setting lighting and beautifully designed sets, everything was outstanding. Although the sometimes racy humor of Young Frankenstein may not have been for all, there was definitely something for every theater-goer to enjoy in the production, especially in terms of music. There is a great variety of musical styles and genres implemented in the show, including opera, jazz, and even a barbershop quintet, and as the directors noted, it “ties all together in the style of classic, old-school musical theater that we all know and love.”
The directors, junior Heather Graci and senior Michael Wagner, expressed that they love theater because it can “give us a break from reality to smile, laugh, and feel along with the actors onstage,” and their sentiments shined through, never failing to satisfy the theater attendees. There is no doubt that in the end, everyone was feeling the “Transylvania Mania.”

In 1612, Artemesia Gentileschi was put on trial for accusing her painting tutor Agostino Tossi of sexual assault because the people around her assumed she was lying. The trial lasted seven months and subjected Gentileschi to torture and thumbscrews. At the end, it was Tossi who was punished and exiled from Rome, though he was never sentenced.
In the wake of her trauma, Gentileschi started to rebuild her life. She went on to become a prestigious artist and the first female member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence. However, her experience with sexual assault and the aftermath never fully left her, and the trauma of both the assault and the trial influenced her work. Striking Baroque paintings of Biblical women became her signature — all women who faced struggles and trauma. Through her depictions of characters like Judith and Susanna, Gentileschi reshaped their stories from one of victimhood to one of survival, reclaiming their power and strength as well as her own.
A lot, as one might imagine, has changed culturally since Gentileschi’s time. But at the same time, a lot has stayed the same: the legal system with its re-traumatizing procedures, the cultural and personal shame that follows relationship violence, and the women who fight to make the world better. Gentileschi’s work pioneered a narrative of survivorhood. In contrast to being a victim, being labelled a survivor implies strength, subjectivity, and healing. Survivors of sexual and domestic violence have for centuries since used art to take back their voice for healing and growth.
On Friday, Oct. 27, SAFE (Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Activism For Everyone) at CMU organized an art exhibit titled It Happens Here for Domestic Violence Awareness Month, following Gentileschi’s artistic and philosophical tradition. The show was only up for one day, in the Peter and Wright rooms of the Cohon Center. Though small and short, it was an important show. While less formal than the art exhibitions I normally cover, the intention of the show rang clear. It existed to educate about and honor the lives of those affected by violence.
In part, the show was a platform for the voices of survivors. On one side of the room lay delicate pattern pieces, photography, and an installation as a series of self-portraits created by fine arts junior October Donoghue to document her process of mourning and healing after trauma. On the other were double-sided photos; on one side, the photography of an art student, on the other, the artwork from a child of a family affected by domestic violence donated from the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. At the center of the room was a projector playing clips of students reading out messages from survivors and to survivors, sharing their experiences with trauma and their messages of support.
But the show also brought in a more analytical voice. Posters lined the room to talk about what relationship violence looks like, the crime statistics, and the resources that exist for those at Carnegie Mellon who are looking for support. Cutouts of silhouettes of people held the stories of people who have lost their lives to domestic violence. A table set with broken dishes displayed the statistics of domestic and sexual violence. With these numbers and these crimes mixed with the personal narratives of people in our community, it’s hard to walk away from these kinds of shows without being affected.
The event was quiet. I don’t know how many people stopped by, but I was the only one at the time I visited. People, especially in the art world, often talk about how issues of sexual violence get put into an echo chamber so that the only people who consume art and information on the subject are the ones already looking to support these issues. Perhaps there is some truth in that statement. But you don’t have to look far for proof that exhibitions like It Happens Here are still controversial and deeply needed everywhere. On the news we see Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rolling back Title IX regulations in support of the accused and the horrifying accusations against Harvey Weinstein continuing to pile up, and it is clear providing a platform for discussion of these issues is as important as ever, if not even more so.
Sexual and domestic violence are crimes committed with the intent to degrade and dehumanize. The lasting effects of that are clear in the stories we hear from survivors. I don’t think people who have never been in the same position understand the power of the shame. The bravery and the strength in the work of It Happens Here’s artists is immense. In some ways, the small, tucked away nature of the show was beneficial. Existing in that quiet space, which feels safe and without judgment, is essential to combatting this burden of shame that is put on survivors. The organization of this show in many ways the standing in contrast to the #MeToo trend, which favored numbers and publicity. It Happens Here focused on making more specific change in the smaller scope of our community.
It Happens Here sends a clear message: Wherever you are in the process of dealing with sexual and domestic violence, whether you feel ready to share your story or not, there are resources here that can help you. And we, as the larger Carnegie Mellon community, support you and hear you.

As the weather continues to get colder, many of us are trying to find the best ways to keep warm; some are digging through closets for big coats, while others may just be relying on hot drinks from Starbucks or Au Bon Pain. Something else that can definitely help deal with the weather is finding a nice place that serves hot food, perfect for the cold. A place that does just that is Hunan Bar in Oakland.
Hunan Bar is a small restaurant located on Atwood St. that serves Chinese cuisine. The menu offers a variety of foods, from hotpot to steamed frog, and their many soup dishes are especially great for really cold weather. Just recently, a few of my friends and I decided to have dinner there. 
When we first went into the restaurant, there were a good number of college students at the tables, sharing hotpots and eating large portions of delicious looking meals. The setup of the restaurant was very simple, but the vibe that was given off was quite relaxing; it’s a good spot for casual meet-ups with friends and having a few laughs over good food.
This was my second time eating at Hunan Bar; my first time there was pretty enjoyable, however I (as well as my friends) wanted to try different dishes this time. The restaurant is known for their spicy food, so my friends decided to order a lamb hotpot, deep fried pork intestines, and braised pork belly for the table, all at the mild spice level. I don’t usually eat spicy foods, and the first time I went to Hunan Bar I didn’t get anything particularly spicy. Since we were only ordering dishes with the mild level of spice, there wasn’t much for me to worry about.
It didn’t take very long for our food to arrive, maybe about ten to fifteen minutes. The food was presented well in large glass bowls, and everything was piping hot. My friends and I took our first bites of the lamb hotpot, and we all thought it tasted great. The dish contained a combination of ingredients: cabbage, lotus, potatoes, glass noodles, and lamb. As my friends began to try the other dishes, I went in for my second bite of the hotpot and suddenly I felt this burning sensation on my tongue. It turned out, the hotpot was a lot spicier than I thought. Interestingly, some bites I took were spicier than others. What was unfortunate was that I never knew which bite would be spicy, so it was always a surprise for me. My friends found this very amusing, especially as my face turned redder after every bite.
Eating the pork intestines and braised pork was no different of an experience for me. Those dishes were probably spicier than the hotpot, since they contained many peppers and other spiced vegetables. The conflict I was facing was that even though the dishes were spicy, they were all so delicious at the same time. I went through many glasses of water that night, and the waiters were probably just as entertained as my friends. However, the experience was all worth it.
Hunan Bar has a lot of great food, and the high spice levels of some of the dishes can definitely help you deal with the cold. If you really like spicy food, be sure to try a meal at Hunan Bar. If you’re not that big a fan of spicy foods there are many other options on the menu, just be sure to choose wisely when you order.

**Hey Ruth,
I have an email problem. Or, this university has an email problem. It sends way too much.
Some of the d-lists I’m on are totally my fault — I signed up for way too many things as a way of getting snacks at the activities fair. But there are a whole bunch of others that I was put on automatically and never send me anything useful! Or when they do send something I want to read (or a professor emails me something really important) it gets lost in the flood of messages. What am I supposed to do? I keep missing things, and I’ve got hundreds of unread emails in my inbox.
Help,
Exposed My Andrew ID. It’s Ludicrous!**
Dear EMAIL,
I used to take an annoyingly large amount of pride in the organization of my email, mostly because all of my friends had a thousand plus unread emails. Then I came to Carnegie Mellon University.
My inbox is organized no longer. Or, it wasn’t for a pretty long time. Then I figured out some rules for making my email situation easier to handle.
First of all, to anyone who’s ever thought about hitting “reply all” in a d-list — don’t. Please, please don’t. Unless you have a really good reason or you want everyone on that list to hate you, just don’t do it. Use “reply” instead. It’s right there and will send your email to exactly the person you want it to and no one else!
So, the good news is that you can absolutely remove yourself from student organization d-lists. Usually there’s an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email, and it’s a tiny bit of a hassle because you’ll probably have to log into your Andrew ID to confirm the choice to unsubscribe, but then you’ll never get emails from there ever again. Sometimes there isn’t a link, but in that case you can usually go on The Bridge and do the same thing there.
The bad news is that you can’t unsubscribe from college, school, or university wide d-lists. You also probably don’t actually want to, as much as you might scream whenever you get three separate emails about a lecture series. Occasionally, information you actually want is sent out via those groups, so the real answer is that you’re going to need to develop some kind of system. (Well.... unless you don’t mind having a plethora of emails sitting in your inbox, but you specifically expressed that you didn’t want that.)
The typical rules are to delete what you don’t need and star what’s important. The trick is working the time into your routine. I’d recommend clearing out your email either during breakfast or after dinner, but how often depends on you and what number of emails you find overwhelming. I know someone who would read her emails as they came in throughout the week, and then Sunday evenings she’d sit down, re-read, and delete everything that wasn’t relevant anymore. That way she’d be reminded of things before the week started up again, just in case she forgot.
That never really worked for me, so I just star important things as they come in and delete whenever I’m standing around somewhere and I’m really bored or am feeling socially awkward and want people to think I have something to do on my phone. (This is where having your Andrew email in a Gmail app is really useful.) The most important thing is that you check your email regularly in a way that works for you.
Just don’t “reply all”,
Ruth

Last week, a couple of friends and I put off all of our schoolwork, braved the dreary weather, and went out on a Tuesday night. Why? To catch the Gryffin concert, of course. Gryffin is an enigmatic electronic and dance musician known for popular remixes of songs like Troye Sivan’s “Youth”, and Tove Lo’s “Talking Body,” and for some immensely catchy originals such as “Nobody Compares To You” and “Feel Good.” Last Tuesday, he brought his Castle in the Sky tour to the Rex Theater in Pittsburgh’s South Side Tuesday night, showcasing a mastery of production and mixing, and an artist’s grasp on physical instruments.
Supporting act Ayokay kicked off the night with a fairly conventional high-energy set to get the crowd warmed up. The set, while highly danceable, relied very heavily on famous samples from the pop music landscape. Towards the end of the set, Ayokay mashed up “Summertime Sadness” by Lana Del Rey, “Roses” by the Chainsmokers and “Midnight City” by M83 for a mix that seemed like it was designed to get maximum hands in the air.
Following Ayokay’s warm up, derivatives trader turned DJ Autograf took to the stage. He provided a singificantly more dynamic set by routinely engaging with the audience in between drops. He brought a songwriter’s perspective to dance music that I found compelling — as he played his current single “Sleepless in NYC,” he told us about how, as a DJ, he works twice as hard as he did when he had a day job, about how he loves every minute of it, and about how “Sleepless in NYC” thus represents his new life.
The modern laptop, and the advent of electronic music has made it so easy to make a good song that it can seem like there are enough taleneted DJs to overrun the entire music scene. How does one differentiate oneself? Ayokay leaned especially heavily on the stereotypical turntablist image. Autograf introduced an introspectiveness that is rare in EDM. 
Gryffin, whose real name is Dan Griffith, uses a laptop and turntable to lay down a base track, and then performs the most interesting elements of his songs live: on an electric guitar, or a piano, or even a drumset, effortlessly moving from intrument to instrument, often within the space of a single song. 
Since his debut in 2014, Gryffin has single-handedly made his mark on the EDM scene. The crowd proved to be a testament to that — I couldn’t find a single person sitting down during his set. Without missing a beat, he went from the piano to the guitar, to the electric drum kit, to the synth and then back to the piano. Watching him effortlessly transitioning between remixes and originals, hard hitting drop heavy songs and anthemic singalongs, I was wowed by his virtuoisity, and I could feel his enthusiasm washing over me and the rest of the crowd.
Gryffin is an incredibly talented producer, adding his own flair to whatever he touches. This Tuesday, I witnessed his equally incredible talents as a performer. Gryffin put on a very difficult to dislike show, with new takes on familiar music, catchy new music, a light show straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the kind of energy that can kept the crowd going all night long.

Creating a worthy sequel to a classic is no easy task — for every The Godfather Part II there’s an Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Matrix: Reloaded. Nonetheless, director Denis Villeneuve overcomes this challenge with his new film Blade Runner 2049. The original Blade Runner, released in 1982 and directed by Ridley Scott, was a dark, dystopian sci-fi film with a noir twist, and its vast, cyberpunk landscapes would go on to inspire a whole generation of directors and cinematographers. Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful, thought- provoking, and fitting sequel, but also works perfectly as a stand-alone story. Like all great science fiction, this sequel highlights problematic behaviors and structures in our society.
Set in Los Angeles in 2019, the original Blade Runner follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a “blade runner.” Blade runners are police officers that hunt out and assassinate rogue “replicants,” androids used for labor and colonization purposes, that look identical to humans. Replicants aren’t supposed to have emotions, and so to avoid mistakenly killing humans, blade runners administer a test to evoke emotions. Furthermore, false memories are implanted into replicants minds to give them the experiences that real humans have and so the producer of replicants, the “Tyrell Corporation,” can control them more easily. In the 1982 film, Deckard falls in love with a replicant, Rachael, causing him to question his work, his own identity, and what it means to be human.
Blade Runner 2049 continues these themes, and expands from Deckard’s story. It follows a LAPD blade runner named K (Ryan Gosling) whose job is still to hunt down mutinous replicants as well as older models. K, however, is actually a newer model of replicant himself, which was created by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), an ingenious tech CEO with a god complex. The newer models, like K, are aware that they are replicants themselves, and that their memories, which are still inserted for mental stability, are indeed fake. K unearths a secret that sends him searching for Deckard, who has been missing for 30 years.
The gloomy setting builds on the industrial themes of the original movie’s visuals. The bleak cityscape of Los Angeles consists of endless rows of blocky grey buildings, illuminated only by colossal neon three-dimensional advertisements. K’s quest brings him to Las Vegas, a crumbling ghost city perpetually enveloped in a dust cloud. The lighting is a key part of what makes this a cinematographic marvel, with shots switching between stark contrasts: from the mysterious darkness of the ocean to the blinding vibrance of K’s debriefing room. Mist and dust are employed throughout to soften the lighting, creating visual intrigue and emphasizing the melancholy of this dystopian future. The jaw-dropping scenes are improved if you opt to see it in 3D, where it avoids the in-your-face gimmicks of most action films. Instead, the 3D effects are used to create a more defined foreground and background, leading to a sharper, more realistic and immersive experience.
The score, composed by legend Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, is also a major contributor to the mind-blowing experience. Rumbling bass and chilling strings create an eerie atmosphere to match the desolate settings that fill the screen. Intimidating industrial tones make the soundtrack feel like a more theatrical version of Kanye West’s album Yeezus.
Gosling, Leto, and Ford are all excellent. Gosling plays K as nearly emotionless, unable to appreciate any part of life. His seeming inability to care about anything parallels the film’s dismal environments, and reveals what one might feel if they knew they only existed to complete a task. As K digs deeper into the mysterious discovery, an internal conflict builds in him as he finds his own identity. 
Ford captures everything that he had back in the 1980s — moody charisma and bitter toughness. Leto’s role, while significantly smaller, is a bone-chilling portrayal of a man consumed by his own power.
The plot twists are clever, and completely alter your perceptions of the first half of the movie. The story comments on the potential dangers of technology. K’s girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas), is a hologram with artificial intelligence. She is simply a product programmed to fulfill his desires, so sometimes K feels more isolated by spending time with her. In some ways, the technology that is supposed to 
satisfy K’s every need makes him appear even more isolated, a reminder of our relationships to our smartphones. Additionally, the constant presence of “Joi” advertisements — nude holograms making sultry promises — is a telling reminder of how we commodify women in today’s culture, a timely point in Hollywood.
Blade Runner 2049 is not an escapist action film. It runs two hours and 44 minutes and requires patience and thought. But with the spectacularly intricate and moody visuals that make it nearly impossible to wrest your eyes away from the screen, an otherworldly sonic accompaniment, and a compelling and twisting plot full of surprises, it is well worth the time.

Replete with beautifully hysterical songs detailing the wacky phenomenon of falling instantly in love, The School of Music’s production this past week was a smashing staging of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Magic Flute. Decked out in wonderfully intricate costumes, vocal performance majors — primarily seniors and juniors — filled Phillip Chosky theater’s stage in the Purnell Center for the Arts with classical operatic melodies during four separate performances. I attended the final showing of the opera, which was the matinee on Saturday. Because I attended this specific performance I only was able to see one of the two casts perform. Alas.
The opera opened upon a nighttime scene wherein the hero of the tale, Tamino, played by vocal performance masters student Daniel King, is getting viciously attacked by birds. Saved by the three henchwomen of the Queen of the Night — or the ladies as they’re called — Tamino is shown a picture of the Queen’s daughter Pamina, and as is totally understandable, falls head over heels in love upon first glance. The three ladies, played by masters students Taylor Troyer and Chantal Braziel and senior vocal performance major Hannah Shea, were my favorite part of the show, and their tight-knit harmonies and obsession with Tamino were both gorgeous and quite funny. The Queen, who seems to me to have the most difficult operatic role, commanded the stage even though junior vocal performance major Alexandra Aks is not a very tall person. She sends Tamino on a quest with Papageno (junior vocal performance major Robbie Raso), a rather bumbling bird catcher employee, to rescue Pamina from Sarastro’s castle where she is held prisoner. She gives Tamino a magic flute, and Sarastro a set of bells.
The set both fascinated and confused me, its primary piece being a tilted platform. The platform itself was circular in shape, with a rather large chunk taken out of it, making it seem slightly crescent-like. It was so steep, however, that I was constantly nervous of the performers tripping and falling and sliding up and down it. Clearly the cast is less clumsy than I myself would be, and with only maybe a few missed footings, everyone stayed vertical.
One thing I’d forgotten about the story behind The Magic Flute is how cult-like Sarastro’s castle and brotherhood are. After Tamino finally sees Pamina, played by senior vocal performance major Sophie Thompson, (she, of course, completely falls in love with him too), senior vocal performance major Ian Young’s Sarastro sends Tamino and Papageno through a set of challenges in order to be inducted into his brotherhood. 
As they bowed in the temple, Tamino and Papageno had their own hands forcefully stretched out in what appeared to be the required salute. Definitely a cult. Part of this induction process included not talking to women, which seems a little arbitrary, but according to Emanuel Schikaneder’s libretto, women seem to be the downfall of men. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, I suppose.
Tamino — strong, handsome, and filled with love for the beautiful soprano Pamina, accomplishes the tasks with no problem. His final tests are done with Pamina, and due to his use of the flute, go by without a hitch. Papageno, suffice to say, does not make it through the induction process, mostly because he is a chatty Cathy. He is also super desperate for a lady friend. When he’s finally rewarded with Papagena, played by junior vocal performance major Colleen McGovern, she’s immediately whisked away. All is not lost though, as they are reunited in the end with the most adorable song of the night. They also hopped around the stage in an adorable way.
The Magic Flute, or Die Zauberflöte, has been my favorite opera that I’ve seen at Carnegie Mellon. Though I haven’t mentioned nearly everyone in the cast, including the helpful spirits who help guide the quest, and Monostatos, and the Armored Guard with its Speaker, and the wonderful chorus, everyone made the full house laugh and clap very enthusiastically.
Maybe some of the themes of the original are mildly sexist, but sometimes you have to let that go for the sake of some truly great art.

To celebrate the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley’s groundbreaking novel Frankenstein, the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries has organized a series of events titled “Frankenstein 200: Perils and Potential,” revolving around the many themes of the novel. To kick off the series, the University Libraries hosted the panel “Creation and Consequence” on Tuesday, Oct. 17, in collaboration with the Alumni Association’s CMUThink program, to discuss today’s changing discourse on artificial intelligence and technologically-augmented human society.
The panelists were Jeffrey Bigham, associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction and Language Technology Institutes; David Danks, the L. L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy and Psychology, and head of the Department of Philosophy; Barry Luokkala, teaching professor and director of Undergraduate Physics Laboratories in the Department of Physics; and Molly Wright Steenson, associate professor and director of Doctor of Design program in the School of Design. The different backgrounds of the panelists led to a wide-ranging discussion, led by moderator Rikk Mulligan, Digital Scholarship Strategist.
Conceived as a ghost story when Shelley was 18 years old, Frankenstein was anonymously published in 1818. The novel is considered to be one of the first examples of science fiction, the popular genre that abounds in film, television, and fiction. In the last 200 years, the novel has been analyzed and dissected for its many themes, ranging from the impact of parenthood to the ethics of creation to the consequences of knowledge.
The first topic Mulligan proposed to the panel was the progress of artificial intelligence today. Danks opened the discussion by drawing a parallel between research in artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology. Instead of tackling the whole entity of artificial general intelligence, engineers have chosen to focus on specific skills and characteristics, similar to researchers in psychology.
This “divide and conquer” approach allowed engineers to optimize very specific tasks. Due to strides in developing high-intelligence technology in these focused fields, many believe that they could glue these local characteristics together to create an artificial general intelligence, which is extremely difficult.
“I think the worry is much less about having AI that reaches human level intelligence, and I would suggest it’s much more about us delegat[ing] authority and power to them that perhaps we shouldn’t,” Danks said.
Steensen introduced the idea of modeling, and how our models of technology are constantly changing throughout time. Certain models are used for a while, but they eventually expire and are replaced by newly developed models that are designed for today’s problems and projects.
“*Frankenstein* is about someone modeling an intelligence and even needing to make it eight feet tall because that was the level of fidelity, the level of fine grain, which is to say, quite coarse, that was available at the time,” Steensen said.
Another important topic the panel discussed was the concept of bias in data analysis. Numbers, statistics, raw data, these are all widely accepted as impartial but can actually be easily manipulated, consciously or unconsciously. Danks presented the philosophical concept of descriptive versus normative: do we want models of how the world is, or models of how the world should be?
To describe this, Danks gave the example of software designed to predict likelihood of ex-convicts to be rearrested. The raw data the software developed revealed that race was a significant factor, showing that African Americans are more likely to be rearrested.
“Descriptively, the algorithm was probably right,” Danks explained. “If you’re African American, you’re more likely to be rearrested, but we might also plausibly think that’s due to structural racism, or to other kinds of factors, and that the world we want to live in is one in which we judge people’s likelihood of reoffending on the basis of non-racial factors.”
Bigham added that while removing race as a factor from the system would be a great first step, it is extremely difficult to truly remove such bias.
“The machine learning algorithms that we have, the reason why they are so effective is because they can pick up patterns that humans don’t see,” he said. “Maybe that pattern they learn ends up recreating a variable that you took. Maybe they’re learning something that’s a proxy for race.”
At the end of the panel, the panelists acknowledged that the continual innovation and progress of technology has cultivated a sense of fear and anxiety over a potential dystopia, often the setting of science fiction products.
Danks said that we should be using technology to figure out what kind of future we want. “We need to teach the next generation how to use these technologies in order to proactively prevent this dystopia.”

This past week, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff had the opportunity to attend forums that allowed us to gain more insight in the search for Carnegie Mellon’s next president. Students were allowed to share their opinions on what they believe the next president should focus on. Many were able to pinpoint issues on stress culture, lack of student involvement on the presidential search committee, a decrease in diversity and inclusion amongst the undergraduate and graduate populations, and a need for leadership development and entrepreneurial opportunities for students. Although the search committee does not have a student representative, student government is attempting to resolve these issues by increasing inclusion and making students aware of the resources that can further develop their entrepreneurial skills.
Kameron Bradley, the Diversity Chair on the Student Body Government Cabinet, has been working closely with the Student Center for Diversity and Inclusion to promote diversity and inclusion on campus. The Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion acts as a hub of resources related to race, gender, and other identifying factors for students. When speaking about the importance of diversity, Bradley says, “creating a safe space for students, generally minority students, to talk to each other and share their experiences, as well as issues and how Carnegie Mellon deals with the mental health and awareness in regard to students who aren’t in the majority” should be one of CMU’s main priorities. To accomplish this goal, Bradley plans to help organize events where multicultural student organizations can showcase their talents and demonstrate to the student population the contribution that they bring to campus.
Greg Volynsky, the freshman representative on the Student Body Government Cabinet, has been working hard to increase awareness of the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship, a system of programs for students to develop their entrepreneurial skills. Students can learn from successful entrepreneurs, receive support for an idea they may have, and work in a space where their passions can come to fruition. Volynsky believes that the “entrepreneurial culture where students are eager to try something of their own, question the status quo, and take things into their own hands is critical for any institution.” To accomplish this goal of making students aware of these opportunities, Volynsky, along with the Collaboration Chair Christie Chang, will be reaching out to student organizations and present on the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship.
Student government will continue to advocate for changes that will benefit our community. Apart from these initiatives, students at Carnegie Mellon still have the opportunity to have their voices heard throughout the presidential search. If you have any comments, suggestions, or concerns about the process, please submit a comment for the committee to read at: https://www.cmu.edu/presidential-search/comment-form/index.html.

On Sept. 20, Hurricane Maria barreled into Puerto Rico as a major category 4 storm, battering the island with winds swirling at over 100 miles per hour.
It killed dozens, destroyed the island’s infrastructure, and turned thousands and thousands of lives upside-down forever.
Today, over a month after Maria devastated the island, Puerto Rico is still in the grips of a humanitarian crisis. Approximately three-quarters of the island remains without power and is relying on generators. Because of the widespread infrastructure damage, there have been difficulties shipping supplies to many areas. Many Puerto Ricans are desperate to leave, especially those that have chronic medical conditions who have not been able to access needed medical care after Maria.
When Carnegie Mellon junior and decision science major Rosana Guernica — who is a native Puerto Rican herself — heard about the plight her homeland had been thrown into, she decided that she had to do something to help. Guernica had heard about families leaving the island after Maria and wanted to find out more about how they were doing it with the airport still offline (at that time, it was about a week after the storm hit).
“[T]he government and hospitals were having immense difficulty finding life-saving aid,” she recalled in an interview with The Tartan. “I inquired as to how, and found out they had evacuated the island by hiring private charters. I then decided to start fundraising to be able to evacuate patients who would die if they did not leave the island, while bringing the life-saving aid the island desperately needed,” Guernica said, when discussing the initial conception for her humanitarian project.
She started a crowdfunding fundraiser on YouCaring and has raised over $128,000 as of Oct. 27.
In a statement explaining her fundraiser, Guernica wrote: “We are desperate to help the island and don’t seem to know how. No one person can solve these issues. No one government can help the island... It is time to come together to take action. It is time to help the most vulnerable before it is too late. There are infants who need formula, diabetic victims without insulin, and cancer patients in need of immediate evacuations.”
The supplies were mostly fundraised through contacts within Carnegie Mellon, but some read about the campaign in the press and reached out to Guernica wanting to help.
So far, she has successfully completed three missions, the last of which finished on Oct. 28. In total, the first two missions have already delivered approximately 3,500 pounds of medical supplies to various hospitals and medical practices around the island as well as general aid — like clothes, diapers, medicine, supplemental meals and food — to the CAPS Foundation, which works with pediatric cancer patients.
The missions have also evacuated 28 patients who are in immediate need of medical care and their caretakers to the U.S. mainland. This included people who need dialysis, who had surgeries scheduled before Maria, who need insulin and do not have the electricity to keep it cold, and who need chemotherapy and radiation treatments.
As for the third mission, Guernica told The Tartan that she planned to “bring down 16,000 lbs of food, water filters, solar panels, medicine, and medical supplies to the island and...leave with 60 medical patients and evacuees in need of immediate and proper medical attention.”
She and her partners in the mission — Gabriel Ostolaza, an engineering Masters student, Jose López, Javier Spivey, a junior drama major, and Ivan Cao-Berg (MCS 2009) on the second mission — were struck by the extent of the storm damage that was fully evident from the air.
“Flying over our beautiful island and seeing all the damage done to our vegetation was by far the most heartbreaking,” Guernica reflected in the interview. She described the pre-storm Puerto Rico as “a happy place full of vibrant people and colors,” and was devastated to see all of that taken away by the hurricane. “Typically, flying over the island means seeing bright blue waters and rivers, complemented by a lush, green, overgrown vegetation. Instead, we witnessed coastlines still filtering out debris, brown running rivers, and vast stretches of brown, broken trees who lost all their leaves to Maria,” she said.
Spivey gave a similar reflection about the way the island has changed in his interview with The Tartan. He described seeing San Juan’s Teodoro Moscoso bridge from the airplane window, which was famous for its rows of alternating American and Puerto Rican flags. “It was barren. The hurricane had ripped each flag off into the wind.” He added that the missing flags were “nothing compared to the blue dots of tarps covering houses and piles of trees I could see from the plane.”
Guernica also described one incident that was especially touching to her. Before the return flight with the evacuees, she and her team had put Carnegie Mellon teddy bears in each airplane seat, giving the evacuees a cheerful and comforting surprise. “During the flight back, I walked down the aisle and found many of [the evacuees] asleep with their teddy bear in their arms,” she remembered. “It was... very touching...to see grown adults, most [of whom] were 50 years and older, so comforted by a small gesture.”
In the wake of Hurricane Maria and the long road the island has to recovery, many have criticized President Trump’s administration for mishandling the crisis and responding too slowly. Spivey shares that same opinion. He says that the president has shown a “lack of sensitivity and ignorance” in regards to Puerto Rico, and says that “[w]e can no longer wait around for our government to make the change we need. We the people can finally make America great.”
Guernica is realistic about the outlook for Puerto Rico: she knows that “[t]he situation is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.” However, she sees that as a call to action for Americans to help fellow Americans stuck in dire straits. “Never underestimate the impact one person can have, especially in such a dire crisis,” she concludes.

Pennsylvania voters will decide this Election Day whether or not to move forward with efforts to allow counties, cities, and school districts to stop collecting property taxes. Officially called the “Pennsylvania Allow Local Taxing Authorities to Exempt Full Value of Homestead Amendment,”  the ballot measure would only be the first step toward lower property taxes. If the amendment passes, the Pennsylvania legislature would then be constitutionally permitted to pass a law allowing local jurisdictions to end property taxes. And if such a law were enacted, some counties, cities, and school districts may choose to lower or eliminate property taxes.
Advocates of the ballot measure point out that property taxes are a burden for many Pennsylvanian homeowners, and are concerned that under current law, continued failure to pay property taxes could result in someone losing their home. The measure has large bipartisan support in the state legislature, but there are critics of the effort. Republican State Senator Michele Brooks has expressed concerns that the loss of revenue from property taxes would have to be made up by raising income, sales, or other taxes. Relatedly, the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board pointed out that some Pennsylvanians could end up paying more in taxes depending on their personal situation and how the tax code is adjusted in response to the amendment.
It is difficult to predict how the amendment would affect Carnegie Mellon University students. The ballot measure might not lead to any tax changes even if it passes, but if it does, then taxes on Pittsburgh homes and apartments would be lowered. This could potentially lead to Carnegie Mellon students who live off campus paying lower rents, but Carnegie Mellon itself already does not pay property taxes because it is a tax-exempt non-profit organization.
If lower property taxes are met with higher income or sales taxes, that could have negative effects on Carnegie Mellon students. Making it more affordable to live in Pittsburgh could attract good professors and even bring jobs to the city, but raising income and sales taxes would have the opposite effect. And it is unclear how Carnegie Mellon would respond to tax changes in terms of faculty and staff pay and tuition costs. 
On Nov. 7, Pennsylvania voters (including many Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff) will decide whether or not to approve the constitutional amendment.

Dr. Ramayya Krishnan, Dean of Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, was elected as the 25th President of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Board of Directors. This move, announced on Oct. 13, means that Dean Krishnan will spend the next two years as president-elect of the INFORMS board of directors before spending a year, starting Jan. 2019, as its President.
INFORMS is a network of more than 12,500 professors and professionals in the world of analytics and operations research. Interim President Farnam Jahanian highlighted the deep connection that exists between Carnegie Mellon University and INFORMS in his statement in a Heinz College and INFORMS joint press release, stating that “this well-deserved honor further strengthens the connections between the university and the INFORMS community, whose past presidents include four other CMU faculty.”
The four past Carnegie Mellon-affiliated presidents, William Cooper, Richard Cyert, Alfred Blumstein, and Michael Trick, only represent a small part of the deep relationship that INFORMS and Carnegie Mellon enjoy. There is an on-campus chapter of INFORMS, which hosts events for students interested in management science and operations research, and a Krishnan-led Heinz College won the INFORMS UPS George D. Smith Prize last year.
When speaking on the award in a Heinz College press release last year, Krishnan referenced former INFORMS Presidents and Carnegie Mellon founding member William Cooper, and brought up the central role that operations research has played, finding that “as the school founded by William W. Cooper, a legendary operations researcher, analytic thinking, appropriate use of technology and a deep interest in societal problem solving are embedded in our DNA.”
Not only is this not the first instance that Carnegie Mellon and INFORMS have intermingled, but it is also the culmination of a long personal involvement on the part of  Krishnan with the organization. On top of his position as the W.W. Cooper and Ruth F. Cooper Professor of Management Science and Information Systems at Heinz College and the Department of Engineering and Public Policy, his tenure on the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Data-Driven Development and his continuing work with Governor Tom Wolf’s IT and Operations Advisory Board, Krishnan has been an INFORMS Fellow, won the INFORMS Information Systems Society’s Distinguished Scholar Award, and led the INFORMS Computing Society and the INFORMS Information Systems Society. He has served as the editor of four INFORMS journals, namely, Interfaces, Information Systems Research, Management Science, and the Journal on Computing.
It is clear that his mission as Dean of Heinz College — the “use of technology and a deep interest in societal problem solving” — sees a natural continuity with his goals as president of INFORMS, with  Krishnan highlighting in his statement “the work of [his] colleagues has saved lives around the world, helped businesses and governments become more efficient, helped keep people safer, and so much more. Today, our capacity to combine analytic and information technology is enabling our fields to reach new heights, solve new problems, and touch more lives than ever before… this is truly an exciting time, and I look forward to helping INFORMS bring even greater recognition to the amazing contributions of our members.”

Social media has come a long way since the early days of MySpace themes and best friends lists. What was once a place purely for entertainment has quickly become a social hub filled with politically charged content ranging from the far left all the way to the far right. When most of these sites started, it was hard to foresee that they would become the stage for some of the most politicized debates. But now, sites like Facebook and Twitter are in a very crucial position with the ability to silence or empower various kinds of speech now more than ever.
Recently Harvey Weinstein has been under heat for his treatment and sexual assault of female coworkers. He’s been cited as using his authority and power to manipulate young women into doing favors for him. Several accounts tell a story of him asking women to massage him without clothes on and to watch him shower. 
One of his victims is Rose McGowan, an actress who was 23 years old at the time of her assault in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. A $100,000 settlement was reached with Weinstein in order to “avoid litigation and buy peace.” In light of all the recent victims coming forward, McGowan took to Twitter to voice her thoughts. Her account was then temporarily locked for violating Twitter rules, leaving her unable to tweet, like, or retweet anything for 12 hours. McGowan took to her Instagram pages to share the word of her frozen account.
Twitter was quickly in touch with McGowan the next morning to explain that she had violated their Terms of Service by tweeting an image of an email that contained a private phone number. Twitter has also explained that the decision to lock McGowan’s account was made overnight, meaning that the most prominent decision makers were off the clock. They quickly decided to end the ban hours before it was set to end and deleted the tweet in question.
It is understandable that Twitter would have this policy to protect its users, but what’s not understandable is Twitter’s selective use and enforcement of its Terms of Service. Twitter has publicly defended its decisions to not interfere with President Donald Trump’s account despite his ongoing threats of violence, which violate “Twitter Rules,” a set of guidelines to prevent abusive behavior on the site. They have defended this choice by claiming that it is because of the newsworthiness of Trump’s tweets, a very subjective standard. 
If Twitter wants to take the laid back approach of not enforcing a standard, then they should do away with the rules entirely. It’s not fair to pick and choose when they will enforce them, especially when the only time they seem to want to enforce these rules is when they’re violated by women and people of color. 
In August of this year, Shahak Shapira, a Berlin-based activist reported over 300 tweets that he claimed contained “absolutely serious threats of violence, homophobia, xenophobia, or Holocaust denial.” Twitter only responded to nine of these tweets and determined that they did not violate its Terms of Service and leaving the tweets intact. Unsatisfied with this answer, Shapira took 30 of the tweets and spray painted them on the sidewalk outside of Twitter’s German headquarters. The tweets contained several racist, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, and homophobic slurs. 
Twitter responded stating that while they don’t comment on individual accounts, they give users the power to do so through blocking and muting accounts. However, Twitter does step in to block certain accounts. This shows inconsistency of whom the onus should be on to remove hate speech. Many areas of the internet allow hate speech to fester and multiply and without some rules or anything to stop it. The onus should be on Twitter to filter hate speech, not on those that the hate speech targets. It should not be the responsibility of minorities to police what others do, it should be the responsibility of those that have the power to do so. 
Twitter is not the only social network known to show this bias. Facebook and Instagram have been known to have their fair share of issues with regulating user content. While images of female nipples have been removed or censored, the sites remain neutral to male nipples. The photo sharing site is notorious for its policies on female nudity, suspending images of female nipples and not male nipples. Free the Nipple activists have campaigned against this by creating the account @genderless_nipples featuring images of nipples that are so close up, it’s hard to determine the gender of the person.
Facebook has also had issues with censoring content. Earlier this year, it was revealed that there were several inconsistencies with Facebook’s methods of deciding what content was allowable. Certain threats did not count because they did not explicitly mention one person that was being threatened, but rather a group of people. Moderators are left so confused and overwhelmed with the volume of work that they often are given just ten seconds to respond to claims. When looking at how influential Facebook was in the spread of fake news in this past election, they cannot afford to take a passive stance with unclear censorship rules.
With great power comes great responsibility, and when Twitter became a political platform, it also had to become the moderator of that platform. It cannot continue to pick and choose when it will be an active participant in the dialogue happening on the platform. If it plans on assuming responsibility to remove abusive language, then it must remove all abusive language, not just the items deemed not newsworthy. If social media sites are going to allow themselves to continue being as pivotal as they are in our sociopolitical lives, they need better regulation of content. It’s not enough to ban only a subset of content that violates the rules. Social media needs to take a stand and decide to crack down on questionable content — or to not care about it at all, which, in this climate, is far too dangerous of a stance to take.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective. Find previous installments @thetartan.org.
This week, I will develop my reflection from two previous articles, published respectively on Sept. 25 and Oct. 9. Indeed, the workaholism culture combined with excessive professionalism in campus activities leads to the glorification of technique over everything else. The processes, meetings, carefully-written statements, and complex organizations seem to be more important than the original goal. The tools have become an end in themselves.
This phenomenon is hard to describe, and I can only refer to little things that seem innocuous taken separately. One club I'm a member of is starting anonymous "performance reviews" to evaluate the work of the managers. Another club I'm a part of keeps repeating administrative meetings every two weeks even though there has been no event related to the club's activity in over three months. Last year, I heard that the student Senate had to redo elections because the people didn't understand the new complex election method they had set up. Every email I receive from the student government seems like a vaguely committed statement of intent that rarely talks about any concrete thing. The fact is that very few people talk about these issues, and that people in the administration seem to care more about it than my fellow students.
I have the impression that this administrative and bureaucratic obsession is the ultimate expression of the Carnegie Mellon culture. The imperatives of formalism, complexity, and performance have overflowed from academic life into extracurricular life. But why is this so? In my opinion, the root of all evil is this false belief that one can use college to only get the specialized education necessary to land its supposedly dream job. As a freshman, entering Carnegie Mellon is a strong financial commitment. But this commitment can quickly turn into a prison: the six-figure tech positions for new graduates become the only way out of the student loans. Because of that, it becomes impossible to freely think about what you want to do with your life. And tech companies are very aware of that: during the recruiting process, you are not required to present a coherent professional plan for yourself. Furthermore, you are often asked to blindly trust the company to assign you to a team that would match your interests, only after they accept you inside the company.
This absence of self-reflection requirements throughout college here at Carnegie Mellon and even in the beginning of professional life is actually damaging to individuals. One of the symptoms is precisely the glorification of technique that I mentioned earlier. Because we are scared of reflecting on what we want our life to mean, academic work, and dealing with complex problems and processes become a mental shelter that is strengthened by the social dimension of the phenomenon: everyone does it, and the recent alumni that come to the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) to advertise for their company seem happy, so no need to worry. Worse, there is this mentality that the ultimate goal is to accumulate cash as fast as possible, and then enjoy a hypothetical freedom that would come with the possession of such a capital. But according to people in the administration in contact with recent grads, many of them wish they had done things differently at Carnegie Mellon.
Solutions to this problem exist and are in fact pretty simple: reduce the course load, change the grading policy to stop rewarding only the people that give up on their life to do their assignments, ensure that students get free time at least during a significant part of their curriculum, reserve half a day per week for extracurricular activities (no academic courses during this half of the day), give people a second chance by setting up free-of-charge second chance exams to pass a course if students have a D or less, harmonize the education requirements between the different colleges to ensure all students actually benefit from these policies, stop raising tuition each year, lower the maximum number of credits one can take in one semester, have the course's credit load actually reflect the number of hours students spend on it, have students write a mandatory statement of purpose two or three times during their curriculum to force them to reflect on their professional plan. I know this Santa Claus list contains elements that are difficult to implement, but these are the solutions Carnegie Mellon needs to really tackle its deepest issues.
Now, let us talk about what to reflect on once you've exited the Carnegie Mellon version of Plato's cave. The companies that recruit the most at Carnegie Mellon all want to "make the world a better place." This meaningless motto has been popularized by the series Silicon Valley as the one-size-fits-all ethical justification for every new tech initiative. But these tech companies are increasingly criticized for several factors: monopolistic positions and disproportionate impact of their decisions, uncontrolled spreading of social media propaganda, cooperation with the National Security Agency (NSA) for massive surveillance of the population, collection of private data for targeted advertising of worse purposes, and more. These concerns aren't acknowledged when the TOC comes to campus and the hallways of CMU fill with hours-long lines to get a CV fed into the complex machineries of new graduate recruiting processes.
Carnegie Mellon students are committed to many political issues and social service initiatives. This paper, for instance, takes a stand each week on national-level issues to promote diversity and inclusion. The recent student-led initiatives to help people in Puerto Rico are a statement of generosity and global awareness of the issues. Carnegie Mellon's students want to make the world a better place. But then, how can they forget that their most important contribution to this goal is actually the way they choose to use their intelligence and skills once they're out of the campus?
I am aware of the importance of the financial constraints here at Carnegie Mellon: it suffices that a professor writes a blunt comment about the price of a textbook to see this taboo issue rise violently in subsequent Piazza comments. I know that for many people a six-figure salary is a necessity when coming out of an expensive college, and that you sometimes have to put your convictions aside if you want to actually get a job. While there is no simple solution to this problem, my point is to raise awareness: be careful that your mental refuge of work and bureaucracy does not turn into a trap that prevents you from asking the most important questions in your life. That is the one right and freedom you should fight for. Because making the world a better place starts by its being a better place for you.

Through a brief glance at the Carnegie Mellon University main webpage, one will assuredly realize the emphasis that the university places on “diversity and inclusion” as one of its core values for the academic community. 
“A diverse and inclusive community is the foundation for excellence in research, creativity, and human development, and is therefore at the core of our mission as a university,” states Interim President Farnam Jahanian, as displayed on the university webpage.
The website also references research supporting its commitment to diversity and inclusion. “Studies show that when diverse groups look at issues they often come up with better solutions to problems, especially complex problems,” it states. 
However, while such “diversity and inclusion” is repeatedly stressed in the academic domain, we unfortunately observe a different picture in the community we live in and experience, especially regarding how much voice students have in the major decisions that affect the student body as a whole.
The newly proposed add-drop deadline, for instance, as tackled in the student government column of the last issue of The Tartan, demonstrates the unwillingness of several faculty members and university officials to implement the student input they received. A shortened add-drop deadline significantly and negatively impacts the lives of all members of the Carnegie Mellon student body: the voices of students expressed through their student government and through the open forum were silenced.
As such, with these impending changes to the student experience and the seemingly increasing occurrence of the exclusion of students from major decisions, it is even more important for students to have a significant voice in the presidential search. 
“The president of the university plays an unparalleled role in defining and executing the strategic vision of the university,” said Sushain Cherivirala, Vice Chair of the Undergraduate Senate, in an interview with The Tartan. “From establishing groups such as the Task Force for the CMU Experience to spearheading fundraising efforts and directing how funds are distributed, the president's actions echo throughout the community. Finding a president that will support and understand the vital needs of students, balancing them against those of other campus stakeholders, is invaluable,” he added.
Indeed, the next university president must have a comprehensive understanding of the student experience at Carnegie Mellon. The president must be able to empathize with the common challenges that students face and be able to work with all members of the community to enhance the university experience. Such qualities in a president, however, are difficult, or even impossible, to consistently advocate for without representation on the Presidential Search Committee.
Rendering the voices of 14,528 students to a few discussions with student government representatives and two 45-minute fora, the Presidential Search Committee has been opaque at best in regards to the collection and their intended use of student input in the Presidential Search. 
“The Presidential Search Committee’s student forums are appreciated but unfortunately, not nearly sufficient,” commented Cherivirala. “While gathering the input of students through fora is vital, the resulting sentiments are often forgotten and overshadowed when the stakeholders in question, students, are not present when highly impactful decisions are rendered… Without our presence, the Search Committee is missing out on having the voice of informed students help guide its decisions, and as I have witnessed many times at both the university and local education level, is liable to making preventable mistakes.”
Such sentiments were the primary points of contention at the 5 p.m. open student forum last Wednesday, Oct. 25. Numerous students, including doctorate, masters, and undergraduate students, repeatedly questioned the Board of Trustees’ decision to effectively exclude students from the Presidential Search Committee. Citing the values of “diversity and inclusion” and persistently expressing the need for student representation on the committee, students demonstrated their unity in the face of a common challenge. At one point, Tod Johnson, the Trustee Co-Chair of the Presidential Search Committee, responded that time would be better spent on listening to what students want to see in their next president rather than debating the issue of student representation. Several students who came up to the mic after Mr. Johnson’s remarks ignored his request, continuing to press the necessity of representation to the trustees and faculty members that sat before them.
As a student body, we must continue to push for student representation on the Presidential Search Committee, for it is the only channel through which our voices will not be forgotten. Representation, as unrealistic as it may seem, is the only true process of inclusion of the largest constituency in the Carnegie Mellon community — the students. As we progress to become a forward-thinking institution, we should first look to our community and see how forward-thinking our administrative procedures and processes are. 
"I will add that it is neither impractical nor unnecessary to have student representation on the committee as evidenced by many of our peer institutions," discussed Cherivirala. "Regardless, we should continue working with the Search Committee and Board of Trustees in a non-adversarial manner, demonstrating to them the value of our contributions to this process rather than attempting to force their hand."

Two weeks ago, the "#MeToo" movement began on social media. The "#MeToo" movement focuses on survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment posting the "#MeToo" hashtag. While this movement has brought awareness to the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, it alienates survivors of sexual assault who want privacy.
The movement has good intentions, and when it originally began seven years ago, it was to show solidarity with survivors. But, we seem to be forgetting that there are plenty of survivors who wish not to speak out. It is a strange feeling of alienation and support when your newsfeed is filled with survivors sharing their stories. On one hand, it feels comforting to know that there are only people in life who share your experience and understand yours. But on the other hand, it makes you feel cowardly because those sharing their stories are described as “brave” and “courageous” and you cannot imagine sharing yours. 
It takes courage for someone to post about their personal experience with sexual assault, and it is amazing that there are people who are advocating to end sexual assault. But, there are plenty of survivors who choose not to share their experience. Considering two out of every three rapes are not reported to the police, most of these survivors are also going to feel uncomfortable posting about their experiences on social media. Everyone deals with trauma differently — for some people this means publicly disclosing what happened to them, for others it means only telling a therapist until it no longer hinders their day-to-day life. 
Social movements cannot be successful when they rely on survivors to share their experiences. We can bring awareness to the issue of sexual assault without pressuring survivors to share their stories. It is unfair to expect survivors to share such a personal, intimate part of their lives. We can raise awareness by advocating in our local communities, encouraging consent to be taught in high school sex education classes, and encouraging survivors to seek help.
In the meantime, we need to show our solidarity with survivors without pressuring them to share their stories. Some survivors will choose to advocate for other survivors and others will choose to focus on their own lives. Both are completely okay and justified. So yes, "#MeToo" wasn’t the worst social movement in the world, but we can do better to support survivors. A simple hotline number, such as 800.656.HOPE (the number of the National Sexual Assault Hotline Telephone) included with the "#MeToo" hashtag would be viewed as an olive branch to those who do not feel comfortable sharing their stories in social media. Sexual assault affects many people from all different backgrounds, and we need to show solidarity with every survivor in order to reduce sexual violence.

Three weeks ago, I wrote an editorial advocating for increased or altered gun control. My argument was only one perspective on the issue, and it was meant to inspire conversation with those holding different perspectives than me. However, as this debate focuses on a nuanced, emotional issue, all sides of the argument must be ready to respond with respect and an open mind. Solutions that only take one side into account will never be appropriate, and real answers will only come from dialogue and understanding.
In his response to my article, Carnegie Mellon and Tartan alumnus David Hunt frames my argument as an attempt to aid state efforts in rounding up the essential, lifesaving weapons of vulnerable citizens. While completely untrue, this claim is also dangerously reductive, and effectively obscures the real argument at hand — that all people deserve the right to live freely and safely, and that the gun control debate, which is nuanced and complex, cannot immediately disregard certain solutions simply because they offend people with a different perspective.
Full disclosure: I personally am, by and large, against guns of any kind, though I recognize that this stance is largely a product of my time and upbringing. To me, guns give rise to a unique culture of violence. I started kindergarten in 2002, three years after Columbine — I’ve never had the luxury of walking into a school where lockdown drills and emergency evacuation plans weren’t at least distantly on a teacher’s mind, where doors didn’t lock from the inside and students didn’t look curiously at the closets as they entered a classroom, wondering how many of us could cram inside if the unspeakable should occur. When I go see a movie in the theater, my mother reminds me to sit near the exits, be constantly aware, and be ready to run.
I haven’t seen many guns in my life, except on television where firearms are the tool of choice in devastating news stories and dramatized police procedural shows alike. Others have undoubtedly grown up amid far more violence than I could even imagine, making them even more wary of firearms. And there are undoubtedly those who were raised differently around guns, who know them to be tools with functions far beyond the unnecessary violence I associate with them.
That is why the solution will never be to completely ban guns, and why I would never — even in my previous article, which focused more on the government's frustrating reluctance to do something than on any specific plan I can prove might change things — advocate for that kind of broad, simplistic response.
At the same time, I do not think we should become complacent with the level of violence we’ve been left to expect and endure without shock or desire to change in our country today.
In a perfect world, no one would die in mass shootings. No one would die because of gang violence. No one would die from suicide, or from being shot while on duty, or from being shot by an officer on duty. Of course, this isn’t a perfect world, and I know that we can’t save everyone. But by better regulating the tools a small number people use to cause such harm, perhaps we could save some, and that would be something. Shouldn’t that at least be a goal we strive for?
Hunt’s primary counterargument may seem like a logical one: in the future, we may need to defend ourselves. As he says, it’s happened in other countries before. But that won’t matter if our future is taken away now. Ultimately what I want is for steps to be taken to reduce the violence that happens every day. Whether those steps involve better background checks, a longer waiting period when buying guns, better education for gun owners, limiting the number of rounds someone can buy, or even taking steps to address the mental heath conditions, chronic loneliness, and lack of intimacy in many Americans, particularly men, is not solely up to me, or to any of us — but those options should all be a viable part of the conversation.
The chance that a shooting will happen to you, or to me, is negligibly small, but the chance that one will happen in the near future is almost guaranteed. Instead of thinking “it will never happen to me,” remember that right now everyone — your niece in elementary school, your cousin at a concert — is at risk. It does not seem unreasonable to me to want to stop certain people — not everyone, but those who would perpetrate such violence — from getting hold of tools that would make their goals so much easier. There is no easy solution, and there might not be a perfect solution. But I want to find something better than what we have now.
One thing is for sure: if all discussions are shut down before they can start to open up solutions in the middle ground — ones that work to accommodate everyone who has a stake in the argument — the problem will never be solved, and lives will continue to be lost without real consequence. We cannot resort to buzz words and character attacks every time someone brings up the Second Amendment in this debate. We cannot rule out a solution until we have looked at it from many sides, and made absolutely sure that the cons outweigh the pros in the long run.
At the same time, we cannot jump to a solution in anger and fear and frustration, because we don’t want to settle for a plan that will not work for all. But to not do anything is to say that this violence is acceptable, or inevitable, and I do not believe that either is true.
Each person in this country has the right to exist freely and peacefully, regardless of party or race or religion or where they fall in this debate. It is time to take steps to make sure everyone is heard, and that we are reaching toward constructive solutions that give everyone the respect, and security, they deserve. That goal should never be lost amid pointing fingers and condescension, because these make us lose sight of what truly matters: the right to live.

Before discussing and critiquing David Hunt’s letter to the editor from the last issue of The Tartan, we would like to recognize his efforts to break out of the echo chambers that both sides have built in our modern political discourse. His opinions on gun control are some that, more likely than not, most students vehemently disagree with. Therefore, for the sake of honest debate, we evaluated his claims at face value, and we have found that many, if not all of the points that he poses in his letter veer into the territory of the incoherent, misleading, or downright manipulative. As a result we feel it necessary to go through his letter and set the record straight on the subject.
In his first line, Hunt arguably brings a point in the favor of increased gun control by commenting on the death toll caused by guns in Chicago. However, instead of making the natural conclusion that human lives could be saved by preventing criminals from getting guns, as has worked in countless other countries, he comes to the conclusion that this is evidence of the failures of Chicago’s strict gun laws. Many lawmakers in the GOP, as well as the President, use this defense as a case against gun control. However, this argument ignores the fact that these gun laws can be circumvented by simply driving to Indiana, a state with notoriously lax gun laws, which is a jaunty 45 minutes away by car. If anything, his point only goes to show that without unified national gun laws, cases such as the gun violence in Chicago will continue.
After this, Hunt goes on a confusing and misleading rant about how “it could be argued that it is Democrats that are the most dangerous demographic” due to the correlation between gun violence and the share of votes awarded to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election by county. However, as any first-year statistics major could tell you, correlation does not imply causation. According to Hunt, these statistics suggest that democrats are simultaneously gun-toting mass murderers while also being willing and able to confiscate all guns in America. However, a more logical explanation comes from the fact that when Hunt talks about how “over 50 percent of the murders in America happen in less than two percent of the counties,” that these counties simply contain our largest cities, which overwhelmingly voted for Clinton in the election. According to Business Insider, 50 percent of all people in America live in less than five percent of the counties. It would be just as honest to imply, then, that gun violence is a result of having a high density of Starbucks, or indeed having a high per-county GDP, which are both other attributes of the counties that Hunt mentions.
Many of Hunt’s references in his letter are found as results of the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC). With such a noble sounding name, we felt it was worth mentioning the founder of this website, John Lott, another author Hunt cites as a credible voice on the matter. ThinkProgress published a full-length piece on Lott, describing his past of pushing fake results from phony studies and using different definitions of terms to change the data in his favor. Among many of his other transgressions, Lott reports this false data to the media as credible through the CPRC, knowingly trying to mislead people into agreeing with his philosophies.
A prime example of this deception is a CRPC article cited by Hunt claiming that the number of per-capita deaths due to mass gun violence is higher in the European Union than in America. However, in the methodology of the statistics, they admit that they only count shootings where at least four people died. This choice of definition skews the data by ignoring people merely wounded by these catastrophes, and conveniently focuses on countries where there has been fewer, but deadlier acts of gun violence. A prime example of this is Norway, which has historically had few gun-related homicides, except for the one attack by Anders Brevik in 2011, and yet tops the charts of deaths by the CPRC’s math. On the other hand, if we decide to count all of the gun violence perpetrated between 2007 and 2012, which includes the aforementioned attack, then according to The New York Times, almost 35 times as many people are killed per capita in the United States than in Norway. To put it another way, The New York Times points out that “even if France had a mass shooting as deadly as the Paris attacks every month, its annual rate of gun homicide death would be lower than that in the United States.”
To add to the misleading facts presented by Hunt, he cites a Washington Post article by Leah Libresco where she writes, “As my co-workers and I kept looking at the data, it seemed less and less clear that one broad restriction could make a big difference.” By presenting this quote with no context, one could be forgiven for thinking the article was about the futility of gun control laws. However, reading the rest of the article makes it clear that the quote refers to Libresco’s newfound belief that gun reform can only be achieved by a number of different policies that protect different groups, such as “prohibiting [domestic abusers] from buying and owning guns.” 
Another one of Hunt’s claims is that “more than 600,000 times a year... gun owners stop crimes.” He implies that this efficacy of gun use far outweighs the costs of any gun control, citing Gary Kleck’s research. The only problem with this is that the research has never been replicated by any other study. On the federal level, this is due to the Congressional ban on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from doing research on gun control, commonly known as The Dickey Amendment. The National Rifle Association (NRA) lobbied for this restriction as a rider in the 1996 budget bill, and it has yet to be repealed. By using this unsubstantiated evidence, Hunt continues to play into a “feelings-over-facts” argument which serves to mislead more than to inform.
Then Hunt talks about “Stability Privilege”, and talks about how the United States rests on the thin line between a fascist dictatorship and total anarchy, and the only thing that can possibly protect us is being armed to the teeth. In a supreme act of tone-deafness, Hunt writes, “Tyrants love gun control because armed people don’t get into cattle cars,” implying that, had the Jews of Europe only been armed, they could have stood up against a force that had conquered all of France in six weeks, and had brought almost the entirety of Europe to heel.
Besides being insulting to the memories of those killed in the Holocaust, this common trope of anti-gun control activists is also incredibly misguided. The United States currently boasts the most powerful military ever constructed, with enough nuclear weapons to wipe out all life on earth and drones capable of remotely raining death from afar. The idea that a few well-armed individuals with questionable training (because, unlike cars, one doesn’t need to prove any level of capability with a gun to be allowed to use one wantonly) could stand up to such a force is a fantasy best left on a movie screen. He implies through callous political rhetoric that even with over 30,000 deaths every year in the United States due to firearms (more than 80 percent of such deaths worldwide, despite containing less than five percent of the world's population), this is simply the cost of protecting ourselves from the imaginary threat of a tyrannical government.
After this, Hunt perpetrates the mother of all slippery slope arguments; he claims that “The Left” (a shadowy, domineering hive mind that seems to bear no resemblance to any real-life liberal party in America) plans to take away our guns only as a first step in what can only be assumed as world domination. After all the guns are gone, next “it will be the machine shops. It will be scrap metal dealers. Chemistry sets… as well as 3D printers.” This crosses the threshold from irrational fear to downright conspiracy theory. Other countries that have restrictions on guns have not devolved into totalitarian nightmares, nor have they banned objects that have purposes other than murder.
As a final argument, Hunt falls back on one of the classic cliches of the gun lobby: mass murders will occur with or without guns, so there is no point in banning them at all. However, in many cases mass killings would not have even been possible without guns, and certainly not on the same scale. This isn’t just speculation; In Australia, after the horrific Port Arthur shooting, the government realized that the gun industry needed regulating, and restricted the purchase and usage of practically all guns, resulting in a sharp reduction in crime and no mass shootings anywhere close to the scale of Port Arthur. With regulations like that in the United States, the Las Vegas killer would have been hard-pressed to kill as quickly and efficiently from the window of a hotel without a high-powered rifle, and it’s hard to imagine a lone madman walking into a church or school with merely a knife ending with the same tragic loss of life that we’ve seen in Charleston and Sandy Hook. 
We appreciate the spirit of what Hunt is attempting. By starting a dialogue about gun control, hopefully we can reach a consensus, or at least better understand one another. We are not insinuating that other groups on the political spectrum have perfect arguments either; all politicians change numbers to make it seem like they are in the right. However, it is equally important to discuss the actual facts and flaws in each others’ arguments, and Hunt’s arguments are riddled with errors. From misleading and outright false statistics to resorting to fear-mongering, slippery-slope arguments, and cliches, Hunt fails to make a convincing point against gun control. In fact, if these are the best points that opponents of sensible gun regulation have, then this is a point in favor of such regulations. We could continue this discussion of the mistakes and errors in Hunt’s letter, but instead we invite Hunt to write back to The Tartan, so that we may further discuss the issue.

On this upcoming Veterans Day our families wish to remember all of our veterans, including our family members who served in all of the major wars from the Gulf War to Vietnam, Korea, World War II, World War I, the Spanish-American War, and the Civil War.
We are disappointed with the removal of the statues of Confederate generals, thereby contributing to rewriting U.S. history. We believe that these statues were placed to commemorate the service of some brilliant military minds and that they were not meant to be racist. About 150 Confederate generals graduated from West Point and served during the Civil War. The Civil War was fought to preserve the Union, and many Americans from the North and South fought huge battles which raged from 1861 to 1865, and they are part of our history.
Our family relates to the experiences of two members who fought in many battles during the Civil War. Sargent First Class (SFC) John B. Jones, my wife's [Elizabeth Ann (Jones) Moskowitz] grandfather, and William E. Jones, my wife's great uncle, were from the Arcade/Sandusky, NY area and were in an upstate New York cavalry regiment.
The following are excerpts from a few of SFC John B. Jones's letters to his sister Ann Jones: "Madison Court House, VA, August 8, 1862 — Last week there were three regiments of us sent out from Culpepper to Orange Court House. The rebels fell back to the village. G and H companies had an awful fight with them for a little while; Centerville, VA, Oct. 29, 1862 — Well, Ann, we had a very severe skirmish with the rebels since we left camp. There were two regiments of our cavalry on picket duty in a place called Thoroughfare Gap. The rebels came out one morning and drove them out; Amosville, VA, July 27th, 1863 — We crossed the Rappahannock River... a part of our division had a right smart skirmish with the rebel Gen. Longstreet's corps.; Stevensburg, VA, Dec. 6, 1863 — Our division was left on the left side of the Rapidan River. The rebels had strong rifle pits... They tried to shell us out of those buildings... The 2nd New York Cavalry relieved us; March 7th, 1865 — Was taken prisoner on Mount Jackson in Shenandoah Valley." 
John was force-marched to Staunton, VA then to Charlottesville, and then ended up in a prison in Richmond. He was released on April 4, 1865 in the area of Annapolis, MD.
We should not be obliterating U.S. history. Leave the statues standing, and honor all veterans.
