Known by many as “Dez,” junior materials science and engineering major Zachary Erra-Hernandez threw himself into the competition this year as a member of Carnegie Mellon’s men’s track and field team.
After helping the Tartans win the men’s University Athletic Association (UAA) conference championship this winter for the first time in school history, the Las Cruces, N.M. native looks to repeat this feat in the outdoor spring season by personally qualifying for the NCAA championship for the second time in his signature throwing (javelin, discus, hammer, shot put) events.
When he was a first-year, Erra-Hernandez showed his throwing prowess early on: He made UAA’s second-team in shot put in the indoor season, followed by third-team honors for discus in the outdoor season.
His success continued into his sophomore year — Erra-Hernandez was the UAA champion in shot put during the indoor season and claimed his career best in the weight throw (15.10 meters). In the spring, he achieved career bests in the javelin (43.52 meters), discus (47.05 meters), hammer throw (49.83 meters), and was once again UAA champion in the shot put. His in-conference achievement qualified him to compete in the NCAA National Division-III Track Championship last year, where he placed 12th in the shot put.
Erra-Hernandez has been throwing since he was in eighth grade, and “loves the mental challenge.”
He also disputed the misconception that throwing only requires brute strength. “It is very technical,” he said. “It requires practice, focus, natural competitiveness, and repitition.”
Even as an accomplished college athlete, Erra-Hernandez says he continues to work to improve. “At practice the other day, I threw the hammerthrow, and it hit the back of the cage and bounced back at me,” he said. “Although I was absolutely terrified, we all laughed about it later.”
Erra-Hernandez is a two-sport athlete, playing football for the Tartans in the fall as a fullback. For Erra-Hernandez, his biggest athletic accomplishment has been “being able to balance both football and track and being able to contribute in both.”
Erra-Hernandez’s teammates agree. “Zach brings an array of throwing skills to the team. It’s almost like he’s an area shooter by the way he can throw the discus or shot put anywhere he wants in the sector,” senior Daniel Cardenas said. “He’s one hell of an area shooter.”
First-year teammate Paul Hamerski agreed, and was quick to praise Hernandez’s significant personal impact on the team. “Zach is definitely one of the best throwers on the team. He scores us a lot of points, which is great, but his impact as a leader is much more important than as a thrower. He always does his best to perfect his technique during practice, which is a huge motivator for the rest of the team. Plus, his intensity at the meets drives his teammates to perform to a similar energy,” he said. “Personally, I owe a lot of the things I’ve learned about throwing to Zach. Overall, he is phenomenal at pushing himself and his teammates to do their best.”
Erra-Hernandez cited Carnegie Mellon as the “ideal place” to be a student athlete. “Everyone recognizes that they’re student athletes and are really willing to put in the work,” he said.
And Erra-Hernandez has most certainly put in the work and he’s seen the rewards, earning an internship with Nucor Corporation this summer to fulfill his dream of working in the metal business.
Of course, Erra-Hernandez has not thrown out all of the fun from his throwing career. He loves “how close-knit the team is.” This past Saturday, the team hosted their final home invitational of the season, highlighted by a series of goofy relays with Tartan track members sporting ridiculous costumes and themes. “[They’re] a great group of guys. I know these are people I will keep in contact with for the rest of my life,” he said.
For now, the team-oriented Erra-Hernandez keeps his eyes on the prize. “It would be huge if we won the UAA championship again. I know that our hard work will pay off,” he said.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team fought off the NCAA Division-I Duquesne University Dukes on Friday, defeating them 6–3.
Carnegie Mellon teams won all three doubles matches. Sophomore Christian Heaney-Secord and senior Duke Miller won at No. 1 doubles, and sophomore Thomas Cooper and senior Jooho Yu came back from 4–5 to earn their victory at No. 2 doubles.
First-year Yuvraj Kumar and sophomore Bryce Beisswanger defeated Duquesne’s No. 3 doubles team.
The first two singles matches went to the Dukes, who won singles matches at the first and fifth positions, but the Tartans were determined to win. Playing No. 6 singles, Yu defeated his opponent 6–2, 6–4, and first-year Abhishek Alla sealed the Tartan victory with a 6–1, 7–6 (7) victory at No. 3 singles.
Kumar also racked up a win for the Tartans at the No. 4 singles position, winning in three sets. “I think we all played really well,” Kumar said. “It felt really good to sweep doubles and follow it up with a good singles performance. We will take a lot of confidence away from this going into Kenyon next weekend.”
Alla agreed with Kumar: “All of us played well; we took care of business. It’s a good confidence boost as Duquesne is a Division I team.”
The team hopes to continue its success when it plays Kalamazoo College on Saturday and Kenyon College on Sunday.

Although it only began in January, the NHL’s abbreviated season is almost over. The Pittsburgh Penguins are asserting their dominance over the rest of the league while battling through extended injuries to star centers Evgeni Malkin (concussion and upper body) and Sidney Crosby (broken jaw).
These injuries to their main playmakers have not slowed the well-oiled machine that the Pens have become. Wingers Chris Kunitz and James Neal would both be on pace for career seasons if this were actually a full 82-game season. Goalies Marc-Andre Fleury and Tomas Vokoun have played lights out, averaging less than 2.5 goals against combined.
Much of the difference that has pushed the Pens over the edge came after last year’s quick first-round exit at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers. This offseason, the Pens traded third line center Jordan Staal for center Brandon Sutter, a first-round pick, and minor league player Brian Dumoulin.
Even though Staal has a 10-year, $60 million contract, Sutter has so far been outplaying him. Vokoun was also picked up during free agency to help back up Fleury and give him some rest, and as the stats show, it has been a fantastic success.
Even with those successes, the Penguins are still not content with sitting still. In the midst of a perfect month of March, going 15–0–0, the Pens made four major trade deadline deals to further cement the idea that the future is now. Wingers Brenden Morrow and Jarome Iginla, center Jussi Jokinen, and defenseman Douglas Murray are all short-term additions meant to push the Pens over the edge this year and bring the Cup back to Pittsburgh.
Morrow came to the Penguins from the Dallas Stars, where he served as their top line left winger and captain. For the Pens, he has so far served on their second line, giving them a bit of a scoring boost while Malkin was out. In a larger sense, Morrow allows the Penguins to move around their scoring talent and to give the third line a bit more firepower, with previous wings Matt Cooke and Tyler Kennedy only scoring 16 and nine points (goals and assists), respectively.
Iginla was the face of the Calgary Flames after he came into the league in 1996, and  he served as their captain for nine years. He is a prolific scorer and last season became only the 42nd player in NHL history to score 500 goals in his career, and only the 15th to do it all with one team.
He was supposed to take a backseat scoring role and was slotted to slide into the second line with Malkin and Morrow, but the recent injury to Crosby will force him to try and pick up the scoring slack in Crosby’s absence. Iginla did not come cheap, forcing the Pens to give up two solid offensive prospects in Kenneth Agostino and Ken Hanowski plus a first-round pick in the upcoming draft.
Jokinen was the most recent pickup by the Pens; they acquired him right at the April 3 trade deadline from the Carolina Hurricanes. Jokinen was acquired to fill in for Crosby on the top line after he went down with a broken jaw; it is still uncertain when Crosby will return. He is also the only one of the Penguins’ trade acquisitions signed past this season.
Jokinen will probably only be used for his set-up abilities with Kunitz and Pascal Dupuis, the Penguins’ two leading goal scorers, on his line. He could also be utilized for key faceoffs, since those are a weak point in Malkin’s game.
Jokinen was acquired for cheap because of his large contract. The Hurricanes put him on waivers last week with hopes that a team would sign him and pick up his contract. However, no one bit, so the Pens were able to trade a conditional draft pick and negotiated for Carolina to take on some of his remaining salary.
Murray was perhaps the least celebrated of the Pens’ pickups, coming right on the heels of the news that Morrow was acquired. Murray is a solid second-line defenseman who plays physically, but does not have much offensive ability.
He will be a key piece in the Pittsburgh defense down the stretch as he helps bolster an aging and tiring defense that has so far played excellently, but is beginning to show signs of wear and tear. The price for Murray was a bit steep, costing Pittsburgh a 2013 second-round pick and a conditional 2014 second-round pick.
All of these recent moves have reinforced the Penguins’ desire to win, regardless of injuries the hockey gods may throw in their way. They are marching toward the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, but the Montreal Canadiens and the Boston Bruins are still very good and could cause the Pens some trouble if they meet in the playoffs.
With less than 10 games remaining in this shortened schedule, it looks like the Penguins will probably be facing one of the three New York-area teams in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Rangers, New York Islanders, and New Jersey Devils occupy the 7–9 spots respectively with 40, 40, and 39 points (compared to the Pens’ 58). Every win is worth two points, so these bottom seeds are going to shuffle around some more before all is said and done.
The nice thing for the Penguins, though, is that they will be able to outscore any team they face with or without Crosby. As long as Fleury and Vokoun continue playing the role of brick wall in net, the Penguins shouldn’t face much of a challenge until the later rounds.
The key for the Penguins is to make sure they keep up the momentum going into the playoffs and keep their eye on the ultimate prize.
It may seem easy for the Pens to get cocky and overconfident, given the bashing they have been giving other teams night in and night out. But fans should not be too concerned — with four years since their last title win and several new hungry veterans who have never won in their storied careers (including Morrow and Iginla), these Penguins have plenty to keep fighting for.

What happens when you put together three Ph.D. candidates in engineering and public policy (EPP), two doctoral students in the School of Architecture, an MBA student from the Tepper School of Business, and a master’s student in electrical and computer engineering? The answer: Two awards won at the Department of Energy’s Better Buildings case competition.
A case competition generally consists of a broad question, typically one with both engineering and economic aspects, which must be answered in the form of a 10-page paper and 10-minute presentation. The Better Buildings competition included four individual case studies; each team was assigned two to work on.
“We had two cases to study: One of them was called the ‘Everything Store’ and involved trying to improve the energy efficiency of generic department store buildings by 20 percent,” explained Alan Jenn, a Ph.D. candidate in EPP. “The other case study asked for a broad plan to improve the energy efficiency of the city of Fort Worth, Texas by 20 percent.”
For the “Everything Store” case study, the team was asked to look specifically at rooftop cooling units. After building an optimization model to look at all possible replacement combinations, the team devised a creative plan that generated as much energy savings as possible while minimizing cost. “Basically what we came up with was a sell-and-lease-back scheme. In a traditional scenario, a company would buy this equipment and then they would rely on the energy savings to pay it off over a certain number of years. So instead we devised a scheme where they would buy all the equipment and then immediately sell it to an investor like GE Capital, who would then lease it back to the company,” said Donald Johnson, School of Architecture alumnus and current Tepper School of Business MBA student. This innovative strategy allows companies not to put capital into the project up front, leading to lower payments, which in turn leads to a much shorter payback period.
However, replacing rooftop units was not sufficient to bring down savings. “We considered other things like lighting efficiency, refrigeration, and insulation,” said Adrian Chong, doctoral student in the School of Architecture. “We ran a lot of energy simulations on a software called Energy Plus.” The team’s out-of-the-box thinking and detailed quantitative analysis earned them the “Best Proposal” award for the “Everything Store” case study.
For the Fort Worth case study, the team acquired building sector data from Forth Worth, which they put into a geographic information system (GIS), a type of map-making software that allowed them to determine the energy consumption for the buildings of Forth Worth by sector. “We ended up targeting residential single family dwellings, industrial buildings, and schools,” Jenn said.
“Our strategy for residential homes was focused on getting the families more information about their energy use so that they can make smarter choices,” said Allison Weis, a Ph.D. candidate in EPP. As for industrial buildings, doctoral student in the School of Architecture Chao Ding explained that most of the energy was used in the manufacturing process. “So we gave them very detailed information on energy-saving technology, and for each technology we gave how much energy you can save and what the payback period is,” Ding said. 
Residential homes and industrial buildings were chosen because of their high levels of energy consumption. “The reason why we chose schools was different,” clarified Mili-Ann Tamayao, Ph.D. candidate in EPP. “We chose schools as one of the sectors to focus on because of the ease of disseminating information in schools.” The team’s Fort Worth proposal won the members’ the “Most Innovative” award.
Jie Yee Chan, a master’s student in electrical and computer engineering (ECE), attributes his team’s success to its multidisciplinary nature. “I think this is a great team because we all come from different backgrounds,” Chan said. “We have a good mixture of [people from] architecture, EPP, and MBA students — and I’m from ECE.” Johnson also noted that while they were all from different disciplines, each individual was well informed in each other’s areas, which resulted in a constant overlap of knowledge.
Last year’s team from Carnegie Mellon won one award at this case competition. This year, the team won “Best Proposal” and “Most Innovative.” “Maybe next year’s team will bring home two ‘Best Proposal’ awards,” Johnson said. If some  members of this year’s team decide to compete again, next year’s team will be lucky enough to have the guidance  and experience of talented leaders.

The prospect of robots becoming integrated into human society has been limited to the realm of science fiction — until now. In his book, Robot Futures, Carnegie Mellon professor Illah Nourbakhsh discusses imminent robot innovation and its implications for society.
According to Nourbakhsh, robot technology will advance enough within the next few decades to bring about a mass of mediocre robots. This trend will create a new species of “social robots,” which will live, work, and interact with human beings on a daily basis. 
In his book, Nourbakhsh highlights that this does not simply entail a mass of benign moving and talking machines, but a major revolution that will drastically affect our “freedom, identity, and behavior.” The robots will allow for the collection and organization of data on humans, bringing freedom and privacy into question. Furthermore, the prospect of robots becoming an integrated part of people’s daily lives will essentially change their identities.
“We’re not just interacting with people, but with a whole new species. That’s going to change who we are,” Nourbakhsh said. Regular interaction with a species essentially devoid of emotion will indeed change people’s behavioral characteristics. There is valid concern that this will ultimately dehumanize people. For example, Nourbakhsh’s book details the concern that robots may incite negative temperaments in people and becoming easy targets for bullying or domestic abuse; people might take out their problems on their robots.
Furthermore, the advancement of robots is likely to dilute our thinking and focusing capabilities. “Telepresence” is a product of robot technology that allows humans to feel as if they were somewhere other than their current location, therefore allowing them to virtually be in two places at once. According to Robot Futures, this will increase the prevalence of attention dilution disorder, a disorder related to attention deficit disorder, which is developed due to the influx of information brought about by modern technology.
Perhaps one of the most glaring effects will be in the manual labor market; Particularly in the eyes of large corporations, robots will be seen as human-equivalent competitors. Nourbakhsh points out that robot labor will be cheaper than human labor and thus may replace human labor altogether, resulting in a loss of lower skill level jobs.
There is the potential that employment levels will be significantly affected, if, as Nourbakhsh puts it, “companies are driven by profit motive rather than social good.”
With these grave ramifications before us, the question remains: Why allow such a revolution to happen at all? Nourbakhsh devotes his last chapter to answering this question, and points out a benefit that comes close to balancing out the potential damages: community empowerment.
Just as robots can enable the mass collection of private data on individuals, they can also enable people in rural communities to collect and analyze the quality of water samples. In many similar ways, robots have the potential to empower communities through efficient and innovative technology.
Aside from conveying the potential direct effects of the robotic revolution on societies, Nourbakhsh’s book subtly reminds readers of the line between reality and science fiction. 
For decades, the prospect of machines overtaking humans and posing a threat to mankind has been a pervasive theme in science fiction. With the coming of the new wave of robotic technology, one cannot help but wonder whether robots will eventually threaten the human species. Fortunately, Nourbakhsh dispels this fear.
“People have forgotten that what we are facing is mediocre robots. These robots are sub-human,” he said. According to Robot Futures, the coming robots will display a variety of inefficient and annoying behaviors, which Nourbakhsh calls “Robot Smog.” Thus, the prospect of being terrorized by machines is unlikely in the near future.
Nonetheless, a revolution is under way. Each facet of society should take an active role in considering and shaping the way the new robo-innovation will change society. Within the next few decades, it will be imperative to “think of robotics that empowers our communities, rather than serving as just tools for corporations,” Nourbakhsh said.

Californians accustomed to dry weather are often puzzled by the gray clouds and drizzling rain that occur in the middle of April. Parts of California even have some of the highest rates of snowfall in the United States. After analyzing cloud particles and ice nuclei, researchers have determined that these bouts of precipitation may be the result of the transportation of dust from Asia.
Assistant professor of mechanical engineering and chemistry Ryan Sullivan is responsible for looking at how Asian dust that arrives on the West Coast in spring alters cloud properties and changes precipitation in California. He collaborated with researchers from other institutions, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the University of California, Santa Barbara; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The research was meant to explore a phenomenon that is very important to Californians. “Environmental engineers in California pay attention to precipitation because they are concerned about the energy supply that is generated from hydroelectric power,” Sullivan said.
For his research, Sullivan and his team first collected precipitation samples in the Sierra Nevadas to find Asian dust particles in residues. Then, they outfitted a research aircraft, “Gulfstream 1,” with various instruments to measure the type and concentration of particles and how those particles interacted with clouds. Next, Sullivan measured the concentration of ice nuclei, which are one-in-a-million particles in the atmosphere that cause liquid cloud droplets to freeze. He claims that mineral dust particles are some of the best ice nuclei in the atmosphere.
Sullivan then observed a long range of transported Asian dust intersecting at high altitudes with clouds that formed over the Sierra Nevadas. The elevated concentration of ice nuclei in dust plumes causes those clouds to freeze, which induces extensive precipitation over the mountain range, thus explaining California’s precipitation.
“Had the Asian dust not arrived, clouds would not freeze and Californians wouldn’t have to experience high precipitations,” Sullivan said.
The California Water Service (CalWater) campaign, along with the research aircraft that took cloud measurements, confirmed that there were Asian dust particles in the cloud that changed cloud properties. These aircraft measurements, in addition to ground measurements and satellite measurements that recorded movement of dust plumes across the ocean, all supported Sullivan’s conclusions.
Sullivan has other research plans pertaining to climate issues. “For the next step, we want to uncover the chemical evolution of particles as they move through the atmosphere and how this affects the particles’ ability to interact with clouds and change their properties, which ultimately affects climate. These effects can be seen as climate changes, such as brightness of clouds, amount of sunlight reflected, and lifespan of clouds,” Sullivan said.
To determine the ability of individual particles to interact with clouds in the atmosphere, Sullivan and his team developed a single-particle analysis technique by merging two different laser techniques. The first one involved sucking a particle into a vacuum chamber, then exposing the particle to a pulse ultraviolet laser beam, which turns the particle into ions. The particle then goes through a mass electrometer, an advanced instrument that can measure electronic properties such as charge difference.
In the second technique, particles are trapped and focused into laser beams, which allows them to be stable for as long as desired. The particles are then exposed to reactive gases like water vapor. While this is happening, Sullivan and his team change the temperature and observe how the particles respond. These techniques are used to simulate processes that particles experience in ice nucleation and interaction with clouds in California.
In a related project, Sullivan studied contact freezing, which involves using an ice nuclei to catalyze the freezing of a cloud water droplet that hasn’t frozen at the correct temperature. During the nucleation process, dust particles collide with cloud droplets, causing them to freeze instantly upon contact. Though it is the most efficient nucleation mechanism, it is also the most difficult to study since it involves controlling contact between individual droplets, according to Sullivan. Sullivan and his team would have to use optical tweezers to hold droplets in a laser beam, explore different mineral dust particles, and use machines to count the number of particles that hit the droplet before it freezes.
By completing his research, Sullivan hopes to understand how aerosol particles in the atmosphere change cloud properties and how that affects climate. Because these forms of research currently have the largest uncertainty in terms of allowing us to understand and predict how we affect climate, Sullivan strives to improve the accuracy of this method.

In many people’s thoughts, eggs are as strongly associated with Easter as pumpkins are with Halloween, or turkeys with Thanksgiving. According to about.com, one theory suggests that his is because in days before modern technology, the beginning of spring would be the first time people tasted fresh eggs after a cold, hard winter, making them special during spring. However, there is much more to eggs than just being symbols of celebration.
Eggs are used by birds, reptiles, and certain mammals as a way to produce offspring. Instead of giving birth to their offspring after they have fully developed, these animals lay eggs instead. The offspring finish growing inside these eggs and then hatch once they have matured enough to be able to face the world. 
Eggs come in many different sizes and colors; however, all have commonalities that let them perform essential functions. All eggs have membranes to keep their insides together and to protect the defenseless young before they hatch. In addition, several types of eggs also have a shell which is formed from calcium carbonate, a material that also makes chalk and pearls.
According to pitara.com, the eggshell is a wonderfully strong material that gains its strength in part from its structure — it is shaped like a three-dimensional arch that lets it evenly distribute any weight put on it. Due to this feature, if someone squeezes an egg by wrapping his or her hand around it, it likely will not crack. Similarly, due to the arch-like structure of the egg, it is difficult to crack an egg by squeezing it at its ends. This even distribution of loads over the shell is why heavy animals like hens can sit on top of small eggs without cracking them. However, when applying sharp pressure to any one area of an egg — for example, cracking it on the side of a pan — the egg will easily break. This is also a useful property of an egg, for it allows the chick (or other baby animal) inside to exit the egg by simply pecking at an uneven pressure.
Apart from the biological uses of eggs, you've probably noticed how handy they can be in the kitchen, too. This is due to the properties of the insides of eggs, which contain materials needed by the developing young. According to Exploratorium.edu, these materials are globular proteins, which are long strands of protein molecules twisted into almost spherical shapes. These proteins are suspended in water inside the egg, and they're the properties that are so useful in cooking.
For example, heating up eggs causes these spherical molecules to gain energy and uncurl. These uncurled molecules begin looking for others to form connections with, since their own spherical connections have broken. The proteins start connecting to each other, and water begins to get trapped in the connections between these molecules. This causes the egg to solidify when it is heated up. Continuing to add heat to these molecules will cause them to form even more connections with each other, which is the cause of the rubbery texture of eggs that have been overcooked. 
Another cool property of these protein molecules: Some parts of them attract water (hydrophilic) while others repel water (hydrophobic). So, in mixtures where one needs water and oil to stick together, eggs can be used to make this happen. The proteins in eggs will uncurl in such a way that the hydrophilic part will be attracted to water, while the hydrophobic part will attach itself to oil. Therefore, these proteins can hold the water and oil mixture together without any separation.
You might also have noticed that eggs get fluffier when beaten. This is because adding air to eggs while beating them causes protein molecules to uncurl and take up more space. These molecules uncurl because the hydrophobic parts attach themselves to the air molecules, trapping more air in the egg mixture, leading to fluffier eggs.
For such a commonplace ingredient, eggs have many interesting facets to them. From the variety in types of eggs to the science inside each one, they are truly “egg-citing!”

International Space Station finds signs of dark matter
A cosmic ray detector aboard the International Space Station has found significant signs of dark matter.
Dark matter is a form of matter that is both invisible and hard to detect. In fact, aside from these signs, no evidence has yet been found of its existence. Scientists believe that dark matter must fill space, because they have no other way to account for various phenomena, including gravitational tugs on galaxies. Scientists surmise that the total mass of dark matter throughout the universe is five times more than the total mass of ordinary matter. 
There is still doubt that the detected signs point to the existence of dark matter. Experiment chief Samuel Ting, a Nobel Laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes that the experiment involving the cosmic ray detector is proceeding smoothly and will be able to produce enough data to settle the dark matter mystery.
“[These are] beautiful results, but we are not there yet in terms of identifying the dark matter,” said Michael Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago.

Scientists use 3-D printer to make tissue-like material
Scientists at Oxford University have used a custom-made 3-D printer to make a material that resembles living tissue. The material consists of thousands of water droplets encapsulated within lipid films that are able to perform some functions of human cells.
These droplet networks are completely synthetic, so they don’t have a genome and don’t replicate. As a result, they are immune to problems that plague other types of artificial tissues, like those from stem cells.
Currently, the droplets are five times the size of living cells, but the researchers believe the size can be reduced. The synthetic material can also be molded into different shapes after printing.

Apple’s iMessage causes federal surveillance problems
Apple’s iMessage is so securely encrypted that federal agencies have problems conducting court-authorized surveillance of suspects.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that over 300 billion messages have been sent since iMessage was announced in mid 2011. Apple stresses that the messages were not intended to be impossible for the government to decrypt. All Apple’s software does is allow for encrypted communication between Apple users and ensure the privacy of their messages. On the contrary, Federal agents are able to intercept the telephone calls or text messages that phone companies generally deliver as unencrypted audio. However, this lack of encryption also does not stop unauthorized entities from intercepting communication. 
Moving away from encryption will be a step backward for user privacy, but officials with the FBI are pushing for legislation regarding more efficient surveillance facilities. Apple maintaining a duplicate set of messages for use by law enforcement is a feasible alternative.

NASA plans to tow asteroid into Earth’s orbit
NASA plans to launch a robotic spaceship that will drag a small asteroid toward Earth so astronauts can explore it.
After identifying an appropriate asteroid, NASA will send a specially designed spaceship to bring it closer to Earth. This mission will help NASA develop the capability to modify the orbit of asteroids and will be useful in ensuring that no major asteroid hits Earth in the future. The fears of an asteroid hitting the earth have heightened since an asteroid exploded over the Chelyabinsk region in Russia earlier this year, causing widespread damage and injury.
According to researchers, the plans include not only learning how to deflect an asteroid, but also develop ways to go to Mars.

“Noise continually surrounds us, from white static to violent intensity,” reads the program for this year’s wats:ON? festival. “Noise asks you to surrender to the possibility of the rush of the sublime.”
There were certainly sublime moments during last week’s wats:ON? festival, an annual arts and architecture festival dedicated to the memory of the late Carnegie Mellon architecture professor Jill Watson and curated by associate professor of art Golan Levin and director of Carnegie Mellon’s architecture pre-college Spike Wolff. This year’s festival went with the theme “NOISE,” which many of the presentations and events alluded to. The festival spanned Thursday through Saturday and featured a variety of lectures and performances in the College of Fine Arts building. The noises over the course of the festival were by turns educational, overwhelming, inspiring, thought provoking, and inescapable.
Although the festival offered four events total, I attended two very engaging but very different events — Jeff Hinkelman’s lecture and screening titled “What Is the Sound of a Pig Dancing?” and the Cyborgs of Sound performance followed by a piece by experimental musician Lesley Flanigan.
Jeff Hinkelman: What Is the Sound of a Pig Dancing?
Hinkelman, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student in film and head of the Hunt Library video collection, offered guests an engaging and sweeping overview of the history of sound in film on Friday night. As Hinkelman revealed, “Film comes from sound”: The idea for film originated when entrepreneurs thought to add pictures to Thomas Edison’s invention of the phonograph, which recorded sound.
The venue for the screening, the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, was pleasant, intimate, and appropriately sized for the turnout: Though small, the room was nearly filled. The festival organizers also invited guests to enjoy free popcorn and sugary treats, which made for an even friendlier and more comfortable atmosphere.
The only drawback was the lack of sophisticated equipment: Hinkelman used an ordinary projector to display short films via YouTube. Although Hinkelman also didn’t seem to favor YouTube as a screening medium, the quality of the short films was just fine for his purposes.
Undoubtedly the most impressive part of the evening was the student performances that accompanied some of the screenings. Hinkelman had wanted to emulate screenings of silent films as they had existed in the silent film era — often in theaters or other venues with live accompaniment. For this reason, senior Bachelor’s of Humanities and Arts student in film and musicology Matthew Zurcher and senior piano performance major Brian Gilling joined Hinkelman at the front of the room, offering brilliant and entertaining live accompaniment to the visuals onscreen.
Other highlights included a hilarious animated short called “Ain’t She Sweet,” which kept the audience chuckling with its adorably scheming animals scurrying back and forth across the screen. Another animated short, “Gerald McBoing Boing,” used sound effects to tell the charming story of a boy who spoke not in words, but in outrageous sounds like the honk of a horn or the boom of explosives.
Cyborgs of Sound & Lesley Flanigan
In contrast to the more educational, historically based Friday night film screening, the Saturday night performances by local electronic musicians brought an explosion of experimental sounds to Kresge Theatre. Each of the four artists brought something very new — at times both beautiful and abrasive — to the stage.
The event opened with Carnegie Mellon adjunct professor of art and internationally renowned musician Eric Singer and his robotic guitar — although by Singer’s own admission, the robo-guitar did most of the work. “I have a very important role in tonight’s performance,” Singer joked. “I press ‘go’ and it takes over.”
The bizarre-looking instrument consisted of four vertical black slabs, each with small objects moving up and down central strings like beads on an abacus. It looked somewhat like a strange, wobbling, four-eyed alien with rotating red pupils. And when Singer did press “go,” the result was a disjointed but somehow rhythmic series of beeps and boops, layered over a steady strumming sound and a solid bass in a kind of computerized chirping. It was a fascinating and impressive accomplishment; the complex robotic sounds occurred in complete synchronization.
Local artist and musician Jeremy Boyle took the stage next with a similar concept, although his instrumentation drew a much stronger resemblance to what we’re used to, complete with a drum set and an electric guitar resting on a stand. But upon closer inspection, it was clear that the setup was far from ordinary: Wires ran from each of the percussion instruments, and the guitar was equipped with a small robot somewhat similar to Singer’s robo-guitar. Clasped around the fingerboard was an object that eerily resembled a hand pressing down on the strings, and on the body of the guitar, small mite-like constructs reached out and plucked individual strings.
The music itself started out haunting and high-pitched, with wooden flute-like tones emanating from the instruments. Boyle supplemented these sounds with an eletric guitar he played himself. A few times, Boyle leaned back and took a water break as his instruments carried the music for him. As opposed to Singer’s rhythmically convoluted pieces, Boyle preferred simplicity and beauty to complexity.
Local instrument builder Michael Johnsen’s performance, however, can only be described as complete auditory chaos. Right from the onset, the theater was filled with a rapid, deafening, and furious series of random sounds — a hectic, incessant barrage of clicks and squeaks. The artist sat onstage looking over a tangle of boxes and wires, regularly leaning forward to dial up or down certain sounds.
For the most part, the experience was downright unpleasant: Some of the sounds were so shrill that a few audience members clapped their hands over their ears. When the cacophony ended and Johnsen exited the stage with a simple “thanks,” many of the the audience members breathed a sigh of relief. The inundating effect was interesting on a theoretical level and most likely intentional — but that didn’t make the sensory experience any less uncomfortable.
The festival organizers held a brief intermission before the final performance by experimental electronic musician Lesley Flanigan. Flanigan’s setup looked somewhat similar to Johnsen’s, though more organized; she kneeled over a collection of wooden box-looking instruments, a microphone in hand. When the music began, it was blissfully different from Johnsen’s.
Flanigan began by blending her own vocals with the instruments for simple, pure-sounding octaves before branching into different harmonies. She used the microphone to amplify different elements, first holding it to her mouth and then dipping it gracefully over each of the instruments, creating soft swells of sound.
The piece grew in volume and complexity. Like the musicians she followed, Flanigan embraced dissonance and abrasiveness in her work, allowing certain shrill, crackling noises to become almost deafening at points. Occasionally, Flanigan’s sultry voice came through, enchanting the audience with her beautiful vibrato.
Of the four artists, Flanigan’s work had the most potential for transportation: During her piece, listeners could allow their minds to wander, imagine, and enter a totally different world. Her piece was undoubtedly a favorite of the evening. After the sounds faded and Flanigan stood up, Kresge erupted with cheers and applause.
All four artists were true performers in that, during their acts, their actions were almost as important as the music. Although the noise was the focus of the evening — and of the entire festival — it was just as fascinating to watch the process of music-making unfold as to listen to the result.
It is a testament to the success of the festival that two of its events alone could be so enthralling yet so different; this diversity only added to the educational and awareness-raising value of the festival. Both events left guests thinking, questioning, and wanting to experience more — a sign that wats:ON? 2013 did exactly what it set out to do.

“Warning: explicit content.”
Those words are printed on every ticket to The Book of Mormon at Pittsburgh’s Benedum Center in Downtown — and with good reason. The musical that cleaned up at the Tony Awards with nine wins last year is one of the most vulgar, inappropriate, and politically incorrect musicals that I’ve ever seen — and I loved every second of it.
For those who may not know, The Book of Mormon is a musical from the minds of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of Comedy Central’s South Park. The musical follows Elder Kevin Price, a young Mormon eager to begin his two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Praying to be sent to Orlando, Price seems to draw the short straw when he is assigned to Uganda with the compulsive liar Elder Arnold Cunningham. Faced with warlords, disease, poverty, and famine, Price realizes that bringing Africans to the church may not be as easy as it initially seemed. Laced with constant jokes, the show had the audience laughing from the opening number.
The Book of Mormon is meant to be one big joke, but the level of humor in the musical does not affect the quality of the show. The amount of work that was put into the production was evident. The vocal performances of each and every cast member was incredible, and the choreography effectively corresponded with each of the numbers. The cast and crew had obviously put an immense amount of effort into polishing the performance, making the show as legitimate as The Lion King or Wicked. It is only due to this level of professionalism that audience members are able to take the more ridiculous parts of the script seriously.
However, what makes The Book of Mormon different from most musicals is that it was written to offend. There are racial slurs and vulgar language everywhere, and direct jabs at organized religion come at every turn. It crosses every line and breaks all the rules. While on the surface it may seem a ridiculous, crude excuse for a musical, the satire is very poignant. The Book of Mormon is only as ridiculous as the concept it criticizes. The message it tries to project through the use of flamboyant Elders and the hyperbolized ignorance of the Ugandans rings true whether people adhere to an organized religion or not.
The Book of Mormon is really about how organized religion isn’t necessarily a requirement for being a good person, helping others and making a difference. And while it does make fun of religion, it also teaches respect for others’ beliefs, no matter how far-fetched they might seem. 
Although the production at the Benedum Center ended yesterday, it’s worth the trip to find another production. Look past the offensiveness and see the genius beneath the jokes. It won’t disappoint.

Our school may not have fashion as an available major, but students keep surprising the world with their talents in this field. Gela Nash-Taylor’s Juicy Couture, for example, is one of the most renowned brands from a Carnegie Mellon alumna (CFA ’78). Now, the up-and-coming personal styling website sharesomestyle.com is about to continue this legacy.
Carnegie Mellon alumna Diane Loviglio (BHA ’05)and her husband Gil Tolle (SCS ’05) just founded the business in November 2012, but the newborn company already has a total of 35 stylists in New York City, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh. A couple of the current stylists, Anya Weitzman (BHA ’12) and Kristen Staab (BHA ’12), are also Carnegie Mellon alumnae.
Before starting sharesomestyle.com, Loviglio and Tolle both tried working at different startups. “ [Gil’s] got acquired, so he was at Cisco for a few years. I went to freelance a bunch of startups, then I went to take up a full-time job for a year and a half, but then we both quit on the same day in November to do this full-time,” Loviglio said. Ultimately, the Carnegie Mellon couple decided to dedicate their all to this company.
The idea behind the site is a simple three-step process: “Find a Stylist,” “Get a Closet Audit,” and “Do a Shopping Trip.” The first step requires you to review stylists’ profiles, which include before-and-after pictures of their previous clients; get to know the stylists through phone calls, email, and social networking. Once you pick your favorite, you may book a session with him or her and then pay online.
Next, your stylist visits your home for about two hours. As a team, you mix and match clothes you already have, throw out or donate the clothes that do not fit your style, and make a shopping list of all the new items that will contribute to your new style and fill the newfound gaps in your closet. Finally, you will shop with your stylist for another two hours to pick out new outfits, check the fit, and help you get out of your comfort zone. The whole process occurs that typically ranges from $30 to $90 an hour.
To ensure the security of clients and the validity of the stylists, clients can check stylists’ website profiles and social network pages, as well as the blogs that both stylists and previous clients post on sharesomestyle.com.
As Loviglio explained, “They put together a ‘My Style’: They upload photos that they like, photo shoots that they have styled for before or [for] their past clients. Also, they may put in a couch or a teapot that they like, so clients can have a better understanding of their static and feel like, ‘Oh, I can relate to that person!’ ”
Mother’s Day and graduation are two big upcoming celebratory events, and sharesomestyle.com is taking this opportunity to launch its newest feature — gift cards — in order to meet the demand for fresh and practical presents. The idea is that people can sign up their friends and family members for the service.
It is truly inspiring to see people from our school supporting each other toward the same goal even after college — a goal toward personal styling, no less. Who says our school doesn’t care about fashion?

Despite playing at The Underground for a crowd of around 50 people, indie folk band Hey Marseilles delivered an intimate and engaging performance last Monday. They took the stage 30 minutes later than the announced start time since the sound check had taken too long. The concert opened with a disjointed collection of instrumentals that turned into the song “Marseilles,” an instrumental lead into “To Travels and Trunks,” the first two songs of their first album of the same name.
After a brief slow piece called “Gasworks,” Hey Marseilles pulled out a few uptempo songs like “Heart Beats” and “Dead of Night,” both from an album released last month called Lines We Trace. These tracks got the audience engaged in the show and caused many of the concertgoers to start singing along.
Despite the small crowd, there were few concertgoers who just seemed to be along for the ride. It seemed as if everyone in the crowd wanted to be there and had known about the band for some time. The intimate environment had the audience swaying and singing to the beautiful and intricately layered music that the seven members of Hey Marseilles created with even more instruments.
Nearly every member of the band played multiple instruments throughout the night: The lead singer played guitar and shared a bass with the cellist, the keyboardist played an accordion, and a versatile trumpeter who took up miscellaneous percussion as well as clarinet.
As the night wore on, lead singer Matt Bishop developed a level of comfort with the audience as he shared jokes regarding pirating the band’s music and the national renown of Carnegie Mellon’s awkward computer science majors.
The band ended its set with a rousing and emotional performance of the single from their most recent album called “Bright Stars Burning,” and a lengthy piece from their first album called “From a Terrace.” After an elaborate interplay of accordion, viola, and trumpet, the song dissolved into a soulful acoustic guitar and vocal segment.
Yet the dedicated audience wasn’t satisfied with a single set and the promise of free ice cream, so Hey Marseilles was called back on stage for an encore. Bishop came on first and did a solo performance of the track “Someone to Love,” a soft and melancholy song about being satisfied with the person you’re with. After that, the full band came on to perform “Calabasas,” an intricate, layered piece that features a beautiful and consuming ending full of viola, cello, trumpet, and keys.
Hey Marseilles delivered a soulful set to a small crowd of truly dedicated fans. The entire experience was similar to that of fan girls seeing their favorite act in a very intimate venue. The Underground saw a rare show that left everyone satisfied and the most enamored of fans loving Hey Marseilles a little bit more than they did before the concert.

Travel writer Pico Iyer spoke at Carnegie Mellon last Tuesday as part of the ongoing Adamson Writers Series. A writer for Time magazine since 1986, Iyer has authored multiple fiction and nonfiction books, with his latest being The Man Within My Head.
The title of the lecture was “Moving and Sitting Still in Our New Global Order” and primarily discussed how, in today’s internationally minded society, many people straddle different cultures and places they can accurately call home. Iyer had much insight on the subject: He traced his family roots to India, split his youth between boarding schools in England and his parents’ home in Santa Barbara, and talked about how he now spends seven months of the year in Japan.
While billed as a lecture, the event was anything but. Iyer opened by saying he wished to have a conversation instead of just talking, and that kind of informal mood pervaded the event. Iyer didn’t use a PowerPoint presentation and didn’t speak as if he were carefully arguing a point. He shared humorous anecdotes about friends such as the Dalai Lama, of whom Iyer is a close companion; in fact, Iyer wrote an account of his travels with His Holiness in his book The Open Road. Iyer also spoke charismatically and energetically about events in his life and the lessons he took from them, which kept his modest audience very much engaged and hanging on to his every word.
While his talk was somewhat disappointing in that it lacked focused points, Iyer made many interesting small points about where people come from in today’s society, eloquently spinning them into phrases such as “stained-glass homes,” and saying that, “Home is where you become yourself.” As his own globe-hopping proves, he doesn’t see “home” as an exact place; instead, he sees “home” as a state of mind and a definition of the self. He says that the greatest pressure of the modern moment is “to figure out where we belong both physically and internally” — a relevant idea at a place so full of different nationalities as Carnegie Mellon.
Iyer also expressed his excitement at how our increasingly globalized society introduces new sights, sounds, and smells into daily life that we often may not notice or take for granted. For example, how often do any of us eat cuisine from different areas of the world for each individual meal of the day? The fact that he was able to bring in these kinds of little details from our everyday lives and connect them to such grander themes helped make the talk extremely thought-provoking.
At the end of his talk, Iyer enthusiastically answered many questions from the audience, some in response to his talk and others that had clearly been rattling around in people’s heads for a while. 
When asked why he chooses to spend so much of his time in Japan, he replied that it was a country with a “mix of energy and serenity,” and that being a foreigner in Japan allows one to enjoy a combination of familiarity and strangeness without the social pressures that natives feel. In response to an excited audience member holding up his interview with Leonard Cohen that had come out in Time earlier that day, he talked about his experience living in a monastery with the famed poet, singer, and songwriter. He also attributed the recent increase in interest in Cohen’s works to the idea that our increasingly complicated lives are losing the kind of simplicity and honesty that he embodies.
The final question asked whether Iyer had ever been to the Japanese region of Hokkaido, which is famed for its beauty. Iyer responded that he has yet to make it there and desperately wants to as well. It turns out that, for all the traveling that Iyer has done over the years, there are still places he wants to go.

Legendary film critic Roger Ebert passed away on April 4, two days after revealing that his cancer had returned. Ebert achieved iconic status after hosting film review shows such as Siskel and Ebert at the Movies and becoming the only film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. His reviews for the Chicago Sun-Times were syndicated nationwide and attracted millions of readers.
One of the things that Ebert taught us was the possibility of living an unstoppable life. His battle with thyroid and salivary gland cancer caused him to lose his voice and most of his jaw, but he never lost his conviction or his passion for life. He always followed through with his purpose and love for writing; as he told Esquire magazine, “[W]hen I am writing, my problems become invisible, and I am the same person I always was.”
For four decades, he garnered generations of loyal readers who grew up with him and his words. His honesty with himself allowed for his film criticism to be accessible to anyone who loved the movies while also being a unique form of artistic expression. 
This year, however, was possibly his most prolific year of writing reviews. Shortly before his death, he declared a “leave of presence”: “Last year, I wrote the most of my career, including 306 movie reviews, a blog post or two a week, and assorted other articles,” he wrote on his blog on the Chicago Sun-Times website. “I must slow down now, which is why I’m taking what I like to call ‘a leave of presence.’ ” Instead, Ebert was going to review films he was truly passionate about. Sadly, we never got the chance to read more of his words.
Through Ebert, people did not only learn about movies, but also about love, life, fear, and strength. His words and his passion widened the experience of life through movies. Ebert helped people understand the truths that turn movies into universes full of wonder and awe. 
Because his criticism was accessible and open, readers could connect to what he had to say whether they agreed with him or not. He wasn’t a pretentious, highbrow critic who only loved European art films. He loved all kinds of film and was unfazed by mass opinion, following his gut and articulating his reviews in such a way that truly made him the most important film critic of his generation.
His explosive presence on Twitter also exhibited his voice not only on films, but about politics as well. His hilarious, politically incorrect tweets reflected a part of him that would never be slowed down or stopped by anyone or anything.
Ebert’s love for the movies helped readers understand them in a more passionate sense. Although he was never a filmmaker himself, the world of film will never be the same without him. He wasn’t merely a critic; he was a man whose love for life and imagination contributed to films in a way audience members never realized were possible.

At that magical, entrancing place where the political intrigue of The West Wing and the filming style of Sherlock intersect lies House of Cards. The thrilling political drama is a not only an extremely well-crafted show, but also an innovation in the world of television.
Instead of first airing on a major network, the show’s first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on Feb. 1. Based loosely on a 1990 BBC production with the same title, the show follows U.S. Representative and majority whip Francis “Frank” Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey with a smooth, charming Southern drawl. Domineering and powerful, Underwood wreaks carefully orchestrated havoc on Capitol Hill after President Garret Walker (Michael Gill) passes him up for the position of Secretary of State. He and his wife Claire, played by the ever-graceful and poised Robin Wright, decide to fight back against the political machine by ditching moral standards in order to look out for themselves.
The couple’s relationship is one of the best parts of the show. While clearly not in love or completely committed to each other, Frank and Claire have a mutual understanding that they will each do whatever it takes to advance the other’s career. They also participate in and openly admit to extramarital affairs throughout the season: Claire with former flame photographer Adam Galloway (Ben Daniels) and Frank with upstart reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara). The dynamic between the couple adds an interesting emotional angle to the show, most of which is driven by the political scheming of Frank and his associates.
The list of standout characters includes Peter Russo, a U.S. congressman who runs for governor of Pennsylvania with Frank’s help. Corey Stoll, who plays Russo, is one of the strongest and most compelling actors featured on the show. His character, while plagued by demons that include heavy drinking, drug abuse, and a penchant for prostitutes, is a force to be reckoned with — an admirable feat for an actor.
The entire cast presents believable and engaging characters. All of the characters are flawed, making it impossible to see anything in black and white; instead, viewers are forced to concentrate on the many interesting shades of gray. The writing is genius; the plot moves and twists steadily while remaining believable; and the cinematography is interesting and easy to watch. The best parts of the show are undoubtedly the moments in which Frank breaks the fourth wall, turning and staring directly into the camera and addressing viewers to explain his true sentiments with snarky commentary or a disparaging glance in reaction to an idiotic political maneuver.
Even though its availability is restricted to Netflix users, the series has experienced huge success, marking what will take off as a trend in television if marketers have any shred of sense. Currently ranking the number-one most watched show on Netflix, House of Cards has been renewed for a second season of 13 episodes.

Dear Patrick,
Carnival is next week, and I’m really excited! ...except I don’t know exactly what Carnival entails. What’s the deal with Carnival? How can I best enjoy it?
Thanks,
Rarely Ever Tremendously Imbibed, Carnival Entices, Needs Tips Regarding Ensuing Vices, Easy Liquor, Eager Rampages
Dear RETICENT REVELER,
For most people at Carnegie Mellon, who don’t go out that much or only drink in moderation when they do, Carnival is the high point of the year. Students forget about the exams just around the corner, let their hair down, and go crazy for one weekend out of the whole year. Some even start drinking on Tuesday!
But for those of us who usually spend Tuesday nights in a bar, Carnival is a time when the people you try to get away from show up at your favorite haunts. The sorority girls are excited for those lemon drop shots, the dudes are shotgunning beer and awkwardly hitting on girls, and the programmers are getting drunk for the first time all year instead of making their kernel. But it’s Carnival, and all we can do is take another drink and enjoy their company.
What better way to celebrate than drinking yourself into oblivion?
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I just thought of this great new drinking game! I call it “Human Fortypede.” It’s a combination of Edward Fortyhands and The Human Centipede. I think it’s a great game, except no one wants to play it with me. How can I convince my friends to play it with me? I know they’ll love it once they give it a chance.
Thanks,
Guarantee Amazing Milieu, Entertaining Guests Until Zappy, Zingers Leave Everyone Reticent
Dear GAME GUZZLER,
That game sounds miserable. But as your intrepid advice columnist, I shall endeavor to advise you on tricking your friends into playing your awful drinking game.
The most likely method to succeed is the most straightforward one: tell your friends the drinks are free if they play the game. Nothing is more alluring than free booze. If you can convince some girls to play, I’m sure you’ll get some guys eager to play too. I would not suggest jumping your friends with duct tape and bottles of booze, no matter how appealing that may be.
Or play my drinking game: Shut up and drink,
Patrick Hoskins

Gangster Squad
9:30 11:30
Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, and Nick Nolte star in Gangster Squad, an empty-headed exercise in old-Hollywood style. Lifting freely from noir and gangster traditions, Gangster Squad tries in vain to distract from its low ambition and ultimately comes across as a child’s dress-up production of Boardwalk Empire. The colors are impressive and it’s clear that the designers had a blast, but this might be the most skippable movie of the past year.
Silver Linings Playbook
9:30 12
Hailed by the Academy on many different fronts, especially acting, Silver Linings Playbook rode through the winter on a tidal wave of hype and found a receptive audience. David O. Russell (_The Fighter_) brings us the story of a bipolar schoolteacher (Bradley Cooper) who befriends a troubled widow (Jennifer Lawrence). The film is a well-choreographed piece of ensemble acting, with Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro delivering notable supporting performances. It poses some questionable ideas — essentially suggesting that mental illness can be cured by true love — but nonetheless encourages healthy debate.
Live and Become
9:30
A young Ethiopian boy is passed from his Christian birth mother to a Jewish woman whose child has recently died. Live and Become is the story of his upbringing in Israel and how he deals with his secret past. The French film won numerous international awards, including Most Popular International Film at the 2005 Vancouver International Film Festival, and explores race, religion, and identity in a multicultural world.

Junior biology and psychology double major Lindsay MacGillivray and sophomore international relations and politics and environmental policy double major Peter Masters will succeed senior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner and senior professional and creative writing double major Meela Dudley as student body president and student body vice president, respectively, for the next academic year.
MacGillivray and Masters won by a landslide, taking 72.64 percent of the vote over their opponents, junior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major Thomas Healy and junior business administration major Caitlin Jones, who garnered 24.39 percent of the vote according to the student government elections website. 
Jalen Poteat, a sophomore statistics major, was elected student body vice president for finance and junior psychology major Corinne Rockoff was elected student body vice president for organizations.
17.5 percent of the student body population participated in the student government elections; 29.85 percent of the undergraduate student body and 3.34 percent of the graduate student body voted.
MacGillivray and Masters hope to achieve their platform initiatives through their “ABC” program.
“A” stands for aided access, which includes extending communication between current and future leadership. 
“B” stands for bridging The Bridge, by focusing on organizations and creating a centralized events calendar. “C” stands for “CMU loves”; Macgillivray and Masters hope to implement initiatives that can improve student happiness and alleviate stress culture. 
They also plan on implementing more vegetarian options on campus, as that was one of the most requested suggestions from the student body.
“We’re looking to make CMU more fun, and in general, making sure more things are available on campus,” MacGillivray said.
MacGillivray and Masters hope to create an overall sense of school pride by connecting organizations. 
“There are also a lot of organizations that are proud of what they do, not necessarily CMU pride but like ‘Buggy pride’ or this pride or that pride. But we think that by connecting these organizations you can create this overall sense of CMU pride,” MacGillivray said.
Masters addressed the concern over a lack of campus unification, especially among separate schools, by proposing ways to continue the sense of bonding that first-years experience on campus.
“One of the biggest exceptions to the separation between schools is through freshman housing. But that sense of community disappears after your first year because everyone gets scattered the way the housing system is set up. So we want to establish more roots by trying to extend the network that emerges from freshman dorms,” he said.
When asked what he likes the most about Carnegie Mellon, Masters replied that the people are what he finds are the most inspiring.
“The CMU student that’s geeky and proud — in my book, that means passionate about something. CMU is filled with people who are driven about one thing or another,” he said.
MacGillivray agreed. “You can’t go a day here without engaging in a conversation with someone that’s incredibly inspiring. From the first-years that I work with to upperclassmen, everybody is doing something cool or has a crazy idea — something that they’re so invested in. That pushes me to also be driven and invested in this campus,” she said.

As part of a continuing investigation into the recent suspension of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity on campus, official statements from the local chapter and national organization of Beta Theta Pi have been released. 
It was also confirmed that the Carnegie Mellon University Andrew distribution list was utilized for the alleged circulation of explicit materials
.
An email sent by Panhellenic Council representitves to members of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority was anonymously forwarded to The Tartan. 
The email confirmed the suspension of Beta Theta Pi, as well as the explicit nature of the photos and videos, and that they were circulated on Beta’s distribution list.
Monica McGee, university coordinator of fraternity and sorority life, was cited in the email as having provided this information.
“Beta Theta Pi fraternity activity was suspended as they are currently under university and police investigation. This investigation is regarding photos of both men and women, explicit in nature, that have been circulated on their d-list,” read the email, which then went on to list resources for concerned sorority members to contact with questions or concerns about the issue.
President of Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Beta Theta Pi Robert Winkelman emailed the following statement to The Tartan: “Our chapter is cooperating with Carnegie Mellon University officials and law enforcement during the current investigation regarding the alleged activities of a few individual members within our chapter. The leadership in our chapter is continuing to collaborate both with University Police and university officials throughout this process.”
“Given the nature of the investigation - and due process and privacy rights that are to be afforded to all parties involved - we will reserve providing additional commentary until University Police and Carnegie Mellon University have both completed their efforts,” Winkelman said.
Martin Cobb, the director of communication for Beta Theta Pi fraternity, wrote in an email to The Tartan, “The fraternity supports the university’s position and recent statements, as we are working together collaboratively on this investigation.” 
“Given the nature of the investigation - and due process and privacy rights that are to be afforded all parties involved - the fraternity will reserve providing additional commentary until the University and General Fraternity have both completed their efforts,” the email continued.
Emails discussing the police investigation and the suspension of Beta Theta Pi were sent out by both Dean of Student Affiars Gina Casalegno and University President Jared Cohon two weeks ago. 
The university has declined to comment further on the incident.

What many students believed to be a fire in the lower levels of Doherty Hall last Wednesday evening turned out to be circulating sawdust emerging from the exhaust system in the building.
Fire engines and police cars were seen at the service road around 9 p.m. near the base of Doherty Hall and on Frew Street near Baker Hall. 
The building was evacuated and all events and meetings being held in the building for the evening were cancelled.
Although the smoke emanating from the building made the incident seem like a fire, it was later reported by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Pittsburgh city fire fighters found no fire in Doherty Hall. 
Deputy City Fire Chief Jerry Hirschfeld reported that the exhaust system in Doherty began circulating sawdust through the building. 
According to Matt Finlay, a junior creative writing major, the supposed fire interrupted a Carnival Committee meeting.
Nick Chisholm, a chemical engineering Ph.D. student, said, “I was in the building and we smelled smoke,” adding that he noticed a strange smell when he was grading papers in the upstairs portion of the building.
Daniel Campos Zamora, a sophomore art and psychology double major, saw what he believed to be smoke coming from the dust collection system of a CNC milling machine, which automates the milling of metal materials, on the C level of Doherty.
“There was the smell of something burning for a while, and we asked if we should pull the alarm,” Zamora said. 
He contacted campus security and was advised to sound the fire alarm.
The university has not released an official statement on the incident.

Carnegie Mellon received a record number of applications for the incoming class of 2017.
According to Director of Admission Michael Steidel, 18,879 applications were submitted, a 9 percent increase from the 17,313 applications sent in last year. A fewer number of students, however, were accepted. The total number of students admitted for the class of 2017 is at present only 4,662, down from the 4,807 at the end of last year. 
This is a 25 percent acceptance rate, which is lower than the 28 percent acceptance rate for the class of 2016. Wait-list activity is expected to begin after May 1.
“Applications to Carnegie Mellon rose to record levels again this season…making the selection process the most difficult and challenging in our history,” Steidel said. 
“We received so many great applications from the best candidates we’ve ever seen in our admission process. It has been difficult, at best, to choose from among so many talented young people.”
Steidel also noted that the average SAT scores of accepted students for the class of 2017 were all significantly above average. 
The average SAT math score was 750, while the average SAT critical reading and writing scores were slightly lower at 710 and 720, respectively. 
All average scores were higher than the previous year’s, which was 744 for SAT math, 706 for SAT critical reading, and 715 for SAT writing. 
Additionally, the average unweighted GPA was 3.82, an increase from 3.80 last year.
Sophomore mechanical engineering major Victor Naziazeni said, “It’s pretty cool. I always thought that CMU is an incredible school, and I feel that our acceptance rate puts us lower in the rankings than we deserve to be. So a drop in acceptance rate is something good for the school’s reputation.”
Fellow sophomore mechanical engineering major Gianfranco Colombi added, “I think these statistics just prove what hard workers we are to everyone else.”
Additionally, 47 percent of the recently admitted students are women, a slight increase from 46 percent last year. 
This is, however, a significantly higher percentage than that of the overall student body ratio of 57 percent male and 43 percent female.
There was also an increase in the percentage of international students admitted — 14 percent compared to 12 percent for the class of 2016. 
The same percentage, however, of under-represented ethnic minorities were admitted as last year — 16 percent.
“We’re extremely proud of the talents, abilities, character, and academic quality of those we chose to join us as freshmen next fall. We’re excited to learn who will ultimately make the decision to become a Tartan,” Steidel said.

“A Conversation with David McCormick,” a lecture hosted by the University Lecture Series, provided advice and career tips to a large crowd of students and faculty in Baker Hall’s Giant Eagle Auditorium last Monday. 
McCormick is the former U.S. Treasury under secretary for international affairs in the Bush administration and current co-president of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world.
Bridgewater Associates manages $130 billion, according to its website. McCormick fielded questions from Heinz College dean Ramayya Krishnan and, later in the talk, from the audience.
The event’s description gave an overview of McCormick’s career as “span[ning] both the public and private sectors, i.e. serving in the Army, working at McKinsey and as CEO of FreeMarkets, then the White House/Treasury, and now working at Bridgewater.” 
McCormick first attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and later earned a Ph.D. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. 
McCormick is also a Carnegie Mellon trustee, and is a distinguished service professor of public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College.
Krishnan led with a sweeping question, asking McCormick what he had learned from his varied experiences in different career fields.
“I feel like it’s this remarkable set of experiences you never could have planned,” McCormick said about his life so far. 
“The quality of the experience, the quality of the learning, the quality of the outcomes — whether they were good or bad — in all those instances was a byproduct really of two things: The people you were surrounding yourself with, and the culture of the place where you work.”
A major focus of the dialogue between Krishnan and McCormick was McCormick’s role in the United States Treasury during the financial crisis near the end of the Bush administration.
McCormick said that at the time, “It felt like you were in the middle of a highway, and you were just dodging cars.”
McCormick also discussed his career choices, particularly how he ended up at Bridgewater Associates after being in the army and working as under secretary of the treasury.
“There’s this unique culture at Bridgewater where they’re incredibly blunt. I ultimately went because I thought I would learn more than any other place I went,” McCormick said. 
He called Bridgewater Associates a “personal growth and evolution machine.”
Halfway through the event, McCormick began to take audience questions.
Sophomore international relations and politics and environmental policy double major and  incoming student body vice president Peter Masters asked McCormick the question, “What’s the legacy that you’ve left so far, and what legacy do you plan to leave?”
“I’ve been trying to think of the next 20 years based on that question,” McCormick said. “I think the way you should think about that is ‘is it fulfilling, is it enriching, are you living an interesting life, and are you making a difference?’”
“I thought it was really informative and there was some great insight on how to deal with people in the workplace and at school as well,” said Elizabeth Ottens, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major.
Senior materials science and engineering major Bianka Roy said that the lecture illuminated the “intricacies of being a leader in versatile fields, and just what it takes to succeed.”
McCormick finished his lecture by touching on the critical importance of personal growth and continued self-improvement throughout life.
“I’m more successful than I probably thought I was going to be, and now what? So, what is really driving this? That notion of personal growth and evolution has taken a greater weight, so where you want to spend your life? You want to spend it with people you really enjoy, people you can learn from. Do you want to be patted on the back every day, or do you want to be tested?”

Johan Verbeke, a professor from the Sint-Lucas School of Architecture (LUCA) in Belgium, presented the lecture “Developments in Higher Education in Europe and its impact on arts, architecture and design,” last Thursday in Porter Hall.
Verbeke served as the Head of the School at LUCA from 2003 to 2009. He noted that LUCA “at the moment has over 2,000 students, not only in architecture but also in design, so it’s one big entity.” 
The school is “very well known for having a strong design competence.” Verbeke has held various positions throughout his career, including project leader at the European Association of Architectural Education.
 Verbeke focused his lecture on developments in European higher education and the effects of those developments.
Student reaction to the lecture was positive. Liza Otto, a first-year Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student, said, “It was interesting to see him talk about how the whole system was reorganized.”
Verbeke spoke of the Bologna declaration, a major document created in June 1999 during the Bologna Process, which sought to enhance and clarify the qualifications and standards of Europe’s higher education process. 
“The declaration mainly was to put forward the system of two main cycles, where access to the second cycle requires completion of the first cycle. 
The first cycle has a minimum of three years, and completion of the first cycle should also be relevant to the European labor markets as an appropriate level of qualification. The second cycle should lead to the masters and doctoral degree in European countries.”
He noted that after the adoption of the Bologna declaration, the European Association for Architectural Evidence (EEAE), “came to the consensus that in order to enter the profession, at least five years of education is required. So it more or less neglects the requirement or advice to have a level of qualification of three years.” Years after the Bologna declaration, in 2005 Verbeke stated that three cycles of qualifications were established: “A basic bachelors degree of three years, then a more advanced master’s degree of two years, then a Ph.D. degree of two years, which stimulates time towards mastery of methods with the field and research efforts.”
He went on to say, “there are different levels to make scientific judgments: On the bachelor level it is gathering and interpreting relevant data, on the Master’s level it is the ability to deal with more advanced knowledge and complexity and formulate judgments on incomplete data, and on the Ph.D. level it is the capability of analysis and synthesis of complex ideas.” 
Particularly with the Ph.D. level, he noted that “students are expected to make original contributions … by developing a substantial body of research work. All is part of a movement which stimulates degree programs to formulate a list of learning projects in competence.”
Verbeke said that areas like arts, architecture, and design place more emphasis on research in their disciplines.
“All of Europe and these schools of art are setting up Ph.D. programs and developing doctoral schools and collaborations on research,” he said.
Verbeke also claims that funding for Ph.D. programs will be affected by this research output because it proves the worth of a Ph.D. 
“Getting a Ph.D. is seen as getting eight years of education that shows you really wanted to become an expert in the field … and will become necessary in the future to teach and for higher education in art and so on, which is clearly a change,” said Verbeke.
He noted other effects, including the creation of the Life Long Learning Program at the European Commission, which “creates commissions really stimulating mobility between universities. Students as well as staff are really stimulated to work together and learn together in research collaborations.” 
He praised collaboration between universities, saying “as an individual university, you will never be able to obtain this kind of research findings; you need to collaborate.”
Without much Ph.D. tradition in the arts, Verbeke felt “fields are not about the truth but exploring possibilities and making descriptions.” 
He believes that new types of knowledge are being encouraged, including tacit-knowledge, ineffective knowledge, implicit and explicit knowledge, embedded knowledge, and embodied knowledge that all focus on five sections: The problem, planning, field work, interpretation, and conclusions.
To Verbeke, architectural arts and design research have seen improved understandings brought on by the modified secondary education system. With more intensive research and collaboration, he contended that these particular fields have made knowledge much more valuable than before.

In light of the attention surrounding a student’s death last semester, campus members began to re-evaluate happiness at Carnegie Mellon.
In all majors and departments, stress is shrugged off, sleep is deemed unnecessary, and emotional problems are placed on the back burner — but it is imperative that students deal with these problems and are comfortable with the psychological services that Carnegie Mellon offers. After hearing different stories from those across campus overloaded with work and stressed to the max, we need to make the Carnegie Mellon community aware that yes, Houston, we have a problem.
In the wake of recent campus discussions and Town Hall meetings, Kurt Kumler, Ph.D. and Director of CAPS acknowledged, “The time is right to move forward.”
In January, along with junior creative writing major Colleen Casey, I was connected with Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) as part of a semester-long project, where we proposed products that CAPS could use to increase the visibility of the program and to reacquaint students with its services.
Our research — including a survey of Carnegie Mellon students, an analysis of data from other college campuses, and the creation of PowerPoint slides and interactive handouts — was partially driven by our own curiosity: Are students at Carnegie Mellon actually any different than students at other schools, as far as using mental health services? How much do students really know about where and how to find help on campus? Is there still a stigma about seeking counseling?
Nationally, only 10 percent of a college student body uses mental health services yearly, according to the Journal of American College Health. So the fact that CAPS sees 1,200 students annually out of 11,531 undergrad and graduate students is no cause for alarm; it mirrors the national average.
The 10 percent statistic seems low, however, in the case of Carnegie Mellon. The combination of a student body that is extraordinarily high achieving and that thrives on a level of extreme academic rigor is a formula for spontaneous combustion. It may not be an explosion in this case, but a quiet implosion that is just as harmful. There are a handful of students who may silently be crumbling — more who are crushed by stress around final exam periods. While the 10 percent statistic means that we are doing okay here at Carnegie Mellon, we really should hope for a higher figure.
But simply hoping students will get to CAPS isn’t enough. Through our research, we discovered that there are universities with demographics very similar to that of Carnegie Mellon, such as Emory University in Atlanta, that actively promote their mental health services through easy-to-navigate websites, providing contact information for students in crisis, screening tools for depression, and links to ongoing programs like stress clinics, as well as outside resources.
In analyzing the comments from the 119 respondents to our Facebook survey, we discovered that there were some students who reported that “it’s hard to get an appointment,” and a few who say CAPS “is a joke.” In general, though, Carnegie Mellon students know what CAPS means and how to get there. 
The average Carnegie Mellon student is at least moderately familiar with mental health issues — especially depression, anxiety, and eating disorders — and the majority refutes the myth that people who go to therapy are somehow “weak.” So what is really keeping more students from using the services?
At times our parents, peers, or professors think they are giving us comfort when they offer the old cliché, “Well, everyone is in the same boat.” At other times, we beat ourselves up with self-talk like, “If he or she can, then I should be able to.”
The student body here is extraordinarily high achieving; CAPS is on campus for a reason. Reaching for help or recognizing the need for support may seem like a sign of failure, but honestly, it’s the smartest thing a brilliant Carnegie Mellon student — like you or me — will ever do.

Student government elections concluded last Tuesday night, determining the student government executives and Senators for the upcoming academic year. While the debates for various student government executive positions were sparsely attended, voter turnout was higher than in previous years: Out of the undergraduate population, 30.01 percent of students voted, and 17.26 percent of the entire student body voted in this general election.
Growing undergraduate voter turnout for student government elections is a positive change for the student body, and hopefully it will continue to increase in the future. According to the student government website, undergraduate voter turnout for the spring student government general election increased 4.51 percent since 2011, with 25.5 percent voting in 2011 and 27.64 percent voting in 2012. Additionally, overall voter turnout has gone up 0.6 percent since 2011, with 16.65 percent voting in 2011 and a slight dip to 16.28 percent in 2012.
A trend of increasing interest in who represents the student body is a good thing; however, there is a large amount of room to grow.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, approximately 39 percent of undergraduates voted during their 2013 spring student body election, according to The Tech, the university’s student newspaper.
Student turnout at Carnegie Mellon could reflect a voting percentage that is close to that of other similar institutions if interest in the election process increases on campus.
Increasing student awareness of the elections through public relation efforts should be a priority for student government in the coming years. Utilizing social media and other mediums to connect to students would be ideal to encourage greater student voter turnout.
The increase in voter participation among undergraduate students indicates that students are becoming more invested in who their representatives are and their college experience.
However, student voter turnout can mirror other university’s elections with new candidate campaigns that reach students and make them aware of the significance of elections.

Three years after its passing, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — commonly referred to as Obamacare — is just as bad of a law as Republicans always thought it would be. When the bill passed, President Obama laid out three criteria that it would fill. First, if you like your insurance, you can keep it. Second, premiums will decrease by about $2,500 per family. Lastly, it won’t add a penny to the deficit.
Obamacare fails to keep all three promises. According to a study by the University of Chicago, over half of the individual insurance plans on the market right now don’t meet the standards for basic coverage that Obamacare sets.
This means that if you’re a young, single individual, you can’t buy an insurance plan that just covers catastrophic care. You need a plan with all the bells and whistles that Obamacare mandates; think of it as a car insurance policy that covers gasoline costs and routine maintenance. Single catastrophic care insurance buyers won’t get to keep their insurance, even if they like it.
As for Obamacare’s second promise of affordability, recent study by the Society of Actuaries found that medical claim costs — the largest driver of health insurance premiums — are expected to increase by 32 percent nationwide, and over 80 percent in some states like Ohio.
This happens because more sick people are joining the pool of the insured, as they can’t be turned away now and can't be charged a higher rate than a healthy person. Plans for healthy people will increase to match the cost of sick people.
Combined with the issue of health insurance, this creates incentives for healthy people to not pay for insurance until they get sick and then sign up for a plan that covers their ailments. The only penalty for doing this is a fine that costs much less than actual insurance. This also drives up costs for people who have and need insurance — like those with pre-existing conditions — whom the law supposedly protects.
This market distortion makes health insurance expensive. Premiums are projected to rise 6.3 percent this year, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, and show no signs of slowing down.
Despite including the largest tax hike in American history, Obamacare still adds $6.2 trillion to our long term deficits, according to the Government Accountability Office. The bill was advertised to the American public as deficit neutral by cutting Medicare payments to doctors — to the point that no doctors would take Medicare. Because of this situation, Congress passed the Doc Fix, which extends the current rate of Medicare payments. Congress will probably pass this bill every time it expires, and Obamacare will add tons of money to the deficit.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) famously said, “We have to pass the bill to find out what’s in it.” We passed the bill three years ago. We know what’s in it, and it’s terrible. It’s time to repeal this bill and have a serious debate about what will actually fix our far-from-perfect healthcare system.

Spring Carnival is just around the corner, meaning that the campus’ biggest concert of the year is also almost here.
This year, AB Concerts booked Ludacris to entertain students, but less than three weeks before the concert — on April 3 — Ludacris cancelled. On April 5, less than 48 hours after Ludacris’s cancellation, AB concerts announced that Lupe Fiasco would be performing instead of their original artist.
The student body should commend AB Concerts for booking a replacement act on such short notice for one of Carnival’s main events.
While AB Concerts could have booked an artist of lesser caliber than Ludacris, they were able to secure an artist who is arguably more relevant than Ludacris. Ludacris’s most popular song on iTunes, “How Low,” was released on December 8, 2009, while Lupe Fiasco’s most popular song on iTunes, “The Show Goes On”, was released almost a year later on October 26, 2010.
“The Show Goes On” also ended 2010 at 28 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, while “How Low” ended 2009 at 36 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, meaning that “The Show Goes On” was more popular during its release year than “How Low” was.
It must also be pointed out that Ludacris prominently features in other artists’ songs, but does not often release his own songs, making him largely popular for the songs he is featured in. However, Ludacris cannot perform these songs during a solo concert.
Student interest also seems to be higher for Lupe Fiasco than it was for Ludacris, with many students expressing more excitement towards AB’s second choice, based on the feedback on AB’s Facebook page.
Spring Carnival Concert is an event that many students look forward to throughout the year. AB Concerts has a large task on its hands to choose an artist that is affordable, yet exciting to the student body.
With such short notice to book an acceptable artist, AB Concerts has found someone who may please more students than the original artist planned.

When I came to America from RWTH Aachen University in Germany for a year abroad, most of my expectations for Carnegie Mellon were met. I was amazed by how much time and effort Carnegie Mellon put into organizing events for incoming students and introducing them to their new environment. After the first two years in Germany, where I felt like one out of many, the warm welcome at Carnegie Mellon was a nice change. However, as the semester progressed, I got a more realistic image of what studying in America was really like and I realized that there is also room to improve here. Away from home, I recognized the strengths of my home university.
In America, I started to appreciate the freedom that every student is given at RWTH Aachen University. While it is true that in Germany problem sets come up each week, and it is a good idea to do work during the semester, you can decide to what extent you want to study the material. Since your grade does not depend on submitted homework, it is less likely to see students staying up all night to finish problem sets. That makes it more likely for people to appreciate the world outside of the university, since they have more time to do so. In Germany, it is more likely for people to join clubs that are not affiliated with the university.
Furthermore, a day off at RWTH makes one feel less guilty because there are no immediate consequences of unfinished work. Having the discipline to catch up on material that one has not yet understood is crucial to succeeding in the German system. With one year of Carnegie Mellon experience under my belt, comprehensive final exams worth 100 percent of course grades will not scare me much anymore. The stress at RWTH University during the semester is not as immediate as in America. Carnegie Mellon has made me familiar with what stress really means.
While I appreciate the campus culture at Carnegie Mellon, it is amazing how much time students spend on campus daily. Unsurprisingly, one day a friend’s smartphone attempted to relocate his home address to 5000 Forbes Ave.
Working in a university environment and being around people with similar passions foster ideas. Yet, this constant proximity to peers contributes to the much-quoted stress culture at Carnegie Mellon. It might sound simplistic, but leaving campus can make one understand that there is more out there than grades and research success. 
That said, I admire how much Carnegie Mellon is already doing to relieve the pressure. Skiing and paintball trips help, but at the end of the day, students often do not take advantage of those offers; work piles up too quickly.
While in America, a valuable skill I was taught at home also became apparent: self-motivation. The professors who I started my academic career with never gave many instructions. Offering the resources for students to succeed in their studies, professors at RWTH did not interfere much in learning course material. Especially for first-year students, this freedom feels unnatural. However, being thrown in at the deep end teaches students how to overcome obstacles. For many students, this freedom coincides with them leaving their parents’ house, causing adult life to start very abruptly.
Carnegie Mellon follows quite a different paradigm. Giving more guidelines on how to attack problems, professors demand more work. I was irritated when a professor banned collaboration on certain problem sets. While the benefit of specified collaboration was apparent to me, I saw this practice impinging on my freedom. From my current standpoint, the German system is less protective and wants its students to learn what works by themselves. Undoubtedly, university graduates will be asked open-ended questions in their professional lives. Being self-sufficient will then be invaluable.
Another interesting difference between RWTH and Carnegie Mellon is grading. Today, I know that the grading system back home is hard but fair. In Aachen, I often complained about how hard it was to get an A. As I hoped to finally see better test grades, I was looking forward to my exchange year in America. In Germany, past exams handed out by professors clearly show what is expected. Even though it is hard to admit, the test results are closely related to how well you understand the material. It becomes apparent to every student where he or she stands in comparison to their peers. If a whole class at RWTH underperforms on a test, there is no curve to make everyone look better. Professors only curve exams when the percentage of people failing the exam is too high, not when too few people get A’s.
In most Carnegie Mellon courses, professors seem to have guidelines concerning what percentage of students must finish with A’s. That makes some courses impossible to fail. I even heard of an exam where a zero was cureved to a C. To me, that seems incredible and self-deceiving. Another downside of Carnegie Mellon’s grading system is that suddenly, helping your peers becomes detrimental to your own grade. 
Luckily, most of the people I have met here are exceptional both in their academic performance and in their willingness to help. However, the fact remains that your grade may depend on whether or not you outperform your friends.
Juxtaposing both systems, it becomes apparent that American and German universities each have individual strengths and weaknesses.
This article is the second in a series detailing the realizations of an exchange student at Carnegie Mellon.

Around a quarter of the detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have been on a hunger strike since last month to protest the search of their copies of the Qur’an and their indefinite detentions, according to The Washington Post.
The general public’s reaction has been underwhelming. Like other news regarding Guantanamo over the last few years, there has been little coverage of the strike in the media.
Some Americans love to complain about government overreach — a product of the fear that big government will turn America into a socialist state. The sources of their complaints have included bans on large sodas, expansive background checks for guns, and government czars of all shapes and sizes. But what about the gulag that the U.S. government runs off the coast of Cuba?
Some people may feel that because something doesn't affect them, they shouldn't be concerned about it.
But just because something doesn’t directly impact you doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be concerned. Consider the rape in Steubenville, Ohio of a high school girl by two football players.
Even though it only affected a few people, many people throughout the nation voiced their concern, fearing that if the case were left unnoticed, there would be a long-term, negative impact on societal attitudes toward rape and sexual abuse. Our sense of justice and awareness of injustice sustain the law. At the same time, ignorance can have harmful effects.
Guantanamo sets a dangerous precedent for future conduct by the U.S. government in “fighting terrorism.” The newest version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) allows for indefinite detention of American citizens without due process. Attorney General Eric Holder declared in March that it would be legal for the president to order drone attacks on U.S. citizens, according to The Huffington Post.
Other people may believe that the people in Guantanamo Bay are all terrorists anyway.
But that’s not true. Of the 166 prisoners, 86 have been cleared of charges but have yet to be released, according to The New Yorker. Furthermore, only a handful of detainees have actually been tried and found guilty. In 2011, WikiLeaks released several documents showing that a great number of the prisoners held were not actually security threats, but were simply detained to extract intelligence, according to The Guardian.
It’s been 10 years since the establishment of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. For over a decade, prisoners have been locked up and tortured — most of them without formal charges, according to the documents leaked to The Guardian.
That our government is conducting this kind of senseless cruelty should be a concern to anyone who is wary of “big government.” Hitler did not take over half of Europe by limiting the amount of sugar in soft drinks. Stalin did not maintain a culture of fear in the Soviet Union by increasing taxes by 1 percent in eight years. 
If our complaints reflect our true concerns, we should be very worried. America, it’s time to rethink our priorities.

At a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colo. on July 20, James Eagan Holmes killed 12 people and injured 58 others during a mass shooting. Holmes, dressed in a costume alluding to the Batman villain the Joker, set off tear gas grenades and shot into the audience with multiple firearms. His advance purchase of the guns and ammunition, as well as his chosen targets and costume, raised lingering questions over his sanity.
Prosecutors recently announced that they would seek the death penalty against Holmes. As there is the lingering question of Holmes’s mental state, and the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. could not execute the mentally ill in Atkins v. Virginia, people will have to wait until well after February 2014 — when his trial is scheduled for — to see if the prosecutors' requests will be met.
Even though Holmes altered several people’s fates, the state of Colorado — as well as the Federal government — should not administer the death penalty, as it does more harm than good. Some people want Holmes to suffer the death penalty. However, a life in exchange for the lives lost would be stooping to his level.
Holmes probably knew that he could have died during his violent attack, but he did not. Death is not his worst fear. Instead of the death penalty, Holmes should serve a life-sentence in prison without parole. It is better for Holmes to live there for the rest of his life so that he can deal with the guilt of his violent actions. In prison, Holmes’ freedom is gone forever and he cannot harm anyone else. Additionally, according to The Economist, “administering the death penalty is even more expensive than keeping someone in prison for life.”
On average, a death row inmate spends at least 12 years in prison before death, according to USA Today. Thus, Holmes’ name will occasionally come on the news while he waits for execution if the prosecutors’ ultimate goal for Holmes is the death penalty.
Even more importantly, having Holmes’ name rarely appear in the news if he is in prison for the rest of his life will benefit the emotional health of families affected by the massacre and victims themselves.
On the other hand, extensive coverage will force families who lost loved ones and victims who were injured that night to relive the event. Particularly, if Holmes goes to the execution phase, the media will cover every detail of his life, from his last meal to how he will be killed. This media coverage will affect the families of victims, which is not beneficial for any of them emotionally.
By taking all of this into consideration, imposing the death penalty on Holmes is not worth it for society, especially for the victims and families affected by the tragedy he created.

North Korea formally threatened the United States with nuclear missile strikes on April 3 and moved a missile to the country’s eastern coast. Because the missile is only capable of travelling 2,500 miles, according to CNN, a nuclear attack would not be able to reach America’s western states, including Alaska and Hawaii, and therefore would not be able to harm citizens. However, an attack could reach U.S. naval and air bases in Japan and Guam.
North Korea asserted that it would directly target these U.S. bases, as well as the nation itself in the future. In response, the U.S. announced the dispatch of ballistic missile defenses to Guam.
Despite the increasing threat from North Korea, many U.S. news outlets have failed to adequately report these developments. Instead of making coverage of the situation prominent, media outlets chose to cover other less important material.
North Korea’s declaration of approved missile strikes barely made its way to the front page of The New York Times on April 4, the day after the declaration was made. A four-line preview of an article titled “A Reaction to North Korea” was the only indicator on the page that North Korea’s threat was even made.
Stories that took precedence over coverage of North Korea in the April 4 issue of The New York Times include "As Web Search Goes Mobile, Apps Chip at Google's Lead," an article about how Google is losing its Internet traffic to mobile applications.
The front page of the Los Angeles Times  also lacked coverage of North Korea’s threats on April 4. The newspaper chose to entice readers with stories about The Tonight Show and a couple’s fight to prove their marriage instead. The case was no different for the Chicago Tribune.
Because people’s opinions and interests are often swayed by the media, news outlets must more accurately portray North Korea’s threats, as well as the U.S.’s responses, to their readers. While the threats are not immediately dangerous, citizens must be properly educated about this issue, which has the potential to evolve into a larger conflict. The media’s job is to provide its audience with the information that most directly affects them; a threat of war to the nation affects millions and is no joke, especially when the threat involves nuclear weapons. 
If the United States government is taking the threat seriously, so should the media.
