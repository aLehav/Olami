The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team continued to step up its game during the past two weeks.
After losing their first University Athletic Association (UAA) game to Washington University in St. Louis, the Tartans have come back strong, winning their past two games against the University of Chicago and the University of Rochester.
In the Oct. 9 game against Chicago, the Tartans battled ferociously as the defense was strong on both teams. Although the Maroons outshot the Tartans, Carnegie Mellon goalie sophomore Anna Albi held strong, allowing zero goals by the other team. This led to her fourth shutout of this season. The one goal of the game was made by Carnegie Mellon first-year Savina Reid.
This key 1–0 victory for the Tartans put them at 1–1 in UAA play. The game became No. 19 University of Chicago’s first loss of the season.
This past Friday, the Tartans hit the road to take on the Rochester Yellowjackets.The Yellowjackets went into the game 2–0 in the UAA, compared to the Tartans’ 1–1. While the Yellowjackets scored first, the Tartans countered with a corner kick by  sophomore Rachel Contopoulos, converted into a goal by Reid, making it her fourth goal of the season, in the 34th minute. 
The second goal came from first-year Lucy Haevens. Not only was this Haevens’ first goal, but it also put the Tartans in the lead 2–1, a lead the team held for the rest of the game.
Again, Albi was a major contributor, collecting five saves at the goal. The victory put the Tartans at 2–1 in UAA play.
The Tartans took on No. 22 Case Western Reserve University yesterday, losing 2–0 in Cleveland.

Despite the lack of varsity hockey at Carnegie Mellon, the Tartans do take the ice as a club team. After a very promising season in 2010–11, with the Tartans making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, the team has continued to build on that success in the beginning of the 2011–12 season.
At a record of 4–0–2, the Tartans have recorded 10 points of a possible 12. The Tartans split their two games this weekend, beating Case Western Reserve University and falling to California University of Pennsylvania.
On Friday, Oct. 14, the Tartans faced the Spartans of Case Western as the visiting team. When the buzzer sounded after three periods, the Tartans were victorious, 3–1. 
First-year goaltender Gilbert Xue was the superstar in this match with 28 saves. The Tartans’ three goals came from senior captain and first-line center Chaten Boscha, junior first-line left winger Andrew McCoy, and senior first-line right winger Ephraim Hathaway.
On Saturday the Tartans took on the California University Vulcans at home. The first period was scoreless. Boscha scored early in the second period, but five minutes later, the Vulcans tied the game with a goal of their own.
Neither team would score again until late in the third period. With only a minute and 20 seconds left in the game, the Vulcans found the back of the net to take a 2–1 lead. With just seven seconds remaining, Boscha scored the clutch goal that sent the game into overtime. The five minutes of overtime were scoreless, so this one went to a shootout. The Tartans did not score, while the Vulcans scored twice to secure the overtime victory.
The Tartans were plagued with injuries, and after sophomore defenseman Kevin Fulton was ejected for a game misconduct — where he checked an opponent whose head was down — the Tartans only had two healthy defenders left.
“We battled through injuries, forwards switched back to defense, [senior goaltender] Torrey [Brenner] was unbelievable, and everyone gave everything they had,” said sophomore second-line center Mike Purowitz.
This hot start by the Tartans is a good sign for their goal to achieve a playoff berth for the second consecutive year. The players, however, are looking to do more than just make the playoffs.
Boscha spoke on the team’s goals this season. “We’ve started the season 4–0–2, which is the team’s best start in 14 years. But I think I speak for the entire team when I say we will be happy with nothing less than a championship.”

Billy Littlefield started his first cross country season in the sixth grade back in 2002, but he did not really take running seriously until his sophomore year of high school. “All the other sports required too much maneuvering and coordination; I like the simplicity of running,” Littlefield said.
Littlefield is a materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major. After graduation, Littlefield is looking to take a year off before attending graduate school. During this time, he wants to do something interesting, such as hiking the Appalachian Trail or wandering around Europe.
Littlefield enjoys being on the cross country team for many reasons. “The team is a really goofy, enthusiastic, and friendly bunch of guys and girls,” he said. 
Besides the team’s camaraderie, Littlefield finds that being on the cross country team helps him cope with school. “It’s nice to be able to put all my problem sets, midterms, and labs off to the side for a couple of hours each day and focus on something entirely different, especially with such a fun team,” he said. Littlefield looks forward to going to practice daily. “I’m continually glad I decided to keep running in college,” he said.
Littlefield is especially proud of his performance in the annual Carnegie Mellon Invitational, which is held in Schenley Park. “I ran [eight kilometers in] 26:37 and came in third for the team, which I was pretty pumped about.” 
He was not only excited about his performance but also his teammates’ performances. “Knowing that I contributed to the team score [top five] is always exciting, and we had a great pack of guys all come in pretty close together, which bodes well for the future of the season,” Littlefield said.
Sometimes the cross country men like to have a little fun on their runs. “We occasionally like to puzzle other joggers or walkers when we pass them on the trail. [We’ll say] ‘Good morning!’ at 5 p.m., speed-walking by them at a 6:30 mile pace,” Littlefield said.
Littlefield has one goal for the rest of the 2011 cross country season: “To keep running the best that I can with this great group of guys, so that we can make it back to nationals and do some damage!”

Earlier this summer, much of sports nation focused on one thing: the NFL lockout. Now that the NFL is back in business, it seems as if the “other” lockout has gone overlooked by many. I’m talking about the NBA lockout — you know, the one that has the first two weeks of the regular season already canceled. Given that the NBA is considering canceling the whole season, why hasn’t this lockout gotten any publicity whatsoever in the media?
I understand that the NBA does not have as great a following as the NFL, but since it is one of America’s four major sports organizations, I feel that some people actually care. However, I think the problem with the NBA lockout is that it doesn’t seem like the players care. All this talk about playing overseas has made the fans think that the players would almost rather play in places like China, Turkey, and Italy. In fact, a ton of players have already signed to play overseas, such as Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili — even Kobe Bryant has considered taking his talents overseas.
Not only are there games overseas, but there are also private league games that stars such as Kevin Durant have played on street corners and in gyms across the country. These leagues, some of which are run by celebrities, most notably the famous rapper “The Game,” have brought the superstars even closer to the fans and have been sources of amazing entertainment. Durant scored over 60 points in one of these scrimmages, and the Bulls youngster, John Lucas III, put up over 50 points in a game. 
This is “street” basketball at its best, with the best talents returning to the place where they learned basketball to put on a show. As if this weren’t enough, a game featuring Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, and other superstars, organized by Anthony, was just played, and it was a great success.
Another huge reason the NBA lockout doesn’t seem like a big deal is because it is nowhere close to being resolved. It is such a big deal that both sides won’t compromise, and it almost seems impossible that they will get this season underway. 
Apparently, the owners have been offering a deal that is nowhere close to the compensation that the players normally get, which is around 57 percent of basketball-related revenues. For much of last year, the owners complained that a majority of teams actually lost money during the NBA season, which I believe is false.
It’s clear that the owners are simply milking information in order to maximize their own profits, with no care for what the fans think about the league.
Adding to the problem is the fact that David Stern, the NBA commissioner, does not know how to handle the situation. Throughout the past three to four months, Stern has done nothing but add fuel to the fire by attacking the players and openly stating that the two sides are far from compromise. As if this were not enough, Stern has been setting deadlines for the two sides, but by the time the deadlines came, he had done very little to make enoughprogress to avoid the cancellation of games.
It is almost as if this thing is a huge joke, and Stern has no control over what is going on. We know it’s a sad day when the supposed leader of the league has no power.
All in all, we’re looking at a year in which we have no basketball, and while many of you probably do not care, it’s still a huge loss of entertainment to a good portion of society. I’m not sure what I’ll do in early May when I can’t root against Lebron James and the hated Miami Heat. On the bright side,  I won’t have to choose between watching the NFL, NHL, and NBA, since those games won’t overlap.

The National Football League season has had an unpredictable start this year. Before the season started, if you had told me that at week five the Detroit Lions would be undefeated, the Philadelphia Eagles would be pretty much eliminated from the playoffs, and that the San Francisco 49ers would have a winning record, I would have thought you had amnesia and thought it was the ’90s again.
But alas, Lions quarterback Matt Stafford is an MVP candidate, leading his team to a ferocious season’s start. Sure, the Lions faced some of the bottom-tier teams, such as the Kansas City Chiefs and the Minnesota Vikings. But they did beat the up-and-coming Tampa Bay Buccaneers on opening day, and then the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears in weeks four and five.
The deadly combination of Stafford and wide receiver Calvin Johnson has made the Lions’ offense very potent. Stafford boasts the sixth-best passer rating (101.4), third-most touchdowns thrown (13), and eighth-most yards per game (287) in the league. He is a leading candidate in the early MVP race along with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Green Bay Packers quarterback  Aaron Rodgers. Combine those numbers with Johnson’s receiving statistics, who’s been the best receiver in the NFL this season. He has four more touchdown receptions than any other receiver at nine, and is fifth in receiving yards with 451.
The young Lions team was bound to break out of its shell eventually, with the dynamic offense backed by a powerful defense led by the monstrous defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. The Detroit fans deserve some success for their football franchise after what seems like an abysmal last two decades, and a winless season in 2008.
What really has me puzzled is the success of the 49ers. Niners, you had your prosperous years with Joe Montana and Steve Young through the ’80s and ’90s; let someone else have a turn. 
But lo and behold, quarterback Alex Smith has led this squad to an unforeseen start. Through the balance of their run game, with Frank Gore, and a passing game with wide receivers Michael Crabtree and Josh Morgan, and tight end Vernon Davis, they have been able to attack some of the league’s top defenses in a variety of ways. They have downed the Buccaneers, the surprisingly awful Philadelphia Eagles (who I will get to), and the Cowboys. But with injuries to starting nose guard Isaac Sopoaga and Morgan in last week’s game against the Bucs, only time will tell if they can maintain this hot start.
Now to the topic that will please the vast majority of NFL fans, with the small minority being their fans: the unpredicted mediocrity of the Eagles. After having the most successful offseason of any NFL team, signing quarterback Michael Vick to a long-term contract, and picking up pro-bowl cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, the Eagles developed a villainous identity, while being the favorite to win a Super Bowl. Now, at 1–4, making the playoffs would be a stretch.
Vick has been an interception machine, with seven already this season. And the defense is abysmal at stopping the run, at 30th in the league in run defense, with 140.2 opponent rushing yards per game. In post-game interviews, you can see how frustrated Vick and head coach Andy Reid are with the lack of success this year.
A players-only meeting was called after last week’s loss to the Buffalo Bills. But given how little time this team has spent in its current construction, I believe that a players meeting with players who do not know each other very well can only end badly. They do not know what makes one another tick and it will most likely end in a slew of accusations. As a member of the previously mentioned majority, I hope this is the case, and that this is the beginning of the Eagles’ demise.
These unforeseen events have been at the forefront of NFL fans’ minds and analysts’ reports through the early parts of this season. If you haven’t noticed, the Bills are in first at 4–1 and the New York Jets are surprisingly unsatisfactory at 2–3. Quarterback Tim Tebow has already replaced Kyle Orton as the starter for the Denver Broncos, and the Indianapolis Colts have proven that Peyton Manning is the most important player in NFL history, as his absence has led them to an 0–5 start after a 10–6 season last year with virtually the same team (but with a healthy Manning of course). Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has been equally electrifying as he has been mediocre, and Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork has two interceptions, more than most secondary defenders. This season has been anything but predictable.
There were some exciting matchups in week six, such as the Lions vs. the 49ers, the Bucs vs. the New Orleans Saints, the New York Giants vs. the Bills, and the Patriots vs. the Cowboys. Hopefully you guys put on your hometown jerseys, ordered a pizza, put off your homework, and enjoyed some regular season football while it’s here.

Finalists for the RoboBowl competition gathered last Thursday at the Posner Center before a panel of judges to determine whose robot would be the winner of a $20,000 first-place prize. For someone unfamiliar with the competition, “RoboBowl” may conjure up images of robotic fighting matches a la BattleBots. Think again.
RoboBowl is a series of robotics venture competitions meant to “find and foster start-up and early-stage companies seeking to develop ‘big idea’ products and services” that meet new needs, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release — very different from BattleBots indeed. The focus of RoboBowl Pittsburgh, the first in the RoboBowl competition series, was on robots designed for health care and quality of life.
As a result of the local hosting, both Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon were well represented in the competition: Three of the five finalists were startup companies hailing from Pittsburgh, while the other two teams were from Highland Park, N.J., and Mountain View, Calif. Additionally, one of the members of RescueBotics, the Mountain View team, is a Carnegie Mellon graduate student in robotics.
The winner of the competition was Interbots, a company made up almost entirely of Carnegie Mellon graduates from the entertainment technology and human-computer interaction programs. The team’s winning design, “Popchilla,” was a toy robot designed to help children with autism.
“We hope to leverage the connection children with [autism] have with robots,” Interbots CEO Seema Patel said during her presentation at RoboBowl. 
According to Patel, recent research shows that autistic children have an easier time interacting with robots than with humans. Think of Popchilla as a technologically sophisticated puppet: Parents and therapists can speak through Popchilla remotely, allowing them to interact and guide children through activities. 
Autism treatment with Popchilla can evolve over time through software that allows users to update Popchilla’s expressions and character, which can also be tailored to the personality and age of the child. Interbots plans to develop robots for educational and toy applications in the future, Patel said.
The other Pittsburgh-based finalists were TactSense Technologies and Origami Robotics. TactSense is a surgical robotics company whose instruments relay tactile information to a surgeon’s hands during remote-controlled surgery. The company, a spin-off from research at the University of Pittsburgh, was the competition runner-up. Origami Robotics submitted “MeMote” for the competition, a robot designed for autism therapy like Interbots’ Popchilla.
“Therapeutic robots right now exist almost solely in academic labs,” said Aubrey Shick of Origami, who is a Carnegie Mellon alumna. These existing therapeutic robots are well out of the price range for home use. However, MeMote, priced at $200, would be affordable for many families. “[Autistic children’s] parents historically are first adopters of new technologies and therapies,” Shick said.
All teams reaching the final round received $5,000, with the winner receiving an additional $20,000. For small start-up companies, small cash prizes can be crucial for the first stages of turning grand ideas into reality.
RoboBowl is organized by the Innovation Accelerator (IA) and the Robotics Technology Consortium (RTC), two organizations attempting to promote American technological innovation. IA provides funding assistance for start-up and mid-stage technology ventures across many disciplines and applications. RTC is an industry group that advocates for robotics development for use by the Department of Defense and other government agencies.
This article was edited on Oct. 17 to correct the estimated price of the MeMote. It is $200, not $500.

Carnegie Mellon’s recent history of research on geoengineering provided an interesting backdrop for visiting professor James Fleming’s lecture, titled “Fixing the Sky,” this past Thursday. Fleming touched on various geoengineering issues discussed in his book, Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control.
Fleming, professor and director of Science, Technology, and History at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, spoke to a public audience in Porter Hall about climate geoengineering’s past, status quo, and possible future. Climate geoengineering, the deliberate modification of the Earth system in an attempt to counter the effects of climate change, has been heavily researched as part of Carnegie Mellon’s NSF-funded Climate Decision Making Center (CDMC), which collaborates with a number of other universities around the world.
“Both because we may need it in an emergency, and because geoengineering is something a nation might start doing unilaterally, the time has come to undertake a transparent and globally coordinated program of research,” Granger Morgan, head of the department of engineering and public policy and director of the CDMC, said in a 2009 university press release.
Fleming began the lecture by stating his own definition of scientific research as “the cutting edge of ignorance.” After a short pause and a few chuckles from the audience, he explained that he believes that some scientists may let their overbearing enthusiasm affect their logical, big-picture way of thinking about their research. “Quite a few people fall into the category that I call ‘sincere but deluded scientists’ — that is, they are pathologically enthusiastic about their research, but not able to really rein in their enthusiasm,” Fleming said.
Social, historical, humanistic, and ethical concerns with geoengineering were not widely considered until very recently, Fleming told the audience, as he reviewed the history of climate geoengineering and how people have been discussing and attempting to modify the Earth’s atmosphere for quite a long time.
One of the many examples of historical climate engineering Fleming discussed was the idea of injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere in order to increase the reflection of sunlight back into outer space and cool the Earth. The proposal of such an act, he explained, was highly motivated by the global cooling that resulted after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, which sent ash and other particles high into the stratosphere. 
However, Fleming warned that such a “man-made volcano” may have adverse side effects, such as stopping the Indian monsoon or causing severe drought in Africa, both of which also occurred after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Given all of the geoengineering ideas proposed throughout history, Fleming argued, “You’re changing the way people relate with nature, and you’re doing it by a small group in power imposing this idea on the world. How do you gain consensus like that?”
What the geoengineering field needed to be, Fleming said, was what he referred to as “the Three ‘I’s: international, interdisciplinary, intergenerational.” The people discussing these ideas need to be from a diverse group in order to provide a more balanced look into the future.
Fleming’s lecture sparked curious discussion within the audience. “I think Fleming reminds us that recent talk about geoengineering as a way to avoid a climate disaster is not the first time that it has been proposed or tried,” said Kevin Brown, a Ph.D. student in the history department. “In those earlier endeavors, the hubris of the scientists, and anti-democratic means in which these projects were developed and implemented, I believe, should give us serious pause before we consider attempting them on an even greater scale.”

Imagine that after getting ready for another workday, your phone, in your pocket, senses your departure and locks all of the entrances to your house for you. Simultaneously, your phone unlocks  the driver’s-side door of your car. Before heading to work, you decide to stop by a Starbucks first, and at the register, you pay for your coffee by briefly waving your phone in front of the cash register. When you finally make it to your job, your boss receives a notification on his or her phone that you just entered the building. Sounds like fantasy? In fact, all of the above is primed to become reality very soon. In fact, to some extent, it already is, thanks to a new technology called near-field communication (NFC).
Actually, NFC isn’t entirely new. It’s based on radio frequency technologies that have been around since the 1980s, though the recent actions companies like Google are taking to promote NFC are making it a hot-trending topic in the world of technology. In fact, you may already have heard the term thrown around before as a contact-less payment solution, which the wireless protocol allows for. However, as described above, NFC technology has the potential to change almost every aspect of people’s lives.
At its core, NFC is essentially another wireless technology that allows two devices to securely communicate with each other over short distances. The difference between NFC and more familiar wireless transfer protocols like Bluetooth is that NFC requires no pairing or passkeys of any kind, is extremely reliable, and allows for connections between devices to be made much faster — in less than a tenth of a second, to be precise.
To achieve these feats, NFC employs an electrical engineering concept called inductive coupling, in which a conductive material passes through an electric field, creating an electric current. So when an NFC-capable phone, for example, comes close enough to a magnetic field-emitting NFC device, the resulting current signals that a connection should be made between the two objects. Data carried by wireless radio waves is then passed to-and-fro within the magnetic field.
Perhaps the most important feature of NFC lies in its “tags.” NFC tags are essentially small stickers with NFC microchips embedded within them. They can store up to 512 bytes of data, can be placed just about anywhere (on posters or items in a store), cost cents on the dollar to manufacture, and — because of the passive nature of inductive coupling —  they require no power whatsoever. Perhaps their biggest advantage is that, unlike bar codes, QR codes, or other wireless tag technologies (like RFIDs) that can only send information, NFC tags are rewritable. Not too fond of that new cereal brand at Giant Eagle? Users can hover their phone over the cereal box and write an in-store review. Other shoppers will then be able to scan the cereal box and immediately be given a list of the most recent reviews for that item.
“NFC truly enables the long-predicted ‘internet of things,’ changing how we interact with the world in subtle but pervasive ways,” said Adam Blum, an adjunct professor at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley campus.
NFC may be very prevalent in our future lives. Google already employs the technology in its flagship Nexus S Android smartphone, which comes with a “Google Wallet” app that allows users to pay with their phones in stores where NFC is supported. IHS iSuppli, an electronics market research agency, estimates that almost 200 million NFC-equipped cell phones will be shipped over the next two years, and that by 2015, over 30 percent of all cell phones shipped will be NFC-enabled. Both Visa and MasterCard are pushing for future NFC initiatives, so a phone can quite literally become a credit card... and then some.

Toddlers learn to share at early age
A toddler’s selfishness can be distinguished by 15 months of age, researchers at the University of Washington found. A test group of 47 toddlers was shown two videos: one with food distributed evenly between two people and another with food unevenly distributed. Researchers recorded the toddlers’ relative attentiveness during the videos, indicating which video they were more surprised with. Of the infants who appeared unsurprised by an even food distribution, 92 percent displayed altruistic behavior. In the same vein, infants who were surprised by an uneven food distribution were more likely to behave selfishly, showing an unwillingness to share their favorite toys.

Women found to leave science early
Roughly 50 percent of women in science, engineering, and other technology fields quit their jobs in their mid- to late-30s. A study at Harvard University found that there are five reasons for this mass exodus of highly trained female employees: hostile workplace culture, isolation, differing “work rhythms,” difficulty of balancing household responsibilities with demanding jobs, and uncertainty in promotion. This sudden dropout rate is one of the reasons that, though 41 percent of the educated and highly qualified workforce is women, they hold very few executive roles.

Chemist creates Star Trek-like lab
Peter Murray-Rust has created a lab inspired by the starship computer from the TV series Star Trek, in which the environment records all lab actions and is intelligent enough to respond to basic commands. Murray-Rust integrated RFID tags into his labcoat sleeves, glassware, and reagents; added sensors which record experiments continuously; and integrated voice-activated note taking into his lab space at the University of Cambridge. He estimated that it would only cost about $3,000 for the hardware to implement this open-source system in another lab.

QR codes help with field studies
Quick Response (QR) codes have been proposed as a means for teachers to more easily carry out biological field studies. Traditionally, exploring an area in hopes of scientific discovery required a lot of prior knowledge or a textbook for reference when a species was collected. Now, however, students can scan a QR code associated with the species they just found and receive a plethora of information about collection technique, safety, natural habitat, and more. This application of QR codes is intended to take the tedium out of field studies and allow students to learn more intuitively.

Birth control affects partner choice
In addition to the numerous side effects of birth control, including nausea, vomiting, or cramps, the pills may also influence partner choice. A 2,500-subject research study has shown that women who meet their partner while on birth control are less likely to be sexually satisfied and generally find their partners less sexually attractive. Researchers hypothesize that normal ovulation causes a fluctuation between picking a reliable future father and picking a sexually attractive partner. They further hypothesize that the interruption of this normal cycle could cause women to make choices based more on fatherly traits.

Bone density in anorexia cases
One side-effect of anorexia nervosa, a common eating disorder that results in severe weight-loss, is the loss of bone mineral density (BMD), leading to much weaker bones. Researchers have recently found a promising approach to combating this bone loss. A simple oral application of high doses of estrogen did not improve BMD. However, research has shown that by applying estrogen in a cycle that mimics puberty, the patient’s bones will  substantially strengthen over time.

Carnegie Mellon prides itself on its alumni’s success in Hollywood — its promotional materials are always quick to let you know that Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Star Trek) and Coté de Pablo (NCIS) were originally students here. Some students, however, aren’t waiting until graduation to make a splash in Hollywood, and are taking advantage of talent reality shows to succeed on the small screen. Both a first-year and a master’s student have recently performed with ensembles on television with the hopes of making it big.

Ethan Crystal has barely begun his education at Carnegie Mellon, but his ambitions already expand far beyond the confines of campus. This past summer, he performed with his high school a cappella group, Soul’d Out, on the television talent show The Sing-Off.
The group was only formed in his first year at Wilsonville High School in Wilsonville, Ore., but it quickly rose to prominence in national competitions. After placing second in the U.S. International Championship of High School A Cappella his senior year of high school, “We were like, ‘Wow, we did really, really well,’” Crystal said. “But then we decided, ‘You know, I think it’s time for us to try to reach even further — if we can get this far, we can reach even further.’”
The group auditioned in front of The Sing-Off’s producers near the end of the school year — it was “the weekend right after the seniors got out of school, so that day, we got out of school, [had] a celebration and everything, had three hours to pack and get supplies, and then we just [flew] down immediately [to audition]. It was crazy,” Crystal said. The group went through several rounds of auditions before being selected to go on the show.
Soul’d Out was the only high school group to make it to the top 16, and Crystal admitted that being the youngest was a challenge. “But the thing is, we knew when we went that we had to have the mentality that we were there for a reason,” he said. “We had to remember that we had what it takes to be on the show; otherwise we wouldn’t be there at all.”
The students’ performance history also gave them a slight advantage. “We’ve only been around for four years, but we’re [an] older [ensemble] than some of the groups on The Sing-Off — some groups had only performed [together] for months before the show, as just a few people coming together,” Crystal said. “We’ve performed together for years.”
When finally given the chance to perform on the second episode of The Sing-Off, the group sang a mash-up of “Aquarius” and “Let the Sun Shine In” from the musical Hair. The judges commended Soul’d Out’s maturity as a group: Shawn Stockman applauded Soul’d Out’s efforts, while Sara Bareilles called Crystal, who was the main male soloist, “adorable.” “That was the hardest thing not to tell people [before the episode aired]”, Crystal said, laughing. While Ben Folds criticized the group’s performance, he still praised its dedication, saying, “I was an idiot when I was in high school. You guys are awesome.”
Even though Soul’d Out was eliminated from the show at the end of the episode, Crystal was still pleased with the group’s performance. “I think we left it all out there.... I think we achieved the goal of making the audience feel the way that we felt,” he said.
Crystal credited the support of his high school administration and the community for Soul’d Out’s successes. “We literally would have not existed at all if it weren’t for them,” he said. “And it’s an interesting thing because, you know, we’re not a performing arts high school, and that’s one of the reasons why I’m really proud of how we did and how we got so far. I feel like I want Soul’d Out to become an example of what’s possible for a regular public school that supports its arts program.”
Overall, The Sing-Off was the perfect way to end Soul’d Out’s time together. “One of the most motivating parts of our time on the show was that this was our last hurrah together,” Crystal said. “We were so close. We did everything together.... There’s always Skype. There’s always Facebook. But I miss them a lot.”
Even though he isn’t performing with Soul’d Out anymore, Crystal hasn’t given up on a cappella: He’s now a member of The Originals, Carnegie Mellon’s all-male a cappella group.
Master’s student Michael Dunn sings in group, makes Hollywood connections on X-Factor
“You know, I grew up watching Making the Band or American Idol with my mom and I was always like, ‘Oh, I want to be on that show,’” said Michael Dunn, a master’s student in entertainment industry management (MEIM). He recently decided to pursue that childhood dream by auditioning for The X-Factor as part of Blackout, a trio consisting of him, Emerson College student Kait L, and Pace University student Julia Franklin.
The trio first met in 2009 while performing in the East Coast stage premiere of High School Musical and “all became best friends,” Dunn said. Once the show closed, they continued to perform together, and, “when we found out that The X-Factor was coming to America and The X-Factor was looking for groups, we were like, ‘Oh, well, this is perfect for us — why don’t we just do this?’”
The X-Factor is a television talent show that, similar to American Idol, originated in the UK and was created by Simon Cowell. Unlike American Idol, though, the judges serve as mentors for the contestants, and musical groups — instead of just soloists — are allowed to enter as well.
Originally, the trio had looked for a fourth member to join them in the audition process. “We thought that dynamic [of two guys and two girls] worked better [than one guy and two girls],” Dunn explained, “but it was such a big commitment that people ... really couldn’t commit to standing in line for hours and auditioning for days and being filmed for weeks.”
Ultimately, though, their chemistry as a trio helped them succeed. “We all set off of each other and we just clicked and the producers saw that, and with all those cameras on us, we were just having fun and really high energy, and I think the show was totally into that,” Dunn said.
The group’s energy won it a spot beyond the auditions, and while Dunn was tight-lipped about how far the trio progresses in the competition, he did comment, “It’s been really, really exciting — it was kind of the craziest thing I’ve ever done, and it’s so unreal — to have the opportunity to perform for 4,000 people was amazing.”
Not only has Dunn been enjoying the experience as a performer, he has “tried to look at it from every side” of his education as an MEIM student, he said. “As a CMU student, I’m always thinking about what was happening, like this production’s working and there’s so much money behind the show and how they’re staying on schedule.”
It has also provided a great networking opportunity: “We’re all trying to pursue careers in the business aspect of the industry, so it really allowed me to make great connections with the executive producers and the associate producers,” Dunn said. “It’s all about who you know in this industry.”
No matter how well Blackout ends up doing in the competition, Dunn said he’s had an overwhelmingly positive experience on The X-Factor. “It’s a really happy and exciting environment, and everyone’s genuinely supportive of each other,” he said. “It’s an exciting opportunity, and I think everyone understands that and appreciates the moment they’re in.”

I’m going to be honest here. When I fished Bella Sara out of what was essentially a Gamestop rubbish bin for $5, I laughed. A lot. It’s a horse riding role-playing PC game, in the vein of Barbie Horse Adventures or whatever other shovelware the game industry thinks young girls between the ages of seven and 13 want to play. Worse, it’s not even its own title: The game is based off a popular horse-themed trading card game.
The cover, emblazoned with a white prancing pony amid a background of rainbows and purple sparkle clouds, leaves very little to the imagination regarding the game’s content. I took it home fully expecting to at least be entertained by its terrible-ness, because — let’s not kid ourselves — we’re in that dry spell before Skyrim’s and Skyward Sword’s releases, and the gaming scene is pretty uneventful at the moment. My intentions were to ride some digital ponies, mock the horrible graphics, and call it a day.
What I found surprised me in a way that I’ve very rarely been surprised by a game before: The title was actually passably good. Not only that, but it’s been a week now and I’m still coming back for more. That old adage about “not judging a book by its cover” applies equally well to games as it does to any other form of media.
Bella Sara begins by asking the player to create an equestrian avatar (female only) to represent him or herself within the game. With positive messages in the sidebar such as “Feel free to be whomever you want to be!” during character customization, it’s hard not to feel like the game is setting up to be a hokey girl-power experience. During the following scenes, however, the player is introduced to the farm; the center of the game, the farm contains a quest board, which the player can use to embark on missions, challenges, and races. There’s also a paddock, where the player can tend to his or her horses in the form of simple grooming exercises. The brushing is therapeutic, and the challenges, while ultimately a very simple joy to complete, are surprisingly tough for a children’s game. The riding gameplay has a very smooth, almost Spyro-esque feel — the player glides over peaceful green scenery (albeit horribly rendered with near-neon green grass), moving past large and impossibly fantastical landmarks on either side of the trail. Players can deviate from the trail, too; given that the game is meant for a young and increasingly curious audience, there’s no lack of satisfying hidden pick-ups and bonuses — hidden behind trees, near the coastlines of rivers, and even within areas yet to be unlocked.
Given what it is, the gameplay is no Bioshock. The user interface is downright horrible, the environmental collision detection is laughably bad, and the graphics look like they took a time machine to the present day from 1992. Bella Sara is not a masterpiece of any genre. But there’s a surprising amount to offer here for such a low-budget game, and it caused me to think a little.
Gamers as a general rule tend to be a discerning population. Games aren’t cheap, and as consumers, we have every right to be picky. But how often do we dismiss at a first glance what might be a truly engaging piece of software because it doesn’t look up to standards? How often do we check Metacritic or Kotaku reviews before bothering to even take a look at Steam or the retail shelves? Judging by the $5 price tag on Bella Sara, I’d be willing to wager it happens pretty often. There are probably thousands of other games out there that no one’s playing, purely because the critics who did play didn’t enjoy them.
There may be more compelling gameplay to be had off the $5 rubbish bin than from the new Deus Ex — and for a cheaper price, too. Next time you’re browsing Steam, check the ‘Free to Play’ tab — it’s essentially a graveyard of poor-selling retail titles that have since gone the way of the freemium model, but there’s a lot of gold among the trash. The result may surprise you.

Those who braved the rain and cold Friday night to see straiGHT ouTTA deviantART, The Frame’s latest show, were in for a strange treat. The harsh weather was forgotten upon entrance to the warm, brightly lit room. As bass music pumped, a mash-up of YouTube videos punctured the beats with their own soundtrack. A mix of characters ranged from a fully costumed fox-human and a girl with a large tail to students in North Face jackets. All were chatting quietly while assessing the artwork. In a sense, the viewers had become pieces of art themselves.
The show was about the manifestation of internet art, a culture often rejected as cheap and unrefined. The creators, junior art major Mitsuko Verdery, senior art major Tara Helfer, senior art and psychology double major Honor Randall, senior BHA student Meagan Trott, senior art major Caitlin Boyle, and senior BCSA student Tim Sherman, fully embraced this culture in an eclectic tribute to influences which have built them up as artists. Described as “where fine art meets 4chan,” the show honored various internet sensations like YouTube, deviantART, and Myspace, along with their most popular subjects. Works were often accompanied by an Urban Dictionary definition of the phenomenon.
Tim Sherman, wearing a sleek mask straight out of V for Vendetta and referring to himself as “XXDeathRingerXX,” was live video-mixing clips from YouTube. He explained that later in the night, when karaoke began, the performances would be recorded live and streamed on internet forums so that anyone could become an internet sensation. Sherman commented that the internet culture permeates millions of lives daily, and walks the line between lowbrow and highbrow art.
Across the room, the creator of a large, Warhol-like print stood behind a camera. Caitlin Boyle’s pink hair and unique style corresponded perfectly with her intensely colored pieces. The Warhol recognition was implemented with a repeating portrayal of a My Little Pony doll using found imagery collaged in Photoshop. Boyle described the work as a satirical piece going back to the roots of her history as an artist. She said that the show was commenting on how artists are influenced by the beginning practices of media that the internet offers, before they enter the world of fine art and “Warhol Culture” that provokes the rejection of their initial roots.
Other pieces included a photo mosaic of a thousand pictures of the stereotypical “Myspace pose.” Randall explained that some of the pictures were actually old photos of herself along with the general population of the internet, generated from Google searches like “in the bathroom” and “my new haircut.” Helfer’s piece, “Portraits of well known cats,” included small, careful prints of cats that have become internet sensations in beautiful frames, featuring stars like the “I can has?” cat. Trott’s three large Photoshop collages made an ironic comment on what internet-goers will find on a website such as deviantART. One of her prints included a portrayal of a crying kitten, and another detailed the complex psyche of Pikachu.
The show embraced everything tacky and crazy, and reaffirmed that many artistic endeavors today are born from the internet. It offered a comfort for artists looking to remember where they came from.

Audiences expect tragic operas to be dramatic, elaborate, and highly emotional. The Pittsburgh Opera’s performance of Giuseppe Verdi’s La Traviata, stage-directed by Crystal Manich with music director Antony Walker, delivered magnificently in all these respects.
The story of La Traviata follows Violetta, a Parisian courtesan who falls in love with a well-to-do young man, Alfredo. Although they love each other, they are forced apart because of their class differences; the couple is eventually reunited, only for them to meet a tragic end.
Moments before the show began, first-year vocal performance major Taylor Rawley said, “I’m very hopeful; I’ve heard good things. I like opera because it is an elevated art form.”
La Traviata lived up to these expectations — the opera used several art forms to deliver an experience that the audience will not soon forget. The set design, costumes, acting, music, singing, dancing, and lighting came together to captivate the audience and make the show a true success.
Anna Sumuil, who played the role of Violetta, was a delight. Her pleasant voice and articulate body language enhanced the production, drawing the audience in.
The costumes and set design by Desmond Heely took the performance to the highest possible level. With the opera taking place in France during a highly decadent time period, one has certain expectations of its aesthetics, and the design certainly lived up to those expectations. The costumes were marvelously designed — even the minor characters seemed distinct from one another.
Despite the story’s tragic ending, it also had several absurdist aspects, like the idea that “wine will banish every care,” which kept the mood from becoming too heavy.
Opera is an art type that one might envision as being highly exclusive, serving a specific crowd. But Deb Bell, the director of marketing and communications for the Benedum Center, who has worked in the industry for decades, disagrees. “Audiences have changed,” she said. “Tonight you saw people who were making fashion statements, where before you had people [wearing] just one mold of an outfit.” While there was the expected crowd of professionals in the audience, there was also a good number of young adults present, with outfits ranging from cocktail dresses and suits to good old blue jeans.
The production of La Traviata at the Benedum Center was a pleasure and delight. It was a huge success; the large and varied turnout served as a testament to the quality of the performance. An elevated art form, indeed.

The Carnegie Mellon Symphony Orchestra performed its first concert of the season Wednesday evening at the Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland to an audience of Pittsburgh residents and Carnegie Mellon students and staff.
The ensemble played two pieces — Metamorphosen by Richard Strauss and Symphony No. 3 in E-flat Major, more widely known as the Eroica Symphony, by Ludwig van Beethoven.
The symphony orchestra is comprised of both graduate and undergraduate students. It is conducted by Ronald Zollman, an associate professor of music and the director of orchestral studies at the School of Music.
The first piece played, Metamorphosen, is written for exactly 23 solo string players. The small group of violinists, violists, cellists, and bassists gave the entire performance an intimate feel. Strauss wrote the piece near the end of World War II to mourn Germany’s destruction in the war; the quiet opening of basses and cellos conveyed this mournful tone to the audience.
Metamorphosen was approximately 30 minutes long, including a grand pause where the entire concert hall was remarkably silent — a testament to how engaged the audience was. The ensemble members’ faces and body movements responded to Zollman’s exaggerated conducting pattern, suggesting the director had an excellent connection with the students playing in his ensemble.
Following a short intermission and a resetting of the stage, Zollman and a larger ensemble, including wind players and a sole percussionist, joined the stage to play Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony.
Beethoven had originally dedicated his Eroica Symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, but removed that dedication once Bonaparte declared himself emperor of France. One of Beethoven’s most famous symphonies, Eroica includes four movements with intense dynamic shifts from loud full-member sections to quieter soli sections. The dynamic contrast was one of the most impressive feats for an ensemble of this size.
Metamorphosen and Eroica have a unique connection: The end of Metamorphosen includes an explicit reference to a theme from the funeral march in Eroica. Even audience members unaware of such a connection surely enjoyed the program put on by the Carnegie Mellon Symphony Orchestra.
The ensemble played well together, with each instrumental section blending beautifully with the overall sound of the group. A variety of fast and slow, loud and soft, solo and full ensemble allowed the audience to remain engaged throughout the concert.
The Symphony Orchestra's next performance is April 18 at 8 p.m. at the Carnegie Music Hall. Admission to most concerts is free with a valid Carnegie Mellon student ID.

You’d be surprised by the number of people who will harass you for going to Ireland to study abroad. I get the argument; Ireland is English-speaking, less diverse than a Wilco concert (Yes, I stole that phrase from 30 Rock — it’s too perfect not to borrow), the weather is crummy, the cities are tiny, and if you’re going to study theater, wouldn’t you rather go to London?
Not to hate on London, but I wouldn’t trade my summer in Dublin for anything. Instead of taking classes, I split my week between two internships, killing both the “summer internship” bird and the “study abroad before I graduate” bird with a single IES Summer Internship in Dublin Program stone.
I lived in an apartment with other American students. They were doing a different IES program and took classes at the prestigious Gaity School of Acting a few blocks from my Monday/Thursday internship. I’ll spare you the mushy friendship stuff, but suffice it to say I made some lifelong friendships, primarily with the people I lived with.
As I said before, I split my week between two internships: one at Fishamble: The New Play Company, and one at Poetry Ireland, which is like the Poetry Foundation here in the United States. I worked Mondays and Thursdays at Fishamble (or ‘The Fish’ as my mother started calling it for no discernible reason) and Tuesdays and Wednesdays at Poetry Ireland. Both internships related directly to my schoolwork here at Carnegie Mellon; I’m a BHA student in dramaturgy and English, and on the whole, I was really happy with my internship placements. I met 11 really smart, talented, and enthusiastic people who were eager to get to know me, advise me, and trust me with tasks valuable to the organization.
Yep, you read correctly. Only 11. It isn’t unusual for companies in the arts to be small, but Ireland is a small country, and that seems to make everything else a little smaller, and maybe even a little more low-key, just because everyone knows each other. I once saw the president get out of her car to go to a meeting in Dublin Castle with only two Garda motorcycles and one black town car. That’s it. Granted, the president is more of a figurehead than a political power in the Irish government, but still, I thought that was pretty neat.
In addition to having smaller staffs than their American counterparts, the Irish work environment was, from my experience, a lot more relaxed. I want to clarify that I don’t mean “lazy.” Everyone I worked with was focused and productive, and I saw all kinds of projects in both the companies I worked for. But in Ireland, arriving five minutes late or leaving three minutes early was not a big deal, and the dress code was very casual.
It was actually kind of a problem: Anticipating four days a week of American-style business casual apparel, I showed up on my first day in tall heels and a pencil skirt, only to find that the dress at Fishamble was far more casual. I wouldn’t go in wearing sweats and ripped up jeans, and I don’t mean at all to say that the staff was not well-dressed, but the Fish was on the fourth floor of a building with no lift and I quickly learned to wear better stair-climbing shoes. I called everyone by their first name, whenever anyone went out they asked if I wanted anything — which did nothing for my hazelnut biscuit addiction — and my supervisor saw nothing wrong with making me a cup of tea.
I don’t want to give the impression that U.S. internships are cruel and unforgiving, but I think because internships are so much more common in the U.S., interns are a dime-a-dozen, and they aren’t treated with the same gratitude as they are in Dublin. It made for a far more pleasant work environment.
Working in Ireland was not without its mishaps. At Fishamble, I had some trouble answering the phone; with my American accent, I hit the “FISH” of Fishamble with the emphasis, instead of the “AM” sound like everyone else at work — not to mention the entire United Kingdom. I’m sure that no one on the other end minded, if they even noticed, but it made me really nervous at first, and I would avoid answering the phone as much as possible. That, and my constant distress about the Irish language.
The language spoken in Ireland other than English is called Irish, not Gaelic. The same way Polish is a Slavic language, Irish is a Gaelic language. So is Scottish, which is why the new name for Homecoming is pronounced “kay-lee,” even though it’s spelled Cèilidh. Though Scottish Gaelic is different from Irish Gaelic, the Cèilidh to “kay-lee” relationship is a good way to understand how hard it was to guess how people on the phone wanted their names spelled. And at Poetry Ireland, I had to type up a few poems and announcements in Irish. I was surprised to learn how hard it is to type in a language you can’t read or even pronounce.
Luckily, almost all of Ireland is English-speaking, which is one of the main reasons why I went there to work. I liked working abroad as opposed to taking a class, for all the normal reasons why internships are good — Hands-on experience! A break from classes! Networking in your field! — and also because I felt more integrated into Irish culture than I would have been under other circumstances. Although I lived with American students, I spent most of my week typing things, reading things, and spending time with people I never would have met otherwise.

The use of genres to understand music is somewhat of an obsession in our society. You’ll see publications and critics pointing out similarities, no matter how inconsequential, between musicians and then lumping them together in some ultra-specific definition that can’t convey any singular objective description. While comparing the differences between genres might give some kind of understanding of music’s possibilities, it is a superficial understanding. In order to delve into the depths of musical potential, music should be examined in both recorded and live settings.
Recorded music is the apex of our collective control obsession. An artist can re-record, digitally alter, and produce his or her music to sound an exact way, while a listener has the option of playing recorded music whenever and wherever he or she wants. Any passion or spontaneity is reduced to a convention. That is why concerts are so important: In a live setting, the audience and the artist are both forced to confront each other directly.
I was able to view this difference for myself this past weekend when a couple of friends and I drove to New York to see Anders Trentemøller perform at Webster Hall. To say that his performance was stellar would be an understatement. Despite the fact that he is an electronic producer, Trentemøller and his band played instruments throughout the entire set. Most amazing, however, was the actual music he played. Not a single song he performed was merely reproduced off an album. Trentemøller expanded them, drew out the nuances within each song, and exposed the emotion and inspiration that existed within the mechanical structures of his music.
While classification is a natural, human thing to do, we put way too much stock into how music can be defined. You might read every single article on Pitchfork and Resident Advisor and know exactly how the styles of different musicians interrelate, but you will never truly grasp their musical identity until you examine them on multiple levels.

Dear Patrick,
Halloween is coming up in the next couple weeks, and I have no idea what I should go as. Do you have any costume suggestions?
Thanks,
Scanty Lingerie, Underwear, Tights, or Tatas? Your Preference Urgently Mandated, Patrick, Knower of Information
Dear SLUTTY PUMPKIN,
If Mean Girls has taught me anything, it’s that nothing is more important than your Halloween costume. As Lindsay Lohan pointed out, many girls take Halloween as a chance to walk around in their underwear and wear animal ears. Those are pretty lame costumes — Amanda Seyfried looked nothing like a mouse! Try being creative. Go as an ex-wife, or tape your eyes wide open and mouth into a creepy smile and go as Michele Bachmann. Or heavily imply to all your friends that you’re going to a party, but stay home instead and call yourself Sarah Palin.
For all you guys out there, you don’t really have to worry about a costume. One easy costume is to wear your underwear on the outside, tie a belt around your head, and answer only to Quailman. Another is to dress normally and go as a Muggle. If you spend money on a costume, you’ve failed at Halloween.
Or just dress in drag,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
Midterms are here, and I’m freaking out about my exams. I’ve been skipping class and feel pretty lost. Do you have any tips on catching up and studying for tests?
Thanks,
Wants Help Entering Recitations, Enjoying Stultifying Classes, Learning A Semester’s Subjects
Dear WHERE’S CLASS,
Skipping class is addicting. You accidentally sleep through your morning class once and realize how nice that extra rest is, so you keep it up every day. You miss a day for a root canal and enjoy the painkillers so much, you schedule one a week for the rest of the semester. No matter what you do, it still seems better than going to class.
You need to stop. Go to class. If there are notes online, read all the ones you’ve missed to catch up with the class. Make a friend in class and con him into a “study session” (i.e. he teaches you everything from the past six weeks in two hours). If you can put up with that strange odor coming from your TA, try going to office hours. They’re paid to help you, so they can’t just blow you off.
Put this down and go to class,
Patrick Hoskins

100 YEARS AGO -- Oct. 19, 1911
The Tartan’s editors weigh in on how to refer to their school, deciding that “Carnegie” is more distinctive than calling it “Tech,” which they say gets confused with other institutions. Now, for “Carnegie,” is that the university, the music hall, the library, the institute, the foundation, the financial company, or... what?
50 YEARS AGO -- Oct. 18, 1961
A recruiting ad in The Tartan for the Martin Company — now part of Lockheed Martin — cautiously begins, “If you have (or will have) your Ph.D. or master’s degree ... you may find that a move to Martin will be a move up in your career.” Grad students know never to count their diplomas before they’re given.
25 YEARS AGO -- Oct. 21, 1986
Horror-film director and Carnegie Mellon alumnus George Romero is set to give a public lecture in downtown Pittsburgh. Romero’s famous Night of the Living Dead and its sequels were shot in and around the city, providing inspiration now for more than four decades’ worth of zombie walks.
10 YEARS AGO -- Oct. 15, 2001
Previously banned from participating, Phi Kappa Theta successfully petitions to be re-included in Carnival 2002. The fraternity had also been evicted from its house on the Greek Quad for unspecified “lease and behavior violations” the previous fall. On appeal, Dean Michael Murphy decided that the “more onerous” housing loss was punishment enough.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- Oct. 16, 2006
A week after Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion, The Tartan’s editorial page muses on the future of the site that, at the time, was serving 100 million videos per day. That future, five years later: bigger numbers. In 2011, YouTube is the third-most-visited site on the web, serving 2 billion videos to 30 percent of the world’s internet users each day.
ONE YEAR AGO -- Oct. 11, 2010
Despite their 3–1 start, Tartan columnist Jeremy King calls the Pittsburgh Steelers “overhyped and overrated” due to their weak defense and running game. Just don’t tell any of the fans — if they can’t riot for a Super Bowl win, a riot against treason is the next best thing.

Protests swelled within the streets of Pittsburgh last Saturday morning, as thousands gathered together to demonstrate against the increasing role of corporate and financial interests in politics.
The demonstration, Occupy Pittsburgh, brought Pittsburgh into the larger movement that has taken hold in cities across the U.S. after its origin in New York. 
Students, workers, children and their parents, and others gathered downtown, chanting and carrying signs, flags, and banners.
“It’s fantastic. It exceeded my expectations. I thought we’d max at 3,000 [people],” said Occupy Pittsburgh’s organizer, Nathaniel Glosser.
The protesters represented causes ranging from social security to police brutality and women’s rights.
The main theme, however, was protest against corporate power. Common signs stated, “Money is not speech and corporations are not people,” “Separation of bank and state,” and “Bail out the students, not the banks.”
“My problem is that the price of everything is going up, and the 1 percent are trying to push wages down,” said Jim Bonner, a laid-off bus driver. Occupy Pittsburgh’s stated goal is “standing together against corporate greed.”
“The politicians and corporations are all in it together,” Bonner added.
Around noon, marchers rallied at Freedom Corner in the Hill District, where a series of speakers took turns addressing the crowd.
Larry Getty, an elderly resident of Pittsburgh, protested cuts to Medicare and Social Security. He held a sign that read: “Who’s going to insure an 80-year-old man with health problems? We need a national health care system. All of Canada and Europe has it. Why don’t we?”
After the short rally, protesters headed toward downtown carrying their banners, signs, and flags. As they passed by the PNC Bank building, the BNY Mellon building, and other corporate headquarters, they expressed their anger, chanting things like “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out” and “One, two, three, four, we declare class war.”
The rally and march coincided with a larger event planned for Saturday, in which groups worldwide were encouraged to participate in similar demonstrations. According to the Occupy Pittsburgh website, “Saturday will see Pittsburgh join the hundreds of cities across the country and hundreds more overseas where the Occupy movement has taken hold.”
In the U.S. and overseas, there are over 1,000 cities where some sort of occupation-style movement has begun.
“I want to live in a world where I know that, if I had misfortune, [if] I was not well off, I would not just be forgotten, like some of these people are being forgotten right now,” said Mark Glosser, a web developer, as he compared the protest to the 1960s civil rights movement, “The civil rights movement today is the underrepresented versus the wealthy.”
The Occupy Pittsburgh movement, which began almost a month ago, captured the attention of the media and local citizens. The group is gaining momentum with over 6,000 members on its Facebook page.
Although the group claims to be “in solidarity” with Occupy Wall Street and have similar goals, participants said they are a separate movement.
“This is a local event with local people,” Glosser told the Pittsburgh Business Times last week. “Organizers from New York are not coming down and doing this. It’s entirely autonomous.”
Steve Iskovitz, who has been involved with Occupy Wall Street, carried around a sign saying “CMU: No autonomous killer drones,” alluding to some of Carnegie Mellon’s government connections.
“I figure I’d just bring a little local angle to Pittsburgh,” he said. As he reflected on the rally, Iskovitz added, “I was going to give up on this country. I thought it was hopeless until this happened.”
Last Thursday afternoon, Pittsburgh city police approved the permit for Occupy Pittsburgh to hold the event and closed off a two-mile stretch of streets on Saturday morning in preparation for the event.
While the protest remained relatively peaceful and orderly, legal observers from the American Civil Liberties Union were on the scene in bright green visors. They kept watch for violations by police and handed out pamphlets informing protesters of their rights.
After the march, protesters ended up at Mellon Green, a park that BNY Mellon owns next to its headquarters on Grant Street. They set up tents and planned to occupy the area for the night. Organizers believe that part of the city code allows for an encampment on private property. However, lawyers and police disputed that.
“This [protest], I believe, is going to result in a critical mass of people who are demanding real change, and I’ve got to be a part of that,” Glosser said.

As the sun began to set on last Friday evening, Carnegie Mellon students took to the Cut to begin the 2011 Relay for Life.
Running from 6 p.m. Friday evening to 6 a.m. Saturday morning, Relay for Life was held to benefit the American Cancer Society. It aims to fund cancer research and provide outreach to current patients, with the eventual goal of finding a cure for and a way to prevent cancer.
Last year, Carnegie Mellon helped raise an estimated $38,000 for the American Cancer Society. This year, there were 37 teams registered with 362 participants, with the goal of raising $39,500.
This year’s top three fundraising teams were Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Iota, and Alpha Chi Omega. The top fundraising participants were Jennie Tang, a senior economics and modern languages double major; Sarah Gorman, a junior design major; and James Owens, a senior electrical and computer engineering major.
Despite initial concerns over rainy weather while the event was being set up, coordinators still made preparations. Prerak Patel, a junior biomedical engineering and electrical and computer engineering double major, was the logistics coordinator and said that the relay was “a rain-or-shine event.” 
However, by the time the participants took to the Cut, the weather had largely cleared; a rainbow was the only remnant of the previously inclement weather.
Like all Relay for Life events, Carnegie Mellon’s effort contained three key traditions: the Survivor’s Lap, the Luminaria Ceremony, and the Fight Back Ceremony.
Starting off the relay, the Survivor’s Lap is a tribute to all of those who beat cancer, in which local cancer survivors and their families complete the first lap. Shortly after, the Luminaria Ceremony was conducted; lighted bags, created in memory of cancer victims, were lined around the track. Finally, the Fight Back ceremony had attendees make a personal commitment to fight against cancer and to help those who are suffering from the disease.
This is Relay for Life’s second year on the Cut, after previously being held in Gesling Stadium. This decision, Patel said, was made partly due to logistic issues when operating in Gesling, but mostly to encourage campus awareness and participation.
Kristen Minno, a senior modern languages student and Science and Humanities Scholar, was the event’s co-chair. Minno first got involved with Relay for Life at her high school, and she was inspired to participate in memory of her friend’s mother, who had passed away from breast and lung cancer the year before she started participating. “We wanted to do something that would honor her,” Minno said.
BioSac team co-captain Katherine Forsyth, a junior biology major, said that Relay for Life “was a very great way of raising awareness for cancer research.” Forsyth went on to emphasize the communal spirit of the event between teams and participants.
BioSac runner Dagney Cooke, first-year in the Mellon College of Science, agreed. She described the event as “a fun way to give back.” Fellow participant Rene Francolini, a first-year in Mellon College of Science, added that the event “was a great way to bond with people.”
The teams relayed through the night, aided by music and performances by the Kiltie Band, Bhangra, acapella groups, Dancers’ Symposium, and other student organizations.
The event finally drew to a close Saturday morning with little fanfare. As the participants were leaving, the total donation count stood at $24,510 — a significant amount of fundraising, but not as large the intended goal. Minno said that the Relay organizing committee believes the lower donation total resulted from past top fundraisers graduating and lower turnout at the event. 
Despite the lower overall total, individual participants raised more individually, "demonstrating that the quality of fundraising per team is increasing," Minno said. Additionally, donors can continue contributing to this year's Relay event until August 2012.

Captain Eric Hofmeister, M.D., of the United States Navy, spoke last Wednesday to students enrolled in the Health Professions Program. The lecture centered around Hofmeister’s story as a medical officer in the military.
Hofmeister grew up in a small town in Wisconsin, with no military exposure but an interest in human science. He became associated with the military when he accepted an Army scholarship, which paid for four years of tuition at Marquette University. 
In exchange for having his tuition paid, Hofmeister owed the Army four years of service. However, his military service did not end there. He applied to medical school and was accepted; again the Army supplied his tuition and books, and even paid for him to be an officer in the military as he studied to become an orthopedic surgeon.
According to Hofmeister, his medical school ambitions were possible because of the Health Professional Service Program Scholarship. 
The scholarship pays for medical school, scrubs, books, and a monthly salary for students to live on. After completing four years of medical school, students owe four years of military service. The program also gives students the chance to do other activities between medical school and residency, such as practice as a flight surgeon or family practitioner with the chance to deploy abroad.
“It gives students the opportunity to build a résumé once they do choose to do their residency,” said Kelleigh Cunningham, a Navy recruiting officer at the lecture. Cunningham believes that the Health Professional Service Program Scholarship is a good choice for many students interested in entering medical school.
Hofmeister, who switched from the Army to the Navy to be closer to his wife, said that he loves being a military doctor because he gets to do what is right for the patient, and he has the opportunity to deploy to different areas of the world. 
Not all of the lecture was about military medicine. In one anecdote, Hofmeister shared what he called his “most interesting orthopedic case,” in which he attached four fingers back onto a man’s hand after they were chopped off by a crabber.
Hofmeister also spoke about the medical school experience in general. The first year of medical school, he said, was a huge eye-opener — the volume of work was just mind-boggling.
“A lot of students faint,” Hofmeister said. “It’s very common, and it’s okay.”
After the lecture ended, first-year Mellon College of Science student Dominic Akerele said, “I felt like this was a great opportunity because it gave me insight into what it would be like going into the medical field and strengthened my interest for pursuing medical school.”

Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar program enrolled a record number of students for the 2011–12 school year. Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (CMU-Q) enrolled 107 students from 20 countries and brought in the highest number of Qatari nationals since the campus opened in 2004.
According to the CMU-Q website, the campus’ acceptance rate for 2009–10 was 26.7 percent. There were 631 applicants, 168 were offered admission, and 86 new students enrolled. As for the 2010–11 academic year, the website stated that the acceptance rate was 24.6 percent. There were 780 applicants, 192 were offered admission, and 98 first-year students enrolled. The expected enrollment for fall 2012 was approximately 100–110 first-year students.
Ilker Baybars, the Qatar campus dean, explained that the high enrollment is a result of the school’s increasing reputation. “This is really a culmination of a seven-year effort,” he said in an email. “We are a young school in Doha, and we are better known every passing year. It was a natural development, not an outcome of a special effort or strategy.”
Jarrod Mock, director of admissions for CMU-Q, brought up possible factors that added to the rise in enrollment numbers. “Probably the most notable difference in our class this year is the high enrollment of Qatari nationals,” he said via email. “Our yield for Qatari students rose from 50 percent over the past three years to 65 percent this year. Simply put, a greater percentage of the Qatari students we admitted chose Carnegie Mellon this year.”
In order to strengthen the campus connection of Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon in Qatar, Initiating Meaningful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) was founded in fall 2008. During spring breaks, eight selected Pittsburgh students travel to Doha and develop strategies and initiatives to enhance the relationship between the two campuses.
Sara Mouhktar, a junior dual English and psychology major, traveled to Doha through the IMPAQT program. “I was really happy when I heard about CMU-Q’s record enrollment — the Qatar campus offers such a great educational opportunity, but it’s new,” she said in an email. “That’s why the student population is so small; the campus is still really young. I hope, and believe, that the enrollment will continue to climb, as more professors from here go over there and more programs become available to the students there.”
Senior philosophy major Jessica Dickinson Goodman, who also attended the IMPAQT program, said, “Carnegie Mellon really offers world-class education. The past years have seen remarkable outcomes of CMU-Q’s education in Qatar.” While great accomplishments serve as an effective promotion of CMU-Q, the admissions office has also spent a lot of time and energy encouraging the top students in the region to apply to CMU-Q.

GigaPan print art on display in Gates, Hillman buildings
Several GigaPan prints from the exhibit at last year’s Fine International Conference on Gigapixel Imagery for Science will be placed on permanent display in the Gates and Hillman centers within the next week.
A reception as well as a walking tour to celebrate the newly installed pieces, titled “Panoramics and Precision,” will take place Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. and will begin on the fifth floor.
The works on permanent display will include Naoko Matsubara’s “Solitude,” a series of woodcuts inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s Walden; Stephanie Jenouvrier’s GigaPan image, “Penguins at Cape Crozier”; Molly Gibson’s “Barnacle,” an image created with a scanning electron microscope modified with GigaPan technology; Richard Bryant’s print of “Eagle’s Nest, Jubbah, Saudi Arabia”; and Chris Fastie’s “Bergamot and Hummingbirds, Vermont.” The pieces will be scattered throughout the Gates Hillman Complex.
The pieces were selected by the Gates Hillman Center Art Committee.
Three additional GigaPan prints are on display in Newell-Simon Hall. These pieces include Jason Buchheim’s “Galapagos Bait Ball of Salema,” Rurik List’s “From Sierra de en Medio,” and Andrew R. Deans’ and Matthew A. Bertone’s “The Big Four.” These pieces are, like the works in the Gates Hillman Complex, dispersed throughout the building’s floors.
ECE professor inducted into AAAS, intellectual society
Edmund M. Clarke, FORE Systems University Professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering, was one of the 179 national leaders who were inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) at a ceremony in Cambridge, Mass. last Saturday.
The official ceremony included the traditional signing of the Book of Members by participants such as Paul Simon, singer-songwriter; David Page, geneticist and director of the Whitehead Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Ei-Ichi Negishi, Nobel laureate and chemist at Purdue University.
The AAAS is one of the nation’s oldest intellectual societies. It is also an independent research center that draws from its members’ expertise to analyze and study science and technology policy, global security, the humanities and culture, social policy, and education.
Last Wednesday, Clarke gave a keynote address at the ninth International Symposium in Taipei, Taiwan. His address focused on automated technology and verification analysis.
On Oct. 26, he will present another keynote address at the Computing in the 21st Century Conference, hosted by Microsoft Research Asia and Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.

Bayes’ Rule: The Theory That Would Not Die
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Sharon Bertsch McGrayne will present a lecture on the research of Thomas Bayes and Pierre-Simon Laplace. 
She will discuss the history of Bayes’ rule, highlighting Alan Turing, who decrypted the German Enigma code, and Jerome Cornfield of the National Institute of Health and George Washington University, who used Bayes’ rule to establish smoking as a cause of lung cancer as well as establish that high cholesterol is related to cardiovascular disease.
McGrayne co-authored the “Atom” and “Electricity & Magnetism” articles for the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
School of Art Lecture Series
Tuesday at 5 p.m.
Kresge Theatre, CFA
Within the realm of performance art, Carolee Schneeman works in a wide variety of media, including performance, assemblage, photography, film, video, and installation. In this lecture, she will showcase her recent works and discuss her career path. During Schneeman’s career, her work has focused on the discourse of the body, sexuality, and gender.  Schneeman’s work has been shown at multiple museums and exhibitions around the world, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City; the Museums of Contemporary Art located in Los Angeles, Barcelona, and Vienna; and the Stadtische Kunsthalle in Dusseldorf; the Venice Biennale in Italy.
Caribbean Captives, African Slaves: The Origins of the Gullah/Geechee
Thursday at noon
Baker Hall 246A
Edda L. Fields-Black, associate professor in the history department, will discuss her research on the “Gullah/Geechee Corridor.”
Fields-Black will argue that the Gullah/Geechee culture and language are the exception to “African-American exceptionalism.” Her research attempts to prove that African-Americans were not decimated by the institution of slavery and that enslaved Africans were skilled, not just brute laborers.
Fields-Black’s lecture will examine the historical evidence about the earliest black settlers in South Carolina’s Lowcountry region. She will focus on the importance of the Caribbean, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Kongo/Angola regions throughout history. However, she will also argue that historians must be very careful about attempting to find the origins of the Gullah/Geechee either in the Caribbean or in West and West-Central Africa.
The Boys of St. Columb’s
Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136A)
Maurice Fitzpatrick, director of the new film The Boys of St. Columb’s, will present a screening of the movie. Afterward, Jennifer Keating-Miller, assistant director of undergraduate research and national fellowships, and Matthew O’Brien, from the department of history at Franciscan University of Steubenville, will lead a discussion of the film.
The Boys of St. Columb’s narrates the lives of the first generation of children to receive free secondary education because of the 1947 Education Act in Northern Ireland. The film tells the story of how the political and historical conditions of Northern Ireland were altered as a result of the mass education of its population, culminating in the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1960s.

President Barack Obama announced last Friday by an executive order that the United States will deploy 100 military advisors to Uganda. These military personnel will support U.S. allies in Africa in the fight against Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a violent guerilla group. Here are some facts that may have persuaded Obama to deploy U.S. soldiers to intervene:
100,000: number of Ugandans killed in LRA violence as of 2007
1,900: people killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo between September 2008 and December 2010
1.7 million: number of internally displaced Ugandans as of 2007
30,000: number of children abducted from Uganda between 1998 and 2004

Opportunities are forks in the road of life. They act as pathways to new experiences and trials that can shape our character. 
Our responses to these opportunities make all the difference in the world.
None of this came to mind when I saw an Activities Board poster publicizing a belly dancing workshop in the University Center.
When you think of a belly dancer, I’m sure you usually think of a woman whose stomach is as flat as a washboard. In contrast, I have the physique of a teddy bear, which — when paired with my Y chromosome — makes it rather unusual for me to attempt belly dancing. However, the opportunity to step outside of my comfort zone with few long-term disadvantages piqued my interest. Lest I allow my activities fee to go to waste, I decided to try something new. I decided to belly dance.
I regretted this decision as soon as I walked into Rangos Hall. Besides the DJ, I was the only male present (although another guy arrived later). The gender ratio was obviously skewed in favor of the women. This granted me a few unusual looks from the girls there, which didn’t ease the situation. Look at me, complaining about too many women at a Carnegie Mellon event.
The class began with us meeting our instructor, Amethyst, and observing her belly dancing performance to music seemingly ripped from the desert level of every video game. We formed lines to start learning techniques, and as Amethyst discussed the idiosyncrasies of “tribal fusion” belly dancing, the feeling that there was no turning back started to sink in.
While the initial techniques and poses weren’t too taxing (not assuming I was executing them flawlessly), the balance and body contortions required for the later moves were beyond me. But somewhere between performing vertical figure-eights with my hips and doing sensual grapevines across the floor, my fears about the ridiculousness of the situation disappeared.
For the rest of the lesson, I was only acutely aware of my inability to dance, and the gender issue became nonexistent. I started to revel in the music, and I was surprised by how fast the lesson ended. I left, not inspired to pursue belly dancing any further, but nonetheless with my head held high.
As college students, we are tested constantly. Our professors push us to reach our academic potential, and our friends influence us to join certain groups or activities, but it is more difficult to gauge how we influence ourselves. 
Challenging yourself is a way to break out of a mold that starts to form from doing what is comfortable. Comfort can often breed a contentedness that limits potential. By challenging yourself, you can reach that potential and learn more than any class can teach you.
By challenging myself, I learned that it is hard to find the distinction between “tribal fusion” and “electro fusion” belly dancing. I learned that teddy bears can belly dance. 
Most of all, I learned that taking advantage of opportunities that challenge you makes all the difference in the world.

Dianna Agron posed on the cover of the September issue of Cosmo with her right arm dangling unnaturally from her too-skinny waist. Adam Levine was missing part of his torso in Russia’s Vogue. A suspiciously darker O.J. Simpson was on the cover of Time magazine in 1994.
A campaign to secure legislation for a law that will inform the public of excessive photo editing might put an end to such Photoshop faux-pas. The campaign was created by Off Our Chests magazine founders Seth and Eva Matlins and would “require all ads and editorials that have significantly airbrushed or photoshopped the human form to carry ‘truth in advertising labels’ on them.” Although we are a bit skeptical of how this act could be regulated (What is “significantly airbrushed” and what is not? How many fixes can be made without the truth label?) we believe it is a positive step toward more ethical journalism and photography.
Many publications, often fashion-related, seem to think that they have the liberty to manipulate a photo without repercussions. The idea that a photo solely belongs to a publication is ethically irresponsible; the person being photographed and the reader should also be considered. First and foremost, a commitment to conveying the truth to readers should be paramount. The National Press Photographers Association supports this and states in its Digital Manipulation Code of Ethics that, “As journalists we believe the guiding principle of our profession is accuracy; therefore, we believe it is wrong to alter the content of a photograph in any way that deceives the public.” Excessive Photoshopping goes directly against this code of ethics.
We are encouraged that these concerns are being heard and put into action through the Matlins campaign. Although we are skeptical of how the act would be implemented, we believe it is a step in the right direction. We stand in solidarity with the Matlins to advocate more ethical journalism.

What if the color of a card identified your state-determined intelligence to complete strangers and was used as a basis of discrimination against you?
Sounds like some hazy dystopian pipe dream. But two high schools in Orange County, Calif., have recently begun requiring students to carry color-coded ID cards based on their performance on annual state-wide standardized exams. Students in the higher score brackets — black and gold — were offered privileges such as school discounts and shorter cafeteria lines over lower-scoring white-card students. 
Immediately, students carrying white cards were faced with discrimination, especially in Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses.  Senior Kiana Miyamoto overheard one student telling another that “anyone who has a white card shouldn’t even be in IB,” according to the Orange County Register. The schools are defending the practice by claiming that the program was meant not as a basis for hostility but instead intended to reward students for doing well on these state exams.
Overall, we believe merit-based awards should be encouraged. Incentivizing high performance in any academic institution is an excellent way to reward hard work and dedication that goes above and beyond one’s peers. But to do so in a way that shames others in the process is inherently flawed.
Publicly revealing potentially damaging information, especially among high schoolers (who are particularly vulnerable), is abhorrent and is a violation of fundamental privacy rights. Moreover, the benefits chosen — separate cafeteria lines, cheaper prices at local businesses — seem to be more indicative of the practices of some elite, cushy club rather than a public high school incentive program. The system does reward students who do well, but it also attempts to incentivize public shame and exclusion. 
Instead, schools looking to implement tangible benefits should do so for the entire student body. If high  performance results in cheaper prom tickets for everyone, or a free ice cream day for the whole school, the emphasis is not on public shame and humiliation but on pushing the student body to work together on everyone’s behalf. This large-scale collaboration is exactly the behavior we want to encourage in future generations of young students.

As an assignment for one of their classes, second-year architecture students had to build a structure to house those painting and guarding the Fence. This project aimed for function and form; once completed, it resembled an outdoor art exhibit.
We appreciate these students and their artistic structures. Having the landscape of campus change with temporary pieces of art makes Carnegie Mellon feel alive — it concretely demonstrates that students are passionate about creative endeavors that can be shared with the community. Temporary works of art that pop up around campus are often a pleasant surprise, and they convey a sense of life, spontaneity, and free-thinking. Moreover, these installations often spur campus conversations and a sense of community.
Take the “shantytown” that was erected in response to the G-20 coming to Pittsburgh two years ago. The collection of structures indeed looked like a legitimate shantytown, and students had varying opinions on it; some students thought it was unsightly and full of hippies, while others supported the political stance the art took. In either case, the project showcased how involved and enthusiastic the artists were to share their beliefs. They used temporary art as a way to make a statement against the G-20 conference, and this art made the campus landscape more diverse. The shantytown could not be overlooked; it became a focal point and stirred up serious conversations. And, once the G-20 left Pittsburgh, so did the structure. It could never have survived as a permanent installation on campus, which made its message all the more appreciated.
Carnegie Mellon prides itself on innovation and change; it only makes sense for its actual landscape to reflect these values. Spaces like the art park on Forbes Avenue, which was created in 2010 for small temporary art installations that change on a regular basis, could be used more frequently. Promoting more temporary art installations dispersed throughout campus will demonstrate how creative and passionate our student body is, as well as bring the university’s environment to life.

Modern American culture gives us many enlightening images of women. As the respected philosopher Beyoncé once defined the struggle for feminine independence and security, “If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it.” She continued: “Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh oh; whoa oh oh, oh oh oh!” Cultural critic Katy Perry added, regarding feminine attractiveness and decision-making, “I kissed a girl, and I liked it. The taste of her cherry chapstick. I kissed a girl just to try it.” And in the last few months, I’ve observed a new phrase that girls use, a new way that women express who they are: by peeing themselves.
Perhaps I should clarify with some examples. Sometimes the phrase is used in times of excitement: “I saw that Chris Brown is coming to Pittsburgh, and I think I peed myself a little.” Sometimes it’s used in times of fear: “I took that bio quiz, and I pretty much peed myself.” Sometimes it’s used in times of surprise: “I just saw that cute guy — you know, that one I met last week? — at that one party? — and he was coming down the hall, but I don’t think he actually has a class in Gates — oh my gosh I practically peed myself.”
Of course, there’s also the tried-and-true peeing in times of laughter: “I laughed so hard I peed myself!”
In short, the modern woman reacts to emotional stimulation by voiding her bladder.
It’s hard to say how widespread this phenomenon is. Statistics are hard to come by on this front. Personally, I noticed it three times in the last week: once from my sister who’s just out of high school, once from a student here at Carnegie Mellon, and once from a woman who’s graduated and is part of the workforce. So I won’t say it’s quite become an epidemic, but incidents of women renouncing control of their urinary functions are definitely on the rise.
Uncontrolled waste evacuation is something people take medicine to fix. It likens women to puppies who are overwhelmed by unusual experiences. What is it about this self-imposed powerlessness that makes it so popular? I’m not sure. Girls can be pretty smart, though. Maybe this is a good habit and the rest of us just need to learn how to do it.
First, let’s focus on phrasing. When peeing oneself, a lot of the other words in the sentence are just for effect. Guys, if a girl says she “thinks” she’s peed herself, it’s not a matter of uncertainty. And if she says she’s peed herself “a little,” this is cause for neither celebration nor alarm. It’s probably her saving up in case she needs to pee herself later.
We should also talk about context. If a girl wearing a skirt says, “I think I just peed my pants,” don’t point out the contradiction. Speaking of skirts, guys, it was a turning point in my life when I learned the difference between a skirt and a dress. At the risk of ushering you into manhood more quickly than you might desire, here it goes: Skirts are just the bottom part; dresses are the whole thing. Did that just blow your mind?
But back to the issue at hand. What we guys are still missing in order to appropriately pee ourselves is an appropriate setting.
“Dude, have you seen the ad for Modern Warfare 3? I think I peed myself a little.” Not bad, but any girl who pees herself would say that your peeing could use more emotional specificity. Make it really count for something.
“He scored! 2–1 Pens! I just peed my pants.” Good emotional content, but peeing is usually retroactively expressed. 
“Honey, remember watching the Pens game last night? When we won I peed myself a little.” Nailed it.
Is peeing yourself just a fad? Only time will tell. Maybe it will be like 19th-century fainting. Movies will show a representative pooling of crotch liquid on the holoscreen and future movie-goers will say, “Wow, these 21st-century movies are great. I wonder if that kind of daily-life stuff actually happened.” Then on the bottom of the screen they’ll see a reference for historical background, a reference to this article. The honor! I think I just... nope, I can’t do it. Girls, why are you so obsessed with peeing yourselves?

I am writing in regard to Emily Dobler’s article “HPV vaccine touches off larger discussion on sex.” Miss Dobler’s article applauds California’s recent passage of a bill that would allow minors as young as 12 to receive the HPV vaccine, and accuses the conservatives who opposed the measure of having some sort of complex about sex. I disagree with Miss Dobler on the quality of the bill. Furthermore, her accusations toward those who oppose her are detrimental to the entire discussion of the issue.
Before I begin, I’d like to say that I am not against the HPV vaccine in general. Cervical cancer is a terrible disease, and this vaccine is incredibly effective at stopping it. However, there are several issues with the vaccine and the bill in question.
First and foremost is the cost. To fully receive the HPV vaccine, a patient must make three visits to the doctor’s office over six months. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each of these visits will cost $130, for a total of $390. That cost is astronomical in comparison to another common vaccine, the MMR booster shot, which will run you $50 and protect you from three life-threatening diseases.
Admittedly, this is not a fair comparison. The HPV vaccine is brand new and as such is not available as a generic. However, that is precisely the point. It is too soon for legislation about the HPV vaccine. The cost is too great for the 40 million Americans without health insurance.
Next, let’s consider the bill in question. Currently, California minors can seek treatment for STDs without parental consent, but must still get parental consent for the HPV vaccine. This bill makes parental approval unnecessary to receive the vaccine. As Miss Dobler says, 
“[u]pon first glance, this does not seem like such a big deal.” But let’s look at those numbers again. This bill allows 12-year-olds to make $400 purchases. I wouldn’t trust a 12-year-old to spend $20 wisely.
Who is paying for these shots? The California government? And here I thought they were on the verge of bankruptcy. Are parents paying for the vaccine? I hope they’re not among the 40 million Americans without health insurance or the 9 percent of Americans who are unemployed.
Finally, let’s look at what happens if a young girl does not get the HPV vaccine. According to the National Cancer Institute, there are approximately 11,000 incidences of cervical cancer in the U.S. annually. The majority of the women diagnosed have never had a pap smear or haven’t received one in the last five years.
What is a pap smear? It is a routine part of any gynecological exam specifically designed to check for cervical diseases. Even after getting the shot, doctors still recommend regular pap smears.
These are a few of the legitimate criticisms of the bill that Miss Dobler chooses to ignore. Instead, she focuses on Michelle Bachmann’s and Rick Perry’s opposition to the bill, pinning it on their own discomfort with sex. In fact, it’s all about Rick Perry. In 2007, Perry signed an executive order that would have made the HPV vaccine available through the state vaccination program, reducing the cost and requiring sixth grade girls to get the vaccine unless their parents opted them out. This order was soon overturned in the legislature, and Perry’s been back-pedalling since.
Why? Because Merck, makers of Gardasil — the only HPV vaccine in 2007 — have donated significant funds to Rick Perry’s re-election campaigns for governor, according to the Washington Post. In fact, his former chief of staff and current runner of a pro-Perry PAC, Mike Toomey, worked as a lobbyist for Merck when his order was passed. Perry is trying to look like he isn’t in the pocket of his contributors, despite all evidence to the contrary.
Instead of allowing children to spend hundreds of dollars unsupervised, we should encourage them to receive routine medical treatment. We can still discuss sex — but let’s do so in a more cost-efficient manner.

As GOP candidates try to distinguish themselves in their bid for the presidential nomination, Herman Cain and his 999 tax plan stand out. While many agree that our tax system is exceptionally complicated and in need of reform and simplification, few act on these beliefs; Cain actually proposes to do something radical and innovative about it.
Cain wants to scrap the current system, eliminate all taxes and loopholes, and replace them with a 9 percent tax on personal income, a 9 percent corporate tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. These taxes would gradually shift toward what Cain calls the “Fair Tax,” a 30 percent national sales tax.
Many criticize this plan as having two problems. The first is that it may not raise enough revenue. According to political blogger Axel D. Whiteman, under current economic conditions, the plan would decrease revenue by $387 billion. But this doesn’t account for economic growth. Though there is no way to know how much this plan would stimulate the economy, some think that it would incentivize corporate spending, which would then create growth. With this growth, many believe the GDP would increase, resulting in more taxable transactions. It’s disputable, but many people think that once growth is accounted for, the plan would be revenue neutral.
The other problem with this system is that it is comprised of two personal flat taxes, which do nothing to redistribute income. Because of this, people believe these taxes will hit low-income earners much harder than high-income earners and will allow the rich to get richer. Others argue that the flat income tax and the added sales tax affect the wealthy more because the wealthy spend more.
This plan’s redeeming qualities, however, cannot be overlooked. I believe that shifting from production taxation to consumption taxation under the 999 plan is beneficial for society. Taking the tax burden away from production incentivizes innovation, corporate growth, hiring, and small business creation — all of which benefit society.
The second redeeming quality of this plan is its innovative and radical thinking about tax reform. Right now our tax system is difficult to understand and creates complications. 
Simplifying the tax system — whether it’s a fair tax, a 999 plan, an elimination of loopholes, or a reduced rates bill — is a step toward making taxes simple and easy for small businesses and individuals.

While I agree with several of the criticisms in last week’s editorial regarding Senate Week, there are a couple I would like to respond to.
I do believe that Senate Week was actually quite effective at getting Senate’s name out to the campus community in a meaningful way. 
While the posters did not contain substantive information about what we did, our intent was to inform our constituents about who we are and what we do through one-on-one interactions that took place at the events during the week. 
From my personal experience and the experience of other Senators, I think that we did have meaningful interactions, and I do think that awareness of who Senators are and what Senators do increased significantly as a result of our efforts.
With that being said, I agree that there is a lot of work for us to do in terms of PR, and we are not yet at a satisfactory place.
Ensuring that we are both more transparent and available to our constituents is something that we are going to be focusing on throughout the rest of the semester. I think that The Tartan will be a valuable resource for helping us do so, as I know we are already planning on sharing more information about our meetings with readers through a weekly column. 
I would appreciate hearing further feedback from Tartan members and students in general, and I can be contacted at student-senate@andrew.cmu.edu.

As much as we try to avoid them, labels can sometimes be important. This week, think about the labels you assign to the people in your life. Are they all correct, or could some stand a bit of relabeling?
Say it with me: Midterms are not stressful. Midterms are not stressful.
Like most technologies, TV has become more interactive, but yelling at the people in your TV shows will not change the outcome of the episode. Please stop.
Inspire yourself this week by listening to famous Shakespearean soliloquies. You might not understand everything being said, but the intended emotions will be clear.
Stop lusting over new phones. You’re already in a relationship with your current phone, and the fact that you openly cheat on it by looking for a new model is just shameful.
Fall is here, and that means it is time to gather up all of your favorite sweaters. Everyone will find your collection amazing — especially your vintage Bill Cosby sweater.
Psst. Hey you. Yeah, you. Hey, guess what? You have a lot of patience; don’t let irritating things or people ruin that quality.
It is your mission to collect all of the fallen leaves on campus. Failure to put the leaves into perfect piles and get your friends to jump onto them will result in dire consequences.
Love is like an addiction, so make sure to enjoy it in moderation as well.
You talk a lot, but are you really saying anything? Stop assuming others’ reactions and just say what’s really on your mind.
There is a fine line between passion and obsession. This week, make sure that line is clearly marked, or prepare to be judged.
Pump up the jams and party, but not so hard — you have midterms this week. Skip the hardcore music and load your Kidz Bop playlist instead.
