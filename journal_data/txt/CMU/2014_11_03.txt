The Carnegie Mellon football team lost to Thiel University on Saturday, 40–27. Thiel won the coin toss but deferred to the Tartans and defended the east goal. After a scoreless first quarter in which both teams dug in defensively, resulting in four consecutive three-and-outs, Carnegie Mellon went on a 26-yard drive which ended on a close miss just right of the goalpost from first-year punter/kicker Tyler Kohman from 32 yards out.
Thiel began the second quarter with an impressive 14-play, 80-yard drive in just under six minutes. After a 6-yard rush by Thiel, the team’s quarterback threw two consecutive incomplete passes, one of which was batted away by junior cornerback Vince Demarchi. On fourth and four at CMU’s 23-yard line, Thiel ran for the touchdown. The Thiel kicker was able to convert the point after attempt. The Tomcats continued their offensive production on a seven-play, 59-yard run that led to an 8-yard touchdown pass.
However, their point after attempt was blocked by junior cornerback Ryan Aitken. This play energized the Tartans, and on the following drive, they were able to lead a sequence of third- and fourth-down conversions (the latter of which came via a Thiel roughing the passer penalty), capped by a 1-yard rush by first-year running back Sam Benger for the touchdown. Kohman was able to convert the point after attempt.
Thiel had possession at the start of the second half, and quickly went on a five-play, 81-yard drive capped by a tremendous 53-yard pass. At the 8:35 mark, Thiel scored once again on a six-play, 70-yard drive that ended with a 44-yard pass. However, this time Thiel failed the point after attempt. Carnegie Mellon was unable to close out the third quarter strongly, as their responding drive was cut short due to two sacks on junior quarterback Andrew Hearon.
Thiel started off the fourth by finishing up a nine-play, 75-yard drive with a one-yard rush by Thiel for the touchdown. The Tartans were able to strike back this time, completing a 14-play, 75-yard drive highlighted by fourth down conversions by Benger and Hearon and a 13-yard touchdown pass from Hearon to senior wide receiver Shae Sealey. Kohman’s point-after attempt failed, but he was able to capitalize on the next kickoff with a 14-yard onside kick that was recovered by Carnegie Mellon on their own 49-yard line. Hearon once again led the Tartan offense on a seven-play, 51-yard touchdown drive that ended with a 30-yard pass from Hearon to junior wide receiver Max Reinertsen. Kohman attempted another onside kick but this one was recovered by Thiel on their own 45-yard line. Thiel was able to respond to Carnegie Mellon’s two consecutive touchdown drives by going on a 55-yard scoring drive ending with an 8-yard touchdown rush with 58 seconds remaining. A scrambling Carnegie Mellon team went on a three-play, 54-yard run in only 44 seconds that was capped by junior quarterback Evan Englert’s pass to Reinertsen for a 19-yard touchdown. However, with only four seconds left on the clock after this run, Thiel was able to run out the clock for the victory.
The Tartans are now 3–5, (3–5). They will attempt to rebound as they continue their schedule against the University of Chicago on Saturday.

On a mild but windy Tuesday evening, the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took on the Penn State Behrend Lions. While quite a few Penn State supporters turned out to root for the visiting team, the Tartans set an aggressive tone early and never relented.
Both teams came into the game with plenty of excitement and energy, but the Tartans struck first as first-year outside defender Alex Moy scored off of a corner kick from first-year midfielder Tori Iatarola within the first two minutes of the game. “I got a really good corner kick from Tori,” Moy said after the game, crediting the communication the players shared on the field. “Everyone understands.”
Energized by the encouraging start, the Tartans continued to attack the Lions, keeping up the pressure early and often. Twenty minutes in, senior forward Savina Reid fielded a pass from first-year midfielder Morgan Kontor and pushed through two Lions players en route to scoring the second goal of the night. Iatarola scored on a free kick 11 minutes later, putting the Tartans up 3–0.
Following the onslaught of scores, the rest of the game featured the Tartans preventing any sort of comeback from Behrend. While the Tartans did not score for the rest of the game, they continued to keep the pressure on Behrend’s defense, allowing few chances for the Lions to go on the attack.
On the occasions when the Lions managed to penetrate the other half of the field, the Carnegie Mellon defense was there to stop any momentum Behrend managed, and sophomore goalkeeper Katie Liston only needed to save two shots on goal. Liston credited the defense for making her job a lot easier: “I love the chemistry of our defense,” Liston said, explaining how players have stepped up for one another and played as a unit. “Our coach has a saying: ‘Defend like your lives depend on it,’ ” she said. Needless to say, the team has taken that mentality to heart, having only allowed five goals all season.
Liston also noted that the team has quite a few first-years on the starting team playing well. “One of the things that make us special is how a lot of freshmen are starting,” she said. She attributed their success to their eagerness to learn from older players on the team and to the exceptional coaching staff.
Liston and the rest of the Tartans spent some time after the game signing soccer balls for the local U11 youth soccer team. “I feel cool,” she said, talking about how she had been in their shoes and now she and other players on the team are being looked up to.
The Tartans followed up their performance with a hard-fought win on Friday against the Case Western Spartans. Liston once again guided the defense to a shutout as the offense wore down the Spartan defense until Reid cashed in on a corner kick from first-year defender Katie Strycharz with only eight seconds remaining in the game.

This article should be about the thrilling David versus Goliath tale that just unfolded in front of our eyes as the San Francisco Giants won their third World Series in five years in a thrilling seven game series that topped the Kansas City Royals, who were making their first postseason appearance since 1985.
This article should be about the incredible regular season where the standings flipped multiple times, as perceived sharks like the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox were devoured by minnows like the Baltimore Orioles.
This article should be about the amazing individual performances from all sorts of unlikely sources. We witnessed the emergence of young sluggers in Chicago White Sox first baseman José Abreu and Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, despite this mini dead-ball era. We might see a pitcher win the National League MVP after the stunning season turned in by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw. We saw Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout continue his reign as baseball’s brightest star. We watched Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas reverse the popular narrative on him, from just another bust to a playoff hero. We saw Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner cement his status as maybe the greatest World Series pitcher ever, mowing down Royals like the French Revolution.
This article is not about any of that. Despite the string of classic October clashes, this article is not about the heart-stopping postseason that just played out over the past month, because the phrase heart-stopping is just a figure of speech. The excitement pales in comparison to the unfortunately real heart-dropping feeling that accompanied news of former Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras’ death Sunday, Oct. 26th.  Details on his death are sparse, but he died, along with his girlfriend, in an automobile accident.
This story came out during game five of the World Series, which was still tight at the time. 
This should have been an exciting moment for baseball fans as they witnessed a masterpiece by Bumgarner. However, no one could watch anymore by the sixth inning. Every baseball fan I knew was in shock, and at a loss for words. 
Some held out hope that the story was simply another Twitter hoax and that we would wake up tomorrow to the Taveras family denying the nasty rumor.
By the end of the night, it was confirmed that Taveras was dead.
Taveras was supposed to be a hero: the next great home-grown Cardinal, and another example of the greatness of the Cardinal Way. He was a star at the minor league level, a prodigious hitter and a solid fielder. He homered in his very first game in St. Louis, in his second at bat, and in his final game in St. Louis — exactly two weeks before his death. He struggled at times as a rookie, but that was to be expected. At 22 years old, he had a bright future once he got used to Major League pitching.  That future is gone.
His talent and potential are not what makes this death so tragic. Baseball lost one of its best young players on one of its most beloved organizations, but the pain digs even deeper. Part of being a sports fan is giving an immense level of respect to the athletes who pour their lives into maximizing their talent and making the product fans watch on television so awe inspiring and captivating. In baseball, that level of respect is emphasized even more since every moment is a one-on-one battle between the pitcher and the hitter. 
A baseball fan will gain a level of familiarity with most of the players in the league. Even the stars of the teams we hate still hold meaning to us. The animosity is contrived, but the personal connection is real, even if it is obviously a one-way street. These are real people, with extremely familiar names and faces, who often have gripping tales of their past or present. To lose one is like losing a close friend. To lose one so young is a nightmare.
This baseball season was a treat to any fan of the sport. In contrast, the loss of Taveras is truly a gut punch. In a year where no one could possibly have predicted the twists and turns that led to one of the most exciting months of baseball in recent memory, the back half of the World Series became almost irrelevant. Several players inscribed OT #22, his initials and number, on their hats. Fans and players grieved, and sent their condolences to the Taveras family, who must be dealing with utter heartbreak at the moment. The loss is a tough pill for the whole baseball world to swallow, and all of our thoughts are with them through this tragedy. 
Taveras will go down in history as a tale of greatness never realized, stolen far too soon.
Rest in peace, Oscar Taveras. You will be missed.

On Sunday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s soccer teams hosted the University of Rochester in a University Athletic Association (UAA) conference double header.
The fourth-ranked women’s team started off the day on a good note as they recorded their fifth conference victory and 11th shutout of the season with a 5–0 thrashing of the Yellowjackets.
Senior forward Savina Reid started the scoring parade in the 26th minute with her 10th goal of the season coming off of a one-timer over the keeper coming from a cross from first-year forward Sienna Stritter. The Tartans weren’t content to have just a one-goal lead and kept the pressure on when first-year midfielder Tori Iatarola took a shot in the 30th minute. While Iatarola didn’t connect with the back of the net, she did manage to hit the crossbar, and first-year midfielder Morgan Kontor was able to knock in the ensuing rebound for her third goal of the season.
Carnegie Mellon kept the pressure up with Stritter determined to find the back of the net. Finally, on her fourth shot in the span of less than 10 minutes, Stritter was able to knock one past the goalie as she dribbled through the defense and put the ball right between the keeper’s hands in the 40th minute for her third goal of the season.
After coming out of half with a 3–0 lead, Iatarola decided it was her time to finally hit net and scored in the 52nd minute on a one-timer off a cross from first-year defender Katie Strycharz, pushing the lead to four and marking Iatarola’s fourth goal of the season. 
The rest of the game was more conservative, as the Tartans took their foot off the gas and focused on just wrapping up their assured victory. The final goal of the match came in the 88th minute when sophomore defender Samantha Smith snuck a long ball past the defense to first-year forward Alyssa Brandt, who took one touch before chipping it over the keeper for her first goal of the season.
With this shutout win, sophomore goalkeeper Katie Liston tied the Carnegie Mellon record for single season records for shutouts (11) and wins (14) and will have one more game to claim both records outright when the Tartans finish up the regular season and UAA play at home on Saturday against Emory University.
The men’s team was up next, but was unable to capitalize on the momentum left behind from the women’s dominance, and they eventually fell 2–1.
The first half was rough for the Tartans, as they did not manage a single shot on goal, but required four saves from their keeper, senior Jacob Rice, to keep the game tied 0–0 going into the half.
Midway through the second half, Carnegie Mellon found some offense through a combination of skill and luck. Sophomore midfielder Tristan Lockwood took the ball toward the goal and scared the Yellowjacket keeper into charging before Lockwood tapped the ball to open first-year forward Ryan Stinebaugh, who didn’t miss the wide open net in front of him for his first goal of the season in the 70th minute.
As the game neared the end, it looked like that one goal would be enough for the Tartans to pull out a victory, but Rochester had other ideas. 
In the 84th minute, the Yellowjackets got a lucky bounce on a rebound off of Rice and buried the equalizer before taking the lead, and eventually the win, on a goal in the 86th minute off a set piece header.
The men will be trying to break their 2–2–2 conference record in their final match of the regular and UAA season when they host Emory University as part of the doubleheader on Saturday.

Volleyball
On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team finished off their regular season when they traveled to Allegheny College.
The Tartans quickly fell behind 2–0, losing the first two sets 16–25, 22–25 before rallying back to tie the match at 2–2, with back-to-back 25–18 wins. Unfortunately, Allegheny regained their composure and finished off the match 11–15 to win 3–2. Sophomores middle blocker Jackie Gibbons and defensive specialist Molly Higgins were dominant in both facets of the game, with Gibbons recording a team-high 15 kills and game-high five blocks, while Higgins led the team with 27 digs.
The Tartans will next host the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship beginning on Friday. Carnegie Mellon will enter the tournament as the third seed.
Cross Country
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country teams competed in the UAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday, hosted by Washington University.
For the women, junior Elizabeth Snyder was the highest placing finisher for Carnegie Mellon, placing eighth with a time of 22:13.04. Overall the Tartans finished fifth as a team, also helped by a strong showing from senior Erin Kiekhaefer, who finished 13th individually with a time of 22:36.61. Both Snyder and Kiekhaefer finished high enough to earn second team all–UAA honors.
On the men’s side, senior George Degen was the best for Carnegie Mellon, and everyone else racing, as he took the top individual spot with a time of 25:05.85, crossing the line more than two seconds before the next competitor.  
Degen’s individual win was the Tartans’ first since 1993, when Jim Langer took the crown. His first place finish was also good enough for All-UAA first team honors.
As a team, the Tartans finished second overall, combining Degen’s win with 10th and 11th place finishes by junior Marc–Daniel Julien and senior Joshua Antonson. Julien finished with a time of 25:40.61, while Antonson finished in 25:41.24, with both times good enough to earn All-UAA second team honors. 
The Tartans will next compete at the NCAA regionals on Saturday, Nov. 15.

Millions of people use Google everyday to search and navigate through the Internet. Using smarter searching algorithms, finding a match based on a keyword or phrase has become faster and more efficient, even as the size of the Internet continues to grow. Similarly, with the growing collection of genetic data, computational biologists are striving to develop their own algorithms to overcome the challenge of efficiently using the data for advancements in biology and medicine.
In support of this research, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has awarded Carl Kingsford, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Lane Center for Computational Biology, with one of its fourteen Moore Investigators in Data-Driven Discovery Awards. This five-year, $1.5 million grant will support Kingsford and his research team in their efforts to develop advanced algorithms for genetic data searching. 
The past few decades have seen a burst in the available genomic data with improvements in biological techniques and increased interest in understanding biology from a genomic perspective. A large amount of this interest can be seen in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Kingsford explained that the Moore award was given with the mission of “finding new uses for existing large datasets to use the data in ways that those who collected the data may not have expected.”
Genomic data exists primarily as sequences of four different letters that represent the four different base pairs in a DNA or RNA nucleic acid molecule. It is now understood that the specific sequence of letters is key to biological function. These searching algorithms have to be able to take a sequence of letters of varying size, and search through a massive database for another similar sequence.
Kingsford says that many ask, “Why not just ‘Google’ it?” However, he explained that searching for a string of words is completely different from searching through biological data. First off, there are many types of data, from DNA sequences to high throughput RNA sequence data, and each must utilize different techniques to match sequences. Furthermore, exact matches are rare, so sequences are compared based on their similarity to see if they can be related to having the same function in an organism.
For biologists, this information is extremely important. For example, experiments that analyze a biological function or a disease may identify that a sequence of DNA is highly expressed. In order to identify the function of this sequence and the biological role it plays, biologists need the ability to compare the sequence to those with known functions in the database.
Currently, Kingsford’s group is working to develop a unique method of building a database that will make it easier to search through gene expression data. Kingsford explained that each sequence is first broken into smaller fragments of size k called k-mers. The k-mers are then stored in structures called bloom filters which are essentially subsets of all the possible k-mers. These bloom filters are then used to construct a tree where the roots extending from any point of the tree will contain all the k-mers at that point. Thus, when searching for a match, instead of searching through all the sequences and comparing similarities, this approach quickly identifies where in the database the matching sequences exist by finding the number of matching k-mers.
Kingsford explained that improvements in searching and utilizing genomic data will help reduce the number of experiments biologists will have to conduct, and help speed up the rate of discovery.
Kingsford’s open-source project, Sailfish, was recently shown to drastically improve the time it takes to analyze gene expression data. The Data-Driven Discovery Award strongly supports those who have experience and success in this field, and open source projects. Kingsford and his team will continue to utilize the funding to develop smarter techniques, in order to aid advances in biological research.

As the world becomes more connected through advancements in technology and communication, interdisciplinary and collaborative studies become increasingly significant in the scientific community. Philip LeDuc, a professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon studying the mechanical aspects of cellular communication, is one of many researchers involved in this type of collaborative research.
LeDuc led a research team along with Lance Davidson, an associate professor of bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, and William C. Messner, department chair and professor of mechanical engineering at Tufts University School of Engineering, which used a microfluidic control system to understand how mechanics play a role in how cells communicate.
“It’s a fantastic collaboration between Davidson, a developmental biologist, Messner, who is interested in control theory from a mechanical perspective, and me, who is interested in cell mechanics and applying microtechnologies to biology,” LeDuc explained. “The three of us are all corresponding authors, so it was a great instance of what happens when you bring people from different thought patterns together.”
The research team aimed to stimulate the local region of a tissue, and observe how this signal was propagated throughout the rest of the tissue, in order to determine the significance of mechanics in cell signaling. The use of non-bioengineered tissue allowed the model to be truly a physiological representation, but created obstacles regarding local stimulation. “We took tissue that was already physiological and observed how it works together, but local stimulation is hard to do in biology,” LeDuc said. “If you have a piece of tissue, and pipette in a chemical on top of it, the chemical diffuses within seconds over the entire tissue, so you can’t have local stimulation for long periods of time.”
In order to overcome this obstacle, the team used a microfluidics based system composed of two streams. Each stream was in laminar flow, meaning the streams flowed in parallel layers without lateral mixing. By flowing a chemical over one side of the tissue, the researchers were able to locally stimulate the tissue. “We flowed a chemical over local regions of the tissue which caused a mechanical contraction inside of the system,” LeDuc explained. “We then watched the way the entire 3-D population responded.”
With the ability to locally stimulate a tissue, the researchers were able to test chemical versus mechanical signaling in order to understand the mechanisms involved in cell signal propagation. 
“Most people assume cell signaling is immediately chemical,” LeDuc said. “In most cases this is true, but in this case we’re looking at contractility which is a mechanical sense.” The researchers used a chemical called heptanol to determine how much of cell signaling is chemical and how much is mechanical. “Heptanol shuts down the cell’s ability to chemically send signals back and forth by inhibiting their cell junctions,” explained LeDuc.
The researchers found that when chemical signaling was inhibited, propagation was decreased twofold, versus a fourfold decrease in propagation when mechanical signaling was inhibited. This implies that mechanical signaling functions as an important part of cell signaling. “Mechanical signaling is actually twice as important as chemical signaling in this particular context, which runs against the current paradigm; people usually say it’s all chemical,” LeDuc said. “Chemistry still dominates, but mechanics affects chemistry.” LeDuc noted that this research could have various applications in the future. “We are not specifically focused on tackling a disease, but these results could lead to advances in various areas,” LeDuc said.
Cell communication plays an integral part in tissue development. This understanding of cell signaling could lead to advancements in the understanding and treatment of aging and birth defects, both areas that involve the growth and proliferation of cells.
One can also draw a parallel to cancer research. Embryonic development involves rapid growth, while cancer involves a loss of control of rapid growth. Understanding the mechanisms behind cell communication and how this affects the rapid growth could potentially lead to advancements in cancer research and treatment.
The research was published in the Sept. 23 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Despite comprehensive civil rights legislation that has improved the quality of life in the U.S., there is still a lot that needs to be done. For 30.6 million people with physical disabilities, ambulatory activities present many hardships. About half of those people have reported using assistive aid, including wheelchairs, canes, crutches. or walkers. Consequently, many city streets, sidewalks, and businesses are inaccessible for individuals that rely on assistive aid. For example, a pole positioned in the middle of a sidewalk panel would be considered an inaccessible place for a person traveling on a wheelchair.
However, quickly reconstructing such areas is not feasible for many cities, especially ones that are burdened by economic constraints. Yet, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Maryland Jon Froehlich believes that the solution to the problem lies in developing mechanisms to identify accessible places and making that data available for individuals who need it.
On Wednesday, Froehlich shared his vision and research with Carnegie Mellon as part of a lecture series hosted by the university’s Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII). Titled “Characterizing Physical World Accessibility at Scale Using Crowdsourcing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning,” the lecture focused on novel scalable data-collection methods for obtaining information about how accessible manmade places are.
In collaboration with graduate students from his research group Makeability Lab, along with another Maryland computer science professor David Jacobs, Froehlich used a combination of crowdsourcing, computer vision, and online map imagery (i.e. Google Street View) within a series of projects.
Crowdsourcing, in this case, involves asking human subjects to identify and label inaccessible areas when given photos on the computer. Similarly, computer vision (CV) uses computer algorithms to identify such areas. By separately applying crowdsourcing and CV to images taken from Google Street View (GSV) — a search engine that showcases panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world — the members of the Makeability Lab were able to experiment with methods in which accessibility information could be collected and visualized.
However, Froehlich also presented the limitations in his methods. With crowdsourcing comes subjectivity and significant time consumption. In one study, crowd workers were found to identify areas that did not actually present inaccessibility issues. In contrast, the CV technique worked more quickly. But given the automated nature of computer algorithms, CV was statistically found to show less accurate results. Additionally, the age of many GSV images overlooked recent reconstruction of inaccessible areas.
Keeping these problems in mind, Froehlich and his group focused on combining crowdsourcing and CV. From their work, they developed the first “smart” system, Tohme, which incorporates two work flows: human labeling and CV labeling with human verification. The work flows are scheduled dynamically based on predicted performance. In their research, they used 1,086 GSV images of street intersections in four North American cities, as well as data from 403 crowd workers.
From their results, they saw that the system was able to perform similarly to crowdsourcing alone, but with a 13 percent reduction in time costs. While the study only focused on curb ramps, the group believes that the approaches used in developing Tohme can be applied to other locational obstacles. Pointing out room for improvement in Tohme, Froehlich also emphasized the need for more advanced computer and machine algorithms. Nevertheless, he believes that Tohme can be made more efficient.
During the question-and-answer portion of the seminar, many attendees expressed their fascination with Froehlich’s research, which may potentially improve the lives of many people struggling with physical disabilities. 
In addition, Froehlich’s lecture presented many implications of the increasing role of data collection in everyday lives.

This week at Pugwash, we discussed the relationship between academia and military research — specifically, whether or not military research should occur at academic institutions at all, as opposed to national labs. In addition, we discussed the intricacies of military research, such as confidentiality and how it may complicate academic research for military purposes.
Most Pugwash members agreed that military research at academic institutions is a good thing on principle. Several members objected on the basis that universities are places of learning, which is incompatible with military goals. Most felt that this argument was misguided, as military research can be of massive public benefit, as with the Internet or the highway system. Further, universities are ideal places for research because they often employ the most capable minds. Our military research is important; it keeps Americans safe. Universities conducting military research make sure our military is equipped with the highest possible level of technology.
A more contentious point was the idea of confidentiality. While some members held that confidentiality of military research was what allowed us to truly have a technological edge, some felt this came with significant drawbacks.
Many groups who define themselves as in opposition to America are largely populated by engineers and other people who could easily replicate American technology if the research was published and publicly available. This makes it harder for America to achieve foreign policy objectives and use the military to intervene in cases like what is currently happening with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The weapons ISIS has access to are very old, but our military research is moving along so slowly that they have basically replicated American infantry and can reproduce the weapons through reverse engineering. This is why, given the ability of universities to produce good research, the confidentiality of that research also comes with the territory of trying to produce an effective military.
On the other hand, confidentiality means a lack of accountability. Mistakes in the research are not caught if they are not publicly available and peer reviewed. While a lack of peer review could be solved via policies like security-trained peer reviewers, this would allow for massive potential of security leaks and would defeat the purpose of confidential research.
However, allowing this confidential research to contain and compound errors also prevents us from achieving the technological edge confidential research is supposed to produce. In addition, situations like the one in Iraq and Syria with ISIS are inevitable when we arm and train our foreign allies. We tend to do a slipshod job, and this policy is largely ineffective. The consistent advancement of this technology giving us this ability might be tricking us into thinking we should use an empirically terrible military strategy.
Finally, the moral situation of the researchers is very precarious. While the military offers huge amounts of money to allow research to happen, a number of people are morally opposed to many actions of the military. This situation may make researchers morally responsible for people’s deaths, despite not intending for their technology to be used in such a way. While some military technology could be used for the benefit of humanity, large swathes of it are used to kill in ways not intended by researchers, and the confidentiality of the research masks the initial purpose of what is being produced. This confidentiality can hurt the reputations and legacies of people who were instrumental in achieving American foreign policy objectives.
Confidentiality is both intrinsic to military research and highly controversial. Ultimately, while confidential military research may give America an edge that cannot be replicated, the pitfalls of confidentiality could end up harming American interests, as well as those on the academic side of the equation. It is not ideal, but it may be our only chance at retaining an edge.

By now, you’ve probably heard about a magical device that creates all sorts of objects with the click of a button. You’ve probably heard the word “3-D printer” many times, but how do these devices operate? And most importantly, what can we do with them now and in the future?
3-D printing is the process of making solid objects from digital files. The first machine capable of doing so was invented by Chuck Hull in 1984 and used a process called stereolithography that added layers to an object based on its 2-D cross sections. The material that the object was to be built of would be added in small layers to create a 3-D object, the process of which is called additive manufacturing. This process is very similar to the formation of stalactites and stalagmites, where small layers of minerals are added continuously by water to form a rock formation. This idea makes up the foundation of practical 3-D printing.
In contrast, the method of subtractive manufacturing involves cutting unneeded material off an object to shape a new object. However, this process results in a lot of wasted material. By using additive manufacturing, lighter parts can be created with less energy used to 3-D print. According to energy.gov, this form of 3-D printing uses “up to 50 percent less energy for certain processes compared to conventional manufacturing processes.”
To 3-D print, we need some way to give the machine instructions for making something or, at least, a model of the object to be printed; this is commonly done using computer-aided design (CAD) software. Such software allows designs for any type of object to be converted into easy-to-understand inputs for the 3-D printer.
Once these instructions are sent to the computer, the printer begins to automatically build the object. It uses a process called material extrusion in which the material, usually plastic, is heated until liquefied and forced out of a small nozzle. Because the nozzles are extremely small, at around 0.1 millimeters in diameter, the printer can carefully place the material so that the material forms the design that was made in CAD.
At each step, it finishes a 2-D cross section of the object, very similar to how a glue gun works, as sticks of hardened glue are melted and extruded from the tip after being heated. As the material cools down, it fuses with the layers below. The platform that holds the object is then lowered, allowing the extruder to work on the next level of the 3-D object. This whole process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days depending on the object, which can be extremely large and detailed or composed of a few simple layers. After the object is printed, any excess dust or powder must be brushed off or unstuck from the base of the printer.
Over the past few years, the 3-D printer has become extremely important, and new types of 3-D printing have sprung up. For example, material jetting deposits plastic and uses light to harden it; this can produce extremely accurate parts.
There is also binder jetting, which allows thin layers of powder to be put on the platform and sprayed with a glue-like binding solution that is able to accurately combine only the parts that are specified by the CAD file. There is also a newer form of 3-D printing that uses special materials in order to create human body parts. Termed “bio-printers,” these machines use a combination of human cell and tissue in order to create human body parts.
As a result of this surge in interest for 3-D printers, people have been using sites such as Kickstarter to help foster the Maker Movement, which is a push to use 3-D printers to revolutionize business and personal technology. By providing more affordable 3-D printers, they hope to allow people to print products locally 
or even straight from their homes to reduce transportation costs and increase affordability.

Mammoth skeleton uncovered in Idaho reservoir 
Paleontologists have recently discovered a 70,000-year-old mammoth skeleton in Idaho’s American Falls Reservoir. 
Every year, when the water level drops in the reservoir, teams of paleontologists scour the beaches for fossils in the freshly eroded reservoir banks; one of the volunteers found the mammoth fossil on a cliff face 30 feet below the reservoir’s high-water level. Mary Thompson, a vertebrate paleontologist and senior collections manager at the Idaho Museum of Natural History, led a team to excavate parts of the tusk (which was 19 centimeters in diameter), skull, and teeth of the 16-year-old mammoth using plaster casts. Next year, Thompson hopes to get a better idea of the dimensions of the fossil with more advanced radar.

NASA identifies methane ice cloud in Titan’s strato
In 2009, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft picked up an image of a space cloud on Saturn’s moon, Titan, reminiscent of Earth’s own clouds near its poles. Recently, researchers have identified that the cloud contains methane ice, and a cloud of this nature has never been seen so high in Titan’s stratosphere before. Because clouds in Titan’s stratosphere require extreme cold, it was previously thought that only ethane clouds could form there. However, Carrie Anderson, a Cassini participating scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, has noted that the temperatures in Titan’s lower stratosphere are not consistent at all latitudes, allowing for the formation of the cloud. Scientists are eager to explore how this cloud will vary with seasonal changes on Titan.

Scientists make DNA wires that carry current 
Recent research, published by an international team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has demonstrated that electric current can be transmitted through long DNA molecules. 
Scientists participating in the study measured currents over 100 picoamperes traveling over 100 nanometers and were able to reliably reproduce their data. Lately, molecular electronics and nanocircuits have become an interest of study, and this potential breakthrough could lead to the development of DNA-based electronic circuits that are more sophisticated, cheaper, and simpler to make than those currently in use, according to Danny Porath, a professor at the university. 
The team published its findings in Nature Nanotechnology.

NASA’s rocket Antares deliberately destroyed
In the aftermath of NASA’s Antares rocket explosion, teams of investigators are examining the damage done to NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility. The unmanned rocket lifted off on Oct. 28 at 6:22 p.m., but roughly 6 seconds after the launch, there was a large explosion and pieces of the rocket scattered across the launch area. A spokesman for Orbital Sciences Corporation said that the rocket was deliberately destroyed after it became apparent there was a problem with it. Lost in the explosion were 5,000 pounds of supplies meant for the International Space Station, including a project called Drain Brain, which was designed to help learn more about blood flow in space, and an experiment called Meteor, which was designed to help detect meteor showers.

Scientists make enzyme that could explain origin of life
Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have devised an enzyme in a test tube with a unique property that could have been crucial to the origin of life on Earth. The new enzyme — called a ribozyme, since it is made from ribonucleic acid (RNA) — helps knit together a “copy” of a mirror image strand of RNA using the original RNA strand as a template. 
The team created the enzyme by catalyzing a quadrillion short RNA molecules of right-handed chirality. This “cross-chiral” enzyme could explain how RNA replication started on primitive Earth, according to Gerald F. Joyce, a professor in TSRI’s Departments of Chemistry and Cell and Molecular Biology and director of the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation.

Miniature human stomachs are grown in labs
Scientists have successfully grown the first fully functioning miniature human stomach from pluripotent stem cells. This intestinal “organoid” was grown in a dish containing mucus-making cells, very similar to how real stomachs grow. 
Scientists are hoping to study human gastric disease using these mini organs, which could lead to the creation of individualized intestinal patches to help those suffering from ulcers. Already, they have injected the mini stomach with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that more than half the world’s population is infected with, to see how the bacterium grows and infiltrates human stomachs.

Duane Michals styled himself an anti-artist, and in doing so, he became an important artist of his time.
The Carnegie Museum of Art exhibit Storyteller: Photographs of Duane Michals, which opened on Saturday, is devoted entirely to the McKeesport-raised artist. His many works, ranging widely across media and subjects, cover every wall of the deep exhibit space.
In the 1960s, emerging as a pioneer in his form, Michals prided himself on his lack of education in photography. “I never went to a photography school, which was my saving grace,” he said; occasional quotations from the artist are painted in a large, clean serif beside his works.
Michals fashioned himself an amateur in a world of narrow-minded photography, and no one can question that he crossed boundaries. More than craft or technique, his photographs, especially when viewed in sequence, are valuable at the conceptual level. Each piece leaves viewers with something distinct and sensational — an idea, a question, a feeling. It’s a phenomenon that defies any unifying kind of analysis, and can only be examined on an individual basis, distinct from work to work.
Photography and Reality
Immediately stepping into the exhibit space, it’s apparent Michals lives in a distant, high-up conceptual world. When visitors first enter the exhibit, they are greeted with a hanging translucent plaque, covered in the artist’s childish, scratched, sprawling cursive. It’s headlined in harsh caps, “A FAILED ATTEMPT TO PHOTOGRAPH REALITY.”
“How foolish of me to believe that it would be that easy,” Michals wrote. “I had confused the appearances of trees and automobiles and people with reality itself and believed that a photograph of these appearances to be a photograph of it.”
“I am a reflection photographing other reflections within a reflection,” Michals continued. “To photograph reality is to photograph NOTHING.”
It seems like a hopelessly abstract assessment. It has the desperate edge of an artist on the verge of what he’s seeking. Many of Michals’ works attempt to upend our notions of reality, if only momentarily, and it’s a sensation best experienced by viewing his works.
Things Are Queer
Maybe the best (and most proximate) example is “Things Are Queer,” one of the many photographic sequences Michals produced throughout his career: a horizontal series of nine frames, placed side by side and viewed chronologically, from left to right.
The first photo depicts a dingy, but otherwise unremarkable bathroom: toilet, bathtub, and sink. Hanging above the sink is an object too small to identify: Is it a mirror revealing the photographer’s indistinct shape, or a photograph within a photograph?
In the second frame, labeled “2,” a man’s hairy leg and foot emerges on the scene, giant in comparison to the bathtub and sink, cut off at the top. In “3,” the photo pans out further, revealing a man bent from the waist over a miniature bathroom setup in what appears to be a window display.
The first three slides are head-spinning enough, but the series doesn’t end there. In “4,” the same image “3” appears on the page of a book, thumbed down by an off-screen hand. In “5” and “6,” we see the owner of that thumb holding that small book at eye level, standing alone in a dark tunnel.
In “7” and “8,” we realize that the image of the man is framed on a wall above a sink. And the original mystery object above the sink is identified. The first and ninth photos are identical.
It’s an Inception-reminiscent cycle, with a similar mind-bending twist. It’s not clear what Michals intends to impart with this series, but we can guess it’s something along the lines of, “Things are not as they seem.”
Not all of Michals’ works weave such implicit messages, though. Some of them are scratched right onto the paper, in the artist’s own distinct inky cursive.
Black Is Ugly
On the wall opposite “Things Are Queer” hangs a seemingly unremarkable profile of an ordinary black man in a rough suit, looking ahead, lips pursed as if in mid-thought. Unlike the photo sequences, it stands alone, accompanied only by the artist’s uneven, looping scrawl below the photograph.
“All his life he believed the lies white men had told him,” Michals wrote. “He believed that black was ugly and a punishment from God, although he could not guess what his sin must have been. So he spent his life being cold when white men were warm, and being hungry when white men were fed.”
“And when I told him it was not true, he would not believe me,” Michals concluded. “It was too late.”
The caption, relayed in the artist’s own hand, gives the simple portrait a dynamism it could not have achieved on its own. The message is grand in scope, yet concise, powerful, and almost poetic in delivery.
Many of Michals’ portraits aren’t so politically infused. Most of them offer simple snapshots — skillfully captured, to be sure, but empty of direct commentary.
Portraiture
In addition to his deviations from the form, among Michals’ work are more than a few traditional portraits — some of everyday subjects, others of celebrities and artists. His 1958 “Children in Leningrad” is of National Geographic type, capturing three inquisitive children in a half-candid, half-posed state. The rightmost, taller girl stares expressionless above the photographer’s head, while the center girl stares the camera straight on, a lift to the corner of her mouth, rectangles of light reflecting white off her too-narrow round glasses. Half-obscured behind her, a boy peers, smiling, over her shoulder, his long hair tousled back and his face bearing a glint of hesitant curiosity.
Michals’ 1975 portrait of Meryl Streep is similarly half-posed, half-candid, though the subject is vastly different. This portrait shows the actress facing the camera, arms open, long hair lifting, eyebrows raised, mouth open as if in mid-sentence. Her expression verges on almost-surprise; instead, it’s a sort of spontaneity. Everything in this portrait is bursting with the potential for movement.
A Global Glimpse
These descriptions just scratch the surface, though. From even a casual walk-through of the exhibit, it’s apparent that the diversity of Michals’ works is unusual for an artist, especially a living one. In addition to portraits and photo sequences, Michals did commercial work as well — magazine and album covers — and his “Paris Stories,” a commissioned assignment, spans two walls with whimsical single-subject snapshots of a playful blond among various Paris monuments and landscapes.
At the exhibit’s end, it’s clear that the curator struggled to somehow tie the many straggling ends that represent Michals’ incredibly broad foray into photography and beyond. The most interesting item in the farthest-back room is a huge blown-up photo of a large pickle on a sterile-looking white plate and background. The accompanying quotation warns, “Never trust any photograph so large it can only fit inside a museum.” The automatic and necessary response is, “And look where it ended up.”
In a painfully timely display, “Self Portrait with Robin Williams” hangs on the adjacent wall, depicting a whimsical, photo-booth-like series, showing the artists laughing, embracing, and pointing at one another.
Michals is an enigma, to be sure. Where was he going with all this? The combinations of media, form, and technique he attempted seem almost haphazard in their diversity. Once he became bored with one genre, it seemed he jumped right to another. It’s no wonder the exhibit is segmented and strained in its attempt to unify this body of work.
A quotation on the final wall, though, may give us a clue. “When people ask me what I do,” Michals said, “I say I’m an expressionist. It’s about how well I express myself using writing or photography or painting or drawing.”
It’s a beautiful, if only partly satisfying, summary to Michals’ work. The haphazardness makes sense, and it takes on that same driving, almost desperate search for truth Michals tried to express in that first “FAILED ATTEMPT TO PHOTOGRAPH REALITY.” Michals isn’t a failed artist, but a dogged, resourceful one, unsatisfied with one medium or form — instead trying them all. His pieces originate in thought and took on whatever materials Michals thought best to express it. He isn’t an amateur so much as an explorer.
[ITAL]Storyteller: Photographs of Duane Michals[ITAL] is open at the Heinz Galleries of the Carnegie Museum of Art through Feb. 16. Admission to the galleries is free with Carnegie Mellon ID.

Granted that this is a broad over-simplification, there are typically two kinds of musical artists: those who achieve popularity and success on the back of one breakout hit, and those who slowly build a following by consistently releasing quality songs. Chicago-based electro-soul producer Manic Focus (birth name John McCarten) rests comfortably in the latter category. Classically trained on the piano at a young age, McCarten has been blending hip-hop beats with funky bass lines since 2011, releasing a new album each year that improves upon the last. While many of his early releases sounded like emulations of more successful artists in the genre, such as his Liberated Music label-mate GRiZ, the release of his fourth album Cerebral Eclipse, available for free download on his SoundCloud page, demonstrates that Manic Focus is establishing a sound much more his own.
Throughout Cerebral Eclipse, Manic Focus makes interesting use of samples that highlight some of the best elements of the electro-soul genre. “Just Another Fool” samples a blues guitar riff straight out of the haunted Mississippi Delta sounds of Robert Johnson, blending it with futuristic electronic bass that would make the Devil rather shake his hips than steal your soul.
“Space Scholar Synthesis,” a collaboration with producer Michal Menert, opens with soulful horns reminiscent of Motown before dropping into a blasting groove. Halfway through the track, every element falls into an abyss before roaring back into a triumphant drop. These kinds of exciting moves are one thing that electronic music has over traditional instruments: Without the power of a computer, artists don’t have such total control over the sound or nearly as many options of places to take the listener.
Electro-soul is known for being one of the most fun and danceable subgenres of EDM, and Manic Focus certainly delivers plenty of party-starting grooves on Cerebral Eclipse. “Rooster” features a funk that tangles around itself, the bass dancing up and down the register.
“Bumpin’ in the Voodoo,” a collaboration with saxophone-wielding Big Gigantic frontman Dominic Lalli, blazes right out of the speaker. Funky bass blasts, blaring horns, and an attitude-filled vocal sample makes this track an irresistible booty shaker. Lalli brings an incredibly catchy sax riff as well as a flaming solo to the table, taking “Voodoo” to a pretty sublime stratosphere.
“Travelin’ On My Mind,” a collaboration with jazz-electronic group The Coop, makes great use of all the participating artists’ strengths. Manic Focus provides a walking slap bass line and trip-hop drums, which The Coop then fill out with a lush soundscape of organs, wandering guitars, and shaking horns.
While there are plenty of bangers on Cerebral Eclipse, it is also in the diversity of moods that the album succeeds. “On The Horizon” floats in a calm ambiance, with a vocal sample that croons “I’m as high as I wanna be.” The track builds into a drop that proves quite calm, merely speeding things up a little without ruining the feel of the song.
Album closer “Life Goes On,” which features GRiZ, brings the album in for a soft landing after the turbulence of “Bumpin’ in the Voodoo.” Bright and watery organs ring over smooth jazz guitar, with playful drums that will keep you bobbing your head. A testament to the power of creative collaboration, this track is actually a decent departure from the typical sound of both artists in a very positive way. Sometimes two heads really are better than one.
Manic Focus has been a rising name in the genre since he arrived, and has certainly been getting places quickly. Last year, he opened for Gramatik in Pittsburgh, and this year, he is co-headlining with electronic hip-hop duo Break Science at Mr. Small’s Theatre on Nov. 6. Perhaps next year he’ll be solo billed. Given the trajectory his career is currently taking, I don’t see why not.

Taylor Swift set the tone for 1989, her fifth studio album, with the album’s first single, “Shake It Off”: The video shows Swift trying to fit into industry molds, but eventually ends up just dancing with her fans. The whole album is more self-aware than her past work — Swift knows her reputation and isn’t afraid to talk about it in 1989.
In “Blank Space,” Swift sings that she’s “Got a long list of ex-lovers/They’ll tell you I’m insane.” In “Shake It Off,” she sings that “I go on too many dates/But I can’t make them stay/At least that’s what people say.” The whole point of 1989 is to actually “Shake It Off.”
She’s not done writing songs about her exes, however. Depending on who you ask, about half the songs on the album could be about One Direction member, and most recent ex-boyfriend, Harry Styles. Still, 1989 is the first of Swift’s album that feels like it’s really all about her.
In the album’s opening track, “Welcome to New York,” Swift repeats (and repeats, and repeats) “Welcome to New York,” appropriate given the multimilliondollar Tribeca penthouse Swift purchased earlier this year, moving in next to neighbors like Beyoncé and Gwyneth Paltrow. In early October, select fans got a sneak peak at 1989 when Swift threw a penthouse pizza party and private listening session.
1989 makes it clear that Swift is a long way removed from the pop-country sound that initially made her famous. 1989 replaces the banjos and country twang of Swift’s first album with synth intros and pop radio beats. This shouldn’t surprise anyone who listened to Red, which, although it kept the instrumentals, made it clear that Swift was done playing the grown-up country girl. 1989 transcends the modern pop-country genre she helped popularize with her first few albums, still common on the charts in songs like Florida Georgia Line’s “Cruise” or Darius Rucker’s “Wagon Wheel.”
For the most part, 1989 feels like the right balance of Hot 100 pop and the emotional connection that first endeared Swift to her fans. Only a few songs feel like empty-headed radio fodder, like the annoyingly catchy “Welcome to New York” and “Out of the Woods,” which feels on the third or fourth listen like the same two lines stitched together for three minutes and 52 seconds straight (“Are we out of the woods yet?/Are we in the clear yet?”).
Swift hasn’t lost the strong vocals that catapulted her from Myspace wannabe to industry mainstay. In the voice memo for “I Know Places,” included in the deluxe version of the album, she sings a few lines sans postproduction and proves that she doesn’t need a recording studio to sound good.
The only place the synths fall flat is in the ballads. No one does a power ballad like Taylor Swift, but 1989’s “You Are In Love” and “Wildest Dreams” feel more like momcore soft rock than heart-rending anthems. Swift doesn’t come close to matching the emotional build of Speak Now’s “Haunted” or the damning chorus of Fearless’s “You’re Not Sorry.”
1989 is about Swift’s fans, too. Beyond the early release penthouse pizza party, Swift features her fans in the video for “Shake It Off,” and has spent the past week “#Taylurking,” or reposting pictures of her fans buying up 1989 taken from their Tumblr or Twitter accounts. This is a product of Swift herself, who is more personable on her Twitter and nascent Tumblr than any PR manager could be. Her strong, I’m-just-like-you voice comes across in her music, and although Swift doesn’t completely write her own songs like she used to, her influence is still strong.
While Swift spoke for thousands of teenage fans in her first four albums, she couldn’t help but occasionally sound petty. In Speak Now’s “Better Than Revenge,” Swift sings of a female rival who’s “better known/for the things that she does on the mattress,” and no one will forget the iconic line “She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts” from Fearless’s “You Belong with Me.” Songs like these caused a fair amount of outcry when third-wave feminists began to decry slut-shaming and oppressive, gendered school dress codes. Over the summer, however, Swift labeled herself as a feminist in an interview with The Guardian, after denying it back in 2012.
Granted, it’s hard to be popular without making it clear that you’re for gender equality. Just look at Beyoncé, who reached near-cult leader levels of popularity with the surprise release of her eponymous album, which explicitly embraces feminism as a theme. Or look at Shailene Woodley, the Divergent and The Fault in Our Stars star who took a nose dive after telling TIME magazine in May, when asked if she considered herself a feminist, “No because I love men, and I think the idea of ‘raise women to power, take the men away from the power’ is never going to work out because you need balance.”
The change of heart shows itself on 1989; it feels much less girl versus girl and more girls versus their oppressors. In “I Know Places,” Swift tells her listeners that “They take their shots, we’re bulletproof.”
Swift isn’t singing that “We are never, ever, getting back together/like, ever” anymore; instead continuing in “Clean” with “And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean/I think I am finally clean.” It feels like Swift has finally taken some me time, and it feels right.
1989 isn’t perfect, but it’s far from falling flat (it has, after all, already sold an impressive 1.3 million copies, give or take). Swift loses some of the emotional clout of her previous albums and sometimes strays a little too close to the army of interchangeable female pop vocalists surrounding her, but she still has the voice that captured her fan base early on. She finally feels like an adult — not to mention a self-labelled feminist — and it shows in 1989.

I wouldn’t feel right not suggesting a hearty apple cobbler as the perfect finish for any delicious meal. Served warm over some farm fresh vanilla ice cream, there’s nothing that beats America’s favorite fruit-filled concoction. If anyone tries to tell you that apple pie is superior, ask that saucy inquisitor if they’ve ever rolled out dough for a crust. When the answer is no, you can shoot back “Then shut your piehole,” and everyone will appreciate your punniness.
Ingredients:
Filling: 5–6 apples of your choice; chopped with the peel and core removed
¼ cup of walnuts, optional of course (I’m a purist; I say no)
3 tbsp of flour
½ cup of brown sugar
2 tsp of cinnamon (or if you want to zing it up a little, pumpkin pie spice)
Topping: ¾ cup of flour
1/3 cup of brown sugar
1 tsp of cinnamon
1 tsp of nutmeg
6 tbsp of cold butter, diced into pieces (it must be cold)
2 tbsp of butter, melted
Directions:
1) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a glass 8x8 baking dish. It doesn’t have to be glass. It’ll just look better when you can see the inside of the cobbler in all of its gooey glory.
2) Mix the ingredients for the filling together in a large bowl, and set aside to marinate. The apples will soak up the flour and sugar, and become the most delicious little pieces of “fruit” (if I may use that term loosely).
3) Next, mix all of the dry ingredients for the topping together in a bowl. I have no further comment on this step, except that if you can’t do it, you should find someone who can and relinquish this project to their superiority. 
4) When the dry ingredients are mixed, take the pieces of cold butter and blend them in to make a lumpy mixture. Because I’m baking with limited resources, I like to use two forks, but if you have a pastry cutter, do yourself a favor and use that. If you want to buy me a pastry cutter, I wouldn’t hate it.
5) Pour the filling into the baking dish. Sprinkle the topping evenly over it. There will probably be extra, so don’t be afraid to be generous. 
6) Drizzle the melted butter over the top. Lean down and admire the calories glistening in the light. 
7) Bake for a little less than 40 minutes or until the crust is bubbly and golden. You will know. You just will, I promise. 
8) Serve warm over vanilla ice cream with an extra sprinkle of cinnamon. God, I love autumn.

“My beats is banging. F**k what you rapping, who produced you?” Killer Mike and producer EI-P form the rap duo Run The Jewels and just released their second album, creatively titled Run The Jewels II. EI-P comes out in this record with some hard and driving beats that are catchy and aggressive at the same time. Indeed, as the tagline suggests, the production is the main draw of this album. Killer Mike’s lyricism is as dynamic as it ever was on albums like R.A.P. Music. This album does suffer in its lyrical content; still, considering that the album is free on iTunes and other digital venues, it would be ridiculous for any rap lover not to pick this one up.
The production is the strongest element of this album. From driving bangers to eccentric drums provided by Travis Barker, EI-P leaves no stone unturned. Building on the subtle electronic beeps and bloops found on R.A.P. Music, EI-P turns the electronic sci-fi accents up to 11 on the latter half of the album on tracks like “All My Life” or “Lie, Cheat and Steal.” (There’s a chopped sample of the sound of Pac-Man dying on “Early” that works very well.)
On the front half, EI-P makes it impossible not to start tapping your foot or bobbing your head to chopped vocals on “Close Your Eyes” or the infectious beats on the latter half of “Oh My Darling Don’t Cry” or “Blockbuster Night Part I.” With the sound Run The Jewels is aiming for, it’s not surprising that they got former Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack De La Rocha to drop a verse on “Close Your Eyes.” Just a word of warning: Even though they’re infectious, these are not club beats ­— they’re catchy but incredibly aggressive.
The lyricism that Killer Mike brings to this album is some of his best, matching his dynamic flow on albums like R.A.P. Music. He drops quotable lines every other bar, ranging from lines like “I’ll beat you to a pulp, no fiction” to “run backwards through a field of d***s” and many more. Mike goes, as he often does, for an intensely aggressive approach to lyricism, keeping the tempo up on most tracks, (with notable exceptions on tracks like “Crown” and “Love Again”) resulting in lines like, “so f*** you f***boys forever/Hope I said it politely / And if I can’t rap it, maggot, f***, then fight me.” EI-P’s lyricism, when he raps, is less stellar. He holds his own with Mike surprisingly well, but can’t match Mike’s flow, and often it seems like he doesn’t really know what he’s rapping about.
The lyrical content on this album is ... varied in quality. If you’ve listened to R.A.P. Music, it’s more of the same, though slightly more socially cognizant in light of the tragic events in Ferguson, Mo. But if you’re tired of Killer Mike complaining about how the U.S. is a fascist state where every cop is crooked, every clergyman wants to touch your kids, and the government’s biggest agenda is to murder African-Americans, then the album’s latter half may not be for you. Tracks like “Early” are a good example of this, even though that song has the best hook on the record.
I’m fairly positive this album won’t incite a single violent protest, but one wonders if there’s some sense of accountability when the duo raps “And even if some good ones die, f*** it, the Lord’ll sort ‘em” or “I love Dr. King, but violence might be necessary.” The high point of the album content-wise is Mike’s verse on “Crown,” a surprisingly heartfelt portrayal of guilt as a drug dealer. Unfortunately, it doesn’t last very long before EI-P comes in and starts rapping about something barely related. Indeed, it seems that in general, Mike’s verses have the most impact when he’s rapping not about shooting cops and urban discontent, but about personal events that shaped his view of the world. Another high point content-wise is Gangsta Boo’s verse about objectifying men in “Love Again.” For a split second, I had an insight into how uncomfortable women must feel when listening to verses that are all too common in rap music.

Dear Evan,
Today’s Halloween. I was cleaning the basement for this party I’ve been planning for months and found a box containing, to my utter delight, my PS3 and some of my old games, all of which I’d stowed away since I’ve been in school. Then, taking a break on Facebook, I saw an ad for 60 percent off all horror-themed games. I could play Red Dead Redemption and Castlevania games all night! But then I remembered my party. I have this zombie Mario costume — I get to say, “It’s a-me, Mario!” in a really deep voice — but all I want to do is sit on my couch, drink Lion’s Head, and play video games. Is that okay?
Need an answer soon,
Sadly Hankering After an Uneventful Night On the Floor Trying to Hit, Expel Demons, Ectoplasms, And Dracula
Dear SHAUN OF THE DEAD,
Someone said you can’t have your cake and eat it too, but isn’t that what Halloween’s all about — eating more sugary food than you should reasonably ingest? It can also readily apply to your situation. You know how many people secretly just want to stay at home and drink with a couple close friends? Well, not a lot, but still a good amount. So don’t cancel your event; instead, make it an all-night video game bonanza, make the max number of attendees 15, and bar the rest from the premises. Make sure everyone still brings $5, because you want money for booze, and you definitely don’t want to be sober when you get to games like Haze or Aliens: Colonial Marines. 
Or be that guy and cancel your party hours before it starts, you simpering sack of spuds, 
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
I’m really cold, but I’m too cheap to turn on my heat. My roommates are freezing, but I’m the only one who knows how to operate the heating system. How do I avoid their wrath?
Writing this from hibernation,
Holding Out, Attired in Robes Fitted ’Round and Over Sheer Torso
Dear HOARFROST,
Just turn on the heat before you make a fool out of yourself. It’s November already; it’s about time.
Just don’t turn it up so high that your Tupperware melts,
Evan Kahn

Alright, I like The Flaming Lips. From Transmissions from the Satellite Heart, to Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell, to Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, the band aggressively pursues a non-traditional songwriting style while retaining a mostly traditional rock band aesthetic.
But with their new release With a Little Help From My Fwends, I wonder if Wayne Coyne has disappeared way too far up his rear end, or if the band’s studio time looked more like the concerto recording scene from Walk Hard. This compilation of Beatles songs is confusing to say the least. From production style changes that occur so frequently you run the risk of suffering from whiplash, to freaking auto-tune, this album takes the term “experimental” and uses it as an excuse instead of an opportunity.
I’m not going to harp on the Miley Cyrus collaborations on the album, because they ended up being exactly what you’d expect. Lets take for example, the Dr. Dog/Chuck Inglish/Morgan Delt collaboration on “Getting Better.” This track is full of lazily sung vocals, a thick layer of reverb, and scattered one-shot samples.
On paper, this album sounds fantastic. In reality, it’s extremely disappointing. Then again, maybe i just don’t “get it, man.”

Guardians of the Galaxy
Friday, Nov. 7 — 8, 10:30 p.m.
Sunday, Nov. 9 — 8 p.m.
In Guardians of the Galaxy, all of your weirdest and wildest fantasies come to life: Andy Dwyer ripped and fighting aliens, Zoe Saldana trading in her signature Avatar blue skin for Gamora’s green shade, Vin Diesel being used solely for his body (he’s a CGI tree that can only say three words), and Bradley Cooper being Bradley Cooper. All these elements added up to an enormous amount of buzz this summer (For real, people would not shut up). But it wasn’t for nothing. Guardians of the Galaxy is a movie that has a golden ratio of chuckles to action. You come out of the movie feeling light, happy, and slightly confused — happy and light because Marvel essentially announces there will be a second one and confused because the end credit scene was more than baffling. You will need to Google it. I had to. 
The Amazing Spider-Man 2
Saturday, Nov. 8
8, 11 p.m.
Look! It’s a bird, it’s a plane, no; it’s the wrong reference, but another superhero movie sequel. I can’t say I fully understood why Sony was making a parallel series to the Spider-Man trilogy called The Amazing Spider-Man — I’m still sort of confused to this day — but I’ll play along like any good pawn in a capitalist society. However, Toby Maguire will always be Spider-Man/Peter Parker, James Franco will always be Harry Osbourne, Kirsten Dunst’s M.J. will always be the main love interest. With that said, here Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man/Peter Parker, Dane DeHaan is Harry Osbourne, and Emma Stone’s Gwen is the new main love interest. The movie starts off with Peter becoming more comfortable as Spider-Man; he’s swingin’ from buildings and doing cool tricks and such. There are also three villains in this installment. Three! If you ask me, once you move past one, one-and-a-half, two villains, it starts to get crowded. So if you like a will-they won’t-they kind of love story and awesome fight sequences that make movies drag on a little too long, the The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the movie for you.

The concept for Jon Rubin and Dawn Weleski’s restaurant was simple: manage a restaurant at which Pittsburgh residents can purchase cuisine from a country with which the United States is in conflict. Rubin and Weleski, an assistant professor of art at Carnegie Mellon and alumna (CFA ’10), respectively, working together were surprised when their first five “iterations” of the restaurant did not spur the conversation that they were hoping for.
But, upon opening their latest iteration, inspired by the people and culture of Palestine, they saw a conversation of a different kind begin.
Over the summer and the past few months, the conflict with Palestine has received hours of air time and spilled over into the Pittsburgh community. “The interesting thing is that 90 percent of the reactions that we’ve heard — phone calls, emails, and comments from both Pittsburgh and the national community — have been positive,” Weleski said. That does, however, leave a percentage of the public unsatisfied with the Palestinian theme.
Included in that unsatisfied population are senior chemistry major Danielle Schleslinger and sophomore chemical engineering and creative writing double major Naomi Sternstein, members of Tartans 4 Israel, the Israel advocacy group on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Schlesinger and Sternstein became concerned not when they heard about the new theme, but when they heard about some of the events that Conflict Kitchen has been hosting during the “Lunch Hours,” which include guest speakers and informative presentations.
“[Jewish students in Tartans 4 Israel] are not upset with their choice to feature Palestinian food, but rather that they aren’t giving an opportunity in their programming for other voices to be heard,” Schleslinger said.
University of Pittsburgh Chinese and political science major Lauren Barney attended one specific panel that made her feel “unsafe.” “My questions were being twisted, double standards were created, and people were yelling out at me. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe in that environment,” Barney said. “It lost the essence of why we were all there.”
Weleski defended the business to The Tartan: “We are only presenting people’s opinions and not fact. We’re just presenting a Palestinian narrative, and we’re just presenting a showcase of their lives and the culture.”
“We identify as citizens of Pittsburgh and as artists. For us as citizens, we are interested in highlighting and trying to reveal a voice that isn’t given a forum. We could’ve had opposing voices all along for all of the countries [that we’ve featured in our iterations]. Palestine has been recognized by some countries in the world as a nation-state, and its citizens deserve to be represented,” Weleski continued. “Not the government, not these organizations that are creating conflict, but the people. We start with food, then we go to their everyday lives. And everyone has different lives and different experiences.”
In the past few weeks, many media organizations have featured the restaurant in a negative light, criticizing the organization for being anti-Israeli, biased, and anti-American. Despite the negative reactions, however, Weleski insists that the majority of feedback is positive and that they are fulfilling the  mission.
“The project provides multiple levels of engagement to the community, and it’s very important to us that we let the public decide how they’re going to interact with us. And if certain communities want to provide a counter-discussion — not a counter argument, but a discussion — that’s fine. We want to encourage dialogue, not a fight. We want them to fulfill their mission, and we want to fulfill ours,” Weleski said.
A counter-discussion is in the works for Tartans 4 Israel through a project they’ve dubbed the “Co-Existence Kitchen.” Essentially a mobile, pop-up version of the original idea, Co-Existence Kitchen will feature food from all around the Middle East. Instead of providing what Tartans 4 Israel considers “passive programming” through the pamphlets of information that Conflict Kitchen includes with the meal, they will be “engaging the audience with trivia questions,” according to Sternstein, president of Tartans 4 Israel.
“There’s such a greater conversation to have  about this issue. We want to share that,” Sternstein said.
Electrical and computer engineering Ph.D candidate Ahmad Khairi, who is from Palestine, said “I think it’s heart warming to see the Palestinian culture represented through food in Pittsburgh....I think that’s a great approach, in response to all the dehumanization main stream media does to such parties.”
“Conflict Kitchen has chosen to focus on the Palestinian story, and ... it has a right to do so,” Siriana Abboud, a junior psychology and French double major and president of the Arab Students Organization, said via email. “It’s unfortunate that Palestine has become interchangeable with Palestinian-Israeli conflict. All of this contention is overshadowing the fact that Palestinian life exists out of the conflict and that there is a culture that is being lost because of it,” Abboud said.
At the end of the day, Weleski said, “United States’ national interests align with Israel, and this isn’t a project where we present countries that we’re not in conflict with…. We’re not about to change our mission to please a certain group of people both in Pittsburgh and nationally.”

The student environmental organization Sustainable Earth is launching a divestment initiative for Carnegie Mellon’s assets. Sophomore civil and environmental engineering major and Sustainable Earth Co-President Jack Fogel summarized the initiative by saying, “The divestment campaign is trying to promote Carnegie Mellon to take its investments out of fossil fuels.”
The organization is finalizing a letter, addressed to President Subra Suresh and Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees, which calls for the university to freeze any investments into fossil fuel companies and to completely divest from the industry within five years. Their request comes on the heels of a similar successful movement at Stanford University, where the university has, as of May, committed to not investing in any coal companies after a recommendation from their Student Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing.
Sophomore art major and Co-President of Sustainable Earth Becca Epstein, who is leading this effort, said about the letter that “divestment is really a big thing to tackle, so we want to make sure we’ve done all of our research.”
Epstein recently returned from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education conference in Portland, where she spoke to members of environmental organizations at other schools regarding this issue. “We’re trying to talk to people from other universities and get their ideas,” she said. The group aims to release the letter over the next few weeks. Then, Sustainable Earth is planning to start a petition for divestment.
Carnegie Mellon’s Investment Office does not have any publicly available documents detailing the university’s investment portfolio. Charles Kennedy, Chief Investment Officer for the University, commented by email in response to a request for that information, “Carnegie Mellon University’s endowment portfolio is managed with a long-term, growth-oriented objective. Using a combination of academic theory, quantitative analysis and informed market judgment, the university allocates the portfolio according to a long-term strategic plan, which is overseen by the Board of Trustees.”
Kennedy continued, “Assets are allocated to investment funds managed by third-party experts who specialize in particular strategies.  We believe this approach — with its broad, global diversification — will enable the endowment to continue to strengthen over time, providing greater ongoing support for the university’s operating needs, while preserving purchasing power to support future generations of students, faculty, and programs.”
Epstein said that Sustainable Earth had an affiliated faculty member meet with members of Carnegie Mellon’s Investment Office, but was unable to learn anything further about the university’s investments.
“[Carnegie Mellon’s] investments are through a money manager,” Epstein explained, noting that details of where Carnegie Mellon’s investments are located are not available. “At public universities they have to say, so it’s easier to divest at public universities.”
Epstein continued, “While we’d love to get CMU to give us that information, since we think it’s our right as students to know it, it’s not the most important thing for us right now. It’s more about pressuring them to talk to the money managers and get a screening process in place so we aren’t investing in fossil fuels anymore.”
Sustainable Earth is described on its webpage as a “group of students from Carnegie Mellon University who are dedicated to bring more awareness to the campus and outside community of Pittsburgh about practicing sustainable ways of life.”
Fogel summarized, “As an organization in general, our goal is to promote sustainability and green practices throughout campus as much as possible.”
Epstein remarked that “this is a big goal to have,” concluding, “if you look at the mission statement of Carnegie Mellon University, a major part of it is about teaching students ethical behavior. And these fossil fuel companies are not behaving ethically. This is morally wrong for our planet and for our students.”

Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced last Monday the recent arrest of eight suspected child predators, including Carnegie Mellon graduate student Adham Mandour. Mandour, who is pursuing his master’s degree in biology at Carnegie Mellon, was arrested on charges of child pornography possession and distribution. The arrest took place on Carnegie Mellon’s Oakland campus with the help of the Carnegie Mellon Police Department and the Pittsburgh Police Department, according to the official attorney general’s office press release. Further details regarding the arrest on campus have not yet been disclosed.
Before making the official arrest on campus, police conducted a search in Mandour’s Shadyside apartment. There, a computer forensic examiner found at least 25 media files of child pornography and a peer-to-peer downloading application installed on the defendant’s laptop. Investigators had previously traced peer-to-peer file sharing of child pornography to an IP address in Mandour’s apartment. University Police then aided the agents in locating and arresting the defendant on campus. Mandour is from Egypt and attends Carnegie Mellon with a student visa.
Mandour’s felonies are of the third degree. He is charged with eight counts of possession of child pornography, two counts of distribution of child pornography, and one count of criminal use of a communication facility.
This arrest occurred along with the arrests of seven other suspected child predators throughout the state and comes as part of the most recent sweep by agents from the Child Predator Section of Pennsylvania’s Attorney General Office.
Carnegie Mellon University declined to comment on the case. The University’s Media Relations Office did include a link to a WXPI article about the case in a “News Clip” email sent on Oct. 24.
Ken Walters, executive director of media relations, gave the following statement regarding how the University manages cases concerning students facing criminal charges: “Consistent with our commitment to student privacy and our obligations under the law, the university will not disclose information related to allegations involving a specific student. In general, CMU uses the community standards process to review matters where a student has allegedly violated university policy or has already been convicted of a serious crime by a public court. For incidents that pose immediate concerns for the safety and welfare of the campus community, the dean of student affairs may take summary action or implement interim measures that limit a student’s ability to be present on campus, engage in coursework, and/or interact with specific members of the university community until a resolution is reached. In cases where the university determines reported criminal activity poses a serious or continuing threat to the university community, we issue crime alerts to the campus as described in our Annual Security Report issued by University Police.”
Student reaction to the university’s communication with the Carnegie Mellon community regarding the case proved mixed.
Victoria Merten, a graduate student in physics, commented “No, I hadn’t heard about it.... I don’t really know how I feel about that. I mean, obviously police still have jurisdiction over campus. They would come to your work and arrest you. So I guess it’s kind of the same idea as that. It doesn’t make me feel great.... I feel like maybe I should have heard about it. I don’t think the police did anything wrong.”
Jonathan Dunstan, a fifth-year senior and electrical and computer engineering major, commented: “I did not know. I would have liked [to know].... I mean, it’s difficult, because at the same time there’s really no concrete reason why people need to know about that, other than shaming him for doing something horrible, which I’m not necessarily opposed to. I can’t think of a reason why we have a responsibility to know, other than the fact that it was done on campus. Taking the location into mind, yeah, I think it would make sense for an email or something along those lines. And I guess the other issue is he hasn’t really been prosecuted yet. So are we going to throw away the assumption of innocence on his part?”
Bruno Vizcarra, a graduate student in statistics, did not know about the case, and wished he would have. “I think they should make ... not a huge deal about it, but maybe say that it’s under control and it’s been taken care of.... I mean, they report on petty crime all the time,” Vizcarra said. “This is pretty major.... Also to reassure people that they’re on top of things.”
First-year Dietrich College student Ann Widom was concerned with the potential outcome of relaying information about the case. “I think that’s a really hard line to talk about. Because on one hand it’s really important to have safety information so that students know how to be safe and if they can be safe and if they are safe,” she said. “But on the other hand, this is one incident. And perhaps since we don’t know about it, it’s not just one incident. And that would be the importance of having the knowledge out there. But if it is just one incident, then what you would create by publicizing it a lot is a huge amount of worry, and people being uncomfortable, and people feeling unsafe, when in reality this is one incident.”
Mandour awaits trial for his charges. Deputy Attorney General Anthony Marmo of the Attorney General Office’s Child Predator Section will be handling the case, which will take place in Allegheny County.

As the university aims to reimagine its strategic plan, President Subra Suresh announced on Oct. 16 in a university-wide email the launch of a strategic planning process. Now, Interim Provost Nathan Urban announced to the campus community through email, that Carnegie Mellon will host a town hall meeting on Nov. 17 from 4:30 to 6 p.m. in the Posner Center to gain input from members of campus regarding the process.
Urban described the new strategic plan, which he said will effectively replace the current 2008 Strategic Plan, as a document that is not a “document that sits on a shelf [that] nobody pays attention to or looks at or updates. We’d like this to be something that is a work in progress. As conditions in the world change, as the university changes, as we develop better ideas about where the university should be moving, we want to be able to go back and revise it in a thoughtful way.”
As part of the process, the university has identified three focus areas, also called thrusts, for campus members to explore in order to gather information to inform the new strategic plan. The thrusts include: Transformative Teaching and Learning; Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship; and The Transformative CMU Experience.
Urban said that the university is in the process of trying to seek information from the campus about the strategic plan overall, beginning with looking at each of the three pillars to assess where the campus currently stands in learning, research, and the campus experience.
“Where are we now? What is it that we’re doing on our campus in each of these domains?” Urban asked, explaining that the university is looking at its strengths and areas for improvement, both internally and through external benchmarks.
Heading these thrusts will be campus leaders and college deans. Urban and Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, will lead the learning thrust; Farnam Jahanian, the vice president of research, and James Garrett, the dean of the College of Engineering, will lead the research thrust; and Michael Murphy, vice president for campus affairs, and Ramayya Krishna, dean of the Heinz College, will lead the campus experience thrust.
Urban said that, along with the initial town hall meeting, the university will hold subsequent smaller focused open meetings and create subcommittees to address areas within each thrust. Urban said that college deans are currently sourcing for faculty within their colleges to participate in these committees, while Gina Casalegno, dean of student affairs, is working to identify students who would be potentially interested in becoming engaged in particular parts of the process.
Urban said about the initial town hall slated for later in the month: “It will be the beginning of a conversation with members of campus about the overall strategic plan and also these individual thrust areas,” mentioning that thrust leaders will be in attendance.
Urban said that a draft of the strategic plan, “a close reflection of what a final document would look like,” will be presented to the university’s board of trustees in the spring.
In his Oct. 16 email to the campus, President Suresh also announced a branding development plan. Urban described the branding process and strategic plan process as separate, but related processes with different goals that will inform each other.
The university has hired branding and communications firm Edelman to “explore what makes Carnegie Mellon such a special place, how we perceive ourselves and how we are perceived by the world around us,” Suresh said in the email.

Students carried mattresses out of their rooms and onto campus on Wednesday as part of Carry That Weight, a national initiative to support survivors of sexual assault and “carry the weight together.” The campaign was created by Emma Sulkowicz, a student at Columbia University who was sexually assaulted by another student and pledged to carry her mattress as part of her senior thesis until the alleged perpetrator is expelled from Columbia.
At Carnegie Mellon, the movement took the form of several students carrying mattresses around campus for the day, as well as hundreds of students wearing red Xs taped to their clothing as a protest against sexual assault and sexual violence on campus and a sign that they were willing to help carry the weight. After the event’s organizers spent the day giving out red tape to make Xs outside of the Jared L. Cohon University Center’s Merson Courtyard, all of the students participating in the initiative gathered at the Fence in the afternoon and marched around the Cut.
Carry That Weight at Carnegie Mellon comes after the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced last fall that Carnegie Mellon is among now over 60 universities being investigated for violating Title IX, a part of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 that mandates that educational institutions treat men and women equally. The OCR’s investigation comes on the heels of a lawsuit raised against Carnegie Mellon by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which alleges that the university failed to protect a student from her abusive ex-girlfriend.
Graham Arthur, a first-year economics and statistics major and one of the event’s organizers, said that he first heard about the movement through a friend at another university. “I got contacted about it like a week ago, there’s like a national event happening today. It’s all over [the country],” Arthur said.
Arthur brought the campaign to Carnegie Mellon’s campus through a Facebook event, word of mouth, and the university’s Greek community. According to junior electrical and computer engineering major and event organizer Gabriel Ostolaza, “We just made a Facebook page, and a lot of people came out. We invited like 2.5K people, and like 300 came. And we marked more than 500 people [with red Xs], and there were 12 to 13 mattresses…. People came out, and I really appreciate that.”
Some students also carried pillows, which, the campaign’s website says, was a way for students who are physically or otherwise incapable of carrying a mattress to show their support. Sulkowicz also wrote in an opinion piece for Columbia’s Spectator, “A call to Carry That Weight together,” however, that “I hope that very few of you end up carrying pillows. Pillows are ‘light,’ ‘fluffy,’ and may detract from our message. The propagation of images of people carrying pillows could undercut our understanding of the gravity of sexual assault, and imbue what should be seen as a serious crime with ‘cute’ and ‘celebratory’ connotations.”
Sulkowicz chose a standard-issue dorm room mattress to carry because it represents the weight she feels as a survivor of sexual assault. The mattress, too, emphasizes the idea of collaboration. “Carrying a mattress with others brings us together to collectively help carry the weight, shows our continued support for survivors, and our collective commitment to working together toward cultural and community-level change to end sexual and domestic violence,” according to Carry That Weight’s website.
On the website, students can upload photos of themselves carrying a mattress and pledge that “I support survivors of sexual and domestic violence and am helping to #CarryThatWeight.”
Sulkowicz also emphasized that her actions are not, at their heart, actually part of a protest. “In the news, people have been calling my piece a protest, and just ignoring the fact it is not really a protest but a performance-art piece,” Sulkowicz said in a September interview with New York Magazine. “Yes, I would like for my rapist to get kicked out of school, but I realize that the university is so stubborn that it may never happen and I may be carrying this mattress for a while.”
The campaign resonated with many students. Sophomore business and economics double major Gujri Singh said that she participated in the initiative “because people are not aware of what sexual assault is and how many people are affected by it. So awareness is the number one way to prevent things from happening in the future. It’s the same as education, which is why this is so important.”
Senior directing major Rachel Pustejovsky participated as a way of fighting a flawed system for dealing with sexual assault and violence on campus. “The most dangerous time to be a woman is in college, and it’s because this country perpetuates rape culture, and colleges are afraid that if they take care of their victims, they’ll lose their rankings,” Pustejovsky said. “And we need to stop perpetuating rape culture, stop making slut jokes okay, and to defend and protect our students at the cost of a ranking. Because a school where you’re safe is a better place to be.”
Junior chemistry major Morgan Schaefer was, she said, simply engaged in the cause. “I didn’t do it for any reason other than that I’m passionate about awareness of sexual violence and sexual assault.”

HealthyU student wellness results presentation
Director of University Health Services Anita Barkin gave a presentation to Student Senate on the results of the HealthlyU survey, which for the first time this year included both undergraduates and graduate students. The survey, which was administered in November 2013, collected data on the health behaviors in which students are participating. It is an established college health assessment tool which has been used on over 32,000 students nationwide. HealthyU assesses students’ general health and well-being, levels of stress, substantive abuse, sexual health, and nutrition.
The survey was emailed to all students and responses were confidential and aggregated to provide a picture of health issues on campus. There was a response rate of about 35 percent for undergraduate students, and about 37 percent for graduate students. Sixty percent of respondents reported moderate to high stress that they were not managing well. Many students identified a lack of sleep as a cause of stress. Sixteen percent of undergraduates and 11 percent of graduate students reported experiencing mental health issues, and 85 percent of students have not used any tobacco products in the past month. Additional results were gathered regarding nutritional status, sexual health, and other factors. University Health Services plans to send out the HealthyU survey annually.
Ex oficio report: Amy Burkert
Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert gave a presentation regarding the university’s new Global Communications Center and its connection to improved undergraduate education in research. Burkert reported that undergraduate research is thriving on campus and stressed the important role of academic advising in helping plan and assist in a student’s education ventures. Burkert also discussed the potential role that technology should play in education. A town hall meeting will be held on these topics on Nov. 17, 4:30–6 p.m.

Pundits have been talking lately about how the 2014 elections seem to be one of the most boring elections in recent history. Compared to the 25 percent of voters that closely followed the last two elections, only 15 percent are closely following these elections, according to a Pew Poll. Most pundits have blamed the general lack of interest in Congressional gridlock and the fact that, in this election, there seems to be nothing important at stake.
However, there might be another factor at play here. In the 2014 elections, races seem to be dominated by political families. A large number of Senate candidates are related to mayors, governors, and other politicians. The Guardian lists just a few of many such candidates: Alaska incumbent Senator Mark Begich is the son of Alaska Congressman Nick Begich. Arkansas incumbent Senator Mark Pryor is the son of former Senator David Pryor. In Louisiana, incumbent Senator Mary Landrieu is the daughter of former New Orleans mayor Moon Landrieu, and sister of current New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu. The Guardian goes on to talk about at least four other states in which this is happening.
Most of the craziness and excitement that resulted from the elections in 2008, 2010, and 2012 were due to the sheer number of new grassroots candidates running. Opposed to candidates from political families, which are branded and polished, these grassroots candidates were willing to overstep the line at times and were far more raw and unedited. Remember Todd “legitimate rape” Akin, or Christine “I am not a witch” O’Donnell? There was a sense that these candidates, whether for better or worse, were true political outsiders.
The lack of these outsiders makes not only for a stagnant election, but also stagnant politics and government in general. A full third of the United States Senate are related to at least one other public official, according to CNN. This is apparently what “normal” American elections are like: the same names, with the same political positions, cycling in and out. With the same old families sitting at the same golf games and vacationing in the summer at Martha’s Vineyard, it all comes out looking more like a competitive aristocracy than a true democracy.
This is nothing new to United States politics, but in general it should be getting better, not worse. The United States has always romanticized its political families to some degree. People want idols they can look up to and adore, such as the Kennedys living in Camelot. However, people should be aware that candidates from political families have had unfair benefits from their connections, especially those from powerful political dynasties.
These candidates are guaranteed surefire endorsement, can draw from an established pool of professional staff, and have a significantly easier time with funding. Many ads for candidates even leverage their family connection. In an ad for Michelle Nunn, a Georgia Senate candidate whose father used to be a senator, her father appears in the ad and endorses her. The media should be aware of this trend and call it out, instead of acting as if it were something negligible, or even promoting the family connection.
If America was a true meritocracy, the connections between family members in politics wouldn’t matter in the slightest. People should be aware of the substantial and unfair benefits a candidate related to a politician receives when they run for office. 
Voters should consider this not only for the current elections, but also for any future elections. Already, we have Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton priming to run for president in 2016, potentially placing another Clinton or Bush in the White House.

There is always doubt as to how real reality television is. For the second time, a TV show produced by TLC has fallen into the camp of “too real.” Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has been canceled in light of the central character’s mother’s unconfirmed dating of convicted child molester Mark McDaniel, the man who allegedly forced oral sex onto her oldest daughter at the age of 8, was charged with the sexual exploitation of another child over the Internet as well.
Though it is tempting to criticize the stars of TLC for their controversial lifestyles, we should instead be skeptical of a network that continues to make celebrities of “salt-of-the-earth” people, then forcibly removes that stardom from the unlucky few who happen to be living humanly flawed lives.
Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has been under scrutiny since its inception, documenting the eccentric “redneck” life of beauty pageant queen Alana Shannon and her family. The former Toddlers & Tiaras star, nicknamed “Honey Boo Boo,” was discovered by TLC while competing in a pageant. Many viewers fell in love with her quirky, spunky, spirited self.
A show following her family’s life shortly followed, and received relative success. That is, until this past summer when ratings dropped, allegedly due to Honey Boo Boo’s diva behavior. However, it took the misaction of her mother, June Shannon (Mama June), to make TLC “redneckognize” the problem. TLC’s cancellation of the family’s show has continued the trend of denying the realities of the stars this reality network creates.
This past December, A&E’s Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson fell under fire for his homophobic and racist comments. He was temporarily banned from being aired in any episodes as a result. It seems unfair to these people that the moment they mess up or make questionable choices, they lose support from the networks that placed them on a televisual pedestal.
Media attention should not be spent obsessing about the affairs of the Shannon family as they resolve their issues, but rather used questioning the integrity of networks that are unable to support the not-so-average realities it picks up and dresses up for television coverage. The public should be skeptical of TLC and similar networks for their lack of foresight in idolizing normal Americans, and the low-quality programming that often results.

The word “quarantine” comes from Italy, having been created by Venetian officials instituting a series of laws while the Black Death was sweeping through Europe in the 1300s. All crew members and passengers aboard ships wishing to disembark in Venice were required to stay on board for 40 days.
While the Black Death did eventually make its way into Venetian territory, the measure helped slow its spread, and the practice proved effective against later diseases.
Quarantines are perhaps one of the few medical practices from medieval times that are actually effective at combating serious health ailments.
But while the media frenzy may have some convinced that a planet-sweeping plague has reached us, Ebola is not the Black Death returned. Modern hygiene and a lack of thatched roof cottages full of flea-ridden rats go a long way toward protecting us from Ebola (which, incidentally, can’t be transmitted through insects).
But one of the most important developments that we have made as a society between the creation of the quarantine and today is not a medical advancement but a social one. The concepts of personal liberty and autonomy as human rights are in danger not from the spread of Ebola, but from fear.
In Maine, authorities demanded a 21-day quarantine for Kaci Hickox, a nurse who has returned from western Africa where she treated victims of Ebola. Upon her arrival, she was held in New Jersey in a cramped isolation tent without privacy or plumbing for three days before being released. These orders were issued despite the fact that she had repeatedly tested negative for the virus and showed no symptoms.
Hickox and her lawyer maintained that these orders were unconstitutional since she showed no signs of infection, and the local judge issued a series of less restrictive orders before dropping them entirely on Friday. While going for a bike ride on Thursday she was hounded by reporters asking her “if it was worth it” to “risk” the safety of everybody around her.
There was no scientific basis to assume she was any sort of risk to the community, and the stigma health workers are facing upon their return could discourage relief efforts in western Africa where they are important for stopping the virus at its source. 
Television media might want to consider covering the part of the world where the vast majority of the 5,000 expected deaths from the epidemic has happened, instead of harassing a healthy woman in Maine going for a bike ride.

Since we are now caught between two major fall holidays, let’s take time to reflect on their cultural significance.
As children, costumes and candy are the most exciting parts of Halloween. As we get older, Halloween costumes become vehicles for showcasing our “wild side” to friends and cohorts. The costumes get darker, the themes more mature, and, sometimes, they cross a line. In particular, racism and sexism creep into the picture.
Commercial Halloween costumes are primarily marketed to white people — see the models in any Halloween catalog — and often represent minorities offensively. Major Halloween outlets like Spirit Halloween and Party City have costume categories like “Cowboys & Indians” and “Geishas & Ninjas” (yes, grouped together) marketed to adults. The catch-all label “International Costumes” displays varying degrees of exoticism, in which each item falls into a funny-or-sexy dichotomy. 
This nonmutual expression of objectification amounts to fetishization and cultural appropriation because it does not recognize someone’s individuality or acknowledge any historical implications.
Racist costumes, whether inadvertent or intentional, are typically meant to be funny or sexy. Funny costumes are generally marketed to men, while sexy costumes are marketed to women as “exotic” alternatives to other hypersexualized costume choices. Sexualization of women on Halloween is its own issue; women should be free to choose sexy costumes if they wish, but sexy should not be the only socially acceptable option.
College women in particular are encouraged to “let loose” on Halloween. Culturally specific costumes for women are usually tight or scanty, and they promote an “exotic,” sexually alluring figure of femininity. This sexualization acts at the intersection of sexism and racism because it objectifies both women and cultures.
Otherness, in the sense of simplifying someone’s sociocultural identity, has its roots in imperialism and cultural appropriation. Aren’t Halloween costumes meant to be fun and entertaining? Racial stereotypes are inappropriate and offensive, especially when they are taken so lightheartedly. When you dress up as a cultural representation, you reduce that culture to a few negative, inaccurate elements. This is why Native American and Blackface costumes are so offensive — they exploit historical oppression without recognizing the suffering of the people being represented.
Though less visible, Thanksgiving celebrations are also rooted in racism. The Pilgrim narrative, in which Americans identify the long-suffering Pilgrim as the hero, demotes the Native American population to helpers who allowed the white Pilgrims to succeed.
The history of Native American genocide in our country is a harsh reality. Some Native Americans today do not participate in Thanksgiving, and instead recognize a National Day of Mourning. The Wampanoag people, among others, are calling attention to the misremembrance of this history and criticizing the fact that Thanksgiving has become a celebration of the Pilgrim narrative instead of honoring the Harvest Festival.
It is important to recognize the racism surrounding our celebrations. Too often we brush off cultural appropriation as “honoring” a custom we do not understand. Respect for another culture is not the same as wearing “foreign” garb or eating “ethnic” food. Even these phrases are part of the problem. When we celebrate Halloween and Thanksgiving, we need to be mindful of our behavior so as not to distort the true nature of these holidays.

Last week was Asexuality Awareness Week, which highlighted the importance of recognizing people’s unique sexual identities, even when those sexual identities do not conform to preconceived social notions of attraction. ALLIES painted the Fence with the purple, gray, and white of the asexual pride flag and chalked sidewalks all over campus to promote awareness.
Like all sexual and gender identities, asexuality exists on a spectrum. It is important to remember that sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and sex drive are distinct from one another in the asexuality (or “ace”) spectrum.
For example, a person who is asexual may be attracted to someone romantically, but not sexually. Aromantic people may lack romantic attraction, and demisexual individuals may not experience sexual attraction to a person until a deeper emotional connection is formed. Across the ace spectrum, being asexual doesn’t mean that a person doesn’t want to experience affection or close relationships; they just may not be driven to express these feelings in a sexual or romantic way.
Unfortunately, asexual people face prejudice like everyone in the LGBTQA initialism, especially since we are so culturally committed to the flawed idea that sex is essential to human expression. Asexuality is often misunderstood, ignored, and delegitimized by both the public and the LGBTQA community at large; violent crimes such as “corrective” rape continue to be a serious problem.
As such, Asexuality Awareness Week and similar movements deservedly shine the spotlight on a  marginalized minority that needs to be more widely understood and acknowledged. LGBTQA people have been gaining legal and cultural acceptance all across the nation, and that’s undoubtably a good thing.
It’s also important to remember that sexuality is something that people have the right to define for themselves. If a person does not feel sexual or romantic attraction, to whatever degree, others should recognize and respect that experience. The Tartan is thrilled to have been able to do so during Asexuality Awareness Week on campus.

Pittsburgh eatery Conflict Kitchen recently launched a Palestinian menu and hosted a program of events that has incited debate both within and outside the immediate Pittsburgh community.
According to its website, Conflict Kitchen aims to use food and discussion to dig underneath “the polarizing rhetoric of governmental politics and the narrow lens of media headlines.” 
In addition to preparing Palestinian food, Conflict Kitchen also hosts events and distributes literature promoting Palestinian voices and arguably pro-Palestinian content on both culture and politics.
The literature consists entirely of interviews, which provide the opinions of Palestinians living in both Palestine and the United States. Statements range from culturally enlightening — “Our culture dictates that the woman decides on her spouse” —  to politically incendiary — “How can you compare Israeli F-16s, which are some of the best military planes in the world, to a few hundred homemade rockets?”.
The Palestinian focus has sparked conversations locally as well as outside Pittsburgh. Though the eatery owners have said that the majority of responses have been positive, some national publications have painted Conflict Kitchen as vividly anti-Israel, and even anti-Semitic. The Washington Beacon  describes the eatery as “a food cart that hands out anti-Israel propaganda.” The Jewish Press features a harshly worded subheading, “Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism come in 57 varieties. Just ask Heinz,” referring to The Heinz Endowment, a Conflict Kitchen sponsor.
Distorting the mission and message of Conflict Kitchen in such radical terms is dangerous. The restaurant may well be advocating a particular viewpoint — after all, there are no Israeli interviews or food options offered — and it is within its rights to do so. 
However, the viewpoint presented should be evaluated on its own merits and faults, not tied to blanket rhetoric as a weapon for either side of the debate. Conflict Kitchen is giving voice to a subset of perspectives and through them promoting thoughtful conversation. Printing an interview with a Palestinian that naturally offers pro-Palestinian sentiments without offering further commentary is a far cry from being wholly anti-Israel or anti-Semitic.
Many of the conversations surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially on our campus and others, are sensitive and nuanced, but in such an emotionally fueled debate — even for geographically distanced Americans — divisive rhetoric can bleed into the dialogue. 
Conflict Kitchen exists to educate community members and start discussions about global conflicts. When we dismiss voices in the debate with blanket labels like “anti-Israel,” we are shutting down that discussion.
It is important to recognize the conflict-fueling language that pervades our media and the ways we can become susceptible to it. Presenting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in black-and-white terms not only misrepresents a murky and complex issue; it fuels a dichotomy that doesn’t inherently have to exist. The continued failure of diplomacy to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict can only be exacerbated by oversimplification of this complex, multifaceted set of issues. 
Branding a pro-Palestinian message as necessarily anti-Israeli, or vice versa — the very polarizing rhetoric and narrow lens that Conflict Kitchen aims to combat — will only worsen the divide.

Last week, a school shooting in Marysville, Wash. led to the death of four high school students. The perpetrator, 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg, shot five students in the school cafeteria after having invited them to have lunch with him. County Sheriff Ty Trenary “may not have answers ... for several months” as to the motive behind this terrifying crime, according to The Seattle Times.
The tragedy in Washington has stirred up a call for action from various gun control activist groups, including Moms Demand Action (MDA). As stated by Shannon Watts, founder of MDA, schools “should be safe from the gun violence that kills 86 Americans every day,” according to an MDA press release.  Watts also added that Washington was the 87th school shooting since Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.
Why haven’t we taken significant action since Sandy Hook to protect our schools? We’ve reached the 87th shooting since 2012, and significant change has not yet taken place to address the issue.
In response to Sandy Hook, the Maryland-based company Hardwire LLC has created a line of bulletproof products, including bulletproof whiteboards, bulletproof clipboards, and so on. 
If this is an attempt to protect schools from gun violence, it isn’t doing the job properly. These bulletproof products are not only expensive, but also not addressing the real problem. I don’t see how a bulletproof clipboard would’ve been any help to the five victims of last week’s shooting.
It’s unfortunate that people simply watch the shootings on television and don’t take action unless it directly affects them. We shouldn’t be watching news coverage on school shootings as if it were the weather. Instead, we should be considering the frequency of school shootings on the news as a call to action.
According to an FBI study last month, 160 active shooter incidents — shootings that may be impacted by the actions of citizens and law enforcement personnel — occurred between 2000 and 2013. The study’s conclusion was that active shooter incidents are becoming more frequent and significantly add to the number of violent deaths in the United States. In fact, these 160 incidents resulted in 1,043 casualties.
Gun control will not be a cure-all to school shootings, since Washington shooter Fryberg had legally acquired the gun that he used to kill four fellow classmates. However, we need to take steps. We can’t just sit and watch the number of active shooter incidents grow. This is already happening way too often.
We need to take more responsibility across the country in order to prevent school shootings. The government needs to take immediate and effective action in order to decrease the number of deaths that occur each day as a result of gun violence. Whether by expanding background checks or increasing licensing, action has to be taken. More importantly, it has to be taken both at the local and the national level.
Individuals and families have to consider what is at risk to have gun access at home, and at the same time, the government needs to respond effectively to shootings when they occur. This eventuality will be better than watching the local news cover the 88th United States school shooting.
