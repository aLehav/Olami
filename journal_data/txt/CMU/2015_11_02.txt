The Carnegie Mellon Women’s volleyball team faced off against the Point Park Pioneers on Friday, coming off a big couple of wins last weekend at the Juniata Wid Guisler Invitational in an attempt to improve on their impressive 24–6 record.
Although the game was statistically set to go in Carnegie Mellon’s favor, it started off with an aggressive set of plays from Point Park as the Pioneers took control of the game with an early 3–0 lead in the first set, and the pressure was on Carnegie Mellon to keep up. The Tartans are a resilient squad, however, and they would not let Point Park run away with the set. The Tartans responded quickly with a few scores of their own, but could never manage to take the lead from the Pioneers in the first set. Each team applied pressure to the other but neither managed to come out ahead in the first section of the game. Toward the end of the first set, Carnegie Mellon began to reveal a distinct rhythm to their play style, but could never take the lead from the relentless Point Park squad. The teams seemed to be engaged in a constant power struggle, with the Tartans being outsized by the Pioneers while simultaneously showing much more team cohesion to make up for it. Each team made significant mistakes toward the end of the first set, disallowing Point Park from increasing their lead while Carnegie Mellon failed to close the gap. The early scores that Point Park had put on the board proved to be the deciding factor in the first set.
The Tartans refused to give up, and in the second set opened with a strong series of volleys that ended in Carnegie Mellon gaining a significant lead. This advantage was gained largely due to junior libero Molly Higgins, who set her team up with a playable ball time and time again, as she made miraculous digs consistently throughout the game to prove once again that she is the real backbone of her team’s success. But Point Park would not lay down despite Carnegie Mellon’s commanding lead. The Pioneers continued to fight valiantly in the face of impending defeat, but the resilient Tartan team did not allow the Pioneers to gain a lead at all during the set. The Tartans maintained their lead, although never running away with the game, and ended the second set victorious to tie the series 1–1.
The Tartans turned up the heat in the third set, spring boarding off of a Point Park yellow card to put the Carnegie Mellon squad up a comfortable six points early in the set. The Pioneers responded with formidable defensive resistance from their large front line, but could not manage to collapse the lead the Tartans had gained as a result of their mistakes earlier in the set. The Tartans carried their early lead smoothly through the rest of the set and took the lead in the series 2–1.
The fourth period carried on much in the same way as the third, with the Tartans gaining an early lead, though not as large as the one in the third period, and maintaining that lead until the end of the period. The Pioneers could not use their larger frontline to overtake the Tartans due to the superior teamwork shown by the Carnegie Mellon squad. Carnegie Mellon perfectly exemplified their play style in this final period as they established a very clear rhythm of set, hit, score as soon as the ball made it to their side of the court. Higgins continued to be the anchor piece for this play style, managing to turn nearly every serve into a playable ball for her teammates. Point Park had no clear response to this established rhythm and began to crumble as a result of accumulated mistakes throughout the set. Carnegie Mellon showed great defensive play at the net toward the end of the final period, and while they did give up a few scores, they did not give Point Park any source of hope of winning the game. The Pioneers must be commended for their perseverance, but ultimately the Tartans emerged victorious, closing out the final set and taking the series 3–1.
The Tartan women’s volleyball team will next look to face off against a yet undetermined opponent in the UAA championship, which will determine their place in the conference as well as place them in the NCAA national championship tournament if they emerge victorious. No matter who their opponent is, the Tartans will look to apply the same pressure as they did in this game against Point Park in order to advance their position in the national standings.

Looking to start the season off with a bang, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams began competition this Saturday on campus. Both teams profited from the occasion, using the quad meet and home opener to improve their records to 3–0. The victories were lopsided in the Tartan’s favor for both genders, with the men’s team overcoming their biggest challenge from Case Western Reserve, 188–109, and the women’s team crushing their closest opposition from Clarion University, 195–103.
The women gave early indication of a dominant performance by taking first and second in the 200-yard Medley Relay to open the meet. Junior butterfly and freestyle specialist Gillian Crews helped put the women’s A team a step ahead with a great leg in the butterfly.
The men followed suit, buoyed by unmatched speed from sophomore breast stroke swimmer Matthew Chu and first-year breast stroke swimmer Winston Chu. Both overtook a Case Western swimmer on the breast stroke leg to give both the men’s A and B teams insurmountable leads.
Both teams appeared comfortable and confident throughout, both individually and as a group. With the Tartan swimmers in lanes 2 and 6, it was a common sight to see a Carnegie swimmer in lane 6 win their race, look up, and calmly glance over to lane 2 to confirm the presence of another Carnegie swimmer up near the front.
And when one of the swimmers on the deck accidentally dropped their lap counter into the pool for a few laps during the women’s 500-yard Freestyle, it was a laughing matter, as the Tartans took the first two spots in the race regardless.
Even as the teams raced ahead on the scoreboard, the swimmers stayed involved in the meet through the end, cheering their teammates on from the sidelines up until the last lap. In a few tight contests, the swimmers on the sidelines got involved by chanting “Go, go, go” in time with breaststroke bobs, and waving their hands to urge the Carnegie swimmers in the race to some tight wins.
First-year freestyle and butterfly specialist Mitchell Riek made a big impact in his first race in college, winning all 3 of his races. Riek helped build early momentum for the men’s team with a dominant 1000-yard Freestyle. In the race, Riek started strong, and kept a hard pace to lose the rest of the field about 500 yards into the race. His time of 9:42.97 was over 13 seconds faster than the winning time for the race last year.
Riek followed up the effort with a comfortable win in 200-yard Butterfly, and a narrow, come-from-behind win in the 200-yard Individual Medley (IM). In the IM, Reik appeared to fight to stay near the leader through 150 yards before powering to the line and nabbing the win.
Reflecting on his races, Riek relished  in the exciting finish of the 200 IM. “I haven’t swum the thousand before. That was my first time, so I didn’t really know what to expect from that. And two fly... I’ve done that a lot so there’s not much excitement, but I like doing the 2 IM. It’s kind of one of my off events, so it’s fun to swim.”
On the women’s side, sophomore IM and butterfly specialist Mary St. John contributed a few strong performances of her own to the Tartan onslaught, with wins in the 200-yard Butterfly and the 500-yard Freestyle races. St. John’s win in the butterfly was especially impressive given that she spent most of the race swimming in third, before taking the lead late to get the win.
In the diving portion of competition, both teams were challenged by Clarion University, who placed ahead of the Tartans in all four diving competitions. However, solid performances allowed the Carnegie men and women to earn points over the other teams, and pick up some against Clarion with the help of strong performances from divers like junior diver Machika Kaku. Kaku placed third in the 3-meter dive with a score of 206.95, only finishing behind divers from Clarion.
Both teams had a lot of success due to a combination of good competition at the front and strong depth. Riek observed that the teams “had a lot of one twos,” pointing to the number of good swimmers picking up points for the team.
A lot of the excitement and energy going into the meet helped contribute to the success. As Riek put it, “Everyone’s excited. You’re high-fiving everyone. Everyone’s in a good mood. It’s a good environment and that creates good racing.”
Going forward, both the men’s and women’s teams will look to continue their success and build on this competition leading up to the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships in March. Next week, the teams will try to add onto their undefeated records as they go to Grove City College to take on the home team and the University of Rochester.

The Buffalo Bills had lots of good feelings surrounding them this offseason. They had just finished one of the best defensive years by a team in recent memory, they hired Rex Ryan — considered by some the best defensive mind in football — to make that defense even better, and with wide receiver Sammy Watkins and running back LeSean McCoy, the team could be a force coming into this season.
After an opening-week win against a listless Colts team, that vision has not exactly panned out. With a horrendous loss to the Jaguars, the Bills now stand at 3–4 and don’t look anything like the team they set out to be. So what went wrong?
The easiest answer is a tough schedule. The Bills have played two undefeated opponents to this point (the Patriots and Bengals) and are 3–2 against teams comprised of mortals. They even hung with both of those undefeated teams until late. That still does not look great when the Bills eked out a win against the hapless Titans and lost to the Giants in their only other matchup against a team over .500. The Bills should be doing much better against the bad teams they have faced if they think of themselves as a playoff contender.
The second easy place to look is injuries. Watkins, McCoy, quarterback Tyrod Taylor, and others have missed significant time over the opening couple months of the season. However, this explanation also seems insufficient. With the exception of defensive tackle Kyle Williams, the injuries have largely been to the offense, which has been honestly pretty good despite the lack of experience at quarterback and the coach’s defensive bent. While backup quarterback EJ Manuel basically single-handedly lost the game to the Jaguars, it seems this team’s problems go a bit deeper than injuries.
The third obvious explanation is the Bills’ penalties. Penalties hurt, but the Patriots and Seahawks are consistently among the league’s most penalized teams, and they do plenty of winning. This, combined with the previous two, will certainly cause problems for a team, but it seems that the Bills have some more fundamental issues.
The root of this team’s problems seems to come, more than anything, from a disconnect between personnel and scheme. Rex Ryan runs a 3–4 defense, putting three lineman and four linebackers near the line of scrimmage. He then runs a two-gap system where the defensive line’s job is to contain the pocket.
There are some problems with the Bills running this defense. Defensive tackle Marcel Dareus is among the best players in football, but his arms are not quite long enough to contain both A-gaps (the spaces between the center and the guards). This allows the center or the guard to seal off one of those gaps, creating both running and throwing lanes.
Further, defensive end Mario Williams is athletic and is best at wreaking havoc in the backfield. He has faded into the background when containing his side, which is further hurting the Bills’ defensive efforts.
The Bills have tried some interesting schematic changes in order to combat this. The first change came against the Bengals. The Bills would stack the line of scrimmage, showing blitz, and then bail into coverage. This confused Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton a bit and kept the Bills in the game until the waning moments. The problem was, the gimmick wore off after a while and Dalton got better at figuring out which blitzes were real. Further, Williams and other players did not like dropping back in coverage, so the scheme was unsustainable with the players.
The second change came against the Jaguars. Ryan changed from a two-gap to a one-gap defense, empowering his defensive line to go all out after the quarterback and continuing his method of having the defense show pressure and occasionally bail. This tortured Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles, who spent most of the game being woefully ineffective. Despite the team losing that game, the defense actually worked quite well. Of the 34 points they gave up, two came on defensive touchdowns, and one came on an absolute prayer thrown from an off balance Bortles that happened to fall into the flailing arms of Jaguars wide receiver Allen Hurns. The Bills lost multiple goal line possessions to a fumble and a (bogus) penalty, so really, they were the better football team. The problem was Manuel throwing the ball to the Jaguars when he wasn’t just dropping it on the ground for them to return.
This change to a one-gap system could, if the offense gets back on track, help right the ship for the Bills. Ryan showed in his first two years with the Jets that he could squeeze an elite defense out of solid players, he should certainly make something out of decent players.
With McCoy and Watkins getting healthier and only one game separating the Bills from the sixth seed, this team will probably make the playoffs, but if the defensive schemes keep ignoring their players, even one of the league’s best coaches with some of the league’s best players will have trouble.

Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team traveled to Thiel for a game on Saturday. The Tartans dominated the Tomcats by a 73–19 margin. The fourth straight win for the Tartans brought their overall record to 5–3 and their Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) record to 5–2.
The second biggest scoring day in Tartan history was also a record setting day for several players. Sophomore running back Sam Benger broke the single-season rushing record for the Tartans. His 166 rushing yard performance brought him to a season total of 1,453 rushing yards, surpassing the previous record of 1,326 set by Travis Sivek in 2006. Junior defensive end Brian Khoury made 3.0 sacks against Thiel, bringing his season total to a school record, beating 13.5 sacks and besting the previous 11.0 mark held by Chris Balouris in 1989 and tied by Anima Nwankwo in 1998. Junior placekicker Gabe Renna converted all eight extra point attempts on the day, bringing his season total to 36, beating out Nate Greenstein’s 32 extra point kicks in 2006.
The Tartans will next compete at home against the University of Chicago on Saturday, Nov. 7.
Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team suffered their first loss of the season against the Washington University in St. Louis Bears.
The game was a pure defensive battle from the moment the game started to the last whistle at the end of double overtime. Both offenses had opportunities, with the Tartans taking 13 shots and seven on goal compared to the Bears’ 20 shots and six on goal. Washington goalkeeper Lizzy Crist and junior goalkeeper Katie Liston each made a number of saves throughout the game; however, Liston’s first goal allowed since Oct. 6 ended up being the determining factor in the 1–0 loss.
The team got back to winning on Sunday, riding a four-goal second half to a 4–1 victory.
The Tartans are now 14–1–1 overall and 5–1 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. The Tartans will wrap up the regular season at Case Western on Saturday, Nov. 7.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team handily defeated Washington and St. Louis 3–1 on Friday.
After an evenly matched first half in which the Tartans fell behind 1–0, the offense took charge in the second half. First-year defender Greg Bellwoar headed in a free kick from junior midfielder Tristan Lockwood in the 54th minute. First-year midfielder Anthony Gulli got the lead for the Tartans off a pass from first-year midfielder Zack Masciopinto in the 71st minute. Senior forward William Webb sealed the victory for the Tartans in the 80th minute, taking in the rebound from a Masciopinto header attempt. First-year goalkeeper Alec Lam took over in goal for senior goalkeeper Eric Bykowsky late in the first half. Lam made six saves as the Tartans built up their lead.
On Sunday, the Tartans defeated the University of Chicago 1–0.
The Tartans will close out the season at Case Western on Saturday, Nov. 7.

Last week’s match-up is still a little hard for me to talk about. I’m going to keep matters brief to minimize the pain. It was bad. I was on the losing side of a 101–72 match-up.
LeGarrette Blount rushed for negative three yards and earned zero points. The Jets D/ST allowed 30 points and almost 400 yards, raking in a whopping one point. And it gets worse.
Team Escamilla had Matt Stafford with 18 points, Marshawn Lynch with 18, Todd Gurley with 27, and the St. Louis D/ST with 21. These four players alone scored more than my entire team. But wait. There’s more.
I had the Giants D/ST on my bench, because why would I start them? And then, they caught three interceptions, returned one for a touchdown, recovered a fumble, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. All this for 16 points. Also on my bench, Nate Washington received for 127 yards and scored two touchdowns, amounting to 24 points. Had I started them both, I could have won 107-101. But I’m not bitter.
Going into this week, the projections had me defeating Team Sizzling Fajitas 87-75, but of course projections never hold. But just after Thursday Night Football, things are looking a little different. We both have Patriots running backs, which is kind of weird to me. Unfortunately, his Dion Lewis just saw more action than my LeGarrette Blount.
I expect to lose the match-up at quarterback, too. Even though Russell Wilson and the Seahawks are pretty much universally expected to beat the Cowboys, it looks like Alex Smith and the Chiefs will come out on top of the Detroit Lions in their London match. Detroit is basically a total mess, they’ve had a lot of staffing changes recently. Plus Charcandrick West is pretty hot right now, and he and Smith have some good chemistry.
The past couple of weeks have been a little disappointing as a Le’Veon Bell owner. He scored eight against the Cardinals and 13 against the Chiefs, which is not what I expect from a number-one draft pick. This week, Pittsburgh faces the Cincinnati Bengals, who have been on a serious winning streak. I don’t feel like I can count on him to live up to his 16 point projection, even though he has historically done pretty well against the Bengals. Still, he’s matched up against Frank Gore of the Colts, who averages about nine points per game. Even though I’m reserving optimism for Bell, I think I have this match up.
At wide receiver I’m starting Decker and Washington. Unfortunately Pierre Garcon has a bye week, so I don’t have any other options. Decker might not even start, which would be seriously crushing along with Washington’s variable performance. In order to win this match up I need both players to actually play, and play their best. Fajitas is starting Michael Crabtree and Steve Smith Sr., who both have the potential to do some damage if they get the targets. I honestly have no idea how this match up will turn out because I still don’t really know anything about football.
On tight end, I’ve been pretty happy with Ladarius Green. (Can I be honest that I still don’t actually know what a tight end does? Someone remind me to google it [editor’s note: once upon a time a tight end was a sixth offensive lineman who occasionally got out to receive short and intermediate passes. Now, a tight end is a sixth receiver who occasionally blocks.] Antonio Gates returned from his suspension and then got a knee injury, so Green is still getting a good bit of targets. And when he does, he can really put up some points. Fajitas is starting Richard Rodgers, who has two first names, so he must be awful.
I actually did end up picking up Dexter McCluster, whose name sounds like something a rooster might choke out at 5 a.m., for my flex. This turned out to be an okay choice. He scored nine points in week six and six points in week seven, actually winning or tying both match ups. I think he’ll do well against Seattle’s Tyler Lockett, who’s just inconsistent.
I’m giving the Jets one last chance to not screw everything up this week against the Raiders, who have actually been somewhat of a force to be reckoned with this season. But Fajitas has the Chiefs D/ST facing the Lions, and the Lions offense might totally choke under new leadership. I’m going to try to be hopeful in my Jets, but only time will tell.
And at kicker, I finally have McManus back. During his bye, my backup kicker Nick Folk did have a solid 13 point performance, but I’m still totally taken with my man Brandon. Sports editor Zeke Rosenberg tells me this is getting creepy, which doesn’t matter to me. Match up irrelevant.
McManus is the only thing that matters.
Now that I’m 4–3, I’m not as confident in my team. I tried some random insulting trades and they haven’t panned out, so I think my only hope at this point is to actually try and understand football.

Modern medicine can do some amazing things. From shocking hearts back into rhythm to eradicating disease altogether, medicine seems to be a field of ever-growing possibility. However, when considering diseases such as cancer, where the enemy is not a foreign invader but the body’s own tissues, effective treatments require a little more engineering, which is where targeted drug delivery comes into play.
Targeted drug delivery is a very complicated process, especially in the case of cancer, where it is difficult to distinguish between mutated cells and healthy ones. Cells receive stimulation from the outside environment via receptor proteins located in their membranes. There are no cancer-cell-specific receptors, which in an ideal situation could be used to effectively treat cancer cells. This makes it difficult to specifically target cancer cells with medication and leave the healthy cells untouched. Many drugs tend to interfere with the parts of a cell crucial for division, which also means that they will target the cells that tend to divide more quickly — hair, skin, and bits of the digestive system. This is one reason why smart drug delivery is being researched — to stop wrongfully killing healthy cells.
There are still many large questions surrounding this treatment method, including how to get drug molecules into cells and how to differentiate between healthy and diseased cells. While some factors are not quite set in stone, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, and U.C. Davis have partnered to tackle a relatively more concrete project: engineering the structure of the “packages” within which drugs would be contained — liposomes.
Liposomes are the structures that surround the drug and carry it through the body. Liposomes are made up of phospholipids, the same molecules that make up a cell’s membrane. They are an important factor in the viability of targeted drug delivery because they have to be structurally sound; if they are not, doctors run the risk of having them burst inside patients, spilling their destructive contents in the body and leading to internal damage.
This project was a multi-scaled study, meaning that three different teams targeted the problem from three different microscope resolutions. The resolution determines the properties and science considered by the particular team — will they look at the liposome’s structure at a magnification which privileges chemistry (atomic/molecular levels), or will they take a coarser look and privilege physical properties?
The Carnegie Mellon researchers, led by Professor Markus Deserno of Carnegie Mellon’s Physics Department and Dr. Mingyang Hu, a PhD candidate in computational biophysics, focused on the structure at a coarse level. This means that they looked at the problem from a physical perspective, applying the study of physics to their computational models and examinations. 
They started out with a hub and spoke model, the same design as an old carriage wheel: the drug molecule in the center, polymeric tethers which would bind to the drug as the supportive spokes, and the phospholipids which would comprise the surrounding layer, or the wheel itself.
The team concerned themselves with the pragmatics of liposome creation, since one of the overarching goals of their research is to produce the liposomes for clinical use. They focused on the liposome’s dispersity, or the uniformity of the system, and, according to Deserno, “how uniform does it have to be not to disperse, in order to work?” The results were encouraging enough that production would not be prohibitively expensive, and the system will hold just fine in theory. 
The team was also concerned with the production process’ role in creating liposomes. For simple liposomes without the structural design necessary for carrying drug molecules, Deserno said that “[their size] depends on the production process. But this isn’t the case with our structure. The size of the liposome is dictated by the physics. It’s the choice of design parameters, like how many polymers, how long they are, et cetera.” 
This means that the theoretical structure is much more easily producible, good news for those who would actually construct them.
“I’m the guy at Amazon who packages things nicely so they don’t get broken,” said Deserno.
The researchers developed a theoretical, robust package for drug delivery. Deserno maintained that while the findings were “pure theory and computational study,” the theories should be sound enough that when another lab attempts to produce the liposomes using these blueprints, it should work swimmingly.

Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University teamed up with IBM to create the first open platform for a smartphone app to assist the blind navigate their surroundings.
The app, called NavCog, primarily works on the Carnegie Mellon campus. It uses existing smartphone sensors and Bluetooth beacons to inform the blind of their surroundings through ear buds or smartphone vibrations.
“When in an unfamiliar place, people tend to use a walking navigation system on their device to compare the map location to the surrounding views,” NavCog’s website explains. “However, visually impaired people cannot check the map or the surrounding scenery to bridge the gap between the ground truth and the rough GPS location. 
“NavCog aims for an improved high-accuracy walking navigation system that uses BLE beacons together with various kinds of sensors with a new localization algorithm for both indoors and outdoors.”
NavCog is currently available online and will be downloadable on the App Store soon. IBM Bluemix has also made the cognitive assistant tools available through a cloud for developers. 
These tools include a navigation app, a map editing tool, and localization algorithms to help the blind identify where they are and what direction they are facing.
Chieko Asakawa, an IBM Fellow and distinguished service professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, headed the project.
“While visually impaired people like myself have become independent online, we are still challenged in the real world. To gain further independence and help improve the quality of life, ubiquitous connectivity across indoor and outdoor environments is necessary,” Asakawa said in a university press release. “I’m excited that this open platform will help accelerate the advancement of cognitive assistance research by giving developers opportunities to build various accessibility applications and test non-traditional technologies such as ultrasonic and advanced inertial sensors to assist navigation.”
NavCog is a product emerging from the research field of cognitive assistance, which utilizes smart machine technology to assist people in everyday life. 
Researchers from the Carnegie Mellon University Cognitive Assistance Laboratory collaborated with IBM Research to explore the use of localization technologies, sensors, and computer vision to identify objects and people to assist with people’s declining cognitive abilities. Although the app currently only works on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, the researchers are optimistic, and hope to work with others to implement this technology in other locations.
Martial Hebert, the director of the Robotics Institute, commented on NavCog, saying that “from localization information to understanding of objects, we have been creating technologies to make the real-world environment more accessible for everyone. 
With our long history of developing technologies for humans and robots that will complement humans’ missing abilities to sense the surrounding world, this open platform will help expand the horizon for global collaboration to open up the new real-world accessibility era for the blind in the near future.”
According to NavCog’s website, “NavCog aims to achieve a higher accuracy localization so that in the future, it will be able to provide a more precise description of surrounding Point of Interests and environmental information to the users based on their current location.” 
While this new technology represents a major step forward in assisting those who are visually impaired, the research team hopes to continue pushing the boundaries. 
In the future, they hope to develop versions of the app that can detect approaching individuals as well as their moods.

At last week’s Pugwash meeting, we discussed the use of statistics in the criminal justice system. Inspiration for the topic was drawn both from the science fiction movie Minority Report, in which crimes are predicted before they even happen and would-be criminals are jailed before they commit the act, and from real life, as a proposed Pennsylvania law aims to determine probabilities of criminals re-offending and adjust prison sentences accordingly.
One of the first things that came up in the discussion were the reasons for jailing people in the first place. First is the idea of retribution: If one person sees another doing something wrong, he would presumably want to punish the perpetrator and make him pay for it. Second is the idea of incarceration: by taking dangerous individuals out of society, society as a whole will be better off. Finally, there’s the idea of rehabilitation: taking people who made wrong choices and teaching them how to function in society so they can return as functioning, productive members to society.
An initial thought was that the use of statistics would make the criminal system more objective. Instead of being at the whim of a human jury or judge, who may hold biases, or be having bad days and make poor judgements, sentencing would be done in the same manner for everyone, by the same algorithm. Wouldn’t it be more fair?
However, some questions about statistics came up. How can we trust the current statistics that would be used to build the models to determine probabilities of re-offense? It would be easy to look at the current situation and say that certain races just commit more crimes than others, when there are really many more factors at play. The current system is biased, and so basing statistical models off the current system would just carry those biases forward.
Countering those concerns was the idea that if we know what the biases are, we can work to correct them and come up with a better system. However, even if the model itself isn’t biased, the police doing the legwork, looking for crime may be biased.
That was one idea that resurfaced throughout the conversation. Couldn’t using statistics to determine who is more likely to commit a crime and then incarcerating him or her end in a downward spiral? Suppose the model says black men are more likely to commit crimes, and so therefore we round up all the “high risk” black men and imprison them. Wouldn’t this be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy?
Similarly, if we’re using statistics to root out the supposedly worst parts of society, wouldn’t it make sense to use the same model to determine who will be the least likely to commit crime and produce positive effects on society, and then prop those chosen ones up? Just by thinking about it, one can see how the self-fulfilling prophecy is something to be avoided.
Also of concern was the idea that by handing off all the work to a statistical model, we would be rejecting the idea of free will. Although an individual may be at high risk of committing crimes, it is ultimately up to that individual whether or not he commits a crime. Instead of just throwing them in jail, wouldn’t it be better to encourage them to make better choices?
This is the key question Pugwash was asking about the need for prisons. Is it merely to protect society? If it is, it would just be best to take people with a high probability of criminality and toss them in jail to protect innocent civilians. But if the idea behind jail is criminal rehabilitation, then the statistical models could be used for a better purpose.
Instead of jailing high-risk individuals, resources could instead be used to help understand their situation and why they would commit a crime, and then help move them away from that situation and mindset. 
For example, criminals who performed crimes of necessity are entirely from poorer populations, and are at more risk of re-offending as well. But no matter how much they get thrown into jail, they’ll still re-offend because they need whatever they’re stealing to survive. So instead of jailing them, maybe they should be targeted with assistance. The statistical models could be used to find high-risk offenders and then work with them to remove the causes of crime.
This would require more than just the introduction of statistics into sentencing, however. It would be an entire shift in the mindset of the American criminal justice system. And while Pugwash mostly compared incarceration to rehabilitation in terms of benefit to society, many Americans still hold tight to the idea of retribution: jail is punishment for bad acts, and should be meted out because criminals deserve it, regardless of any existing alternative methods.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the use of statistics in the criminal justice system.

Recently, the citizens of Mexico unexpectedly found themselves in the direct path of Hurricane Patricia, which is being lauded as the most intense tropical cyclone even recorded in the Western Hemisphere. Meteorologists first acknowledged Patricia as a tropical depression, but it quickly grew from a tropic storm to a Category 5 hurricane within the span of 24 hours. Hurricanes can be amazingly powerful and destructive forces of nature, and they can grow at terrifying and unpredictable rates.
On Oct. 23, Patricia made landfall and luckily was not nearly as destructive as initially expected. Still, its rapid growth has mystified meteorologists. Despite having a fundamental understanding of how hurricanes form, they cannot fully explain Patricia’s growth.
Hurricanes generally form over warm ocean waters near the equator because the warm, moist air rises upward from the surface. Simultaneously, the space left void by the rising air is filled with the surrounding cooler air. The warm moist air forms into clouds, generating a powerful machine-like system that continues to grow as the wind spins and the storm feeds on warm air. 
Storms formed north of the equator spin counterclockwise while those that form south of the equator spin clockwise. The center of the hurricane, commonly known as the eye, forms as the storm system begins to pick up speed. 
A Category 5 hurricane like Patricia produces wind speeds up to and over 155 mph, though Patricia earned the title of the strongest Pacific wind system ever observed, with wind speeds of 200 mph. 
Meteorologists described Patricia’s development into a Category 5 hurricane as a result of a perfect environment for rapid intensification. During its formation, there was a consistent cycle of heat exchange and a large drop in pressure, optimal conditions for hurricane formation.
Wind shear, also known as a wind gradient, results from quickly changing speeds and direction of wind and usually acts as a brake to slow the growth of the hurricane. Unfortunately, wind shear was very weak during Patricia’s formation, and this largely contributed to its rapid growth.
Luckily, the strength of the storm subsided, and damage was not as serious as initially expected. Still, Hurricane Patricia will continue to be regarded as a very interesting phenomenon and a dangerous natural disaster by meteorologists and citizens alike.

Neurons involved in itch separate from those in pain
Researchers from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies discovered a neural pathway involving neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons dedicated to transmitting non-chemically induced itches, defined as tingling sensations caused by a light touch. In collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the researchers determined the function of neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons by removing them from the spinal cord of mice and performed experiments in which they silenced the genes that expressed the NPY neurons. 
To their surprise, they found that the mice without NPY neurons were no more sensitive to chemically-induced itch, itch caused by a healing mosquito bite or wound on the skin, or pain, even through their sensitivity to light touch had increased. The study suggests that the spinal neurons involved in an itch differ from those that cause pain and chemical itch. In the future, these findings could help researchers modify neurons to treat patients who suffer from chronic itch.

New class of DNA enzyme repair is discovered
A new class of DNA repair enzyme, called AlkD, has been discovered by researchers from Vanderbilt University of California, Davis, and Toyama Prefectural University. Found in soil-dwelling bacteria that cause a certain kind of food poisoning, AlkD binds to DNA that is damaged by environmental factors such as ultraviolet light. This binding causes conformational changes in the DNA that enable the removal of a damaged base, a building block of DNA, in order to make room for a new, undamaged base.
AlkD was previously thought to belong to a class of enzymes known as DNA glycosylase which remove damaged DNA bases through a process known as base-excision repair. The new discoveries by these researchers broadens the scope of DNA repair mechanisms, and suggests that there could be many more mechanisms than previously thought. Information about these new mechanisms could potentially lead to new treatment options for a variety of diseases, including cancer.

Dolphins suspected in whale attack off the coast of Skye
Last week, a severely injured, three-year-old pilot whale was euthanized after being found in Dunvegan, a small town on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The whale had teeth marks on its body, flippers, and dorsal fin, wounds that are rarely found along the coasts of the United Kingdom. Marine officials suspect that bottlenose dolphins were the culprit of the injuries. The officials are not sure whether the injuries arose from the whale playing with or being attacked by the bottlenose dolphins.
Scottish waters are home to the most northerly population of bottlenose dolphins in the world, and interactions between dolphins and whales are an integral part of their natural behavior. There has only been one previous incident of a dolphin attacking a whale in the United Kingdom. The incident serves as a reminder to those who come in contact with dolphins that while they are generally friendly, they do possess a potentially aggressive nature.

New artificial skin feels texture and hears sound
The world’s first artificial fingerprints have been designed by researchers at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology and Dong-A University, which are both located in South Korea. The scientists created electronic skin that incorporates fingerprint-like grooves on the surface to mimic real fingertips.
The artificial skin is made of layers of plastic and graphene material that are flexible and sensitive toward external stimuli. Through fluctuations in electric current the skin can detect subtle changes in temperature and pressure. Furthermore, it can detect noises even better than a microphone of a smartphone. The study was published in the journal Science Advances.
The scientists hope to continue this research in order to find a way to relay signals from the electronic skin to the brain. They hope that the skin will ultimately serve as the basis for more comfortable and efficient prosthetics, wearable devices, and hearing aids.

Probes unveil three hidden blemishes on the moon
In a recent publication of the journal Science Advances, researchers presented evidence that reveals three previously unseen blemishes on the surface of the moon. Back in 2011, scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched twin probes from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL). The GRAIL mission, which went on until 2012, gave the scientists a better understanding of the circular dents on the moon’s surface caused by impact craters. With the data collected from the gravitational pulls on the two spacecrafts, the scientists were able to find evidence for the existence of three basins named Asperitatis, Bartels-Voskresenskiy, and Copernicus-H. 
The size and distribution of these basins goes against the idea that four billion years ago space rocks hit the Earth and moon, which is a common suggestion for the eradication of early life on Earth.

Facebook replaces Other inbox with message requests
Facebook has announced that in the next few days it will be making changes to its Messenger service by getting rid of the Other inbox, similar to a spam folder, in which users receive messages from people that they are not friends with on the site. The Other inbox, which many Facebook users either are not aware of or don’t check, will be replaced by a message request system in which a user receives these messages directly in their inbox and has to either accept or reject them. 
While the new request service will enable to users to message virtually anyone on the social network and ensure that their message is seen, there have been increased concerns about the decreased privacy associated with the service. Many organizations and page admins, however, are embracing the new format because it will likely increase the amount of users they are able to contact.

On Thursday afternoon, members of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) assembled to present a panel discussion regarding the relationship between computer science, neuroscience, and the connection between the brain’s circuitry and consciousness.
The panel was composed of Carnegie Mellon faculty from multiple departments. The panel, mediated by professor of biological sciences and interim director of BrainHub Alison Barth, included Carnegie Mellon faculty coming from the Departments of Computer Science, Neuroscience and Biological Sciences, and Philosophy. The attendees were Sandra Kuhlman, assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences; Wayne Wu, an assistant professor and Associate Director of the CNBC; David Touretzky, research professor for the computer science department and the CNBC; and Anind Dey, a faculty member in the Department of Human Computer Interaction.
In the words of Dr. Barth, the central question the discussion revolved around was, “How close are we to being able to represent the human consciousness in computers?”
Kuhlman began the panel by speaking about the brain’s complexity. After listing some of the ways in which this complexity manifests, she noted her doubt toward the idea of neuroscientists fully understanding the brain within her lifetime, stating that she is more interested in “developing strategies for understanding the brain” than she is in pursuing a complete understanding.
Next, Wu discussed a paper which examined the idea of hearing a sound to understand consciousness; some brain activity was observed when the subject was introduced to sound but did not actively “hear” it, and brain activity was widespread when the subject heard the sound, or was conscious of it. In this way, Wu summarized that not all brain activity “gives rise to mentality,” which adds another difficulty to the already aggressive list.
Wu went on to discuss the idea of downloading consciousness, of mirroring the brain’s circuitry and attempting to replicated consciousness in a computer. He admitted that “there are already problems connecting the brain to the mind, so there would be many more issues in connecting the brain to computational systems.” As it now stands, there is no clear sign for a biological basis for consciousness, no explanatory connection between intelligence and the circuitry of the brain.
Wu brought up the idea of Turing’s Test, in which a human (A), and a computer (B) are asked questions by an impartial party (C); based on the questions and their answers, C determines which one is human. If C has to guess, then this is considered proof of an artificial consciousness’s legitimacy. This idea was applied to constructions such as Watson, IBM’s artificial intelligence who beat actual human players at Jeopardy, SimSensei, a virtual therapist, and Chatbot programs which simulate conversation in text. The argument is that artificial intelligence is more than the ability to create a dialogue; some programs can do this by reiterating the question originally asked, or in Watson’s case, by answering correctly. These sorts of virtual consciousnesses are the closest we can currently come to a truly artificial intelligence, but they appear to be on the right track.
The conversation gradually shifted from the creation of artificial intelligence in computers to the possibility of transferring a human consciousness into a computer. The panelists focused on a case in which a doctor of neuroscience developed a brain tumor and elected to preserve her brain so that in the future, there would be potential for her consciousness to be replicated in a computer so that she and her boyfriend could talk after she passed away. The panelists agreed that there are many issues with cryopreservation and this overall situation. There is the issue of natural cell death and the tissue death that comes from freezing, and since we do not currently have a concrete connection between the brain and the mind, it would be a long while before anything like this would even be plausible. Also, there is the fact that were they to reconstruct her brain, they would be reconstructing a haywire brain — a tumored brain — to consider.
Dey talked about work being done by the University of Southern California, where researchers are attempting to preserve the consciousness of a Holocaust survivor. They recorded him with multiple cameras in order to produce a 3D hologram construction of his body. When he speaks, he mimics the normal physical patterns of human speech very well. The hologram is a repository of information, much like a human intelligence: One can ask him a question, and he will reply by combining many facts about himself and responding in a very human way. This seemed to be the most interesting push toward a real consciousness within a computer out of all of the examples.
The underlying thread beneath these two examples is that there is still no clear connection between the mind and the brain — between consciousness and circuitry. The most difficult task, the panel agreed, would be to recreate a specific consciousness and have it recognizable by a loved one. 
As of now, it is far easier to replicate a simple emotion or a person you’ve never met before. Recreating a specific consciousness brings up the question: just because a program can think like a person, or has the same wiring and circuit activity, is that program then that person? Do they need access to that person’s memories to truly replicate that consciousness? Is a simple replication of the circuitry enough, or is there something more, something intangible about the individual that makes this concept of downloading consciousness unproductive? Right now, there are more questions than answers.

It is hard to forget the original buzz generated back in 2009 by the wide release of the first installment of the Paranormal Activity series. It was released with advertisements that “guaranteed nightmares” and recommended that you “don’t see it alone.” The movie fared decently well among critics, and the series continued. However, ratings for the series have followed a negative trend and declined pretty steadily with each film.
The latest movie, film number six, was released on Oct. 23. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension promised similar thrills as its predecessors, even adding, “For the first time you will see the activity.” Personally, though admittedly unsatisfied with the last five Paranormal Activity movies, finding them predictable and full of holes, I was still willing to give this installment a chance.
The Ghost Dimension was directed by Gregory Plotkin, who had not been previously involved in the Paranormal Activity series. Hoping that this change would vary the directing style of the film (after all, this is the sixth movie in the series), I was disappointed to see that the film’s basic style, which consists mainly of shaky, night-vision, POV camera footage, remained unchanged.
The Ghost Dimension opens on a young family that has recently moved into their new home. Parents Ryan and Emily Fleege (played by Chris J. Murray and Brit Shaw, respectively) are decorating the living room for Christmas with their young daughter Leila (Ivy George). We are quickly introduced to Ryan’s brother Mike, and family friend Skylar (played by Dan Gill and Olivia Taylor Dudley, respectively) who are planning to stay with the family over the winter holidays. Although the opening of the film seemed quite cookie cutter, and the whole “young family moves into a new home in a new town” thing had a strong resemblance to the opening of several other Paranormal Activity films, I was happy to see the film seemed to be moving a little faster than others in the series.
Fast-forward a little, and Ryan and Mike are outside decorating when Mike finds an old box of VHS tapes and a video camera. Here we are met with another classic scary movie cliché — “It was probably left over from the previous owners.” Naturally, they watch all the tapes and mess around with the video camera. Those who have seen previous installments of the Paranormal Activity series would recognize both the content on the films and the films themselves. The films have been passed around between several families, and they include recurring footage of characters that appeared previously in the series. The two young girls in the videos seem to be interacting with a paranormal being named Toby, who becomes an integral a part of The Ghost Dimension.
The movie pace picks up a little as Leila starts acting strange. She tries to bury her mother’s rosary and burn a bible in the fireplace. It wasn’t a huge shock to find out that Leila’s explanation for the strange doings was that Toby told her to. Given the title of the movie, The Ghost Dimension, one might think that we are finally making progress in the series and coming a little closer to figuring out what exactly is possessing everyone in the series, who exactly Toby is, and where exactly this dimension is. We’ve been in suspense since the original Paranormal Activity. We’ve seen family after family be affected by the same demonic being, Toby. Perhaps the idea behind such a mystery is to keep viewers coming back for the next film, but a six-movie-long mystery seems a tad bit excessive.
For about forty minutes, the movie consists of Ryan walking around his house with the video camera filming some strange black mist, presumably Toby, which seems to interact with Leila. There was a lengthy period of not-so-paranormal activity that could probably be explained by a draft in the kitchen or an open window in Leila’s room. The same cliché scary movie scenes ensue: The camera gets knocked over, pots and pans from the kitchen fall over, a loud bang is heard in the living room and a startled wife yells “What was that?!” The only real thrills up to this point happened when the mist would fly passed the camera, and that was really only due to that fact that The Ghost Dimension was in 3D.
The movie is nearly over at this point, and no real action has transpired. Convinced that Toby is going to take Leila away, the family sets up the camera in Leila’s room and consults a priest in the hopes that they may rid their daughter of the evil spirits. The family is gathered together in the living room with the priest. In a very sudden turn of events, the movie goes, quite literally, from a crawling pace to a full on sprint in terms of paranormal activity. The lights in the house go out, and the movie switches to a very familiar night vision, POV footage, because for some reason Ryan still feels the need to use the video camera. The room is in chaos. Toby somehow morphs into human form. There is a great deal of screaming. The footage is so shaky that it is unclear what happens to Skylar, Ryan, Mike, or the priest. They are there one moment and gone the next. Are they dead? Maybe. It’s odd that the characters all died at once, but there was hardly even time to be scared or upset at the loss of over half of the cast, as the movie was in full throttle at this point.
Emily chases a very possessed Leila up to her room, where she enters into a portal to what the viewer assumes is the ghost dimension. Are we finally going to see who Toby is? Are we finally going to be exposed to this strange world where all these tapes of lost footage are coming from? For those, including myself, who assumed The Ghost Dimension would finally answer these questions unfortunately waited in vain. We are left with even more unanswered questions as the film closes with Leila walking out of frame with Toby, whom we only ever get to see from the knees down.
What happens to Leila? What becomes of her family? Who is Toby? Will the tapes get passed on again? All in all, the movie was predictable and full of cliché scenarios. A scare here and there, but nothing dramatic. In true Paranormal Activity fashion, the film closes with the obvious set up for an additional installment. Am I excited? Not really. Will I see it in the hopes that they will finally, after seven films, reveal what the hell is going on? Probably.

Gaylen Ross is an actress turned producer, writer, and director. Her transition was triggered by an epiphany during a beach scene: she noticed how much better it looked on the other side of the camera, how non-actors did not get splashed or covered in sand. She visited Carnegie Mellon University last Thursday to talk about storytelling through film. She began by speaking about how much movies have changed. How when she was younger, half the fun of a movie was watching it in the middle and having to guess what happened in the first half. Films have lost this essence, Ross said, and now they so clearly spell out the story for the viewer that it is almost impossible to guess or interpret any of it for yourself. As someone who does not think about movies much beyond the theater, I thought this was very interesting. Do I not think about movies long after I see them because of how clearly the plot is spelled out to me? Does the lack of outside thought required make me a passive movie watcher?
As I pondered this, Ross launched into how she chooses to layout the films she puts together. The first of her films that she spoke of was Caris’ Peace. This was a film she made about her late friend Caris Corfman, an actress from the Yale School of Drama who starred in several movies before developing a brain tumor that caused her to lose her short term memory. Ross discussed how important it was to not make the focus of the story that she got back onstage after this, but how she got back on stage. Ross explained that she did this to keep the film from being a cliché story about someone overcoming obstacles to finally achieve something that she thought she could not do. By starting the documentary off by showing that Corfman does get back onstage, the viewers were allowed to focus more on her journey rather than wondering if it would all be in vain.
Many of the excerpts that Ross shared of her films showed how she always tries to find the most unconventional way to tell a story. The most interesting way she did this was in her film Killing Kasztner: The Jew who Dealt with the Nazis, a movie about the life and death of Rudolf Kastner, a Hungarian Jew that helped other Jews escape occupied Europe during the Holocaust. Ross spent years collecting information on the subject not to build a case for or against Kastner, but to provide a comprehensive story and let the viewers decide which side of history was correct. She chose to begin this film by allowing Kastner’s assassin, Ze’ev Eckstein, to tell his side of the story first. This definitely made it harder as a viewer because there were moments where Eckstein would do or say something funny, but it felt wrong to get attached to him the way you would to any other person who was sharing the intimate details of his life with you.
Ross talked about how smart he was to build this sense of trust and understanding with those watching him so that at the end of the film when he recants his story and says that he actually didn’t shoot Kastner, you almost believe him. The film then goes on to the perspectives of Kastner’s daughter and granddaughters, which admittedly were not as interesting as the perspective of the assassin. The way that Ross not only arranged this film to include his perspective and make the film more unbiased, but set it in the present tense instead of focusing on the past was refreshing. I felt that this helped to make the story more relatable and also show how the version of history that is perpetuated can influence the present.
Overall, I really enjoyed the perspective that Ross had to offer regarding how to enhance stories by telling them through film. There are so many different ways to put together the different puzzle pieces of a story to make it much more interesting. By starting with a question that either can or can’t be answered, Ross challenges viewers to focus on things that usually would not be the focal point of a movie, such as the man behind the gun or how hard it is for a woman with no short term memory to remember why she is on stage in the first place. I cannot promise that I will be a more active movie watcher, but it would be nice if movies challenged me to be one a little more.

Leonardio DiCaprio comments on next film: *The Revenant*
Leonardo DiCaprio chooses roles much the same way a professional ball player chooses which pitches to swing at: it has to be perfect, and it has to present the best opportunity to score. Whether or not "score" means Oscar contention or a chance to work with a revered director, it is apparent that DiCaprio has a pretty good batting average. His new film, The Revenant, is set for a Dec. 25, 2015 release, and the film looks to be another cinematic masterpiece, much ado to two-time Academy Award winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity, Birdman). DiCaprio sat down with Yahoo! Movies to discuss the new film, and his comments make me anticipate The Revenant even more, which I did not think was possible. DiCaprio stated, "It’s going to be one of the most unique film-going experiences that audiences have seen in modern times..."
The film takes place in the frozen wilderness and the filmmaking team spent nine months in remote parts of Canada and Argentina, using only natural light to film. When asked about the harsh filming conditions, Leo responded, "The truth is that I knew what I was getting into. This was a film that had been floating around for quite some time, but nobody was crazy enough to really take this on, simply because of the logistics of where we needed to shoot and the amount of work and rehearsal that would have to be done to achieve Alejandro and (Lubezki's) vision. They’re very specific about their shots and what they want to achieve, and that — compounded with the fact that we were in an all-natural environment, succumbing to whatever nature gave us — was something that became more of a profoundly intense chapter of our lives than we ever thought it was going to be."
Nothing is certain in film, but I anticipate The Revenant to be in the Oscar conversation come the new year. All the right pieces are in place. All we can do is wait and see.
Chris Rock to host the Oscars 
Speaking of the Oscars, let's talk about the upcoming 88th Academy Awards and how the show's producers decided to bring back, after 11 years, one of the most celebrated comedians around. Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, and documentarian Chris Rock will return as host for the Feb. 28 broadcast of the "Biggest Night In Hollywood." Rock and the Academy butted heads in the decade since 2005, the last time he hosted, regarding the Academy's "white-washing" the awards, but the tensions have since died down. Today, we can finally wise up and recognize that Chris Rock's comedic style might be the perfect breath of fresh air for an Academy Awards, which has taken a recent dip in the ratings since its height in 2014 under Ellen DeGeneres' hosting. Chris Rock is hilarious, intelligent, adept, socially aware, dramatically talented, and charmingly snarky. He checks all the boxes for great hosting and brings that one-of-a-kind voice as a cherry on top.
Jared Leto speaks out about his role as the Joker
The Joker may be the most famous villain in entertainment. Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader are contenders, but when the Clown Prince of Crime enters the scene, no good can happen. There have been several accounts of Jared Leto never breaking character on the set of the upcoming Suicide Squad (sending co-stars dead rats in a shoe box and whatnot), but Leto himself has finally commented on what it was like to become the most feared villain in Gotham, "There was definitely a period of... detachment. I took a pretty deep dive. But this was a unique opportunity and I couldn't imagine doing it another way. It was fun, playing those psychological games. But at the same time it was very painful, like giving birth out of my pr**k hole."
Director David Ayer also spoke about Leto's Joker, and how this incarnation will differentiate itself from past Joker's we have seen on screen, "The Joker is the third rail of comic book movies. There's a power to that character, and by some freaking miracle, through the incredible things Jared has done and the photography and all the other millions of things that went into it, we've cooked up something transcendent. He's scary."
A scary Joker? So, all the past Jokers were not scary? Sure, the Joker in the comic books has done things no film has come close to, but is this when we get the frightening psychopathic rage that The Joker embodies? I'm already going to be first in line when [ITAL]Suicide Squad[ITAL] is released on Aug. 5, 2016, but if this Joker is the most rampant, psychotic, frightening Joker we've ever seen, I might just have to campout at the ticket booth.
Nicholas Hoult and Rooney Mara to star in *The Discovery* 
Nicholas Hoult entered my radar as Beast in X-Men: First Class but has only recently become a name to remember when he appeared as Nux in Mad Max: Fury Road. Rooney Mara's talents are undeniable, especially for those who have seen her Academy Award nominated performance in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. It is now being reported that Hoult and Mara will be seen together in The Discovery. 
Directed by relative newcomer Charlie McDowell, the film is a romance set in a world one year after scientific proof of an afterlife has been discovered.  Hoult plays the son of the man responsible for the discovery while Mara plays Hoult's love interest, whose life is "tinged by a tragic past."
The concept sounds very intriguing and fresh. Hollywood has been criticized recently for not producing much, if any, original material; only sequels and films based on comic books get released. Much the same as any casual pedestrian buying pizza, you buy a pizza you trust. Trying a new place is a bit frightening. New ideas and untested scripts are frightening to studios, especially when they may need to hand over tens of millions of dollars. I hold that same skepticism. On the other hand, I may not know McDowell's directing abilities, but having Hoult and Mara involved tells me the acting caliber is far from untested. The Discovery is set to start production in Rhode Island in January 2016. No release date has been, set but anticipate waiting until 2017 to buy your tickets.

La Scuola Degli Amanti, the Carnegie Mellon School Of Music’s latest production, is best described by the literal translation of its name — “The School of Love and Infidelity.” La Scuola is built around three operas — Cosi fan tutte, Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro. All three, collaborations between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte, are legendary works. Scored by Mozart at the height of his genius, all three are amongst the most brutally honest, dark, and hauntingly beautiful expressions of what it means to be in and out of love. La Scuola takes these classics and does something very brave, melding them into a single production set across multiple timelines.
In La Scuola, scenes from Cosi fan tutte are set in the modern era, from Don Giovanni are set in the roaring ‘20s, and from Le nozze di Figaro are in the original 18th century setting. As such, La Scuola has a very interesting narrative structure. Scenes from each timeline are interspersed with others, making for a heady contrast for the audience. Nevertheless there are unifying ideas to the entire production. As a whole, La Scuola explores the roles that men and women play in relationships; it makes the argument that certain themes — like love and fidelity — are timeless concepts.
Successfully reinterpreting not one or two, but three classics is a herculean task to say the least. Doing it over three different eras, and interspersing the scenes with each other is more difficult still. And though this brave structure makes for a revolutionary production in theory, some of it doesn’t come off perfectly. Some of the scenes seem out of place. Some of the lines seem incredibly dated in a modern context. In Cosi fan tutte, for example, women are represented as weak-willed and superficial. Such depictions might have been the norm in 18th century Vienna; put in a modern setting, however, this misogyny seems incoherent. This, and other such instances make La Scuola’s themes seem far from timeless, and end up distracting from the productions underlying message.
Ideation aside, the execution of La Scuola is flawless. If you haven’t seen many performances from the School of Music, prepare to be blown away. From the singing to the arrangements, Mozart is unbelievably layered and intricate, with abrupt key changes, and strange time signatures. The cast and orchestra make it all look downright easy. Not to mention, the set and costume design are downright spectacular. A simple and minimalist set successfully morphs from a small private chamber to a large party space to an enchanted snowy forest. The costumes are used to convey era and mood. Modern day Cosi fan tutte has characters that dress in loud and garish contemporary attire. 1920s Don Giovanni has characters that represent the gentry of that era. 18th century Nozze has characters that represent 18th Century aristocracy.
Ultimately, La Scuola is a very well-staged piece — there isn’t a wrong glance, flat note, or an off-time beat. The ideas that form its foundation are brave and forward-thinking. That said, most of La Scuola’s greatest flourishes are far too subtle and opaque to someone not well versed in 18th century Viennese Opera Buffa. If you happen to be an avid connoisseur of Mozart, you will be highly impressed by an interesting and flawlessly executed reinterpretation of his greatest work. If La Scuola happens to be your first or second opera, you’ll probably walk out at the end more than just a little confused.

Let’s be honest: no one likes doing the dishes. Unfortunately, the reality of the looming adulthood that lies before each of us forces the matter when it comes time to cook a dinner that is anything beyond pita and hummus. Envisioning a satisfying home-cooked meal invariably comes with visions of a sink piled high with skillets, pots, and pans of all kinds, but it doesn’t have to be that way. As the weather cools, turn to these three hearty recipes, all distinctly different yet sharing one shining quality: they are made with only one pot.
One-Skillet Vegetable Fry
As with many of these recipes, the base of this recipe is the vegetables that you choose. Follow my lead or forge your own path — whatever combination you stumble upon will be satisfying and filling.
Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
1 can of corn
Cooked noodles 
Feta cheese
Avocado 
1 egg per serving (optional)
Directions:
1. Sautée onion, zucchini, and squash in olive oil until cooked, about five minutes.
2. When cooked, add the noodles and the corn to the pan and let everything cook together for roughly five minutes.
3. Distribute the mixture into bowls.
4. Fry the eggs individually in the pan.
5. Assemble: mixture on bottom, egg on top of that, half of a sliced avocado, then feta cheese on top.
One-Pan Mexican Meal
Filling, spicy, and everything you want at any given time of the day, this dish can be served up for breakfast after a late night out, an inspired lunch on an otherwise sad Monday, or a nice dinner to round out your day.
Ingredients: 
1 can of black beans
1 can of corn
1 can of tomatoes
1 tsp of garlic powder and cumin
1 cup of quinoa 
1 cup of chicken broth
Cheddar cheese
1 egg per serving
Directions:
1. Put the first six ingredients in the pot and cover. Let it cook for 20 minutes. 
2. Put the bean mixture in bowls and top with cheddar cheese. Set aside to melt.
3. Fry the eggs individually in the pot that you just used. 
4. Serve the eggs on top of the melted cheese, then top with a little more cheese if you’re feeling adventurous.
Chili
Pick your poison with this one. Whether or not you decide to include the meat, this recipe will fill you up and fuel your journey to an easy clean-up in one go.
Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 pound of turkey or ground beef, if you’re using meat
1 can each of garbanzo beans, black beans, corn, and kidney beans
1 can of tomato sauce
1 can of diced tomatoes
1 tsp each of chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, and cumin, then add to taste
Directions:
1. Sautee the onion and garlic in a few glugs of olive oil until the onion is translucent. 
2. Add the turkey or beef or tofu or nothing, if that’s how you’re swinging. Brown thoroughly. 
3. Add the beans and the tomatoes. Stir everything together and then add all of the spices. 
4. Add the tomato sauce and the water. Stir, then cover and let simmer for 30–45 minutes. 
5. Taste to make sure that it is well spiced, then serve with a dollup of sour cream and a hunk of bread. 
Pro tip: slap some plastic wrap on top of the pot, and you don’t even need a leftover container.

Dear Joshua,
I'm having an existential crisis, and I don't know who to talk to, and this public forum seems to be the best place to air my dirty laundry. So I started seeing this guy, and he was kinda perfect and kinda cute, and his feet didn't smell bad, and just based on that, I thought he was marriage material. Anyway, we broke up last night because he said he just didn't feel anything anymore, so I pinched him really hard, but that just made him angry. Anyway, we're not together any more, and my world is crashing down, and it was right before our second weekaversary, and it's just so unexpected. I had our entire lives planned out for us, right up to the names of our four kids — Danny, Damian, Baptista and Carl — and our collection of antique cuckoo clocks. He just had the most perfect earlobes, man. And like, I even knew his middle name. If that's not intimate, I'm not sure what is. My question is what do I do to get over him? I've never had an actual relationship before, and this kind of shattered my hope of finding one.
Signed, 
Romantic Ovaries Missing Connection with Ornery Male
Dear ROMCOM,
I'm sorry that your relationship didn't work out. It's never a fun feeling.
My advice is that there are more fish in the sea, more people out there, all that jazz. This was not the only love you will ever have, and there will be other guys with whom to share your future and your antique cuckoo clocks. I know that's not helpful for the emotional situation you're in, but you should never let someone's lack of love toward you to affect your hope or your confidence. You seem like someone with big dreams and a big heart, and I'm sure other people will appreciate that. In regard to what you might be feeling, the best thing to do is just feel — just spend a night doing whatever helps you burn these emotions, whether that be spending a night alone, with people, doing nothing, or doing anything, accept your emotions rather than fight them. It's all healthy expression. Then, once you're all felt out, redirect that love to yourself, that emotional intensity into your work, and charge forward with your life. I believe in you.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown,
Advisor Extraordinaire.

The Voice — which is in all rights the successor of American Idol in the hearts and minds of Americans — is currently in the middle of a dramatic ninth season. The show follows contestants from their auditions through various stages of competition: the Battle Rounds, the Knockouts, and the Live Performances. Contestants are split into four teams when they audition, with each team being led by a coach. A variety of musical greats have been coaches, but the current season presents the coaching abilities of Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Blake Shelton.
Each of the performers talk about their enthusiasm and excitement about working with a coach, and what an amazing opportunity it is. During the course of the show, we see clips from the coaching sessions where the coach or guest coach — another musician who is called in for a round — offers criticism. These clips are often followed by produced segments where the coaches talk about an individual’s strengths and weaknesses to camera. Even though The Voice is a phenomenon, it has been dumbed down for viewers in a way that’s detrimental to the show and its value in America.
The Voice excels in many ways. The format, with various rounds, keeps viewers entertained. The variety is more fun to watch, and the Battle and Knockout rounds show really fascinating juxtaposition between two artists pitted against one another. I have not long been a faithful follower of The Voice, but I do have an appreciation for the talent and growth that the singers often exhibit. I never have the gumption to vote for performers once the show reaches the Live Performance round, but I still get irrationally angry when those I like are eliminated. I often skip through the dialogue parts, and when coaches are arguing to convince a particular performer of their superiority, I usually turn down the volume because I don’t find it that exciting. So I totally recognize that I am not the most devoted of supporters, and that my criticisms come from a place of semi-enthusiasm.
That being said, one aspect that really attracts me about The Voice is the idea of mentorship and guidance. The four coaches are given time to work with each of their contestants, and that is an exciting moment to witness. As a musician, I like the idea of a coach helping the singers work through their songs, finding aspects of their voice that are stronger and giving them tips to help their performance. The show is all about giving new musicians opportunities to grow and learn and maybe break into the industry, so watching the coaches share their knowledge should be a special and exciting experience for aspiring singers around the nation.
This is where I think the show gets too dumbed down. Even though America is not filled with people who want to be singers or who know the ins and outs of musical and vocal training, repetitive quotes from coaches about needing to “believe in what someone is singing” or “feeling emotional with the song,” are unnecessary and don’t teach audiences anything about the work musicians and coaches are doing to maximize an individual’s performance. I’m not saying that coaches are lying or that emotional messages don’t matter, but this sort of communication can be improved upon with strides in technical skill or performance practice. While it’s possible that the coaches don’t have any other useful pieces of advice, it is more likely that producers of the show choose not to air the moments in which more nitty-gritty work is being done.
This season has been notable to me because of a slight increase in the instances of actual technical advice and musical aids. Rihanna, a guest host on the Knockout Rounds last week, gave advice that actually related to moments in the song where an individual could improve. Even hearing Rihanna sing with the kind of changes she was looking for demonstrated, with clarity, the actual improvement she was asking for. I don’t think that the show and coaching sessions have to be as serious as a masterclass, but I think the show could be incredibly useful for those around the nation who have not been able to receive vocal training. Having the opportunity to hear coaches sing, or act out with their bodies a certain choreographic step, not only gives audiences a glimpse as to the hard and detailed work it takes to succeed, but also humanizes the stars.
Oversimplifying the role of the coach in The Voice damages and detracts from what is inherently special and different about this reality show. While this season shows marked improvements in the technical advice that contestants receive, there is still space for the show to grow into a staple that both entertains and educates those who view it. It’s nice to pretend that success comes from a fundamental emotional core, but there is a lot of work needed to communicate feelings in music. Reality TV is in general dumbed down to an excessively formulaic and repetitive form of entertainment, which makes the popular show The Voice an excellent choice for inciting change in the genre.

Popular comedian Aziz Ansari will release ten episodes of his new television series, Master of None, to Netflix on Friday, Nov. 6. Ansari gained fame and popularity with his portrayal of Tom Haverford on Amy Poehler’s comedy Parks & Recreation, in which Haverford navigated the politics of small government with loose morals and bizarre antics. Since then, Ansari has entertained his fans with various comedy specials, most notably Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening, and has, most recently, charmed America with his book Modern Romance. But beside his achievements in the world of comedy as it pertains to appearances and specials, Ansari has claimed a place in the lives of twenty-somethings as a sort of love guru.
Ansari speaks a lot to what relationships mean in the current day and how the process of dating has changed since he himself was in college. Ansari, now 32, discusses dating in the modern era with self deprecation, confusion, and with the goal of illustrating the challenges and changes presented to those who are trying to find love.
In Modern Romance, Ansari introduces the term “emerging adulthood” to describe the period in a person’s twenties in which they are exploring romantic options, while still developing as an individual. Ansari juxtaposes this period with the way the twenties were perceived back in the early to mid twentieth century, when marriage happened soon after high school and, more often than not, to an individual in the same neighborhood. Nowadays, people are bombarded with options with no clear life trajectory set up. Now, people often sift through a huge amount of people in their attempt to find their soulmate, instead of marrying a person they like for the opportunity and lifestyle it presents, and growing to love them more later.
While romantic comedies often portray a miracle ending to love, Ansari’s take on relationships deals with figuring out when to stop looking, or how to communicate through the noise of having too many options. This is why Master of None is set to be such an interesting, sentimental, and surely hilarious examination of love. As a person more than a little obsessed with love, and also social psychology, Ansari’s insights totally interest me and also scare me.
In the new trailer released last week, Ansari and a cast of characters, played by actors ranging from Noel Wells to Ansari’s own parents, all participate in the humor surrounding Ansari’s quest to figure out what he wants and then find it. The trailer includes a trip to a drugstore to buy some Plan B, discussions surrounding the difference in Instagram comments between genders, Ansari going to an audition where he is asked to demonstrate his talent with an Indian accent à la Ben Kingsley, and conversations about racism. One of the funniest parts of the trailer is Ansari’s conversation with his father, who talks about the problem he had with the first woman he considered romantically who he found too tall.
At one point, a friend asks Ansari’s character Dev to close his eyes and try to determine if he can see a future with a certain woman. Closing his eyes, Ansari answers “All I can see is black.” This seems to demonstrate that the show will take some light comic material and then reflect more deeply on it.
I often put people into two camps: those who embrace modern technology as wildly improving their lives but refuse to acknowledge the complications that it presents, and those who reject modern technology completely and don’t attempt to make it work for them. Ansari falls in the middle. He embraces the new technology that has made swiping through 50 potential matches in an hour possible, but is also quick to point out the way this is both great and terrible. His mission is to figure out how to make it less painstaking to use technology to find what you are looking for. Hopefully, with this awareness, those who find themselves in the “emerging adulthood” period can feel less lonely and understand the boat that they are in.
So far, Master of None has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from those who have seen the series ahead of its release. Both deadline.com and Entertainment Weekly have sung the show’s praises.
For anyone who has not watched Ansari’s ruminations on modern romance, I recommend watching some of his clips on Youtube. His stand up bits about explicit and uncalled for sexual text messages and his story about 50 Cent’s first grapefruit experience are great places to start. As a warning, Ansari does not deliver answers to the people. He does not have a secret recipe for success in love. But his theories and his observations and his sheer comedic talent make watching anything he does totally worth it.
Hopefully, this Friday, everyone will gain a little bit of wisdom while laughing uproariously at this semi-autobiographical Netflix Original.

Orientation at the Carnegie Mellon Qatar campus is the liveliest time of the year. It’s the time when CMUQ restocks its supply of talented individuals and welcomes them to be part of the Tartan community.
A team of four Head Orientation Counselors (HOCs), five Orientation Leaders (OLs), and 20 Orientation Counselors (OCs) were recruited to welcome the newest members of our campus family. Over a five month period, the HOCs worked hard to recruit the rest of the team, decide on an orientation theme, prepare a schedule, and manage the logistics of this week-long event. 
The most significant part of orientation planning is deciding on the theme. Each year, the orientation’s theme is based on concepts like superheroes or pirates, and our entire campus is decorated accordingly. This year, the inspiration came from Dr. Seuss’ famous poem, and the HOCs chose the phrase, “Oh! The Places You’ll Go!” and turned the campus into Carnegie International Airport. Activities over the five-day period were designed to incorporate these aspects of the theme. The orientation team members were dressed as pilots, aviation officers, and flight crew. 
The idea was to encourage the newcomers to dream big and to make sure they know that their fellow Tartans are there to guide them through the process. Under the CMUQ roof, we are all Tartans, bound for the same four-year journey.
As orientation week approached, the team took part in four days of training to prepare to welcome the new Tartans and engage them in a week of fun-filled activities. The first day of the week centered on the history of Carnegie Mellon, along with team building activities and informational sessions. Excitement picked up on the second day as freshmen in their respective orientation clusters chose a team name, painted their team flags, and played dodge ball with other clusters. 
On day three, also known as Academic Day, the freshmen met with professors in their departments and learned about the various academic resources available to them. On day four, orientation participated in more team building, went to a social with professors, and attended convocation for the Class of 2019. By the last day of orientation, these new Tartans were part of the CMUQ family. Each orientation cluster prepared short skits based on important values at CMUQ and ended the day with a final dinner together. 
Orientation has always played an integral part of the freshman experience. It allows the upperclassmen on the orientation team to give back to the community by creating a smooth transition for the incoming Tartans. College is an important milestone in every individual’s life, and having a wonderful family to spend some of the most important years of your life with makes this a very special experience. CMUQ is our home, and orientation gives us the chance to welcome people to it with open arms.

New Yorkers rarely seem interested in what’s going on. This makes locals fairly easy to pinpoint: they walk around with “I’ve seen it all” attitudes. Snobbish, yes, but also quite well founded. I personally know New Yorkers who would not give a second glance to a naked person walking down the street. New Yorkers are truly a hard-to-surprise breed. So I wasn’t utterly shocked when I witnessed a rather unremarkable case of civil unrest in Times Square last weekend: the Rise Up October protests.
I stopped to take a good look anyways. I don’t wish to belittle the Black Lives Matter movement, and quite to the contrary, I am sympathetic to the cause of fighting police brutality and mass incarceration. But I also don’t want to misrepresent the incident as something more than it actually was. The police contained it after a short-lived brawl and few media outlets ended up giving the protesters coverage.
I might not be a New Yorker, but I am an Istanbulite, a person who is equally if not more used to seeing crazy stuff happen right in front of their eyes. Two years ago, I happened to be in Taksim Square during the Turkish Gezi Park protests, a nationwide condemnation of the ruling party that sprang from plans to build a shopping mall in one of the few urban green-zones in Istanbul. Though the dynamics of the two movements are not identical, both include factors such as police brutality and the oppression of ethic minorities that have led to direct action by frustrated masses.
No matter how unique a social movement appears to be, I believe that the plea for social change all across the globe is centered around the same themes: liberty, human rights, and equality. As a proponent of the Gezi Park movement, I could relate to protesters in New York demanding equal treatment from law enforcement officials. Unfortunately, I could also relate when a peaceful gathering intended to protest police brutality ironically ended with more police brutality.
When I sensed that tensions were growing, my journalist’s instincts took over, and I approached the protesters. I know that transparency means little these days, but I began to record anyways. I saw protesters getting kicked by cops as they laid defenseless on the ground. I heard people shout that they would not commit suicide under police custody, bringing attention to suspicious deaths of detainees such as Sandra Bland. But by far the most tragic thing I witnessed was people taking selfies with such chaos in the background, grinning ear-to-ear.
My home country is as polarized as it gets. The massive support thatexisted for the Gezi Park was greeted with an equally sizable opposition. That pretty much sums up Turkish politics: We either stand together in solidarity or we fiercely dissent. But at least we usually care enough to dissent. When people are so indifferent to the issues of their fellow citizens that they treat their demands for justice as petty Snapchat stories, we’ve reach a whole new level of low.
This is not an American issue; the growth of apoliticism is global. People everywhere are losing their ability to empathize. As technology permeates culture more and more, personal communication suffers. When we fail to communicate, we withdraw into our little bubbles. As our bubbles shrink, so do our comfort zones. Instead of confronting deeply entrenched political issues such as racial segregation and Islamophobia, we pretend that they do not exist.
Ignoring social movements that demand racial equality can be convenient and comforting. But indifference will make neither the movements nor the problems go away. History has shown this repeatedly. We need to engage. We need to pay Black Lives Matter the attention it deserves.

The World Health Organization (WHO) report released on Monday should give pause to everyone on campus with a dining plan. From Resnik to the Underground, red and processed meats are ubiquitous, and the recent WHO report ties these foods to an increased risk for several types of cancer. The report ties the daily consumption of at least 50 grams of processed meat to an 18 percent increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Campus is not the only place where such processed meat is in abundance and even excess. In 2012, the average American consumed 54 grams of processed meat per day, putting her at an elevated risk. This report highlights the need for change in how Americans think about and use meat, as well as how the government subsidizes the meat industry.
First, let’s break the report down: It’s written by the International Agency of Research into Cancer (IARC), the branch of the WHO that specializes in cancer research. The IARC classifies correlates for cancer into five groups: carcinogenic, probable carcinogenic, possible carcinogenic, unclassifiable, and probably not carcinogenic. To be classified as carcinogenic, a substance must be proven to cause cancer in human subjects, while a probable carcinogenic substance only requires strong support in animal test groups.
The report placed processed meat in the carcinogenic group and red meat in the probable carcinogenic group. It also announced the 18 percent increase in risk tied to processed meats and tied 34,000 cancer deaths per year to processed meat consumption. Most people know that hot dogs aren’t a health food, but the category of processed meat includes anything that has been salted, cured, fermented, or otherwise altered. This translates to sausages, bacon, jerky, lunch-meats, and more.
Americans eat almost three times more meat than the global average, and much of that is either red or processed. One of the reasons Americans eat so much more meat is that it’s amazingly cheap and plentiful in this country. Meat prices should be through the roof with the high demand, but farm subsidies help keep the cost down.
The United States Department of Agriculture spends around $20 billion annually on agricultural subsidies. The vast majority of that money goes to corn and soy. These crops are integral to many people’s diets — us vegetarians are practically made of tofu — but most of the yield goes to meat. In 2014, 5.3 billion bushels of corn went to animal feed, compared to the 1.4 billion that went directly to humans. The government is practically picking up the tab for the meat industry.
In contrast, fruit and vegetable farmers get almost no support. Specialty crops, defined by the Department of Agriculture as “fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops,” are actually ineligible for both of the major subsidy programs. Without government support, produce is significantly more expensive to grow and therefore to buy. The farm subsidy system locks Americans into a strange parallel universe from most of the world by making meat is the cheaper alternative.
The WHO report is just another voice in the chorus proclaiming the detrimental affects of high-meat diets. The American Cancer Society has long touted the benefits of limiting processed meat. Even the American government itself has admitted that it is important to eat a diet skewed away from meat, recommending a healthy meal that’s half fruit and veggies and one-fifth meat.
Yet even while paying lip service to the medical community, the government continues to economically promote excessive meat consumption. The WHO report should serve as a reminder that the farm subsidy program needs to be reevaluated if America wants a healthier population.
What does this all mean for us on campus? There’s an idea in American culture that a meal is not complete without a meat component, but the science is showing that that might not be the best idea. So next time you’re ordering pancakes at the Carnegie Mellon Café, maybe opt for the veggie sausage as a side — I promise it doesn’t bite.

For those of you unaware, there has been a recent outbreak of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over false accusations from Palestinian leadership. 
Namely, they have claimed that Muslims may not be the only ones allowed to pray at the Temple Mount in the future. In addition, the Oslo Accords, which set the ground for peace under former president Bill Clinton’s administration, were denounced by Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
Furthermore, on Palestinian television, Abbas welcomed the spilled blood of Palestinians in Jerusalem as the blood of martyrs. An op-ed recently published by The Tartan, “America must not fund oppression of Palestine,” discusses the recent tensions and suggests that the terrorism being perpetrated is understandable given the plight of the Palestinian people. 
The author also argues Israel’s response has been grossly disproportionate. But what can Israel do when four children, all fewer than 10 years old, witness the murder of their parents, or a father is murdered, and his wife and two-year-old child are attacked?
The only answer is to defend themselves as they have done for decades as the State of Israel, and for millennia as the Jewish People. Hamas, the internationally recognized terrorist group that controls the Gaza Strip, as well as Fatah, the political and militant party in charge of the West Bank, called for a “Day of Rage,” inciting Palestinians to attack innocent Jews on the street. 
Palestinians committed arson at Joseph’s Tomb and a bus depot in Ramat Gan, a neighborhood of Tel Aviv where I used to work. A couple weeks ago, two Palestinians armed with a gun and a knife attacked a bus full of innocent Israelis, killing one and injuring several others, and a mother and her children were badly burned in a firebomb attack last week.
Despite this violence, Israel has practiced restraint in its response. There has been no incursion into the West Bank, no disruption of services or aid to the Gaza Strip or West Bank, no airstrikes, and no military action other than increased patrols in Jerusalem and other major cities. Yet there is still more terror, and more innocent blood spilled.
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank indeed live under terrible conditions. But the attacks that are being planned and carried out will only make their conditions worse; innocent Palestinians will be placed in further danger due to the actions of the terrorists that live and plot among them. The only solution is a peaceful one.
When I lived and worked in Tel Aviv in the summer of 2014, Hamas launched hundreds of rockets and thousands of mortar shells toward major population areas and border towns of the Gaza Strip, including Tel Aviv. 
Israel invested in counter-terrorist measures such as the Iron Dome missile defense system and bomb shelters that made me feel safe enough to stay in a country under attack. Israel invests its money, time, and resources into protecting everyone that lives within its borders.
Meanwhile, Hamas in the Gaza Strip and terrorist factions in the West Bank invest their money, time, and resources into attacking Israel while using United Nations schools, hospitals, and innocent civilians as shields. Israel will do everything it can, including aborting air strikes targeting terrorist leaders, to minimize collateral damage and prevent the loss of innocent lives.
If you truly want to support the Palestinians in their plight, then you cannot support the organizations that hurt the people they supposedly protect. Support the search for peace; engage in a peaceful conversation rather than a shouting match. Let us come together and see each other as humans, without hate, without prejudice, with a single goal of living together peacefully.
There is a passage in the Jerusalem Talmud: “Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.” As Jews, we value the life of every person. Even if a person has so much hate in their heart that they seek to kill us, their life still matters. Israel trains its security forces to wound, and not to kill unless absolutely necessary.
Israel has shown great patience and restraint in dealing with constant threats of terrorism. It is a marvel that Israel is still willing to negotiate a peace agreement despite this. All we ask is that the other side is willing to come to the table where life is valued more than hate. I fear this may be in the very distant future, and until then, I shall mourn the needless loss of innocent Palestinians and Israelis thrown away in favor of hate.
I will continue to pray that there may be a peaceful solution, that Israelis and Palestinians can live together without fear, without hate, without violence, and finally live in peace.

In a speech at the University of Chicago Law School, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated that he believes the “Ferguson effect” is responsible for an increase in crime in cities across America. 
According to a study in the [ITAL] New York Times [ITAL], the number of murders as of August has increased in many major cities. Milwaukee, for example, has seen a 76 percent increase, from 59 murders in 2014 to 104 in 2015. Murder rates have increased by 60 percent in St. Louis, 56 percent in Baltimore, and 22 percent in New Orleans.
In Comey’s opinion, one that is shared by several other law enforcement officials, this is at least partially due to the demands of Black Lives Matter protesters. He speculated that an increase in public scrutiny of police behavior after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. has resulted in more hesitant policing.
According to Comey, police officers are increasingly reluctant to take action for fear of becoming the source for the newest hashtag or YouTube video condemning overzealous and downright unconstitutional police actions.
Other government officials, including White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, have countered that there is no evidence of a relationship between the protests and the current rise in crime. Numerous other causes have been suggested, from lowered gun prices to a rise in synthetic drugs to more people being released from prison.
True or not, Comey's claim could just be his attempt to oversimplify a complicated issue and point fingers. But if the “Ferguson effect” is, as [ITAL]The Atlantic[ITAL] proclaimed, nothing more than the “bigfoot of American criminal justice,” it is unsettling to see powerful people jumping to lay the blame for increased violence on social activists without any proof.
Combined with Comey’s use of the phrase “all lives matter,” thought by many to undermine the Black Lives Matter movement, it seems evident that he intends to merely bully those speaking out and return to a state where people turn a blind eye to police injustice. 
Even if there were any evidence to support the Ferguson Effect, that would mean that police officers find themselves unable to properly do their jobs when there is a risk they may be filmed and held accountable for their actions.
If there is truly a trend developing where police are taking a hands-off approach thanks to the increased presence of civilian vigilance and recording devices, that means they feel that they can’t keep people safe without simultaneously disrespecting people’s civil rights. They know their misbehavior would not be supported under scrutiny, and yet they would rather do nothing than adjust their actions to comply with the law.
Black Lives Matter protesters are either viewed as a convenient scapegoat or an excuse to delay changing police behavior. Over a year after the shooting in Ferguson, it has again become clear that the issues brought to light that day have not disappeared. But if efforts to bring about reform are treated as almost criminal themselves, it may not be practical to expect things to change significantly anytime soon.

Every year, public schools across the United States experience a drastic change from their day-to-day activities. Teachers hand out thick packets of multiple choice questions, students fill out an excess of bubble sheets, and parents get bombarded with emails reminding them to make sure that their children get lots of rest and make it to school on time. School administrators lose sleep over national and state performance level standards. 
Normal curricula are suspended, and attention is instead turned to state-mandated reading comprehension questions, basic math equations, and canned essay formats. Entire schools are turned upside down, and it is all thanks to standardized testing.
Standardized testing has been a part of American education since the mid 1800s. However, its use in public schools skyrocketed when the No Child Left Behind Act (2002) introduced the first nationwide annual standardized testing requirement for children from grades 3–8. The Council of Great City Schools estimates that students in public schools take, on average, 112 standardized tests during their school careers, according to a report released last month. . This translates to roughly eight tests per student every year from pre-kindergarden until 12th grade, many of which have been mandated by No Child Left Behind.
This rampant use of standardized testing is meant to increase and hold schools accountable for student performance. However, National Assessment for Education Progress, a set of federally sponsored exams that is administered consistently across all 50 states, released its newest report last week, showing a decrease in the math scores of fourth and eighth-graders, the first decline since 1990. Increasing standardized testing, it appears, is not the key to improving the American education system.
President Obama seems to agree. The Department of Education’s new Testing Action Plan promises to provide guidance and funding to help reduce testing. open letter to America’s teachers and parents, Obama states his three basic principles that any test used in the classroom should meet: “First, our kids should only take tests that are worth taking — tests that are high quality, aimed at good instruction, and make sure everyone is on track. Second, tests shouldn’t occupy too much classroom time, or crowd out teaching and learning. And third, tests should be just one source of information. We should use classroom work, surveys, and other factors to give us an all-around look at how our students and schools are doing.”
Under the Testing Action Plan, any test that doesn’t meet these standards will be eliminated. Furthermore, schools will only be allowed to spend a maximum of 2 percent of classroom time on standardized testing.
This critical view of standardized testing as a whole is a much-needed development in American education. Our schools’ reliance on standardized testing is extremely limiting, forcing teachers to halt the momentum of their classes, stifle their creativity, and teach in a manner that might not be the most effective for their students.
Many times, teachers feel pressure from school administrations to “teach to the test” in an effort to raise school averages and thereby increase federal funding. Putting teachers in a box significantly lessens what students learn. A class taught with the goal of preparing for a standardized test is a class taught with no real-world context. There is little opportunity for students to be creative and take deeper meaning from their lessons when everything can be summarized in a state-issued test. Teaching to a test is not teaching students how solve problems, it is not encouraging students to inquire further into the course material, and it is not teaching students how to internalize methods of learning effectively.
Furthermore, the prevalence of standardized testing creates a serious disparity between students that are good at it and those that are not. Just like any other method of learning and any other method of assessment, standardized testing is not built for every student. 
When it is emphasized so much more than other methods of learning and assessment, it alienates the multitude of intelligent, motivated students who may not be as successful in the standardized testing model as in other assessment models. On the other hand, students who are adept at the standardized testing model should not be taught to solely rely on those skills, as very little real-world problem solving involves a by-the-book multiple-choice test.
President Obama is on the right path in his efforts to reduce standardized testing. That is not to say that the Testing Action Plan will solve all of our problems regarding standardized testing. Even 2 percent equates to approximately 23.4 hours of testing every year, and the three guidelines to what will make a standardized test acceptable are still very vague. But it is a step in the right direction and a step toward an education system that is more effective and accurate in both teaching and assessing all types of students.

Last week, YouTube launched its ad-free subscription service: YouTube Red. As with any change that rolls around, YouTube Red has had its critics. 
The majority of the criticism revolves around how, in the face of ad blocking, paying $10 a month for YouTube is a waste of money. Furthermore, there have been concerns over the steps YouTube seems to be taking to make its creators pay, as evidenced by an 16,000 signature petition on Change.org, “Stop YouTube Red”.
To the first point, YouTube Red may be of interest to people who want to support content creators or the platform itself. As popular YouTuber and multimillionaire Pewdiepie points out on his blog, ad blockers significantly cut into the ad revenues of creators; an estimated 40 percent of ad revenue may be lost due to ad blocking, which can significantly hurt smaller channels.
There have been many creators on YouTube who have asked their viewers to turn off ad-blockers when viewing their content. Personally, I would rather tip a creator I supported through Patreon than turn on ads. In my experience, ads significantly increase the time a webpage takes to load, diminish the viewing experience, and sometimes even contain malicious code. 
An official ad-free solution that helps support content creators would be useful, but it is clear that YouTube Red cannot survive on the selling point of an ad-free viewing experience alone.
For one thing, a large portion of YouTube’s user base is young and may not be as willing or able to pay a subscription fee. Compared to Netflix, for example, most of the content on YouTube seems to be geared toward an under-30 crowd — think Tyler Oakley versus House of Cards. Furthermore, the majority of videos on YouTube are amateur content that most people would rather not see if they had to pay money for it. Red may be of the most use for people who use YouTube to listen to music, but this service is hardly any different from the existing Google Play Music subscription, which is now bundled with YouTube Red.
To entice anyone into using YouTube Red, YouTube plans to rely on “premium” content: high-budget videos by some of its biggest stars available only to Red subscribers. It appears that YouTube is trying to change the direction of how it does business.
Instead of a platform where people are able to post and discuss videos, YouTube may be trying to become a content distributor, able to hold leverage over the decisions of its creators and shift the balance of who rightfully owns content.
Many are concerned about how YouTube handles its power over its partners and whether they will maintain the culture of open content. In launching YouTube Red, YouTube partners were given the option to either sign up for YouTube Red or let their videos be made private, which would make their videos inaccessible to the general public. While most partners had no qualms about the switch, YouTube got its way by essentially threatening them with censorship.
Although it remains to be seen what direction the platform will head in, for now YouTube Red seems to be overall a net positive for creators and users. Hopefully, YouTube will continue to support the efforts of creators and improve the experience of users without sacrificing its traditional culture of open content.

From pre-kindergarten onwards, many public school students see police officers almost every day. Whether it’s in Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), in an assembly, or just in the halls, police officers are a significant presence in school. 
School police officers serve many purposes: They teach students about drug resistance, help prevent violence in schools, and often serve as friendly faces. Sometimes, however, school police officers are the ones causing violence in public schools — last week, a video surfaced online of a school police officer in Columbia, South Carolina flipping over a student’s desk and throwing her to the ground. 
Although some claim the officer’s actions were justified — the student had refused to leave the classroom before the officer struck her — nothing short of a gun in the classroom justifies such violence against a high school student. 
The officer, a white man, has garnered well-deserved condemnation from proponents of the Black Lives Matter movement for his violence against the black student, and has since been fired from his position at the school. 
As police officers become commonplace in schools, they bring into the classroom tactics used to fight crime in the streets. School police officers are becoming figures of intimidation, rather than the role models they’re intended to be. 
With police officers stationed in schools, wayward students follow a pipeline straight from high school to prison, contributing to an overfilled, ineffective, and ultimately broken prison system. Although school police officers are supposed to be trained in defensive discipline, the video shows that such training is not always effective. 
The cons of having police officers in our schools outweigh the pros. We must rethink a system that keeps high school students in line with brutality, and replace it with one based on more constructive disciplinary tactics.

The Tartan Board recently published a commentary on a study from the University of Washington which revealed that in the 50 most populated American cities, less than one third of high school students take either the SAT or ACT. This indicates the disturbing influence that class and race have on access to education, and therefore a well-paying job, in America.  
This week, however, New York City took an encouraging step toward bridging this gap. Beginning in spring 2017, city public schools will offer the SAT for free to high school juniors during the school day. Normally the test occurs on weekends in variable locations and costs $54.50.Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña announced the change on Monday to kick off College Application Week, a national program that encourages students to apply to college by offering them the chance to speak with admissions officers and receive free advice on application essays. Once the program is implemented, it will not be mandatory to take the exams, but giving students the opportunity to do so in a comfortable atmosphere at no cost will break down a barrier that stands in many students’ ways to higher education.
By making the test the default, participation will increase for students who would not otherwise choose to spend the money and the Saturday morning on it. But then, by already fulfilling a requirement for many college applications, higher education may seem more realistic — especially for students who don’t expect to earn a degree. Some institutions offer scholarships based on performance, which could ease the financial burden even further.
This program is only expected to cost New York City an annual $1.8 million per year, which is barely a penny in the grand scheme of the city’s budget of $75 billion. We hope that other cities in America will follow New York’s lead and implement similar programs in their public schools. If they succeed, an encouraging next step would be to offer free or reduced-price SAT preparation classes to help students maximize their potential.

Earlier this week, New York passed “ban the box” legislation, which removes a checkbox on job applications requiring candidates to disclose their criminal background. This legislation plays a key role in equitable employment opportunities. By merely having applicants check a box on a form, employers are misunderstanding the nature of crime in a way that unfairly disadvantages people.
The first problem with simple check boxes is that many crimes are crimes of necessity. There is much context involved in crimes, many of which are related to socioeconomic status. If a person’s family is destitute and selling drugs is the only way for them to put food on the table, he or she should not be permanently out of a job. 
Even though the person did break the law, they did so largely due to poverty. Putting them in a position that permanently excludes them from the economy is the exact opposite of a meaningful solution. It creates the cyclical poverty that condemns families to lives of hardship for generations.
This problem is exacerbated by the rising income inequality in the American economy. After the 2008 financial crisis, the recovery has taken the form of an upward redistribution of wealth for a variety of reasons. 
As wealth is concentrated within a small number of people, the money that people do have simply has less purchasing power because the wealthiest contingent of society has a much higher price at which they will buy goods. 
Further, wages have stagnated for about 15 years. With higher prices and less money for the working poor, the economy is not producing the kinds of jobs that allow people to sufficiently provide for themselves. This means more people are in positions where crimes are not only realistic but, well, necessary.
The second problem with check boxes is that they rest on two assumptions, both of which are intuitively false. The first assumption is that arrests are representative of who is committing crimes. The second assumption is that people who are convicted are always guilty and people who are not convicted of crimes are always innocent. 
The binary nature of a checkbox requires these assumptions to be generally true. The racial and ethnic biases of law enforcement, trials, and sentencing are all well documented. This means that Black and Hispanic applicants will be more likely to actually have to check the box than a white person who has committed the same crimes. 
This economic discrimination is unconstitutional but, more importantly, simply wrong. A job grants someone access to resources, and it allows someone to participate in the economy. That right should always be independent of immutable characteristics like race or bad luck like the struggling post-recession economy.
The Tartan applauds New York City for recognizing the issues with check boxes to indicate a criminal record on job applications and encourages other states to pursue similar measures in the future.
