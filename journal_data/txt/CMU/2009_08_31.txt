When the men's soccer team kicks off at Washington and Jefferson University and the women's volleyball team opens at home against Marietta College this Tuesday at 7 p.m., it will mark the beginning of the new fall season for Tartans Athletics. This season, as always, brings much excitement and anticipation, while we welcome in new faces and bid one final adieu to the old. Those new faces not only include first-years, but new women's assistant soccer coach Jen Myhre and a boatload of new fans ready to cheer on their team, whether it be soccer, cross country, volleyball, or football.
Here's what players and coaches have to say about the upcoming year:
[ITAL]Men's Cross Country:[ITAL]
Chris Rizzo, senior: "We lost a lot of strong runners, but the depth from previous years will cover it. We're looking at the same type of team that has always been underrated and always beats expectations."
[ITAL]Women's Cross Country:[ITAL]
Laura McKee, junior, captain: "Despite having a lot of turnover, our team still has a solid group of returning upperclassmen. An excellent [first-year] class will make us stronger as a team over the next four years. This should be an exciting year for the Women's XC team as we look to improve on our UAA and regional finishes."
[ITAL]Volleyball:[ITAL]
Megan Killeen, senior: "Even right out of preseason, the level of play is just so much higher than it has been in previous seasons — the team dynamic, especially with so many senior players, has really allowed for this athletic development. Our three [first-year] players have also added some extra leeway and have created more depth in our team. With such a seasoned team, we expect to have an amazing season, hopefully one that will be record-breaking once again at the NCAA tournament. I know we are all really excited to get back on the competitive court and finally play as a team again."
[ITAL]Men's Soccer:[ITAL]
Arron Lujan, head coach: "The preseason went well. We have a lot of returning players that are looking to build upon our success that we had last year. We also have new players that will add a lot to our team."
[ITAL]Women's Soccer:[ITAL]
Jen Myhre, assistant coach: "We are looking forward to this upcoming season, as we have a strong first-year class who has the ability to make an immediate impact on our team. We held our own in a scrimmage against Kenyon and throughout the game began working the ball well out of the back and attacking in the box. We definitely have some perfecting to do, but are off to a great start for a competitive and successful season."
[ITAL]Football:[ITAL]
Rich Lackner, head coach: "There are lots of new faces on the football team this season and I like the group of [first-years] that we recruited. The team came to preseason camp in good shape and we had a very productive camp. The team worked very hard and is coming together nicely. Our expectations are always high! We have had great tradition over the years and the team and coaches work hard to continue that tradition."

Carnegie Mellon men's soccer team member and business administration senior Jon Hall has been selected to be featured on the September episode of [ITAL]NCAA on Campus[ITAL]. The show is set to air on CBS College Sports on Wednesday, Sept. 2 at 9 p.m.
[ITAL]NCAA on Campus[ITAL] is a monthly 30-minute look at stories of student athletes from across the nation featuring interviews and insights from friends. The show highlights students who have demonstrated excellence not only in sports but also in academics and community involvement. On the field, Hall has started all 55 games in his three years on the Tartan soccer team as a defensive back. He is also a three-time member of the All-University Athletic Association and was named the 2008 [ITAL]ESPN The Magazine[ITAL] Men's Soccer Academic All-American of the Year. Even more impressively, off the field, Hall boasts a 4.0 GPA at the Tepper School of Business as a business and finance major and is involved in the Business Opportunities Conference as a co-chair, serves in Students in Free Enterprise as a senior adviser to the executive board, and last year helped establish the Tartan Olympics as a co-chair of the Student-Athlete Advisory Council.
Even with such an impressive list of credentials, Hall was surprised to find himself selected.  
"I was extremely shocked when I found out I was selected to be interviewed for a national program," said Hall. "I'm definitely humbled by the selection. The whole process of filming this episode with friends and professors made me realize how fortunate I am to have such support to which I completely credit my success."
Hall will be joining a prestigious list of student athletes, including San Diego State's Stephen Strasburg, the number one pick in the 2009 MLB draft; University of Georgia's Courtney Kupets, arguably the greatest gymnast in NCAA history; and Loyola University's Phil Scholz, who didn't let his blindness stop him from becoming a member of the Loyola Greyhounds swim team or a resident assistant.
The show will be reaired each Wednesday of September before being added to archives on the NCAA's website, [SLANT12]www.ncaa.org[SLANT12].

Last semester, I wrote an article warning Pirates fans not to get their hopes up because this year — like the past 16 — would not be "the year" for Pittsburgh's ball club. The Pirates' stinginess in dealing with players' contracts, whether they be prospects or veterans, would surely be their downfall not only this year, but for years to come.
Well, I was halfway there. I still gave them too much credit.
I'm a Mets fan, which means I have to deal with cheering for a team so depleted by injuries that, on Sunday, the starting lineup included only three players that were on the Opening Day roster. Pirates fans face a similar dilemma: the Pirates also only had three players in Sunday's starting lineup that were in the Opening Day lineup, but for an entirely different reason. Their lineup has been depleted by trades.
One of the topics I'd touched upon in my previous article was the long-term contracts awarded to Nate McLouth and Ryan Doumit, young offensive stars for the Pirates last year: "The three-year deals for Doumit and McLouth provide hope that a young, talented core to build a winning franchise around is finally being established, but just wait until their three years are up. If they’ve produced up to expectations, their monetary yearnings will no doubt be out of the Pirates’ and Nutting’s miniscule range." Well, it turns out I was about two and a half years off — while Doumit still dons the black and yellow, McLouth was traded to the Atlanta Braves on June 3 for three prospects, only one of them noteworthy. Calling the move shocking would be an understatement. 
"There ain't a guy in here who ain't [ticked] off about it," said then-first baseman Adam LaRoche in an interview with the [ITAL]Pittsburgh Post-Gazette[ITAL]. "If they feel like it's the best move for three or four years from now, great. Unfortunately, that does me no good."
"Wow," added then-second baseman Freddy Sanchez in the report.
But the Pirates weren't done there. On June 30, Nyjer Morgan — another player I'd mentioned as being an integral part of the Pirates' core — was traded alongside pitcher Sean Burnett to the Washington Nationals for troubled outfielder Lastings Milledge, who is far past his days of being a top prospect, and Joel Hanrahan, a reliever who had struggled so much that he lost his closer role with Washington earlier this year.
Jack Wilson, the longest-tenured Pirate at the time, was slightly put off in an interview with MLB.com about the deal: "We understand that it's a business and that they have to do what they have to do to make the team better. Hopefully it does. I just know there are a lot of people in this clubhouse who aren't going to be here, so we don't care too much about it.... I've been here for nine years and seen these trades two or three times every year and still haven't had a winning season."
Well, Wilson just might be able to have that winning season this year. That's because he was traded a month later to the Seattle Mariners. Sanchez was also traded that day to the San Francisco Giants, while LaRoche was traded a week prior to the Boston Red Sox. Also gone are pitchers Tom Gorzelanny and John Grabow, who were traded to the Chicago Cubs.
So, while I was technically right that Doumit, outfielder Andrew McCutchen and first baseman Steve Pearce would be parts of the talented core the Pirates would hopefully build a franchise around, things do not look encouraging for the defending record holders for consecutive losing seasons. There are some silver linings — McCutchen and fellow rookie outfielder Garrett Jones are both having fantastic years right now — but don't worry, folks. They won't be here much longer. The revolving door of players is moving so fast, it'll make your head spin.
So don't get too comfortable.

Much has been said concerning former New York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress since that infamous Friday night in November of last year, when Burress shot himself in the right leg at a New York nightclub. This event made him an easy target for initial barbs toward his intelligence and jokes about shooting himself in the foot, both figuratively and literally, as charges for the criminal possession of a handgun fell upon Burress. But public sentiment toward the situation has changed since then, coming to a head when Burress’ sentence of two years in prison was finalized in a plea bargain last week, with people beginning to question whether Burress was being made an example by the justice system.
The two-year sentence causes Burress to leave much behind, including a recently signed $35 million contract, a Super Bowl contending team, and a new daughter due at the end of November. In a humanizing interview last week with ESPN’s Jeremy Schap, Burress explained that he only had the handgun with him because teammate Steve Smith had been robbed at gunpoint a few days earlier. That night Burress picked up a teammate who lives near Smith, Ahmad Bradshaw, and thus he brought the gun with him as protection. Burress subsequently kept the gun in the waistband of his pants upon arriving at the nightclub. According to Burress, security allowed him to enter the club with the weapon. Soon afterward, Burress revealed during his interview, the gun dislodged itself and began to slide down Burress’s leg. As he attempted to stop the falling gun, he accidentally pressed the trigger, sending a bullet through his right thigh. Burress was driven to a hospital by teammate Antonio Pierce and was treated for the flesh wound. The hospital did not contact police, as would normally have been protocol in that situation, and Burress also said during the interview that the hospital admitted him under an alias.
The NYPD reportedly did not learn of the Burress situation until it was reported on the news. Only then was he charged with criminal possession of his weapon, as he did not own a license to possess a gun in either New York or his current home state of New Jersey. Even worse, the license he had for a gun in the state of Florida was expired, so Burress didn’t have any business carrying a handgun in any state.
Now, it can be argued that if Burress were the average Joe, he would have slipped through the cracks and avoided charges, since Average Joe would not have gotten the media coverage that Burress received, tipping the NYPD off to his criminal gun possession. Average Joe would also not have had to deal with New York mayor Michael Bloomberg publicly announcing that he should be penalized to the fullest extent of the law. But would Average Joe have been able to get into the club with a gun scot-free? Would Average Joe have received seemingly preferential treatment at the hospital? For every celebrity who is “made an example of” by law enforcement officials, many more are given leniency that the rest of the population does not receive. The U.S. justice system is inherently a subjective process, one that celebrities and average Joes alike must face once exposing themselves to it. Complaining about the incredulity of Burress going to jail for simply shooting himself is ignoring the real situation at hand — that he was illegally possessing a handgun, one that he did not make sure to secure. It is Burress’s responsibility, like anybody else’s, to know the laws of the state he resides in. New York gun laws are as tough as they get, and the sentence he received is completely in line with it.
The bullet that went through Burress’ leg reportedly came very close to hitting a security guard nearby. That Burress was walking around a packed New York City club carrying an unholstered gun, without a safety enabled, is downright scary. Any innocent bystander could have been killed that night by Burress’ reckless behavior. If it’s true that a lower profile individual would have gotten away with a lesser penalty, then that is very unfortunate. Perhaps in most other situations, more leniency may have been exercised, but at least this time they got it right.ht.

It’s the first week of school and already Tartan athletes from football, soccer, volleyball, and cross country have hit the ground running in preparation for the upcoming fall season. Volleyball is aiming for another final finish in the UAAs, while 21st-ranked men’s soccer and football are looking to make the NCAA Division III Championship for the second year in a row. Also on the radar is sixth-ranked women’s tennis, who last year made the NCAAs but fell in the quarterfinals to rival University of Chicago. Although official practice has not yet begun, the men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams, as well as both tennis teams, have already begun practice for play that begins in late September to early October. Such dedication from the school’s athletes shines true of the Tartan work ethic, and will hopefully yield successful results in the weeks to come.
This week marks the start of dual matches for most of the fall sports. Volleyball will kick off their season when they play Marietta College at Wiegand Gymnasium on Tuesday at 7 p.m. Shortly thereafter, the Tartans will travel to the Gettysburg Tournament hosted by St. John Fisher College in Gettysburg, beginning Friday, Sept. 4.
Tuesday night is also when both men and women’s soccer begin their fall season. The men’s team will open at Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., while the women’s team will play at home against number 20 Denison in Gesling Stadium, with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m.
Football will begin their schedule this week, with the whistle set to blow on Friday at 1 p.m. against Ohio Wesleyan in Gesling Stadium. Cross country’s first meet will commence earlier in the day with a 9 a.m. start at the Duquesne Duals, held at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.
For Tartan sports enthusiasts who wish to follow play live, live stats are available at [SLANT12]www.cmu.edu/athletics/fanzone/video/webcast.html[SLANT12].

Simulating the physical world as we understand it, accurately, is the key to everything from games and movies to experiments.
“If you look at a Pixar movie, you’ll see that all the characters have simulated clothes and flowing hair,” said Adrien Treuille, asssistant professor in the computer science department, “but video games are totally different and have a much simpler world.”
The complexity of the physical simulations needed to make convincing hair, fur, and liquids require large “farms” of specialized computers and large amounts of time to render. Treuille’s research focus has been in making convincing physical simulations possible, in real time, on laptops and other commodity devices.
For example, the traditional approach to cloth simulation views the cloth as a number of particles connected by springs. Physically accurate simulation with this method, however, requires seconds or minutes to calculate per frame.
“Basically, even with very fast algorithms, it’s hard to update a large number of variables in real time. We need ways to represent physical systems using far fewer variables,” Treuille said.
The work in physical simulation by Treuille and his students attempts to boil down the problem to a smaller, more manageable number of variables that describe the essence of the phenomenon.
“Using huge numbers of variables to simulate physical systems is a little naive, because this enables an enormous number of configurations that we’ll never see that don’t actually happen in a typical day,” Treuille said.
In the case of cloth simulation, “a few number of variables, each of which is a representation of the global state, could represent the folds that you would typically expect to see,” Treuille explained. Treuille’s research group has applied this so-called “reduced basis” method to the problem of simulating fluid flow.
“In computer graphics, fluid is a relatively new field in the scheme of things,” said Matthew Stanton, a Ph.D. student under Treuille. “The problem is that the techniques are slow — even in a relatively small three-dimensional domain, it takes minutes per frame to simulate,” Stanton said.
The goal is to make fluid flow simulation responsive in real time so that it can be used in interactive contexts, such as games. In a paper published in SIGGRAPH 2009, a high-profile conference for computer graphics research, the group presented a method for linking several reduced basis simulations spatially. This allowed the group, for example, to simulate airflow through a cityscape in real time. The airflow around individual buildings was characterized independently, and the resulting piecewise simulations were stitched together on a city grid.
Treuille’s interest in simulating physical phenomena has also helped spark the FoldIt (http://fold.it) project, a game and competitive community for the problem of protein structure prediction.
As a protein is being created in a cell, it begins as a long string of building blocks called amino acids — the sequence of amino acids of a protein is called its primary structure. In this state, the protein is not useful, and so it either folds on itself naturally or is folded by another protein into its functional configuration. The problem of protein structure prediction is deciding how a protein will fold, knowing only its primary structure.
Computer algorithms for deciding protein folding are a hot topic in computational biology, because understanding how proteins fold can help to understand how to design proteins for specific problems.
In the FoldIt game, the player is given a protein in a partially unfolded state. The goal is then to get higher scores by folding the protein into a more and more stable state. “These are experiments to see how well human intuition helps players to find new shapes where computers fail,” Treuille said. Treuille hinted that they have had positive results in comparing human-folded proteins to computer-folded proteins, which will be revealed in an upcoming Nature article.
With the successes of FoldIt in hand, Treuille’s group has been designing and implementing a game called EvolveIt. In this game, the player designs an organism from the same building blocks used by RNA molecules. “RNA is believed to be the first, and simplest, form of life,” Treuille said. In an initial study, the players will be tasked with creating stable RNA molecules of various shapes. “We are trying to find the possible range of shapes for RNA structures,” said Jeehyung Lee, a student in Treuille’s group who is spearheading the project. Lee explained the kinds of RNA structures they want to make, saying, “Can this RNA be folded into a knot? And does it hold its shape when we shake it?” The best creatures, or RNA molecules, will be synthesized by the group’s partner lab.
In a further phase, the game will be expanded by allowing players to complete with one another. By designing and dueling their creatures, players will participate in a form of evolution, where the strongest creatures thrive and the weakest creatures are not reproduced. “Hopefully we can bring to life ancient pathways,” Treuille said.

Before aliens, mutants, and robotic killing machines took over the world of fictional monsters, characters like Frankenstein and werewolves ruled fiction. Many people have heard of werewolves — one of the most famous being Harry Potter’s Professor Lupin — people who turn into wolf-like creatures when there is a full moon. 
Although the werewolf is a myth, there is a disease called hypertrichosis, popularly called the werewolf syndrome, that is a rare inherited illness.
Hypertrichosis actually describes excessive hair growth in abnormal places on the body. An article in the Dermatology Online Journal describes that in normal humans, hair differentiates into lanugo, vellus, and terminal hair. Lanugo hair grows and sheds during fetal development and vellus hair immediately replaces it. Vellus hair is short, soft, and light and is seen over the face and arms of children. Terminal hair is longer and coarser and is found on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes. This type of hair comprises the hair pattern formed in puberty and adulthood.
The diagnosis of hypertrichosis is made based on hair pattern, analysis of hair type by histology, and genetics. Additionally, hypertrichosis is not caused by a disturbance in the amount of androgens the body secretes; hence a presence of excessive hair growth but normal androgen secretion may be an indication of hypertrichosis. 
In hypertrichosis, the patient’s entire body is typically covered with light-colored hair that is most prominent on the shoulders, face, and ears. Hair length can reach up to a few centimeters. 
Other physical anomalies can include a dismorphic triangular coarse face, or a long nose with a round tip. From genetic analysis of this disease, it seems that mutations of chromosome 8 are associated with hypertrichosis. However the true cause and genetic background of this disease are yet to be discovered.
As stated on Hypertrichosis.com, a person with congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa will show, shortly after birth, prenatal lanugo hairs (which are usually shed before birth) over the entire body except the palms, soles, and the mucous membranes. This is one type of the disease and is especially rare. Yet, as stated on the Dermatology Online Journal, this was the disease that Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy had. The first recorded case of hypertrichosis, however, is believed to be that of Petrus Gonzales in 1556. He was taken to France initially as a gift for the nobles, and was educated once they realized he was quite intelligent. He subsequently had offspring with similar werewolf-syndrome features and this kindred was later known as the family of Ambras because their family portraits were discovered in Ambras castle, located in modern-day Austria.
Other types of the disease include hypertrichosis with gingival fibromatosis, where hair appears over the face, trunk, and eyebrows during childhood followed by gingival hyperplasia (overgrowth of the gum tissues). Naveoid hypertrichosis is an unusual case of hypertrichosis in that there is only one area where hair growth occurs. 
This disease can occur at birth or even later in life and is characterized by hairy tufted ears, tails, or excessive beard growth in males and females with the illness.
Although there is the initial shock of having a child who is covered in hair, these children are able to live a long life and are able to procreate. 
Some patients do develop other anomalies like dental problems, yet because this disease is so rare, with only 50 reported cases in the world since the Middle Ages, there could be other complications that have not yet been discovered or properly diagnosed.

When watching performers walk over burning coals, put sticks of fire down their throats, or even pelt out a jet of fire from their mouths, it is hard not to squirm in sympathetic pain. But, unlike you, the performers usually finish their act with a smile on their face and show no semblance of the pain that they ought to have felt. How do these people manage to do their acts? Although all these acts are extremely dangerous, there are special techniques that the artists employ to minimize the danger. Playing around with simple scientific concepts helps these artists do what is almost unthinkable: play with fire. 
The technique employed by the firewalkers is vested in the theories of conduction of heat and insulation. Fire-walkers actually never walked on flames, but rather walk on burning coals. An article in National Geographic News explains that heat is transferred to the feet of the walker by the process of heat conduction. When the coals have been burning for quite some time, they are reduced to mostly pure, lightweight carbon. Such carbon is an extremely poor conductor of heat and would take a long time to transfer heat. 
The fire-walker never stands on the coals for a long period of time; the walker usually walks quickly over the coals and each foot remains touching the coals for hardly a second. Such a short period of time is not sufficient for a large amount of heat to transfer and the walker’s feet do not get burned. 
The second aspect that makes this technique possible is the fact that the coals are covered with a layer of ash. Ash is basically an insulator and further hampers the transfer of heat to the feet of the artist. 
The result is that the artists are able to walk across the coals quickly, without burning their feet.
According to this theory, artists should not be able to walk across hot metal as metal is a good conductor of heat and would cause the artists’ feet to burn. The National Geographic News article puts forth another theory to explain this art. As stated in the article, members of the Firewalking Institute of Research and Education in Twain Harte, Calif. were able to walk across a hot metal grill without burning themselves. The previously described theory of coal and ash has no way to explain this feat. Tolly Burkan, founder of the institute, believes that the ability has to do with the artist’s frame of mind. In the article, Burkan compared the ability to the way an egg boils in a paper cup kept on hot coals. 
Although the hot coals should cause the paper to burn, it doesn’t. This is because the boiling water is at 100°C and the paper stays at this temperature, not burning. Similarly, if the artist’s feet have a good amount of blood supply, the blood flow prevents the flesh from burning. 
Burkan believes that with a relaxed mindset, the artists can achieve this large amount of blood flow and not get burned.
Fire eating and fire breathing are much harder than walking on “fire.” 
These feats usually do harm the artist and require the artist to develop some amount of pain tolerance. However, the basic techniques are based on physics and chemistry. 
Artists who “breathe” fire basically shoot a jet of fuel from their mouths onto a source of flame in their hands. The fuel ignites on contact with the flame and the spectators get to see ball or jet of fire. However, fire breathing acts have gone terribly wrong when done by amateur artists, or even well-trained artists who have had poor judgment. This is because the exact force with which the artist sprays the fuel and the angle at which the spray is directed have to be precisely calculated. If the angle is too high, the fuel can fall back onto the performer’s face. If the angle is too low, the ignited fuel can fall to the ground, causing a fire at the performer’s feet. Another factor that artists have to keep in mind is the type of fuel they use. Many fuels are carcinogenic, so the artists have to try and find a safe fuel that causes them the least amount of harm.
Along with this, the artists have to keep in mind that the fuel should not create a fire so large that it is hard to control. Houseofpoi.com explains that knowing the flash point of the fuel being used is extremely important. Flash points are assigned to all flammable liquids and indicate the lowest temperature at which that liquid can ignite in air. 
The lower the flash point, the more easily the liquid can burst into flames. Fire breathers, consequently, have to choose liquids that have a high flash point. Using low flash point liquids like gasoline or alcohol could cause dangerous explosions.
In spite of these precautions, a fire breather’s health is severely compromised and may get mouth and gum cancer, stomach ulcers, burns on the mouth and gums, and headaches. Even fire-walkers may get severely burned if they do not perform their acts carefully. There is a large amount of risk involved in all of these techniques, and if not done properly, they may lead to death.

Nostrils compete to process scents
Researchers conducted a study that resulted in new information on how the brain processes scents. In the study, volunteers simultaneously sampled smells from two bottles with different odors, one through each nostril. Researchers found that the brain processed the smells in an alternating fashion, with participants switching between perceiving each of the scents. Rather than smelling a mixture of the two smells, the smells alternate in a binary rivalry. Understanding this perception, called an “olfactory illusion,” might help cure olfactory disorders, particularly those affecting the elderly.

Wikipedia adds  editorial review
Within weeks, Wikipedia will impose editorial review on articles about living people before any changes become public. Edits to pages about living people will become “flagged revisions,” which will be invisible to visitors until an experienced volunteer approves of any changes. Those at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that governs Wikipedia, hope that this will make Wikipedia more dependable given its large size and influence.
The system is particularly important for pages about living people because inaccurate information can be very harmful. Some pages are already “protected” or “semi-protected,” including articles on Britney Spears and President Obama, limiting editing capabilities to only certain Wikipedia contributors.

Honey bee colonies may be declining due to damage in their internal production of proteins. Bees make proteins using ribosomes, and a study of sick bees found fragments of ribosomal RNA in the bees’ gut. These bees suffered infections that attack the ribosome, preventing bees from responding to life-threatening problems, such as pesticides and inadequate nutrition.
Additionally, a virus that damages the ribosomes is carried by Varroa mites, which were accidentally introduced in the U.S. in 1986. This virus might contribute to ribosome breakdown among bees.

More mosquitoes may reduce disease
Researchers found that a less dense mosquito population results in bigger mosquitoes that pose more of a risk of spreading disease. An experiment where density of Aedes vigilax mosquitoes was reduced by a factor of 10 resulted in female adults increasing in size by 8 percent, living 48 percent longer, and laying 67 percent more eggs.
This finding is likely a result of less competition for food, resulting in the ability to become bigger. The mosquitoes’ increased lifespan is a cause for concern because the longer a mosquito lives, the further it can fly and the more easily it can spread disease. This new information on mosquitoes suggests that mosquito control programs should focus on areas with low density of mosquitoes in addition to those areas with high mosquito density.

WHO reports more severe swine flu
The World Health Organization declared that a new severe form of swine flu is infecting healthy, young people and is attacking the lungs directly. Several countries are reporting that nearly 15 percent of the patients affected by swine flu need intensive care.
This new form of the H1N1 virus is far more severe than the seasonal influenza virus and can cause respiratory failure. Unlike previous cases, young and healthy people are getting infected by this virus and require extra, specialized care that can prove to be very expensive. WHO is warning countries in the northern hemisphere to be prepared for a second round of the pandemic and it also believes that the number of swine flu cases in tropical countries will soon increase.

Imaging exposes many to radiation
According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, at least four million Americans below 65 years of age are exposed to high levels of radiation because of medical imaging tests each year. Around 400,000 of these patients receive doses of radiation that are higher than the permitted radiation levels for nuclear power plant workers or others working with radioactive materials.
Such imaging tests are generally prescribed by doctors to check for the accumulation of plaque in the blood and to check how well the heart pumps blood. The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that the number of patients undergoing CT scans has increased four times over the period of 10 years from 1995 to 2005. In light of these new findings, doctors believe that soon there will be many more cases of cancer in the country.

West Nile virus migrates to Europe
Scientists have discovered the harmful West Nile virus for the first time in mosquitoes in Switzerland. Aedes japonicus has colonized an area of 540 square miles in central Switzerland. The mosquito was previously found in Japan, Korea, China, North America, France, and Belgium. However, this is the first time that the mosquito has been found in Switzerland.
The mosquito is capable of transmitting Japanese encephalitis and the West Nile virus, both of which can cause serious harm to humans and are potentially fatal. Last year, the West Nile virus killed 44 people in the United States alone.

H1N1 deaths highest in Brazil
A total of 557 people have died because of swine flu in Brazil. This is the highest number of deaths recorded anywhere in the world. Nearly 1800 people have died across the world because of the disease and 522 have died in the United States.
As of now, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and the United States have the most cases of swine flu. Argentina has the highest swine flu mortality rate — which is calculated by considering the total population of the country and the number of deaths — while Brazil has the seventh highest and the United States the 13th highest.

It was an absolutely picturesque afternoon as couples and families strolled up and down Walnut Street admiring all the work at the art festival this past weekend. 
Booths lined the center of the street, and food vendors selling sausages and freshly squeezed lemonade punctuated each block. Musicians also performed, playing pianos and steel pans, singing and selling CDs of their songs. 
The booths were situated in the center of the street so that visitors could walk all the way up Walnut Street to South Neville Street and circle round and walk down to Centre Avenue. 
Some booths were complete with a generator and sophisticated track lighting to highlight their pottery, paintings, or jewelry. There were mixed media pieces, wall hangings, lamps, hand-dyed scarves, purses, wallets, handmade clothing, leather goods, black-and-white photographs, landscapes, ironworks, giclee reproductions, acid etched metal... the list goes on. 
Some artists took a relaxed approach, sitting in directors’ chairs on the sidewalk and letting people browse through their collections, while others were in their booths with their customers. 
There were fused glass light switch plates, ornaments, vases, earrings, tableware, rugs, lamps, fine furniture and house accessories, ornate outdoor fountains, and even botanical collages on display.
Many artists’ work was eye-catching, with unique items on display. Janet Johnson painted poignant red poppies in acrylic onto large canvases. Lisa Aronzon displayed glass ornaments, bowls, and hand-blown flowers. 
Jimmy Langford came from Cumming, Ga. to show his copper, bronze, and brass sculptures. Leslie Reich had an interesting selection of wheel-thrown pottery, and her two sets of green and red bowls really stood out. 
Rita Troller, an artist from Orland Park, Ill., displayed a series of zinc and copper etchings. She had created an exquisite piece titled “A Pair,” an etching of two bright pears hanging from a tree, one colored chartreuse and the other lime. Jennifer Ardolino brought her watercolors from Crystal River, Fla. Keith Ernest, an elderly jeweler, showed rosebud rings and necklaces attracted lots of attention.
Obayana B. Ajanaku constructed a booth of sterling silver, 14- and 18-carat gold, and mokume gane, that was simply astounding. He was one of the few artists actually making pieces on site, sitting quietly behind his work with his head down, but ready to answer any questions about his pieces.
Kimberly C. Anderson of Milkweed Ceramics made beautiful functional, figurative, and sculptural ceramic pieces. She highlighted her “Goddess Cups”: glasses, jars, pitchers, and even soap dispensers that mirrored the features of a female from the navel up. 
Charles D’Onofrio brought handmade leather bags from Danbury, Conn. It was interesting to compare his leather designs to those of the only other vendors with leather goods, and he clearly had the upper hand because of his superior hides, textures, and custom pulls that trumped the other artists’ formulaic totes and wallets. His wife told me that she picks the fabrics and that each piece is one of a kind, that she never has and never will make the same bag twice.
Some very interesting furniture was also on display. John Damratoski featured some amazing mixed media metal and wood chairs. A woodworker from Millmont, Pa., J.C. Sterling exhibited custom-designed hand-built furniture with traditional joinery and unique figures that he claimed would last for generations. 
Jeff Laibson’s art was an abstract and impressionist interpretation of music featuring mangled music notes, crayola colors, and a jumble of jazz instruments. Scribbled in the corner of one of his pieces was “Play, rest, repeat.” This was a wonderfully fitting phrase for the day, good advice for the future, and a pretty mature mantra to have.

The new exhibit at the Miller Gallery, 29 Chains to the Moon, curated by Andrea Grover, is a bit surreal, but very interesting. Its name comes from R. Buckminster Fuller’s book Nine Chains to the Moon, which is, as stated by the Miller Gallery website, based on “his radical proposal for improving the quality of life for all humankind via progressive design and maximization of the world’s finite resources.” 
The name of the book was derived from the fact that if all the people of the world cooperated with each other and stood on each other’s shoulders, then everyone could form nine chains to the moon. With the increase in population since then, the world can now, essentially, complete 29 chains to the moon. 
The exhibit is spread out over an entire floor of the gallery. One corner is called the Reading Room, complete with a sofa and a couple chairs where patrons can take time to digest the scene and read books on loan from Hunt Library that apply to the exhibit. There were titles on the shelves like Small is Beautiful and, of course, Fuller’s book. 
On the left wall, a monitor is set up playing a five-minute video on loop that describes Open_Sailing, an institution created by Cesar Harada and Hiromi Ozaki. According to their website, www.opensailing.net, Open_Sailing “acts like a globally-conscious superorganism, a cluster of intelligent units that can react to their environment, change shape and reconfigure themselves.” 
There is also an impeccably-made scale model of the “International Ocean Station,” complete with a little man looking out to an imaginary sea. Below the monitor is a stand where flyers are stacked, saying that this “floating architecture” is a responsive and reactive habitat at sea. A team of 40 scientists have been developing this amoeba-like marine prototype “composed of multiple dwellings, ocean farming modules, and a ... design that can expand and contract.” It is being assembled in the U.K., France, and Morocco.
The video discussed five items, first, Instinctive_Architecture, discussing the shape of this “floating laboratory.” Second, Nomadic_Ecosystem, noting how its live data feed monitors amounts of freshwater, energy, plankton, algae, as well as detecting favorable environments for relocation. Third, Swarm_Operating_System, a “distributed operating system that suggests a general safest location and a form for the overall structure ... in order to provide intelligent distribution of supplies, energy, and information.” Fourth, it is an Energy_Animal because it creates wind, solar, and wave power at all times. Finally, a Life_Cable, a sustainable wire that will pass energy, water, and data throughout the structure.
In the final segment of the video, was a quote from Alan Kay saying, “The best way to predict our future is to invent it.” This is a poignant point when looking at these amazing futuristic designs that will revolutionize how we think about rigid infrastructure and metropolis.
The next artist to be featured was Mitchell Joachim, co-founder of Terreform ONE, a nonprofit organization that promotes environment-friendly design in urban space. There is one storyboard, complete with smaller square images of projections of their island utopia. This part of the exhibit was the most futuristic, presenting pictures of cars, vehicles, workout centers, biodomes, and geodesic spheres. 
The largest poster had modern visualizations of downtown Manhattan — a redesign of New York City complete with integrated structures that would interact with the natural vegetation and surrounding environment. This team had a vision for the future that would revolutionize the way we integrate ecological principles in an urban environment. More can be learned about their missions of sustainability and social justice at www.terreform.org.
Finally, Stephanie Smith’s piece is at the far right corner of the room, and can only be described as a commune circle. She has built a six-foot-high oblong wooden structure, with openings on either side. In the center of the shape is an eight-foot high PVC pipe supported by a tripod, and on the floor is a creamsicle-colored circle, with “I’M SHARING“ and “WE’RE COMMUNING” written in fuschia on either side. 
The flyers on the structure call it a “kiosk” and say that it is meant for sharing items, info/resources, and communal experiences. The artist encourages anyone to “gather here, spontaneously or intentionally, for any reason and for any length of time.” 
All these artists’ schemes for a fantastic feature were pretty interesting and I would certainly stroll through with some friends and see if you get inspired.

Since the day I got back to the U.S. from spending my spring semester studying abroad in Christchurch, New Zealand, I have been met with the somewhat annoying but completely reasonable question: “How was New Zealand?” And every time I find myself faced with this question, the words “It was so fun!” come out of my mouth. The first time this happened, I realized I had just used those words to describe one of the most amazing times of my life, and it made me cringe. In fact, my experience was not just “so fun”: it was incredible, exciting, terrifying, full of novel things, new experiences, things I learned to love, things I learned to appreciate, and, above all, people I will never forget. 
I picked Christchurch based on three requirements: English language use, location and weather, and program duration. While these were all very important factors, when I found out that one particular school had a three-week-long spring break, I immediately picked it. And I am so happy I made that choice.
I spent my first week in New Zealand getting to know the other people in my program, since I had left the U.S. not knowing a single person who would be in the country. At college, I took an indigenous language course that helped me pronounce names of cities and landmarks, a marine biology course that helped me learn about the nature there, and a New Zealand history course, where I learned a lot about the country’s past. But my experience in New Zealand was hardly shaped by my classes. 
My semester was marked by weekend road trips, trying more new things than I ever thought possible, and spending it with the most amazing people in the world.
I am going to try to detail 10 of my favorite experiences from studying abroad.
Hiking the Abel Tasman Coastal Track. This three-to-five-day hiking trail is located on the northern part of the south island. (This would be the time to do a Google image search of New Zealand and realize that it has two main islands.) Half the track is across beaches and the other half is through mountains. Not only was it incredibly beautiful, but I did the walk with 13 other people, which made the entire experience much more fun.
Learning to surf. I had never done this before and I have to say that I am a pro surfer now!
Bungee jumping. For those who have ever been skydiving, I think you will love bungee jumping. It was one of the most terrifying and amazing things I have ever done. I thought I was going to pee in my pants.
Following a shark in the Great Barrier Reef. I spent my three-week mid-semester break in Australia and was able to go both snorkeling and scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef. At one point while I was snorkeling, I happened to see something that looked like a shark probably no less than three feet and no more than 20 meters beneath me. 
I was so excited by the fact that I saw a shark that I started following it. After a few minutes, I started to get bored and then looked around only to find that I was pretty far from everyone else. When I looked back into the water I couldn’t see the shark anymore. That’s when it got really scary and I swam as fast as I could back to the boat.
Driving 3000 km (1900 miles) down the eastern coast of Australia. There are so many things I can think to say about this trip, but I think I’ll just go with a word montage: beaches, kangaroos, sleeping in the car, drunken old men, flashers, sand dunes, erotic novels, opera house, tent, BBQs, koalas, plumbers, Coochin Hills, speeding ticket, lagoon, diarrhea, Nutella, bars, no showers, road kill. I’ll let everyone try to put the story together.
Hiking a glacier. I was fortunate that my boyfriend was able to come out and spend eight amazing days with me. While he was there, we drove to one of the two most well-known glaciers in New Zealand — Franz Josef — and did an eight-hour hike. It is hard to explain why it was such an incredible experience, but it was the magnitude of the glacier and the amazing forces of nature that came together to form it that I couldn’t stop thinking about. 
Being on the sets of Lord of the Rings. While seeing Hobbiton, Mount Doom, and the jewelry shop that the original Ring was made in, I didn’t even realize I was walking through places from Lord of the Rings. I got to sit inside Bilbo’s house and see the party tree, and I actually bought an exact replica of “the One Ring.” 
Black water rafting. I went into a cave for the first time in my life and saw glow worms that looked like the Milky Way. I also got to raft my way down and lead the group of people I was with through parts of the cave. 
Zorbing. I can’t really think of a good way to describe this, but the best way to understand is to YouTube it. Basically, a giant plastic ball is suspended within an even larger plastic ball. In the smaller one, some water and a person are put in and then the whole thing is rolled down a hill. Sounds lame? Turns out it was one of the most hysterical and surprisingly fun things I did in New Zealand.
Meeting people I will be friends with forever. I met a guy on a city bus that knew my favorite college football team, and he was the first person to tell me when their quarterback was drafted to the NFL. I met another guy who let me stay with his parents and his best friends even though we had only known each other for a few weeks. 
I also met a guy from England who has become one of my best friends. A girl I met for about 10 minutes in the U.S. — just because our parents knew each other — let me stay with her for four days in Australia. I met people from all over the United States who have become some of my closest friends and I miss them terribly.
If I were given a chance to go back to New Zealand tomorrow, I would take it up in a heartbeat. I did so many amazing things, but there are still so many more things I would like to do. I hope sometime soon I will be able to go back.

If you’re looking for something to read but don’t want to be bogged down by thousand-page epics, Constance McCutcheon’s Woman of the Baths might just be the answer. 
A novella, Woman of the Baths takes place primarily in Pittsburgh after the end of World War II. Wagner Fike, a middle-aged member of one of the city’s richest families, finds himself in conflict with a decision made by his son, Ogden. Ogden, whose friendship with a younger man and disagreement with Wagner’s beliefs set him at constant odds with his father, has forged papers for the transfer of a young Japanese woman, Yukiko, out of her country and into the United States. Specifically, the papers allow Yukiko to remain at the Fikes’ residence under the guise of being a “bride” for Ogden’s friend, Ricky Virostik.
Initially, Ogden’s goal is twofold: First to confront his father about his support of the war, especially the brutality of its climax in Japan; and second to fulfill a promise to Virostik, an issue that remains elusive and is fleshed out more and more as the story progresses. Surprisingly, Wagner agrees and becomes caretaker to Yukiko, who will not utter a single word to anyone. Having been a victim of a fire-bombing raid, Yukiko lost both of her hands. Interestingly, Wagner begins to develop feelings for Yukiko as time goes on. As his own wife was recently deceased, Wagner comes to see Yukiko almost as a replacement for her, a sentiment that irks Ogden to no end. Wagner arranges for prosthetic appendages to be made for her, hook-like extensions to her arms that can be covered with a flesh-colored glove, but Yukiko prefers to wear the hooks bare. 
Determined to offer Yukiko a place in his world, Wagner brings Yukiko to therapy sessions so that she can learn to use her new hands to perform more complex tasks. Gradually, she gains in proficiency, and Wagner offers her a job as a custodian at a museum his family maintains. Perhaps what sets Wagner apart from his other American counterparts is the fact that when Yukiko starts to live in the public bathrooms, he allows her to. Unlike the rest of his family, who refer to her as “custodian of the toilets,” Wagner makes her new position sound more sophisticated and European, calling her the “custodian of the baths.”
It is most interesting, as well, to note the dynamics between father and son in the novel. Ogden, who intends first of all to show his war-supporting father just how wrong his beliefs were, makes little effort to empathize with Yukiko or get to know her better as his father does. Instead, he acts on behalf of Virostik’s wishes, and is convinced that his father will become a better person on seeing first-hand the people that the war has wounded. At the beginning, Ogden seems a hero, and his father the heartless villain. By the novel’s close, though, McCutheon switches the two roles. Wagner becomes the one to truly see Yukiko’s humanity, and Ogden’s actions on behalf of his friend turn out to have graver consequences.
McCutcheon, who graduated with a masters’ degree in writing from Carnegie Mellon, currently lives in Munich, Germany. She has written two novels in addition to this novella: Elusion and Fit to Print. Her website, which contains more samples of her writing, can be found at www.cmccutcheon.com.

The Benjy Davis Project is a Louisiana-based rock band made up of five members, including none other than Benjy Davis, who does the lead vocals and acoustic and electric guitar; Mic Capdevielle on the drums, percussion, and vocals; Jonathan Lawhun on the electric lead guitar and banjo; Matt Rusnak on the bass guitar; and Michael Galasso taking on a few roles playing the piano, B3 organ, Wurlitzer, harmonica, and vocals. Davis formed the Benjy Davis Project in 2001 as a folk rock duo and transformed it into one of the most popular bands in Baton Rouge. The band recently released their latest album, Dust, which took them to a new high in their career. On the band’s music page, Davis says that “these sessions were more raw, more real.”
The album takes you from emotional points with “Still Sweet” and “Good Enough” to romantic points with songs like “I Love You.” The music is great to listen to during different times of the day and different states of the mind. The band takes its fans on a journey into their minds as they write from the soul, and with this album, the band feels that “they’ve fully arrived.” Dust is a great album to listen to when you want to listen to musical abilities take over and actually hear the music from the artist.
On a different note, the album Not as Far by Three Legged Fox is more of a pick-me-up album. Band members Kyle Wareham, Eric Weisenstein, Mike Brody, and Kory Kochersperger really deliver in this one. It’s the kind of music you play on the boom box when you are getting a tan on the beach as a Frisbee whizzes over your head and a barbecue grill is about 10 feet away from you with the smell of grilling burgers and dogs whiffing past your nose. This CD is a mix of flavors as it pulls together reggae beats and rock music to create the perfect laid-back blend. “Away,” the second song on the album, really takes you away with its rhythmic and catchy tunes. This album is a great combination of so many ideas and thoughts that have been put together to be delivered to fans in a relaxed vibe. Lie back, close your eyes, and listen to the album. You may just want to play it again. 
The album also features guest appearances by Slightly Stoopid, members of G. Love & Special Sauce, and more. The band’s reputation speaks for their album as they were voted #1 Best Rock Band in the 2008 Out & About Magazine Music Awards. The group was actually formed after winning the University of Delaware’s 2006 Battle of the Bands. Three Legged Fox has received great reviews.
Priscilla Renea: In one word, “Yes!” She began her music career by posting her music on YouTube and surprised herself when her fan base turned into thousands. Just hearing a taste of her music puts you in a lighter mood. “Hello My Apple” is a great song for those who love to hear when their “apple” just calls to say hello. It’s not a mushy song that makes you want to change the station but, rather, it’s just enough to get the point across. “I Fell In Love” picks up the pace as she shares with listeners her experience with romance. She fell in love and it is easy to see why fans fell in love with her music. Look forward to hearing more from this up and coming artist. 
Her music stems from the many experiences she has been through as the child of a naval officer. It led to her writing poetry, prose, and song which she did because there “wasn’t anything on the radio that I wanted to hear.” Her music has already been featured in ad campaigns and she has been featured in Giant magazine for her fashion sense. Renea is coming through various media and we can expect to see her debut album on Oct. 20. Her music is available on YouTube.

If you are going to gain the predicted “freshman 15” and keep it throughout your time at Carnegie Mellon, you might as well do it the right way. Aside from furnishing your dorm or apartment with furniture and personal touches, you also need to prepare your kitchen to provide for your hungry stomach and late-night snack sessions.
For students who have on-campus housing with a communal kitchen, the fundamental basics for eating at the desk are a mini-fridge, a microwave, a bowl, and some utensils. This is the bare minimum for survival. If you are a gastronomic minimalist, go for a shallow bowl instead of a plate — a shallow bowl doubles as a plate and a bowl. Another quick tip: A medium-sized paring knife with a protective sheath is useful for cutting fruits at the desk.
For those who adore dessert, a glass liquid measuring cup with a handle is highly recommended. It comes in especially handy when mixing brownie mix out of the box, because instead of using up different bowls in the process, the mixing and baking can be done just in the measuring cup. Aside from being oven-, microwave-, refrigerator-, freezer-, and dishwasher-safe, a measuring cup can also double as a bowl with a handle for heating up oatmeal or ramen noodles in the microwave. The measuring cup tends to remain in the kitchen after moving off campus as well.
In an apartment kitchen, pots and pans become essential in order to completely utilize it. A pot and a pan would do just about anything from an Asian stir-fry to a winter stew. Again, for a gastronomic minimalist, go for a pot instead of a pan. You can do a decent saute in a pot but you definitely cannot cook up chicken soup in a pan. For a more specialized job, a flat bottom cast iron skillet is amazing for steak, pancakes, and also baking cornbread. Cast iron cookware can hold more heat and does not change the temperature as fast as a pan.
Aside from basic pots and pans, I am a firm believer in a good knife. If you enjoy cooking, a knife allows you to manipulate vegetables, meat, and fruits to a greater level. Invest in only one good, six-to-eight-inch santoku or chef’s knife. It allows you to cut, slice, chop, and carve comfortably.
For the avid baker, an electric mixer is the gateway to heaven. KitchenAid provides reputable mixers, including both stand and handheld mixers. The key point to think about when buying a handheld electric mixer is its weight. For some recipes, you might need to hold the mixer for up to 10 minutes. Find something that fits your price point and your bodily strength.
Most of the time, we go to stores like Macy’s and Target to get our dorm or apartment furnished. But we often forget about places like Marshall’s and T.J. Maxx, where you can get the same or even better quality cookware, along with other dorm furnishings, for lower prices.

c Radiohead took the world on full force with the triumphant release of OK Computer, vastly integrating electronic sounds into the very core of their sound and lyrics, completing the revisionary need of Thom Yorke, the band’s lead singer; Wilco became a sunny source of pop on Summerteeth, erasing the hereditary characteristics of the band’s predecessor, Uncle Tupelo; The White Stripes abandoned their low-fi roots to create a band based solely on the interplay of guitar, voice, and a simple drum rhythm; and now come the Arctic Monkeys with their new album, Humbug.  
The Arctic Monkeys’ first album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, became the quickest-selling debut album in British history. This formula revolved around the mixture of sharp-hitting guitar clips surrounding lead singer Alex Turner’s vocals and the band’s slower tunes, which felt two-dimensional. This formula was stretched out with their sophomore album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, by introducing a darker aspect to the band while retaining a high-energy affair, but the album still felt somewhat stale in comparison.
Insert Humbug. What an interesting album. There is no sustained attack to the senses on the first track. Humbug defies the formula that catapulted the band to success. The album no longer attempts to stretch this formula out further and further until the sound becomes ultimately stale beyond belief, a la The Strokes. Humbug has taken the complex and irregular aspects, be they vocals, guitar, or bass lines, found within Whatever and has produced them into a state that is seemingly simpler, though Humbug resonates within the soul deeper and longer.
“Crying Lightning” is the epitome of Humbug. It starts slowly with a fairly simple beat and drum line, but this generic sound is transformed with the introduction of Turner. It differentiates the song from the binary formula of Whatever and Favourite by creating a building block on which the rest of the song adds until the cathartic release, as Turner carefully and repeatedly articulates the words “crying lightning.”
Turner’s new articulation marks the transformation of Arctic Monkeys. The band is no longer the amateur super-pop celebrities heard on Whatever, but has become the mature and contemplative complexity of Humbug. 
There are still some quick songs, such as the great “Pretty Visitors” and the not-quite-good “Potion Approaching,” but they are airier and not immediately likable, as was Whatever. The hooks are gone, but the album rewards listeners by growing on them quickly.
The Arctic Monkeys have followed great bands by recreating their formula within the third album, but the best might be coming along the horizon. Radiohead followed their third album with the amazing album Kid A; Wilco with their best album in Yankee Hotel Foxtrot; The White Stripes became legends with Elephant. If the closing cacophony of sounds in the finale of Humbug, “The Jeweller’s Hands,” is any indication, the Arctic Monkeys might very well be on the right track.

Plastic grocery bags have gotten a bad rap in today’s green-conscious society. But what if your average Giant Eagle grocery carrier could be a building block in the creation of a space? Is it possible for waste to be transformed into an enjoyable environment? These questions are answered in the Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) installation, aptly titled LDPE Loop, created by four Carnegie Mellon fourth-year architecture students: Filip Agren, Max Arocena, Conor Doyle, and Liz Duray. 
“We are in a wasteful moment in society,” said Arocena about the inspiration for the project. “There is no respect for what’s old and what’s already there. There are [artists] doing installations and going to Home Depot to buy their materials; we are turning people’s trash into something that’s beautiful.”
The installation, currently being displayed in downtown Pittsburgh at the Future Tenant Art Gallery, certainly achieves this element of beauty. The ethereal curtains of woven plastic bags transform the gallery space into a passageway that moves and sways with the visitor. A juxtaposition of smaller passageways opening up into a larger, communal space guides a person from the entrance to what the artists have dictated as “nodes of importance”: a bench for resting or the bar for socializing. 
“My initial impression was ‘Where do I go?’” said senior mathematical sciences major and musician Dan Lacker. “I started exploring and realized that the installation was guiding me.” The opening of the exhibit that took place last Friday featured live music by Lacker and pianist Patrick McGettigan, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus. Around a hundred students, faculty, and alumni of Carnegie Mellon were brought together by the art.
The installation is the second in a series of projects exploring space and its relationship to audience created from material otherwise deemed waste. Last year, the project titled Canopy, created by Agren, Arocena, Duray, and two other fourth-year architecture majors — Ellen Garret and Judy Podraza — used aluminum cans to form 15 hexagonal structures that were fit together, creating an organic shape, then suspended from the ceiling. The current LDPE installation is also a free-form structure that makes use of a pattern, the weaving of the plastic bags, while still maintaining a natural, non-calculated form. The artists have been working on the concept and execution of the project throughout the summer, culminating in the past two weeks with late nights at Future Tenant weaving the bags together.
To plan the installation, the artists relied on their own drawings rather than computer-created imagery. The space of the gallery was also taken into account; lines of tension wire were mounted parallel to the ceiling tiles, and the bags were then attached to these wires to make full use of the room. The natural light from the entrance was also taken into consideration in the design, with the translucent material of the bags creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere in the areas of interest chosen by the four artists. 
Apart from the aid received in the form of a grant from Carnegie Mellon, all of the materials were donated by Giant Eagle and the people of Shadyside. “We went door to door asking people to give us their extra bags,” said Arocena, who estimates that about 5000 were used in the project. “[The installation] also shows the buying habits of people in Shadyside.” While the majority are white and blue bags with the emblem of Giant Eagle, a few Target and CVS logos pepper the sheets of plastic. 
“I’d love to see this on a larger scale,” said senior design major Natalia Olbinski. For now, the LDPE bags of the installation, like the cans from Canopy, will return from whence they came: back to waste, recycled and reused by Pittsburgh Giant Eagle customers.

I know I’ve only made it through the first week of classes, but I am already exhausted. Every day by about three o’clock, I am ready to take a nap. For those of you well-acquainted with the all-important ritual of napping, you know that it is a very serious practice, and its success hinges on any number of variables like blanket choice, general atmosphere, and, of course, music.
There have to be a million songs written about sleep (after all, don’t we spend about a third of our life doing this? Can someone please give me an update on this statistic?). In the last week I’ve been rediscovering The Smiths’ song “Asleep.” 
I can remember first stumbling on this song in middle school, those formative years of anxiety and woe, characterized by many of us through the mix tapes we listened to, the basements we smoked in, the beat literature we read. But unlike the rest of the nonsense that littered my middle school experience, The Smiths’ still retains its uncanny sadness.
Morrissey himself has a knack for melancholy — even in his most up-tempo, danceable tracks, there is a pervasive gloom about the condition of being alive. The effects of this can be disastrous.
My friend Jen is least immune to Morrissey’s angst and has been known, on more than several occasions, to break down in the middle of doing anything and weep to the croon of Moz’s voice. 
Hell, sometimes she would just break down at the thought of him old and sweaty, playing the Celebrity Showcase in Reno, Nev., changing his soggy T-shirts every 30 minutes and riding long black limousines for 200-foot stretches, realizing that no one would ever put up with that kind of shit from her.
No one would put up with that shit from me, either, which might make listening to The Smiths after a laborious first week of class even worse. There seems to be a sort of unfairness at play, but if poor Moz wasn’t always famous, at least he was always sad. 
So if you’re feeling a bit worn and torn after a rough first week, I suggest you take comfort, curl up, revisit your old sad songs, and hope that you too will find great success in your wallowing.

Dear Rohit,
I am not really great when it comes to the dating scene. I falter a lot when it comes to the pivotal step — you know, making the move. What should I do?
—Still Inexperienced, Not Great Lover Emotionally  
Dear SINGLE, 
Meeting someone is less about “making a move” and more about starting a conversation. Just start talking about something; be friendly. Even if you’re just at the grocery store, getting the conversation started is about 60 percent of the battle (another 30 percent is getting his or her number, and the remaining 10 percent is not embarrassing yourself during the actual conversation). Once you’re talking, stay alert to any relationship status clues and whether he or she seems to be digging you. Then go for it!
Here’s my expert advice when it comes to situations like this. Generally, you can at least tell if someone finds you somewhat interesting and/or attractive. If you genuinely feel there’s a connection and you’d like to see him or her again, what do you have to lose? As long as it’s not someone you work with, the absolute worst thing that could happen is you ask for his or her number and you get a “no.” However, the best case is that you’ll fall in love, have lots of hot crazy sex, get married, and live happily ever after — the fairytale ending we all want. 
So get down to it, okay? You’ve got to date a few that aren’t perfect before you find one that is. Oh, and let me know if your love interest has a sister.
Single and ready to mingle,
— Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I can’t live without everything in my room being absolutely spotless, but my roommate is a slob. Everything else between us is great, but I’m sick of cleaning up after him. How can I save our friendship without cleaning up all the time?
—Nearly Emotional About Trash
Dear NEAT,
This is a situation that is played out in many a dorm room and ends with varying degrees of trash left lying around. What you need to do first is to think about what you can and cannot deal with. You really cannot expect your roommate to completely turn around and be as clean as you, so be prepared for it. 
Try talking to him about the things you cannot bear, even for a moment, to see in your room, and ask him to put in an effort. If that works, then maybe you can push a bit more. If not, get out your war dress and annoy him to the point that he has no choice left. 
Wait, that was a joke, don’t do that. Just give him a few subtle hints by putting all his trash in and around his bed. He’ll get the point and then you have a germ-free zone to live in.
Don’t forget to recycle,
— Rohit

100 Years Ago
Sept. 22, 1909
In the “Pertinent and Impertinent” section, it is noted that The Margaret Morrison School is offering a new graduate course in “Normal Work.” I can only imagine the grueling undergraduate courses that one must have taken to be eligible to take on this type of baggage as a graduate student.  
50 Years Ago
Sept. 23, 1959
Ah, the ’50s. A quaint time when there actually was a cigarette ad on every single page of The Tartan. This included one such ad from Marlboro and Philip Morris, which claimed to “upgrade my gusto, magnify my cheer, and broaden my bliss.”

Sept. 12, 1984
The classifieds section advertises “Exotic Dancers — both male and female — and Stripper Grams for parties.” Now that’s what I have always been wanting from my newspaper: a one-stop shop for all things newsworthy and exotic. It’s a shame The Tartan no longer affords us this opportunity.

“Tuition will rise again” is the main headline this week as the Board of Trustees votes to increase tuition by 11.3 percent, bringing the total cost to just under $30,000. With all the current changes on campus with regard to dining, renovations, and whatnot, it sure is refreshing to see that some things haven’t changed a bit.
5 Years Ago
Sept. 9, 2004
“Hour without Power” is a front page headline that talks about how all of campus and parts of Squirrel Hill were completely without power for part of the afternoon. This caused much displeasure among the party-going campus community, as they were unable to complete their own “power hours” during this time.

Health Talk this week brings up the subject of phantom limbs, a condition in which amputees report feeling pain in their lost appendages. This isn’t as rare a condition as you may think, though, as some receivers on our very own football team suffer from a different type of “phantom limbs” from time to time... meaning, they drop passes.

An iPhone, Skype, and Google street view were all it took for one lucky Carnegie Mellon student to catch a group of armed robbers. Can Duruk, a senior cognitive science and human-computer interaction double major, was attacked by two armed men just before midnight on Friday night, and by 4 a.m. had led the police to the actors and identified both of them in a police lineup. Duruk’s story was completely made possible by the technology on his iPhone that he found on the Internet.
Duruk’s troubles began when turning off Fifth Avenue to walk on Amberson Avenue toward his off-campus apartment. The two actors were walking ahead of him while looking back at him. When they saw that Duruk was looking forward toward them and that he was the only other person within sight, they began to slow down, then turned to run toward him.
The actors took his wallet from his pocket and demanded the PIN for his PNC bank card. 
They then threatened him with a small black gun, and proceeded to take his iPhone. Finally, they ran from the scene.
“I checked my pockets. They didn’t take my keys so I went home. I couldn’t call 911, so I downloaded Skype on my computer and called my friend,” Duruk said.
Duruk and the friend he had Skyped were able to track the path of the actors using MobileMe, an online iPhone program that syncs the iPhone in addition to displaying its exact location at any time using its internal GPS system. Duruk and his friend watched as the actors traveled throughout the city from Shell to Walmart, and eventually to an Eat ’n Park restaurant in North Versailles. They were able to determine that the location of the restaurant, for example, was actually an Eat ’n Park by comparing the map displayed by MobileMe with a zoomed-in Google street-view map of the exact same location.
Duruk had been able to track the economic happenings of the actors as well, using PNC’s online banking system. He watched as the actors took out lumps of money in succession and attempted to buy an Xbox and a baby car seat, among other items.
Throughout this tracking period, the two had been on the phone with Pittsburgh police, updating them on the progress of the actors. When the actors landed at Eat ’n Park, they remained there for a sufficient amount of time that the North Versailles police were able to go there and apprehend the actors.
“They caught them while they were having dinner,” Duruk said.
The police notified Duruk that the actors had been caught and asked him to come to the station to view a police lineup, where he was able to identify both actors.
“I never thought we would actually catch them,” Duruk said.
While the link to the other robberies has not been investigated, Duruk is expected to attend a preliminary hearing for his own case next week.
“Just do whatever they tell you. If money’s gone, it’s not the end of the world,” Duruk said. “But the best advice would be to not get yourself into that situation at all. Take the Escort or walk with someone.”
As for his feelings on MobileMe, Duruk of course has rave reviews. MobileMe was the key part of his ability to track down the actors.
While Duruk’s robbery was the first with such a capture, it was not the first to happen as of late around the Carnegie Mellon campus. The university has reported a series of armed robberies in the past few weeks, an action that has not been lost among the student body.
“I felt less safe after the report that someone was robbed at gun point at 9 a.m.,” said Gabby Moskowitz, a senior economics major. “I always walk home late at night with other people, but I’ve never hesitated to walk to Shadyside alone during the day.”
Moskowitz hopes that the string of armed robberies will soon slow.
Editor's Note: Can Duruk is the Online Editor and Systems Manager for The Tartan.

For anyone involved in a student organization, club, or team on campus, the members of Alpha Kappa Psi Fraternity, the professional business fraternity on campus, have just done you a great service. For the first time, students now have access to a Carnegie Mellon-based website, CMYou.net, which allows them to purchase customizable items for their various organizations.
Alisa Deychman, a sophomore chemistry and economics major and a member of Alpha Kappa Psi, said, “We offer similar services as already popular existing websites, but we expanded those. Now, not only can we offer you rush t’s and Buggy t’s, you can also get banners, pens, postcards, or any other accessories you would like to promote your organization.”
The website began taking shape in fall 2008, when Matt Glantz, a senior business major and member of Alpha Kappa Psi, was contacted by Andy Bernstein, the owner of a marketing company based in Philadelphia called Non-Traditional Media. Bernstein had already started similar websites at schools like Georgetown and the University of Pennsylvania, and he wanted some help creating a website for Carnegie Mellon.
Members of Alpha Kappa Psi are committed to helping each other in areas of professional development like résumé writing, improving interview skills, and hands-on business experience, so helping to start this website was in direct correlation with the mission of the fraternity.
Although there are similar websites available, the members of Alpha Kappa Psi improved and enhanced their site to ensure they were offering the best option to Carnegie Mellon students. Non-Traditional Media provides a template to every school that they work with for the website. Alpha Kappa Psi thought, however, that the template was not user-friendly and that it did not allow them to offer the same features as their competitors. They redesigned the template by changing some of the layouts, creating a logo, and adding the design tool.
Kim Chan, another member of Alpha Kappa Psi and a junior business major, explained the tool. “The design tool allows you to pick a T-shirt and then design it on the computer. We saw that it was a big selling point for Customink.com [a similar website], so we used it for CMYou.net.”
There are many benefits, besides the ease of using the website, for students choosing CMYou.net rather than its competitors like Customink.com and Universitytees.com. 
CMYou.net has all of the same features as these websites, but offers better prices. It also offers a student-to-student relationship.
“If you have a question, you can easily find us on campus, whereas you would have to call [our competitor’s] 1-800-numbers and go through all this jazz that can be very annoying,” Chan said. The fraternity also has samples of possible products that you can see, pick up, and decide if they are right for your organization.
Norlex Belma, a junior ethics, history, and public policy major and a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated, said, “I think this website would be great for our organization because it’s reasonably priced and it would provide us with more than just matching T’s, but also matching hoodies and bags.”
Another thing that separates CMYou.net from its competitors is that if you get a quote from the website that doesn’t fit your organization’s budget, the company will see if they can find a lower price.
“Andy has a lot of contacts with manufacturers, so we can work to find a better price if the organization cannot afford the one that is given,” Glantz said.
Although this is the first business the fraternity has helped start and promote since its founding at Carnegie Mellon in 2004, they have high hopes for future business ventures.
“This is really big for us,” Deychman said, “and we’re excited for the future.”

A Carnegie Mellon Official Communications e-mail sent out by Dean of Student Affairs Karen D. Boyd Friday morning confirmed the death of sophomore computer science student Rohan Vakharia after a fall from a staircase in Wean Hall. 
The e-mail stated that Vakharia, 19, was from Gainesville, Fla., and a graduate of Eastside High School.
Vakharia’s death was first reported by local news stations early Thursday evening. 
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that police believe the death to be an apparent suicide, and that a note was found at the scene. 
However, the police investigation is still continuing.
Students who would like someone to talk to are encouraged to contact Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS). 
According to the e-mail, further details on any memorial plans will be announced once they have been confirmed, per the family’s wishes.

For most undergraduate students living through the worst economy of their lives, it is a scary time to be looking for a job. Fortunately, that’s not the case with Carnegie Mellon students. In May 2009, Carnegie Mellon named Robert Murphy as the new director of the Career Center, and during his first week on the job, the proactive pioneer changed the name of his domain from the Career Center to the Career and Professional Development Center.
“If you become complacent in this economy, you lose your core,” Murphy said. “The career director clearly has to lead innovation.”
The former Marine Corps captain, senior executive at PepsiCo. International, and most recently director of Career and Leadership Development at Hobart and William Smith College in Geneva, N.Y. is determined to better prepare Carnegie Mellon students to compete for and ultimately win jobs in this tough climate when up against students from other top-tier institutions.
“Employers are hiring less people. If a company is only going to hire 10 people, I don't want seven to come from Stanford and three to come from here; I want all 10 to come from Carnegie Mellon.”
Murphy worked at PepsiCo. International running business units of 71 million, increased appointments at the Career Center at Hobart and William Smith by over 400 percent in his five years there — he personally met with 900 students just last year — and even climbed Mount Everest.
“You never know what you're good at until you do it,” Murphy said. “If you have the competencies, it doesn't matter what your degree is in.”
In just the last month since Murphy has come to Carnegie Mellon, he has implemented a multitude of initiatives to help students discover what makes them stand out in the current job market.
Some of the initiatives Murphy and his team are implementing include a Professionals In Residence program, which will have recruiters and people in the workplace come in to tell students the skills they look for when hiring new employees. Murphy is also assigning the role of “employer relations” to some of the Career and Professional Development Center’s employees’ titles so they can reach out to companies that haven’t come to Carnegie Mellon in the past, but which students are interested in working at.
He knows that representatives from Google, Microsoft, and UBS come to Carnegie Mellon every year looking for students in their tech and finance departments, but he wants to encourage students who want to work in other fields to start a dialogue as early as possible with their career consultants so the “employee relations” team can develop relationships with companies in other arenas so that every students needs and interests are met.
Another new implementation is a 3-D portfolio available on TartanTrak, which allows students to type in their interests, leadership positions, work experience, and classes that they liked the most so employers can see the well-rounded nature of a student, not just the specialized expertise. Career consultants will help student’s communicate what their digital 3-D portfolio highlights about them to their potential employers in interviews and on résumés.
Maureen May, the assistant director for employer development, said, “We want to be able to help advance capabilities of students to convey to different industries. So many students never make an appointment with their career consultant and think, ‘I have a degree from Carnegie Mellon, a prestigious university; companies should hire me.’ Students are so surprised if they don't get a second interview when students never meet with us to develop their presentation skills.”
R.F. Culbertson, entrepreneurship professor at the Tepper School of Business, believes that, “In a time when there are more people than jobs, you need to retrain the students how to sell [themselves] so that the students from Carnegie Mellon ‘outsell’ the students from the Penns, Chicagos, and Stanfords. With an oversupply of qualified candidates for limited positions ... the views toward sales need to change dramatically.”
Although the average starting salary of Tepper students dropped from 2008 to 2009, the college of Humanities and Social Sciences was very pleased with how their students fared.
“Starting salaries for our students [were] the highest in years,” says Debra Ignelzi, assistant director for the Career and Professional Development Center and consultant for the college of Humanities and Social Sciences. “The numbers of appointments went up, more students attended our career center workshops, and our consultants were able to work with our students to develop a plan.”
Although Carnegie Mellon is often categorized as a technical school specializing in computer science and engineering, many H&SS students had starting salaries well over $60,000, with some making $75,000, and even $100,000.
Ignelzi joked, “Bob [Murphy] always says we aren’t tooting our horns loud enough.”
The other assistant director of the Career and Professional Development Center and consultant for the college of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ray Mizgorski, acknowledged, “the skill sets of H&SS students can go across a whole breadth of opportunities. In this economy, students have realized that they shouldn't be confined to their major because they can compete in a lot of different arenas.”
“The most neurotic thing in the world is to think about what your core competencies are,” Murphy later asserted. “That's why we have trained our career consultants to translate students’ interests, values, and skills to different professions and work with students so they are able to clearly articulate to employers what they want to do. If they can’t do that, someone else will get the job.”
Culbertson agrees. “The good news is that the college student bar for sales is set fairly low, so learning how to sell yourself and competing against people who (A) prefer not to sell themselves or (B) sell themselves poorly could create a competitive advantage in the eyes of the employer.”

With the addition of two sororities to the Greek quadrangle — Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma — and the removal of two prominent fraternities from it this past summer — Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi — the future of Greek life at Carnegie Mellon has been drawn into question.
Following incidents that occurred last academic year that, according to the Office of Student Life, violated university protocol, Kappa Delta Rho was removed by the University Disciplinary Committee. 
G. Richard Tucker, Interim Dean of Student Affairs at the time of his May 29 letter to Kappa Delta Rho explaining the university’s decision, listed the official reasons for the fraternity’s suspension as “furnishing alcohol to minors” and “failing to comply with university sanctions.”
“We’re the people that are ‘quote-unquote’ making the decisions,” explained Monica Bebie, coordinator for fraternity and sorority life, to The Tartan, “but it wasn’t any decisions I made, but rather decisions the fraternities made.”
Several members of the fraternities removed from campus expressed feelings that the university is moving toward an unspoken policy of favoring sororities over fraternities.
Bob Saris, however, the most recent president of Theta Xi, clarified Theta Xi’s position on the matter.
“I would say that we were [treated fairly while on campus]. I do think that the original charge [that] got the ball rolling on our probation — an accusation of furnishing alcohol to minors — was not handled perfectly, but overall, I think we [were] treated like any other fraternity on campus would be.”
Theta Xi, unlike Kappa Delta Rho, was removed based on a decision made by its national organization, rather than by the university’s Office of Student Life. 
In an Aug. 7 e-mail from the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Association to the Carnegie Mellon Theta Xi Pi Alumni group, Dean of Student Affairs Karen Boyd explained that the chapter had been placed in “dormant status.” That is, “the charter is inactive for an indefinite period” based on “an investigation of a serious violation of fraternity standards conducted earlier [in July] by representatives of the National Office of the Fraternity.”
Additionally, Boyd’s e-mail encouraged Theta Xi alumni to connect with the national fraternity “in support of the potential reactivation of the charter in the future” — encouraging, at least in theory, the fraternity’s future growth on campus.
According to Hippensteel and Bebie, the Office of Student Life is not trying to kick fraternity life off campus. In fact, it is doing the opposite.
“I started here five years ago,” Bebie explained, “and Greek life was 14 percent of the campus, and now it’s 21 percent of the campus. The IFC [Interfraternity Council] is already opening the doors for some national organizations.”
Hippensteel stressed the difficulty of making such a decision to remove a fraternity, such as in the case of Kappa Delta Rho. “It’s very sad to lose an organization. It’s hard to see an organization that was there not be there anymore,” she said.
The campus community may think the fraternities are being judged too harshly by the university, as several brothers of both current and former on-campus organizations questioned. “We hold them to a higher standard because they’ve chosen to hold themselves to a higher standard,” Hippensteel said.
From the perspective of Student Affairs, the decision to remove Kappa Delta Rho followed this pattern of heightened ideals and often self-imposed pressures to contribute to the campus community. However, this doesn’t always mean a fraternity’s members’ actions will follow suit.
“We can say what the expectations are, but in the end, people make choices, and there will be consequences for choices — sometimes they’re good, but sometimes they’re not,” Hippensteel added.
“They’re an organization; they’re not individual students,” Hippensteel told The Tartan. 
However, according to a letter sent to Kappa Delta Rho by the university, the majority of the allegations against the fraternity were based upon individuals’ actions, often unrelated to events or activities sponsored by Kappa Delta Rho.
While several Greek organizations’ members were under the impression that the fraternity would again be on campus in two years, Bebie explained otherwise.
“Kappa Delta Rho is as eligible to return to campus as are the 75 other nationwide Greek organizations being considered,” she said. 
The university is looking for, she added, “the strongest and best: they [should] have a strong alumni network, the largest foundations and endowments, a large structure in place for support, strong leadership programming, and lots of chapters nationally.” If Kappa Delta Rho qualifies as a fraternity fitting these qualifications, it will be considered “through an IFC process for expansion,” along with many other Greek organizations.
The sisters of Delta Delta Delta have since moved into Kappa Delta Rho’s former house. 
Megan Sasinoski, the membership development chairman of the sorority, expressed her sisterhood’s gratitude in an Aug. 19 e-mail to The Tartan.
“While Tri Delta is very excited to have moved onto the Greek Quad, we are sad to see a chapter leave. We feel especially fortunate and grateful for the opportunity to live in a larger facility that will help promote our chapter’s growth.... Tri Delta is really looking forward to being a part of the larger sorority community on the quad.”
The president of Kappa Kappa Gamma did not respond for comment to The Tartan.
“Our organization was approached and asked if we were interested in replacing one of the houses on the Greek quadrangle,” said Chris Niessl, IFC Vice President of Community Relations and a member of the Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity in an August 21 e-mail to The Tartan. “However, I know we declined.”
Bebie and Hippensteel, however, insisted that other fraternities were not considered. 
Rather, a process from four years ago to decide the order of moving organizations onto the quadrangle was consulted. 
However, they would not discuss the specifics of this process or of the exact reasons for choosing Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma.
Lizzy Young, the president of the Panhellenic Council, simply stated that the recommendation to move Delta Delta Delta onto the quadrangle was made based on a decision made in the spring of 2007, according to an Aug. 14 e-mail to the leaders of Greek organizations.
Regardless of the specifics of the decision process by which these two sororities were chosen, it is clear that the university is looking to reduce the potential opportunity for underage alcohol incidents and any associated liabilities on the quadrangle. 
Kappa Delta Rho, if chosen to move back onto campus in the future, was recommended by Tucker to “return as an alcohol-free organization.” Moreover, Hippensteel and Bebie acknowledged the rule (which exists at a national level) that disallows sororities from providing alcohol. “Sororities are farther along and more responsible,” Bebie said. Some of these organizations have 100,000 to 300,000 members internationally, and “insurance premiums go [up]  with alcohol.”
Saris, Theta Xi’s president, echoed this rationale. “Overall I think there will be a grand shift from fraternity life as we know it.... We felt that it was a privilege to have social events where people could come, meet us, meet others.... I think that because of legal implications against our fraternity and the university, this has become too big of a risk and thus this aspect of [Greek life] is on its way out.”

On Friday, August 28, Rangos Ballroom was the site of a social mixer called H&SS Connect: Live, bringing the students in Carnegie Mellon’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences together for a night of giveaways, free food, and DJ YS on the 1s and 2s.
Unlike other colleges on campus, H&SS students have a wide range of specialties and career goals, so it is difficult for students of different majors, although within the same college, to meet each other. Most of the time, H&SS students are only able to bond with students who have the same or a similar major.
Nicole Ifill, a sophomore information systems major, identified this lack of connection as a serious problem within the college and decided to do something about it. Ifill said, “We’re very diverse. We needed a unifying event. We wanted to do something like this last semester, but everyone’s schedule was too hectic.”
Ifill did not let that stop her from fulfilling this need. She decided to spend her summer planning an event for the fall. She approached other H&SS students to help with the event, created a Facebook group to promote it, and did most of her planning over the phone and by e-mail to ensure it would be a success.
“I’m pretty proud because we didn’t have much time and it still turned out great,” Ifill said. “We want to instill H&SS pride and create a community amongst students of different majors.”
And according to many of the students who attended, it was a success. Aurelia Henderson, a first-year creative writing major, was among the students who attended.
“It’s nice meeting a diverse group of people,” Henderson said, “people who are multi-cultural and multi-faceted. It makes me happy to know that I’m part of a community that is so passionate about so many different things.”
Yulin Kuang, a sophomore creative writing and global politics major said, “I got to meet a lot of the [first-years], which is nice because it’s always nice to bond with new people.”
Ifill approached Gloria Hill, the assistant dean and director of the Academic Advisory Center, and Renee Camerlengo, the associate dean of student affairs, at the end of the spring semester and pitched the idea. 
She told them that she felt a divide within the college and that she had thought of a way to begin closing it.
Hill was more than willing to offer her support.
“I was very, very excited when Nicole came to us,” Hill said. “We are working hard to build a community within the college. We want H&SS students to feel great about being here.”
Hill also said that they hope to have two similar events per semester to ensure that they sustain the community that they have begun to build. 
They even provided a suggestion box to allow students to share their ideas about what the next event should be. This may be the first mixer of this kind for H&SS, but Ifill and Hill insist it is not the last.
Whether they be one of the people who thought of, planned, and presented H&SS Connect, or one of the students who was bonding with people they may have never met, all participants can sense the excitement everyone feels about this new venture.
Crystal Wray, a sophomore economics and Chinese major said, “I think it’s great that they’re doing this because H&SS is such a diverse [college]. We really needed something like this to bring all of our interests together.”

Social networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace, have become a big part of teenagers’ and college students’ lives. It is one of the main ways of keeping in touch and communicating with each other. Twitter, a more recent social networking site, is steadily gaining popularity since its launch in 2006. Unlike Facebook or MySpace, Twitter attracts a significantly older age group. Here are some statistics about Twitter:
The largest age group on Twitter: 35–49 
Percent of daily unique visitors between the ages if 35 and 49: 41.7 
Number of teenagers visiting Twitter daily: 250,000
Percent of users accessing Twitter from a work place: 62
Percent of growth of Twitter users from 2008 to 2009: 1382

Title: University Lecture Series — Great Decisions: Cuba after Castro
The Basics: This Great Decisions lecture is part of the Passport to Global Awareness course and will be webcast by the World Affairs Council. The lecture will discuss the challenges and opportunities in reopening ties with Cuba. Since Fidel Castro handed over the presidency of Cuba to Raúl Castro in early 2008, there have been mixed messages of change and keeping the status quo in terms of U.S.–Cuban relations. 
The lecture will question whether Castro seeks to reopen ties with the U.S. and what role Cuban-Americans will play in shaping a post-Fidel Castro Cuba. For more information on Great Decisions 2009, please visit the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh website.
When: Wednesday, Sept. 9, 6–8 p.m.
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter 100)
Title: University Lecture Series — Global Warming: Doing what the planet needs in Washington, Copenhagen, Pittsburgh, and tropical forests 
The Basics: Doug Boucher will discuss the importance of the next four months in terms of taking action on global warming around the world. 
Washington has the Senate debating on the House-passed energy and climate bill, and negotiations are underway in Copenhagen for a new treaty to make drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. 
Boucher believes the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24 –25 is key for both these events, since it is where President Obama and the leaders of the world’s largest economies could make a commitment to making the necessary investments to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. 
Boucher will explain why part of this commitment needs to be reducing tropical deforestation, which is responsible for about 20 percent of global warming pollution. 
The presentation will also weigh the balance of forces and the political dynamics that could lead to historic steps on climate change in the next few months — or to a failure to act that would have drastic consequences for the planet. Doug Boucher joined the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in July 2007 as director of its Tropical Forests and Climate Initiative. 
He is in charge of UCS’s work in the United States and in the international climate change negotiations on tropical deforestation and its role in climate change. He is based in UCS’s Washington office. 
He has published widely on ecology and forest management issues, most recently in Ecology, Science, Plant Ecology, Forest Ecology and Management, and the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America. Boucher has a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Michigan and a B.A. in ecology and history from Yale University.
When: Thursday, Sept. 10, 4:30 p.m.
Where: Breed Hall (Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 103)
Title: World Poverty: Explanations and Responsibilities
The Basics: Thomas Pogge, the Leitner Professor of Philosophy and International Affairs at Yale University, will lecture on the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor. He will discuss severe poverty in poorer countries and its connection to about one third of all human deaths. Pogge will also focus on what role global institutional arrangements, such as the rules of the WTO Treaty, play in the persistence of severe poverty, and how poverty could affect the responsibility of citizens in affluent countries to work for its eradication.
When: Monday, Sept. 14, 4:30 p.m
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter 100)

In last week's issue, the article "New dining options bring new vendor, changes to meal plans" contained unclear information. The line stating that “...each of the meal plans now allows you to have two guest meals per semester...” should have specified that these meals apply only to traditional meal plans.

Ever since it was announced that the 2009 G20 Summit would be held in Pittsburgh, it was trumpeted as a chance for the city to shine, to show what Pittsburgh was really made of. 
Other than those seemingly important words, however, there is not much reference to how the people of Pittsburgh were to do that. 
Of course, there were the usual complaints about the effect that the G20 would have on many of the city’s businesses due to security concerns—that many of them would have to close down and lose vital revenue for the duration of the summit. 
And also, of course, there were people who told the others to stop whining and complaining, and to think of the positive things that the summit would bring to the city.
Another group of people, however, has taken their own spin on what aspect of Pittsburgh they want visitors to see when they come for the G20. According to a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article, a coalition of multiple arts groups in Pittsburgh — aptly named ARTS and headed by the dean of the College of Fine Arts — has formed to show people what an important effect art has on the city of Pittsburgh and its people.
The article cites a four-part message that the coalition hopes to leave visitors with: Art transforms Pittsburgh. Art employs Pittsburgh. Art “greens” Pittsburgh. Art inspires Pittsburgh.
I really appreciate the different spin that the coalition is putting on what would normally be thought of as a business-oriented event. And it really is the perfect time to show off Pittsburgh’s art scene — the city keeps being told that this could be their chance to shine, and I think it’s great that ARTS is stepping up and taking the oft-heard warning to heart.
And what many people may not realize is that Pittsburgh does have a vibrant arts scene. There is, of course, the Cultural District, which showcases a number of musicals and plays on a rotating basis, as well as the always-constant staple of the symphony. While Pittsburgh might not be a performing mecca on the level of cities like New York or Los Angeles, I have been to a number of shows of all types and can personally attest to their quality. In addition, there are a number of museums for more visually based art. Not only are there the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, there are also lesser-known museums like the Mattress Factory or the Warhol Museum, all of which have interesting and varied displays.
In addition, Pittsburgh has so many small cultural neighborhoods that all have their unique architecture. Two summers ago, my internship took me on a field trip to the Mattress Factory, and I discovered that a block or two away from the museum were a few beautifully painted and decorated houses. 
I was so surprised to learn that something so unique and beautiful existed on a random block in a random neighborhood. Because Pittsburgh is inhabited by people of different cultures that originally tended to form neighborhoods to stick together, cultural landmarks can be found all throughout the city.
Carnegie Mellon also got a specific mention in the article, where it stated that our architecture program is ranked number one in terms of teaching sustainable design, in reference to the coalition’s message that art “greens” Pittsburgh.
What impresses me most about the coalition’s efforts, however, is their perseverance and dedication to their cause. Because of the still-undecided security measures that loom in the city’s future, many businesses in the area are planning on just closing completely to cut their losses (and, of course, complaining about it). ARTS, on the other hand, is taking the exact opposite approach. 
They are hoping to keep as much open as possible; they understand that in order for the city to be seen in the best way possible, it needs to seem alive, not like a ghost town with numerous closed businesses.
And the list of what ARTS hopes to have going on during the summit is actually quite extensive. 
The Post-Gazette article lists maintaining regular hours for the Liberty Avenue art galleries and the Wood Street galleries, as well as Space, another gallery; free performances at the plaza at Seventh St. and Penn Ave.; and performances by an Indian dance group, a flamenco dancer, and singers from the Pittsburgh opera.
So while most Pittsburgh residents and G20 delegates are focusing on economic issues during the summit, I hope that people are able to take a few minutes off and check out what the Pittsburgh arts scene has to offer — it may be more impressive than people think, and will certainly help to put the city in a better light at a time when all eyes will be on it.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is Forum editor and wonders if she has made her love for Pittsburgh clear yet — it goes way past the Steelers.

Being at home for the summer and without the rigor of constant schoolwork putting a damper on recreational activities, it seems almost inevitable that reality TV would crop into the summer holidays. Sure enough, Survivor is back with yet another new immunity challenge, the Bachelor and Bachelorette need to choose their summer sweethearts, and Jon and Kate have separated.
Woah, hold on there.
Okay, so reality TV might not be the most exciting thing in the world, but when you’re stuck without thought-provoking, 10-page essays or massive problem sets, watching someone else raise a bunch of cute kids starts to look pretty appealing. The series seemed to have a good purpose behind it: The parents allow their lives and their children’s early lives to be filmed in exchange for money. Which, when you consider that there’s eight kids to put through school, let alone college (Guess what the tuition for eight kids will be 10 or so years down the road? Try a cool two million bucks), doesn’t seem like such a horrible thing. 
Granted, Jon and Kate want the best for their kids. They have a house that’s probably more than they can afford, but each kid gets more room than they would have had in their last house. Maybe Jon’s quitting his job wasn’t the best move in the long run, but he has more time to be with the kids and do tag-team parenting with Kate. For those that haven’t been keeping up as religiously with their reality TV, Jon and Kate have separated. Both Jon and Kate have their own places, and Jon has even found himself a snazzy little bachelor pad in New York City to entertain various female acquaintances. The new season features both parents working through their separation and getting to spend time with their kids, well, separately.
Now, from the evidence presented above, it doesn’t seem like Jon’s doing as well as a parent as one might hope he would. Kate’s also gotten her share of a media maelstrom for being bossy and an attention hog, but it seems like Jon’s gallivanting about town seems to go mostly unnoticed compared to Kate’s own egregious faults. Curious, I watched a few of the episodes over the summer just to see if what people were saying had any substance to them. Intriguingly enough, I found out that they did.
Kate took the eight kids out to an island getaway while Jon stayed at the house supervising a new cabinet installation. Kate and some of her relatives shepherded the bevy of children onto a boat, fended off reporters hungry for a photograph, and zipped the kids to and from the pool on golf carts. 
Jon, on the other hand, got to decide where cabinets went in a house he doesn’t live in much, if at all. He directed workers who didn’t need much direction, nodding approvingly at professionals who would have been just as well off without him, and commented on their handicraft as though it were so innovative that it couldn’t have been pulled off without his input.
In other episodes, Kate took the kids to a snake and reptile zoo, housing creatures that she’s scared of herself but knew that her kids would find exciting. She even tried to hold a python for them to show that she could conquer her fears and succeeded in doing so. Jon, on the other hand, took the girls out to play bumper cars for an afternoon. It seemed like the activity was something that Jon was having more fun doing that his kids were. In contrast, Kate took the boys out to board a battleship that had been converted into a museum, something her boys loved but would obviously not be her first choice for entertainment.
So you decide. Are the better parents the ones who put their kids before them, even if it’s not what they would have wanted to do themselves? Or, are they the parents who, on leaving their children’s lives, devote their time to their own happiness? When you become a parent, you need to think about your kids’ happiness before your own, and if that means foregoing the NYC flat and sticking it out with the snakes, then so be it.
Alex Yuschik (ahy@) has got to hand it to Kate Gosselin for keeping cool under both python and pudding pressure.

After spending over $65,000 on tuition and four years in college, one would think that Trina Thompson would be smart enough to figure out that America is experiencing a recession, which means she isn’t guaranteed a job right after graduation. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.
According to a recent article from the New York Post, Thompson graduated from Monroe College in April with a degree in information technology. After graduation, she filed a lawsuit against Monroe College in Bronx Supreme Court because she had yet to find employment.
Even if we weren’t in a recession, 100 percent of college graduates do not get jobs right after school. Is this news to anyone? Aside from simply pointing out that Thompson seems to lack common sense, this move to sue her alma mater is another example of a case with no merit taking up space in civil courts’ dockets.
I used to want to be an attorney, to defend liberty, justice, the pursuit of property, and all that jazz; but the pursuit of funds willingly paid to an institution in return for an education, which Thompson received, qualifies as a waste of time. 
Finding a job after college is a lot more intensive than sitting around and waiting to get hired. I wonder what could drive a college student to give up the job hunt and instead invest whatever monies she has left into attacking the justice system.
What does this accomplish? Winning this lawsuit — a far from likely outcome — may give her enough money to pay back loans and legal fees, but she’ll still be unemployed. More than likely, her case will be dismissed, or dropped, or whatever the proper legal term is for not getting any attention; she will be in even greater debt from all the legal fees; her family will be embarrassed and made fun of in grocery stores and at doctors’ offices; and she will have an even harder time finding a company to hire her after they discover she was that college graduate who sued her school and failed.
This case is right up there with the poor, misguided fools who are ignorant enough to put their business out on daytime television and show their faces on Judge Alex: “So you’re saying you stole his car, but you are suing him for not putting in enough gas for you to drive across the country, in his car?” “Yes, your honor.”
In Thompson’s defense, I can understand her frustration and desperate need to form a course of action, follow through, and see results. 
I’ve met plenty of college graduates who, even before our economy began to decline, were struggling to get hired and start their careers. 
People from art and design backgrounds to people holding master’s degrees in satellite communications; all jobless, or at least not hired in a position that relates to the subject that they studied for years (getting hired to work as a truck loader for FedEx at 3 a.m. every morning is not the career most architecture majors see themselves having after graduation).
Personally, I would have been a little angry, even bitter, had I spent so much time, energy, and money in college (at Carnegie Mellon, no less!) and was not able to find a job. 
But then I would watch an episode of House or TrueBlood, have a few laughs, and then really sit and think about why I am unemployed, because at the end of the day, it is me who is unemployed. Not Carnegie Mellon, or Monroe College. Me.
I would ask myself if I went through every possible channel I had available to me to find a job. Did I utilize the career center? Did I post my résumé online for companies to see? Did I make a typo in my cover letter? Am I applying to the wrong companies? Are they searching for me on Google and finding an incriminating Facebook photo?
I really want to ask Thompson these questions and see if she exhausted all her resources. My guess is, the answer is no. Well, let me not make assumptions. Maybe she really searched and tried her hardest but still couldn’t get a job. At that point, I would’ve told her to go back home. Go live with mom. Go work at Forever 21.
Honestly, a job is a job, and some income is better than no income. But what if Forever 21 isn’t hiring?
Well, then, maybe that’s the point when she should consider going back to school. But what if she couldn’t afford it?
Well. Then. Maybe she should pick up a hobby and keep up the job search. Because, in all honesty, until you find a job, the hunt does not stop.
It is within our genetic code to hunt until we are satisfied, until our needs our met and we are content with our environment.
Now, is filing a lawsuit against my college part of our genetically coded hunt for satisfaction?
No. That is called a random mutation, of which natural selection will hopefully rid the world.

Free speech has been in the U.S. Constitution since its inception. Unfortunately, our forefathers had not anticipated anonymous bloggers.
Most recently, the trend came into the public spotlight when a blogger with the alias PittGirl revealed herself to be Virginia Montanez, only to face the direct consequence of losing her job. 
PittGirl’s blog, The Burgh Blog, criticized her hometown of Pittsburgh, and most notably and without reserve, the actions of the mayor. Montanez had begrudgingly revealed her identity herself out of fear that it would quickly be uncovered without her knowledge by the media.
The fact that Montanez lost her job is just a little bit ridiculous. Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and cast members of Saturday Night Live criticize the actions of public officials and personalities all the way from Julia Roberts to the President of the United States on a daily basis, and make a living out of it. Their messages have been fueled by the same fire — criticism of what these people do, how they act, and why they are the way they are. 
Anonymous bloggers are not the first to go on record without revealing their identities. For centuries, writers have published novels, articles, and other pieces under carefully crafted pen names. And what is a blog if not an online piece of literature?
PittGirl is not the first case by far to cause big media controversy. Some cases of anonymous bloggers have even gone as far as the Supreme Court demanding the blogger unveil his identity. 
The world has so many more problems right now that a Supreme Court case over a blog and a woman losing her job after revealing her identity as a critic of the Pittsburgh mayor just seem ridiculous.
Whatever people are saying about a person or an issue, it means that they care — and in the majority of cases, this should be taken as a compliment.The public needs to learn to appreciate these anonymous bloggers for caring so much about the world to criticize it, and the people talked about need to learn to take the compliment that they are just that important in some people’s lives to be constantly blogged about. Anonymous bloggers are not going away, and the public needs to come to terms with it.

The swine flu: we’ve all heard of it, we’ve been warned countless times about its possible health risks via numerous e-mails, and we’ve seen our school make the front page of local papers because of it. But is the situation really as desperate as it’s being made out to be?
College campuses are notorious for being the perfect places to spread diseases. You see the same people day after day, week after week, and are living and studying in close contact with them. When one student gets sick, it is easy to see how illness would spread quickly from person to person to person. 
When cold and flu season hits every year, it is not surprising to see multiple students in the same class walking around with Kleenex boxes or a group of friends huddled around a library table all sniffling at the same time.
Instead of keeping this fact in mind and merely looking at H1N1 as an example of this common phenomenon, people are looking at the sickness with a panicked, mob mentality — they can think of nothing else other than the fact that more and more people are being infected, and their minds are quickly jumping to think how much higher that number could be in a few days. 
Instead of looking at H1N1 as another strain of the flu —  there are thousands of them —  people are looking at it like some new disease with scary potential.
While people may be overreacting a bit about H1N1, it is still good to take precautions to avoid spreading the illness, and we appreciate the university’s efforts to do so. 
It is clear we at Carnegie Mellon have a more pressing problem than any of the other local universities, since our reported cases are much higher in number, and we believe that the university is doing what it believes necessary to stop the spread of the disease to any more students. By taking precautions like isolating infected students, the likelihood of slowing the spread of the disease is much greater.

Carnegie Mellon has a new dining vendor, and with that new vendor comes better food and additional services to keep the community interested in dining and eating at the various new locations on campus.
According to a recent e-mail newsletter from Dining Services, Carnegie Mellon was ranked in the bottom 10 schools for food by the Princeton Review. Dining Services is taking steps to change that, however, by introducing new eating options on campus.
Even more important than the taste of the food served (which is superior to the old food, at least for now) is the new variety of eating locations on campus. Before, it seemed as if there were only different sandwich shops, but now, there are many more options: freshly tossed salads, comfort foods, a fresh juice bar, and places to eat steak and burgers on campus, as well as plans for an all-day breakfast location and an ice cream shop, which will serve up classics like milkshakes and malts. Even locations similar to old eateries have improved, adding higher quality ingredients and more options.
Aside from this, CulinArt and Dining Services have taken extra steps to keep the campus interested. They have introduced specials, where items are offered at a free or reduced charge at certain locations, as well as both breakfast and coffee clubs, which reward customers with a free item after the purchase of 10. These things take away the monotony of on-campus eating by introducing reasons to go to different locations, and also reasons to stay on campus. (Why bother going to Starbucks for your coffee if you can go to Maggie Murph and get the same coffee with a promise of a free drink after 10 cups?)
CulinArt also has a Twitter account for students to follow to keep up with any dining news, changes in hours, and specials. While it is unclear how useful this will be, it is good that the company is trying to connect with students and keep them informed about dining on campus. CulinArt has also begun offering free hand sanitizer to its customers in several locations, showing that despite a clear focus on food, they still care about the well-being of the campus community.
CulinArt is receptive to suggestions, and with input from students, we think that dining will continue to improve, in both small and significant ways.

Last week, the Dean of the School of Computer Science, Randy Bryant, sent out an e-mail to the School of Computer Science to “give us a review of some basic etiquette” in regards to the newly constructed Gates Center.
Bryant writes, “I am getting a lot of reports from people who are dismayed when they hear a litany of complaints or a lack of enthusiasm” when asked about their thoughts on the new building. His response, in short, is not to deal with these two problems by trying to solve them, but rather suggesting the community walk around parroting phrases to mask the problems’ existence.
Why not instead address that many of the complaints stem from a move into the building before it was finished, and explain the reasons behind that move? Rather than expecting enthusiasm from the community, the e-mail should have looked for reasons for the lack of excitement. 
You might ask, But what if I am truly not enthusiastic about the new complex? The e-mail makes it seem like that doesn’t matter; that as a Carnegie Mellon University community member, you are not currently in a place to voice your own thoughts. The message even went so far as to give suggested quotes that would be suitable for upper administration and visiting guests, such as, “Just try saying ,‘Thanks for all your hard work.’”
This is the heart of this message — “his tips,” which recommend: If you are asked about the new Gates Hillman Complex, don’t explain what is wrong with it, don’t be silent, speak only with complete gratitude, thanks, and praise.
We believe the Carnegie Mellon student, faculty member, or staff member who wants to be told how to say, think, and act is rare. 
This e-mail was an assault on our intelligence; it was condescending, and it advocated limiting speech and lying to President Cohon.
While we are sure that many people around this campus could say thank you more, and could be more polite and more grateful for the hard work that obviously went into the construction of the Gates Hillman Complex, this message was not written with a balanced suggestion of tempering our complaints with thanks. 
It was not written to moderate Carnegie Mellon’s critical thinking and cynicism with gratitude. It was created to silence all concerns with the new Gates Hillman Complex, and instead, it makes them seem even more severe and additionally creates new concerns with regard to the message coming from the school’s leadership.

Many of you have just finished your first week of classes here at Carnegie Mellon University, learned a new schedule, and are already deep in the trenches of your studies. 
Here in the second week comes the Activities Fair, an opportunity to learn about the student groups on campus and maybe even find an outlet to get involved.
With over 200 student organizations to choose from, it’s hard to walk down the many aisles set up on the CFA Lawn and not run into an organization that interests you. 
From online gaming to spiritual fellowships, Greek life to bagpipes and Ultimate, the Office of Student Activities is putting together the perfect place for you to connect with other involved students here.
So I’m here to encourage you to pursue those opportunities — my time here has been so enriched by the experiences had with student activities. 
I’ve had access to cover the Presidential election season from behind the barricades and been given the opportunity to spend a week as a missionary in Ecuador — all the while alongside my peers that I learned to see as so much more than students.
Let’s take The Tartan as an example — putting a newspaper together is so much more than reporting and photography. 
We have amazingly skilled layout and production staff members, copy staff — who are students who edit all of our articles — those who maintain our network of computers and award-winning website, and business and advertising teams that keep our free newspaper showing up for you every week.
The experience of working together with such high-caliber individuals has been both educational and rewarding — you’ll find this in a whole array of organizations manning tables on Wednesday. 
Whether that experience results in a hilarious TV program, a stunning fashion show, or just an opportunity to be with others that you have a good time with, getting involved in a student organization is an essential part of the college experience.
So come out Wednesday afternoon and swing by some of our tables — we’d love to meet you and get you plugged in here on campus.
