The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team took the court on Saturday to face off against the Saint Francis University Red Flash, an NCAA Division I opponent. The discrepancy in division might bring one to think that the Division III Tartans took the fall in this seemingly David vs. Goliath matchup, but the Tartans ended up emerging victorious in a landslide 6–1 victory, improving their record to 4–1, and bumping the Red Flash down to 5–2.
Carnegie Mellon completely dominated doubles play as the duo of seniors Yuvraj Kumar and Abhishek Alla were the first to taste victory in third doubles, winning the first slot 6–4. The first-year tandem of Vayum Arora and Daniel Levine took control of first doubles to win 7–6 (7–2), while the Tartan’s third pair of sophomore Jeffrey Chen and junior Kenny Zheng won 6–3 in second doubles. The Tartans moved into singles play feeling very confident that they could continue the sweep.
Levine was the first to finish singles play, and took the set 6–1, 7–5 in the second position to maintain the Tartans’ healthy lead over the Red Flash. Junior Kunal Wadwani won in fifth singles with a 6–1, 7–6 (7–5) score to bring the Tartans to a strong 3–0 advantage. Zheng clinched the match in third singles with a hard-fought 6–4, 5–7, 7–6 (7–3) victory. Arora took the victory in fourth singles with a score of 6–4, 5–7, 6–3, and sophomore Tommy Cheng won in sixth singles, 6–2, 6–3.
This dominating performance against a team placed two divisions higher than the Tartans shows that the men’s tennis team is a real contender for national ranking, and they are going to continue to improve on their current No. 11 rank through consistent hard work and practice.
On Sunday, the Tartans suffered a tough loss to Division I opponent Youngstown State, 4–3. Their next competition will be against Pomona-Pitzer at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio on Friday, Feb. 19 as they look to come back from this week’s loss.
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team improved its record to a perfect 6–0 on Saturday in a match against NCAA Division I opponent Saint Francis University. The Tartans emerged victorious with a score line of 5–2, earning the doubles point and then going on to win the first four singles match in a show of incredible athletic prowess.
First-year Minami Makino and sophomore Cori Sidell worked together in first doubled to take the victory 6–1, while junior Nicholle Torres and senior Abbey Hamstra similarly dominated their match in third doubles with a score of 6–2.
The first to finish singles play for the Tartans was Sidell, who took the match in the second slot by a core of 6–4, 6–2. Torres followed her to win by the same score, improving the team’s lead to 3–0. Senior Brooke Tsu took the match point at first singles in a nail-biting come from behind win in the third set, winning with a score of 6-2, 3–6, 6–4.
The next challenge for the Tartans comes on Friday, Feb. 19, as they take on another Division I opponent, Duquesne University. The Tartans will look to continue to improve their rank against Duquesne before playing in the ITA Division III National Indoor Championship the following week. If the Tartans keep this up, they’re on track to run the gauntlet and become a force to be reckoned with on a national level.

Losing the Super Bowl is never a good feeling, and being the immediate reason why your team lost the Super Bowl is even worse. For Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, the postgame press conference proved to be too much, especially with Broncos cornerback Chris Harris celebrating at his own conference right behind Newton. After three minutes giving mostly short answers to media questions, Newton abruptly left the press conference as Harris boasted how the Broncos shut down the Panthers’ offense. On Tuesday, Newton held a press conference that lasted over seven minutes, addressing his behavior after the Super Bowl among other topics. “I’ve had a lot of time to think about it. I’ve seen so much blown out of proportion. At the end of the day when you invest so much time, when you sacrifice so much and things don’t go as planned, I think emotions take over. I think that’s what happens,” Newton said.
To be fair to Newton, postgame interviews never feel good after a loss, especially when it’s the Super Bowl. Panthers head coach Ron Rivera was sympathetic to Newton. “What we’re asking people to do in a stressful situation after a very difficult situation is to gather our composure and step up right away,” Rivera said. “I’m not sure how fair that is. I’m really not. And he’s not the only player that’s ever been through a situation like that and handled it like that.” He had handled himself with composure after the game, and offered congratulations to the Broncos in a show of good sportsmanship. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning spoke glowingly about Newton in a Monday interview on The Today Show. “He was very nice to me, and I really appreciated that,” Manning said. “He’ll be back in that game, I can promise you. I’ve been on that side of it. It is tough, it is not an easy pill to swallow. But he was very nice to me and I really appreciated that.”
Still, Newton’s stoicism on the field, which some have noted was more than Manning showed following his own loss in Super Bowl XLIV against the New Orleans Saints, does not excuse his actions at the press conference. Newton’s position as the face of the Carolina Panthers demands that he sit there and take what the media gives him. Scott Fowler, a writer for The Charlotte Observer noted that Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood had taken a full half hour of questioning after his missed field goal gave the New York Giants a 20–19 victory over the Bills. “That’s the way a pro does it,” Fowler wrote. “No one wants to answer questions after you just lost the biggest game of your life, but that’s part of why you are paid millions to play a kids’ game.”
Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders was not a fan of how Newton handled himself in the press conference. “You’re opening yourself for more criticism, because everybody is going to say you’re dabbing and smiling and smiling and styling,” Sanders said. “So this is how you go out when you lose?” Hall of Fame quarterback and ESPN analyst Steve Young had similar remarks about Newton. “ You’re the guy that’s going to be the face of the franchise, you’re the face of the NFL going forward, you were the dabber,” Young said. “This is the moment to actually show that resilience on the other side.”
It’s not as if Newton is incapable of giving positive responses to the media after a loss. Following the 20–13 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Dec. 27 that ended their strong hopes of a perfect season, Newton gave stoic and composed responses of how he was responsible for the loss, how his teammates played their hearts out, and how the Panthers would continue to win. Though the scale of the Super Bowl is much larger than one game against the Falcons, Newton still needs to compose himself with the patience expected from a quarterback who took his team from a losing season the year before to the Super Bowl. Newton needs time to recover from the biggest defeat of his career. If he truly learns from the whole experience, he will come back next season in full force as the leader his team needs.

The fallout of the Zika virus as Brazil hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics depends on a lot of factors, but based on historic results, there a few ways Olympic crises usually work themselves out. Of course, this all depends on what scale the Zika virus continues to spread, and how severe its impact turns out to be. 
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), common symptoms of the virus are a fever, rashes, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. While a combination of these symptoms sounds unpleasant, the ailments are hardly deadly.
The real issues stem from how easily Zika spreads undetected, and whether or not it causes birth defects. It seems more and more likely that women who get Zika while pregnant are likely to have children with birth defects, most notably a brain defect called microcephaly, which can cause lifelong problems for the infants, and frequently results in death.
Brazil, the most heavily impacted country, has reported over 4,000 cases of microcephaly with potential ties to Zika. While the link between Zika and microcephaly hasn’t been confirmed, the jump in cases in countries with the virus points to a connection. So what will Brazil do? In the past, there has been a general ‘the show must go on’ mentality with the Olympic games. With the exception of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 games, which were cancelled because of the World Wars, every games has been run as planned independent of external forces.
So if the show goes on, how will it go? Looking back to the cost overruns of the 2014 World Cup hosted by Brazil (FIFA admits a cost of upwards of 15 billion USD), there is already cause for concern. Even without the complications of a birth defect causing virus, cost overruns have been a consistent problem for first time hosts of the Olympics, with the Sochi games having an estimated cost upward of 50 billion USD.
While cost overruns and runaway price tags are certainly an issue, the games have always run as planned through financial issues. With steep costs at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and at the Montreal Olympics in 1976, events ran as planned and only after were the hosts left trying to recoup their losses.
Besides high costs, the default problem for an Olympic games is boycotting countries. Past historic boycotts have come from border disputes, apartheid protests, Cold War political statements, and even smaller regional disputes. While the last boycott was by North Korea in 1988, this option has often been taken advantage of, with seven boycotts held in the last 16 games.
This leaves the question of what it would take for the Zika virus to cause any form of boycott. To date, there are about 35,000 estimated cases of the virus in Brazil, many of which are not confirmed. In contrast, the CDC estimates that there were 60.8 million cases of the H1N1 flu virus in the United States during the 2009-2010 outbreak. For Brazil to have a proportionally large outbreak, there would need to be about 40 million cases of the Zika virus. However, if the correlation between the Zika virus and birth defects is confirmed, the picture would be different for the Zika virus. But which countries would boycott the games?
Since Zika is very difficult to contain in areas with mosquito populations and subpar medical systems, African and Southeast Asian countries where the disease could quickly spread have reason to consider caution. The island countries around the South China Sea are especially vulnerable, given past problems in these areas containing yellow fever, a disease spread by the same mosquito breed as Zika.
In addition to facing the prospect of intercontinental boycotts, Brazil may see countries close to home choose not participate. El Salvador, a small country south of Guatemala in central America, has asked its population to avoid having children until progress is made battling Zika. Could they go the next step, and ask people not to go to Brazil?
Even if a country isn’t worried about bringing Zika back from Brazil, they may prefer to keep the focus on combating the disease, instead of turning to the Olympic games. Take Columbia, which estimates 30,000 cases of its own. While an official boycott of the Olympic games may not be necessary, another Zika-hit country could easily choose not to participate in order to focus national efforts on the problem at hand.
With Zika becoming a bigger issue each day in Latin America, there are still a lot of options on the table for the 2016 Summer Olympics. But odds are good that most countries will still participate as planned.

Women's Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon women's basketball team traveled to the University of Chicago for a rematch on Friday. In a tough-fought battle that went into overtime, the Tartans emerged victorious with a 93–90 score.
An early Tartan lead dissolved as Chicago mounted a comeback, prompting a series of lead changes throughout the rest of the game. Sophomore guard Anna Novak's two foul shots gave the Tartans a 42–40 lead at halftime, but the game continued to be a battle between the Tartans and the Maroons. Though the Tartans held onto the lead at the end of the third quarter, Chicago made a run that brought a 52–44 Tartan lead down to a 62–61 Carnegie Mellon advantage. Chicago took a 70–69 lead in the fourth quarter and threatened to keep the Tartans down. With 6.1 seconds left and down 79–77, junior guard Jackie Hudepohl broke free and earned the tying basket with 1.5 seconds left. Senior guard Lindsay Poss made the first shot for the Tartans, and they never relinquished the lead.
Hudepohl led the team in scoring, amassing 23 points along with 11 rebounds for her fifth double-double of the season. Poss contributed 21 points, junior center and forward Lisa Murphy gave 17, and senior forward Liza Otto added 10. First-year guard Jenn Mayberger became Carnegie Mellon's single season assist leader. Her current total of 119 eclipsed the mark of 117 set by Jeanine Megahan in 1992-93.
On Sunday, the Tartans lost to the No. 10 ranked Washington University in St. Louis by a score of 57–54. After a tight first quarter that the Bears led 11–8, the Tartans started to pull away in the second and third quarters. Though they held a 14 point lead with 8:50 left in the game, Washington University managed to mount a comeback. The Bears took advantage of the Tartans' 28 turnovers in the game, and overtook the Tartans as time ticked away. Down by one with 11 seconds left in the game, Otto made the risky decision to foul against the Bears, putting the Tartans behind by three but giving them one last chance with the ball. Poss tried her best on a three point field goal, but the shot missed and ended the Tartans' hopes.
Otto led the team in scoring, making a career-high 25 points for the Tartans. Murphy and Hudepohl contributed 11 and 10 rebounds, respectively.
The Tartans are now 16–6 overall and 5–6 in the UAA. The Tartans will next face off against Emory University on Friday, Feb. 19.
Men's Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men's basketball team faced off against the University of Chicago for the second time this season. The Tartans fell to the Maroons 94–59.
Though the first 17 minutes of play saw neither team gain a lead of more than three points, Chicago closed the half with 11 unanswered points, and the Tartans were never able to recover. Junior center Chris Shkil led the team with 13 points and seven rebounds.
On Sunday, the Tartans took on Washington University in St. Louis, falling 80–75. After the Bears built a 15–10 lead in the first four minutes of play, the Tartans went on a 9–2 run, earning their only lead of the game. The Bears went on a run of their own, leading to a 44–35 advantage for the home team. The Tartans fought to the very end, coming as close as 70–69 with 2:03 to play before the Bears finished off the Tartans with five consecutive points. Junior forward Jack Serbin became the 19th Tartan to reach 1,000 points in his career. Serbin etched 21 points and 12 rebounds to record his 13th double-double of the season. Shkil had 21 points and nine rebounds.
The Tartans are now 9–13 overall and 2–9 in the UAA. The Tartans will face Emory University at home on Friday, Feb. 19.

New Hampshire has had its say in the presidential primaries, and a few more candidates have decided to call it quits.
On Wednesday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie finally decided to exit the race following his sixth-place finish in New Hampshire. Once a highly sought-after candidate in 2012, and a meteoric star after his reelection in 2013, Christie has undergone more scrutiny for his record since the 2014 Bridgegate Scandal saw some of his top aides dismissed. His reputation for straight talk completely vanished the moment businessman Donald Trump stepped into the presidential spotlight. 
Perhaps the most significant contribution Christie made in his campaign was derailing Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL) during the Republican debate on Feb. 6. Christie’s critique that Rubio is scripted was highlighted by the senator’s overly repetitive criticism of President Obama, contributing to Rubio’s fifth-place finish.
Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina also suspended her campaign on Wednesday. Initially placed among the bottom tier of the Republican contenders, Fiorina stole the spotlight in the first Republican debate on Aug. 6. Though she was placed among the lower performing candidates, she emerged as an option for those looking for a political outsider with moderate views. Later debate performances failed to capture her initial spark, and she failed to pick up enough endorsements and donations to remain a viable candidate.
On Friday, former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore ended his long-shot bid for the presidency. Gilmore received 133 votes in New Hampshire, more than 10 times his vote count in Iowa. Gilmore was still eclipsed by candidates who had already dropped out of the race like former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, and Senator Rand Paul (R–KY). Gilmore even lost to a man named Andy Martin, whose claim to fame was alleging that President Obama is both a Muslim and the son of political activist Frank Marshall Davis.
Despite a few more candidates dropping out of the picture, the race for the Republican nomination remains murky. Although the establishment had begun to coalesce around Rubio following his third-place finish in Iowa, his fifth-place finish coupled with Ohio Governor John Kasich’s second place and former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s fourth-place finish in New Hampshire have sewn confusion over who exactly can be the moderate candidate in the race, much like how there was a large debate over who the conservative challenger to Mitt Romney would be in the last election cycle. Rubio, Kasich, and Bush all have reason to believe they should remain in the race, but the political reality is that the Republican nominee will be either Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX) or Trump unless two of them suspend their campaigns soon.
For Cruz, his third-place finish despite a lack of campaigning in New Hampshire solidified his position as the conservative choice for the Republican nomination.
The clock is ticking for neurosurgeon Ben Carson, the last voice trying to appeal to Republican voters as the true conservative of this election cycle.
Trump stands in a category all to himself, and his power in the race has completely turned the Republican nomination process upside down. Should moderate Republicans continue to remain divided among Rubio, Kasich, and Bush, the chances of a brokered convention will continue to increase, a prospect that should delight the Democrats.

During this presidential election, one of the key differences between the candidates — within and between parties — has been the ways in which each wants to reform immigration. While many of the proposals are similar, the details of immigration policies can be the difference between families being ripped apart, jobs for millions of citizens, and even life or death. Long story short, this is an extremely important issue to keep track of throughout this election. To that end, here are some brief summaries on each candidate’s immigration policy:
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush
Bush believes in further securing the southern border;.However, he believes fencing is useless and creates a barrier to legal commerce. Instead, he wants to expand border patrol’s powers, particularly their access to waterways along the border, and implement an e-verify system that would force employers to immediately check the work eligibility of their workers upon hiring or expanding H1-B visas for highly skilled workers. Bush also believes people in the country illegally ought to be able to work towards legal status but not necessarily citizenship.
Retired Neurosurgeon Ben Carson
Carson feels that through a double fence, prosecution of all first time offenders, and certain technologies, the border could be secured within one year. He also wants to tie all benefits of United States residency to legal citizenship. People without criminal records would be allowed to remain as guest workers but forced to pay a tax penalty.
Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX)
Cruz vows to build a wall along all of the southern border and to replace all single fencing, saying he will get corporate bankruptcy enthusiast Donald Trump to pay for it. He also wants this wall to be law enforcement-accessible and reinforced by technology including cameras, sensors, and monitors. He also wants to equip the southern border with biometric tracking systems. Cruz has also pledged to triple border patrol numbers with a particular focus on aerial surveillance.
In addition, Cruz has said he will reverse Obama’s “executive amnesty” and rescind permissions to stay for current immigrants in the United States illegally. He also will cut down on H1-B visas until unemployment is lowered (at less than 5 percent, the United States is currently close to what economists call full employment, so it is safe to assume Cruz is talking about a permanent freeze on H1-B visas).
Cruz will also cut off all federal funds to “sanctuary cities,” cities that do not cooperate with the federal government in deporting illegal immigrants who have interactions with the criminal justice system.
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Kasich has said Trump’s plan to deport 11 million citizens is unrealistic and backs a path to legal status for illegal immigrants currently in the United States. In both public appearances and at debates he has said illegal immigrants contribute a lot to America and has seemed disturbed by the idea of breaking up families to enforce immigration laws.
Kasich has backed away from the idea that birthright citizenship should be ended and has claimed that guest worker programs should be expanded to meet the needs of American businesses. Kasich has not ruled out a path to citizenship, but a path to legal status is central to his stance on immigration.
Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL)
Rubio once was a member of the “Gang of Eight,” a group that attempted to pass a sweeping immigration reform bill that included a provision for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Rubio has since backed away from that idea, claiming that it is too divisive in the current American political climate. Instead, he now prefers programs like e-verify to lower the population of illegal immigrants in America. Rubio has said that after ten years (twice the length of residency required for citizenship), illegal immigrants would need to learn English (rather than the official language of America, nothing) and undergo a background check. After passing those two hurdles, they would pay a fine for legal status.
The Trump Organization Chairman and President Donald Trump
Trump famously claimed that Mexico was sending its criminals across the border to commit crimes in the United States. He wants to build a wall along the southern border to prevent people from entering the country unless they have been outstanding, in which case he will allow them in through a “big, beautiful door.” He has claimed he will get Mexico to pay for this wall despite Mexican officials claiming that such a proposition is a nonstarter. Trump has implied that he will impound remittances from illegal immigrants to their families in their home countries to force the hand of the Mexican government.
Trump has said he will triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and mandate e-verify.
He will also force cities to detain illegal immigrants and return illegal immigrants with even misdemeanor charges to their countries of citizenship while defunding cities that do not comply. Trump also wants to commit ICE members to gang task forces in cities.
Trump also wants to make it more costly to overstay a visa, claiming it is a threat to national security as well as birthright citizenship, the basis of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.
In order to keep more work with native workers, Trump wants to increase the prevailing wage for H1-B visas to prevent companies from filling positions with foreign born workers over Americans in addition to simply regulating that employers look for American citizens first before hiring workers on visas. Trump also wants to freeze immigration and green cards temporarily to force employers to look at Americans.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
Secretary Clinton has long been a proponent of immigration reform, backing the DREAM act when she was a Senator. She has proposed a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally and has backed President Obama’s executive action to protect DREAMers from deportation. In addition to protection from deportation, Secretary Clinton has also proposed ending private detention centers which she believes contributes to over-incarceration of immigrant families.
Clinton has also vowed to protect access to health care for all immigrants, particularly children. She has also proposed expanding access to fee waivers and English programs to help more people become naturalized.
Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT)
Sanders has long been an advocate of border security and contraction of the H2-B guest worker program for unskilled labor calling it a “Koch Brothers proposal,” but his focus on immigration has shifted from the source to the result. Sanders finds deportations and detention centers to be cruel and vows to end them and has occasionally had a particularly sharp focus on LGBT immigrants. He has also voiced support for comprehensive immigration reform, though it is not clear exactly what form of immigration reform he supports beyond a “roadmap to citizenship.” Senator Sanders has also vowed to use executive action if Congress will not work with him.
To make things more concrete, in Thursday’s debate, Sanders threw out his past uneasiness with immigration and said there will be a path to citizenship for all people in the United States illegally if he is elected president.

The New Hampshire primary exposed a very deep undercurrent of anger running through the American populace. On the GOP side, businessman Donald Trump pulled out a victory in which he drew more than twice as many votes as his nearest competition, Ohio Governor John Kasich. On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by over 20 points. While both candidates had been leading the polls for quite some time, both managed to beat lofty expectations and, with one of the longest lulls in the primary schedule upon us, create a feeling of disarray in the election.
In the GOP, Trump started out as a seemingly factional candidate with little hope of sustaining his momentum. The Huffington Post put him in the entertainment section, and party elites never took him very seriously, and still don’t. There were very few attack ads run in either Iowa or New Hampshire leading up to the contests in those two states. However, an overloaded GOP field allows Trump’s loyal followers — a relatively small faction of the GOP — to override the overwhelming negative sentiment surrounding Trump within the Republican Party.
The Republicans would do much better to take Trump seriously. After the Republicans were surprised by their loss in the 2012 election, they found that social conservatism — and immigration policy in particular — were keeping “natural conservatives” away from their party. They hoped to leave social conservatism behind, but this caused a revolt within the party and caused very few people to shift toward the Republicans. Republicans may have learned a lot about the opposition, but failed to realize that there are few people within their party who actually agree with their policy platform. Rather, these are people who culturally identify with the conservative cause. They felt completely betrayed when the Republicans abandoned them on many social issues, immigration in particular. This anger has led to Trump basically controlling the narrative of the GOP, which he has been doing for months now.
However, Trump only pulled in 34 percent of the vote, a number generally insufficient to win primaries. The candidate closest to Trump was Kasich, who pulled out a surprising second. Kasich has been running far to the left of both the Republican Party and his own record, but Kasich’s positive campaign has struck a chord with many voters. While this is bizarre — Kasich built up a reputation in the House of Representatives as being an arrogant hothead who would fight anyone — with Trump representing little of conservative orthodoxy and Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX) taking the “true conservative” role for himself, the cheerful tone of Kasich’s campaign could put him in a strong position if former Florida governor Jeb Bush joins New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in exiting the race.
One person in the Republican Party who disappointed on primary night was Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL). After a terrible debate performance, Rubio managed only fifth place in New Hampshire, annihilating his stated “3-2-1” strategy of coming third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, and first in South Carolina. Rubio has to pick up the pieces fast, or the support he has been gaining will dissipate quickly.
On the Democratic side, Sanders demolished Clinton in a state that has been home to some of the most memorable moments in the careers of both the secretary and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. The defeat was not surprising. While much is made of the fact that Sanders won across all demographics, winning all demographics in New Hampshire is like counting to one. Sanders has been leading Clinton among white, liberal voters for a long time. Those demographics match up with New Hampshire, which has one of the whitest and most liberal Democratic electorates in the nation. Sanders’s ability to appeal to minority voters — particularly minority voters over age thirty — is yet to be seen. It is impossible to win the Democratic nomination with such a heavily white coalition, so Sanders has his work cut out for him, despite the impressive win. However, President Obama had a similar problem before his stunning win in Iowa, so it’s possible the momentum from this big of a win could bring many people to Sanders’ side.
Both parties appear to be in disarray after New Hampshire. With such a long, lazy stretch in primary season, this feeling of panic is likely to last long enough to create major shockwaves in the election. With all of its resources, the GOP has been heavily influential in deciding nominees over the past several decades, but the Granite State flexed its first-in-the-nation primary muscle on Tuesday and now things start to get interesting.

Chris Christie renounced his candidacy for president following a disappointing finish in New Hampshire. He announced his decision on Facebook saying, “I leave the race without an ounce of regret. I’m so proud of the campaign we ran, the people that ran it with me and all those who gave us their support and confidence along the way.”
A conservative governor in a largely blue state, Christie struggled both with getting funds and gathering enough support to win the Republican nomination. He was attacked by Bush, Rubio, and Kasich on his state’s usage of the Common Core, the Bridgegate scandal, and his past stances on gun control and abortion. According to CNN, Christie’s campaign strategy centered on his survival in the primary rounds, rather than on acquiring the numbers he needed to win.
Tensions between Rubio and Christie began to rise long before the New Hampshire debate. According to inside sources, Christie planned to issue systematic attacks on Rubio during the debates.
Before the New Hampshire primaries, Rubio himself directly attacked Christie by reading a direct quote from Christie’s press release that implied Christie’s support of Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor.
During the ABC debate in New Hampshire, Christie targeted Rubio’s lack of experience as a first term senator saying, “When you’re president of the United States, when you’re a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn’t solve one problem for one person.”
Christie’s attack took Rubio by surprise. He struggled to formulate an adequate response and thus repeated the same speech he made a few minutes earlier verbatim.
Christie called him out on repeating memorized lines and highlighted again his lack of experience. Rubio responded by regurgitating the memorized lines for a third time.
Christie was forced to withdraw from the race, but he impacted the results of the New Hampshire primary with his attack on Rubio. Rubio, who also encountered difficulties in the latest debate, is working on a strategy to bounce back from both the attacks and a disappointing fifth place finish in New Hampshire.

From The Fast and the Furious to the myriad racing games presently available, hyper-fast cars are a common sight in today’s media. While the portrayal of such technology may be a bit unrealistic in popular media, the technology isn’t fictional and has quite a few real-world applications.
One of the most common applications of a nitrous engine is to improve a car’s performance by fitting it with a nitrous system. This drastically increases a vehicle’s potential speed by using nitrous oxide to supplement the combustion of fuel in a car’s engine. 
Nitrous systems are used in both competitive racing and modulated personal driving.
To understand how exactly nitrous systems work, it helps to be familiar with the workings of an internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine uses the energy released from the combustion of fuel to do physical work, like make the car’s wheel turn. 
At a very basic level, think of an internal combustion engine as a syringe whose plunger rhythmically moves up and down.
The system consists of an ignition chamber or cylinder where the fuel burns, an inlet valve that releases a fuel-air mixture into the chamber, a piston that moves up and down, a sparking plug that ignites the flammable mixture, and an exit valve that expels the products of combustion from the chamber.
First, the piston is drawn out and the inlet valve opens, causing a mixture of fuel and air to fill the chamber. The ratio of fuel to air is especially important for efficient combustion and is maintained by a device called the carburetor. Then, the piston pushes back up, which compresses the mixture and increases its flammability. 
The spark plug then sharply “sets fire” (exponentially raises the temperature in a very short time) to the mixture, allowing it to combust, and therefore push the piston back down again. Finally, the exit valve opens, releasing all the products of combustion, which causes the piston to go back up once again. This process repeats over and over again to “power” the car.
Combustion is the primary driving force of a car, so an increase in the efficiency or amount of this combustion would cause more energy to be released.There are two types of nitrous systems: wet and dry. In both systems, nitrous oxide and fuel are fed into the combustion chamber. The difference lies in how these substances are fed: A wet system injects a vaporous mixture of fuel and nitrous oxide into the chamber, while a dry system injects the two separately. 
Nitrous oxide, also known as “laughing gas,” is an excellent producer of oxygen gas, which is essential for combustion. In the chamber, since there is an increase in the amount of oxygen as compared to a regular air-fuel mixture, there is also more space for fuel. Thus, additional fuel and oxygen increase the amount of combustion that takes place, thereby increasing the power delivered by the engine by half a horsepower on average. In this sense, power is the amount of work done in unit time. Essentially, the faster a car is going, the more power, or horsepower, it needs to keep its wheels spinning at that speed. 
However, this technology is not all fun and games — there can be quite a few repercussions. First, internal combustion engines heat up due to the high temperature gases inside them, so using a nitrous system simply increases the temperatures even more. This increases the probability that your engine will overheat.
Drivers must only fit their cars with nitrous systems after understanding the mechanical boundaries of their engines. The high temperatures in the engine also increase the possibility of early ignition (i.e., ignition of the mixtures before the sparking plug ignites it). This can do severe damage to the internal systems of a car. Furthermore, insurance companies are more likely to object to the idea of insuring a car with a nitrous system attached to it.
Therefore, while nitrous engines certainly improve a car’s performance, the technology comes with its own risks and benefits that need to be carefully weighed before use.

Last week’s Pugwash meeting focused on what technology can add to weapons in the realm of smart guns. The topic was not gun rights, but instead how technology could be used to overcome ethical issues surrounding gun rights.
You may have heard of the Internet of Things, the idea that we can connect objects, even mundane ones, to technology in order to make them function more effectively. When applied to firearms, this can lead to safety features like thumbprint scanners or other locking mechanisms; other potential features are increased capabilities like advanced aiming features or being able to adjust bullet velocity.
At first glance, some of the safety features seem like no-brainers. Adding a fingerprint scanner to a gun would make it so only the authorized user could shoot it, making it impossible for stolen or ill-gotten guns to be used. 
Similarly, adding a safety that could only be unlocked with a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip, which uses electromagnetic fields to identify people or objects, would make it harder for unintended users to fire guns. In addition to just preventing illegal guns from shooting, these features would make it harder for accidents to happen in the home, as children wouldn’t be able to fire guns even if they were able to access them.
Another possible smart gun technology would provide a GPS tracker and a log of all shots fired by a gun, with the opportunity to have an alert sent to the owner of the gun. This would help keep track of where guns are and make it easier to respond to shootings, accidental or not.
However, all of these high-tech solutions come with their own problems. To start with, there is absolutely no chance any of this would become mandatory. All of the older guns without smart tech will remain out in the world, and even if the technology comes to the market, there is no political will to make the smart guns the only gun. Smart guns also cost more, and those with safety features have faced heavy opposition from the National Rifle Association and private gun owners. 
While the NRA isn’t explicitly against smart guns, they are against many of the safety features that take away the very thing that attracts people to guns. Many gun owners see guns as an ultimate defense, as something that they can rely on to stop an intruder or protect themselves. By making it more difficult to use the gun, the technology takes away the certainty a gun offers.
Thumbprint scanners require clean hands and no gloves, neither of which are guaranteed. If a gun owner forgets their RFID chip, then they won’t be able to unlock their gun to use it. Also, if the RFID chips have a large-enough range, they don’t function for their very purpose: a chip in a homeowner’s pocket could allow an intruder to turn the homeowner’s gun against them, or keeping the chip in the same room or same area could still allow children to accidentally fire guns.
Any extra level of complexity in firing a gun takes away from its purpose of being a response to a life-or-death situation. While purely mechanical guns can jam, adding layers of technology on top only makes it more likely something will go wrong. As one Pugwash member put it, gun owners don’t want their guns crashing as often as their phones.
Even if they aren’t feasible among private owners, could these technologies be used for the police? It seems like the answer to that question is no, for the same reasons civilian gun owners don’t want smart guns. If a smart gun were to lock up or glitch and endanger someone’s life because a police officer couldn’t fire it, that would be a tremendous amount of liability on the police department.
There are already safety mechanisms in guns — for example the “safety” — and smart guns often seem to be a complicated, flashy, and unnecessary solution. If someone already doesn’t lock their guns at home, or keep their magazines separate from their weapons, or take any number of simple precautions, then adding something even more complex and expensive won’t help.
One Pugwash member wondered how far society has to go to protect people who seem to refuse to protect themselves. For example, if a pedestrian refuses to look both ways before crossing a street, do we need smarter cars, or do we need to teach people to look both ways? There are responsible gun owners, and they don’t need the safety features of the smart technology, but the irresponsible owners aren’t going to use the smart guns anyway.
The sorts of smart technology that are catching on among gun owners are those that don’t hinder the basic function of a firearm, but only add to it, such as advanced aiming systems, or the ability to adjust bullet velocity from lethal to merely very painful. When trying to make guns safer, techies have to work together with gun owners and understand their reasoning behind owning a firearm. Otherwise, solutions that might seem ideal, end up on the wayside, unhelpful, untrusted, and unadopted.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on smart guns.

Everyone gets stressed, and we all deal with our stress in different ways — meditation, exercise, or eating chocolate, to name a few examples. But new research out of Carnegie Mellon’s psychology department shows that mindfulness meditation, a state of focusing on the present and interacting nonjudgementally with thoughts, may physically change your brain and help you feel better.
Mindfulness meditation is a form of focus exercise that can take many forms, but a common one involves sitting upright with closed eyes and focusing on breathing. When the mind wanders, one passively acknowledges thoughts and returns to focus on breathing. The idea is to focus on the present moment instead of thinking about the past or the future. 
Over the past few decades, research into mindfulness meditation has shown that it helps improve a broad range of stress-related physical health, disease, and psychiatric outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, but little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms behind these positive health outcomes. 
A new study published in Biological Psychiatry and led by David Creswell, an associate professor of psychology in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, shows that mindfulness meditation reduces interleukin-6, a biomarker of systemic inflammation, in high-stress, unemployed adults more so than simple relaxation techniques. 
“Not only did we show that mindfulness meditation training could reduce a health biomarker of inflammation, but we also showed what mindfulness training-related brain changes drove these beneficial health effects,” Creswell said.
For the study, the research team randomly selected 35 stressed adults who were seeking employment. Half of the subjects underwent an intensive three-day mindfulness meditation retreat program, while the other half underwent a relaxation retreat program. Both before and after the retreat programs, five-minute resting brain scans of the subjects were taken. Blood samples were taken before the retreat program and at a four-month follow-up appointment. 
At this four-month follow up, it was noted by the researchers that those who underwent mindfulness meditation training showed reduced circulating levels of interleukin-6 as compared to those who experienced relaxation training.
“This finding suggests that mindfulness meditation training may decrease biomarkers of inflammatory disease risk in populations who have elevated inflammation (such as stressed unemployed adults),” the study concludes. “Little is known about how behavioral interventions, such as mindfulness meditation training, can impact the brain and physical health. We provide the first well-controlled evidence that three days of mindfulness meditation training increases resting state functional connectivity of the default mode network with neural regions important in executive control (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and that these resting state functional connectivity changes statistically mediate improvements in circulating levels of IL-6 at follow-up.” 
Ultimately, mindfulness meditation provides physical benefits along with the psychological ones. 
“Mindfulness meditation is about paying attention to your experience, and I think it helped these stressed out unemployed folks in our study by helping them notice how they were reacting to stresses,” Creswell said. “With mindfulness training, they could take a step back and begin to change ineffective reactivity patterns to more effective responses to life stressors.” 
So next time you’re feeling stressed, take a few minutes and focus on breathing, on nothing else but the present. It’s easier said than done, but practicing mindfulness meditation may change your outlook on how to approach stressful situations.

Brain-machine interfaces are devices that allow their subjects to control external devices using only their thoughts. Using these interfaces, a team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon has found that the brain makes mistakes because its conception of the world isn’t always an accurate depiction of how the world really works.
The project primarily focuses on the process of learning while using a brain-machine interface. Learning can be defined as an organism becoming increasingly able to adapt to its environment. This type of learning is nondeclarative, meaning that it cannot be expressed in words. Nondeclarative information can be skills or certain motor abilities, in contrast to declarative memory, which is comprised of facts and information. Nondeclarative memory can easily be understood as “knowing how,” where declarative memory is “knowing that.”
In this experiment, the brain-machine interface used data received from the activity of the primary motor cortex — the area of the brain that controls the execution of movement — to drive cursors on a monitor. The project involved looking at the movements made by the subject, especially the mistakes that they made. 
Those movements required the subject’s brain to issue motor commands, which generated a pattern of neural activity that drove the cursor. The subject’s brain, in this way, was learning how to perform these tasks and perform them accurately. In this way, learning can also be defined as becoming increasingly able to perform a task without making mistakes.
Researchers found that the observed patterns of neural activity match the subject’s expectation of the working of the brain-computer interface. In order to come across these results, they used techniques developed by Matt Golub, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, over the course of his thesis. 
“We were able to figure that those neural activity patterns are appropriate to drive what the subject thought the brain-computer interface was,” Steve Chase, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, said. “It suggests that one of the limiting factors in brain-machine interfaces is the learning itself. To make the devices work better, should we record more neurons or is there a deficit of learning that we need to get around?”
The brain-machine interfaces work by relating the neuron fired to a particular direction. When recording neural activity, it can be observed that neurons tend to be “directionally tuned”, e.g. they fire more if the subject intends to “go” in a particular direction and less if they want to go in a different direction. 
When one looks at the action potential (an electrical pulse that travels through the neuron to facilitate communication) fired to go in a particular direction and plot the action potential as a function of direction that the neurons are firing in, one can observe a smooth curve. That curve has a peak, which is representative of the neurons’ preferred direction. 
These devices work to figure out the peak of these graphs and understand that when a particular neuron fires, the cursor has to be moved in that direction. As the subject receives visual feedback from her actions, she can get better at controlling the cursor. While there are some broad similarities across different subjects, the particular patterns of activity and the relationship between neurons differs significantly from subject to subject. In fact, there is no way to correlate neurons from one subject to another subject. 
The first step to building a brain-computer interface, is finding the relationship between neural activity and cursor movements, then creating a “mapping” of sorts and connecting that to the device. Based on the data received from the experiment, the team concluded that the subjects would misinterpret the working of the interface and “expect” it to work a certain way. 
Their internal model influenced their learning processes, as they continued to make fewer mistakes as time went on. This project has a myriad of applications; just like humans learn from our mistakes, we may soon be able to observe robots doing the same.  
Rather than having a robot intent of performing its duty and not realizing whether or not it’s performing it well, we may soon see robots who can better adapt and learn to better perform their tasks. “By understanding how to improve the brain-machine interface, we could immediately apply this to telesurgery,” Chase said. A trained surgeon operating in a remote location would have to have a very good model of the device to practice surgical maneuvers. 
One could study the mismatches between the internal models and the machine’s response to train the surgeons to perform that action. 
“[The research team and I] want to understand the relationship between the training that we give and how quickly you would develop accurate internal models,” Chase said.

As humans, we have invested in the development of computers to automate the world around us in order to increase efficiency and the reach of human understanding. While computers can seamlessly make a large number of computations very quickly, the machines are little competition for the the biological machines we find in nature, like the brain. A developing research area in computer science is focused on better understanding biology and using the insights for algorithm development.
Following this path, Carnegie Mellon researcher Tai-Sing Lee, a professor in the Computer Science Department and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), will attempt to reverse-engineer the brain in order to try and reveal its learning methods and apply them to advancing machine learning algorithms. The project will span five years and will cost roughly $12 million.
The human brain is made up of many small units called neurons that send messages to each other through a massive network of electrical impulses. These messages mediate all the functions the brain conveys to the rest of the body, which range from actions such as interpreting the scenes in a video to moving your hand. While scientists don’t fully understand all the intricacies in a neurons’ functioning, biologists have gained a breadth of understanding in recent decades. 
Recent data has been starting to uncover that these neurons are highly interconnected and may even participate in feedback loops, leading to a very complex system. While biologists have been hard at work uncovering the secrets of the brain, computer scientists have been busy with the advancement of machine learning, which has seen a remarkable growth within the past decade. 
The main goal behind machine learning is to use a computer to interpret patterns with the data it receives to generate a computational model and use the model to make further predictions given new data. The models can also evolve with new data and become more robust. Machine learning algorithms have been responsible for many recent advancements such as genomic analysis, the power behind large-scale big data, and even self-driving cars.
Recent development of new technologies has made it possible to collect large amounts of data regarding the brain’s activity, and more importantly, to be able to analyze that data and make important conclusions. One of the main goals of Lee’s project is to create a large data repository which represents neural circuitry. In order to do this, Lee is collaborating with investigators at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, MIT, and Columbia University. 
This repository will then be available for other researchers around to world to conduct their own analysis. In addition, Lee will collaborate with Sandra Kuhlman, assistant professor of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon and the CNBC, and Alan Yuille, the Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, to analyze their data.
A technique already used in machine learning is one of neural nets: algorithms based on simple units like neurons that share information, or in this case data, with each other and make computations. To better understand biological neural nets and their feedback loops, Kuhlman will utilize 2-photon calcium imaging microscopy to record signaling of tens of thousands of individual neurons in mice as they process visual information. 
The modeling of thousands of neurons at a time is a scientific achievement that wasn’t possible a few years ago as only a few neurons together would be monitored at once. 
“AI has gone from failure to failure with bits of progress,” Yann LeCun, director of the Center for Data Science at New York University, said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “This could be another leapfrog."
Using this massive dataset, the researchers hope to unveil intricacies in neural nets. Their goal is to then apply their new knowledge to machine learning algorithms that would enable them to develop a model given a fewer number of examples. This holds great significance for the future, since machine learning is a burgeoning research area within many lab communities. 
The idea being that if we can somehow understand the brain, we can understand how to replicate it, and our machines will become capable of learning on their own. The dual goals of this research project are very in tune with Carnegie Mellon’s interdisciplinary culture.
This research is made possible through funding from the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) through its Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) research plan.

Wintering warblers sing during winter, practice for spring
Great reed warblers flee their European homelands during the colder months to winter in Sub-Saharan Africa. While there, the birds are reported to spend much of their time singing. For many bird species, singing is the method by which mates are selected. However, birds do not tend to mate during migratory seasons, so this frequent singing has perplexed researchers for some time. 
Singing creates a 50 percent increase in energy consumption for the reed warbler compared to the birds’ resting state. In addition, it risks catching predator attention and cuts down on time that could be spent foraging. The dedication these birds give to their musical endeavors  serves to show how important and vital the mating process is. They will go against efficient biological imperatives, such as preserving their energy and staying out of potential predators’ sights just to practice singing.
The warbler’s song consists of a composition made up of 40–60 possible sounds and has been described as “very harsh-sounding and creaking.” While initially expected to constitute a territory defense, the warblers’ winter song is now thought to be a rehearsal for the springtime, so that once mating season comes around, the warbler will be better prepared to woo potential mates.

Babylonians utilized advanced math to chart moon, Jupiter
Ancient tablets recovered from Babylonian dig sites show that Babylonians using geometric methods to chart astronomical information more than 1,000 years before these methods were previously thought to be developed. Many Babylonian tablets are inscribed with calculations relating to the moon or the planets, but these are mostly based off of addition and other simple arithmetic. 
Out of the hundreds of tablets, there were five which researchers took a more in-depth interest in. These tablets recorded what researchers call “trapezoid procedures,” named so because of the references to four-sided shapes with two parallel lines of differing sizes. The tablets were translated by Mathieu Ossendrijver, a historian of ancient science at the Humboldt University of Berlin, who determined that the fifth tablet contained nearly complete instructions for carrying out these trapezoid procedures. 
The Babylonian astronomers were able to chart the change in Jupiter’s velocity over a 120-day interval using trapezoidal graphs. Similar methods were used in the 14th century by British and French scholars, but Ossendrijver says that the Babylonians pioneered those methods. These findings are just one of many mathematical histories which redefine our idea of past-era human intelligence.

Different howling dialects between different species
The largest quantitative study of wolves’ howling patterns was able to define the ways in which wolf species howl. Some wolf species howl more than others, and researchers believe that this could represent an evolutionary thread in the development of our own speech patterns and use of language. This study was also the first of its kind to utilize machine learning techniques. 
Researchers used computer algorithms to create an index of 21 different howl types, based on a sample of 2000 different howls. The large sample was analyzed based on factors such as pitch and fluctuation. Researchers found that the types of howls being uttered by different species, across a range from flat to highly modulated, were largely correlated to the species of wolf. 
Wolf packs are a close social analogue for human social structures, and by understanding the communication patterns of these similar social structures, researchers will be able to “uncover evolutionary trajectories that led to more complex communications in the past, eventually leading to our own linguistic ability,” said Arik Kershenbaum, a research fellow in the Cambridge’s Department of Zoology and the study’s lead researcher. The evolution of communication is a burgeoning research field, bright with potential.

Less apprehension, more reward shown in cocaine users
A novel study, published in Addiction Biology, contains evidence that cocaine users show signs of alternative brain functioning; compared to average people, cocaine users have lower-functioning inhibition pathways and higher functioning reward responses. In the study, cocaine users engaged in a gambling activity while brain measurements were simultaneously taken. Cocaine users showed hyperactivity in the ventral striatum, the brain’s “reward system,” whether they won or lost money. 
This hypersensitivity was accompanied by a strange activation of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region heavily involved in higher-level decision-making and regulating behavior. One of the biggest roles of the prefrontal cortex is to inhibit impulsive behaviors, to which the reward pathway, the ventral striatum, responds well. 
The results showed that cocaine users have a hyperactive reward pathway and a largely indifferent regulatory pathway, which means that cocaine users’ brains do not respond to the adverse effects of their behavior (e.g. losing money). This does not mean, however, that cocaine users are completely driven by reward stimulation and cannot make rational decisions; it simply means that they have higher susceptibility to addictive or pleasurable actions.

Scientists stumped over the origin of unique human trait
Evolutionary arguments can explain many things, but chins are not among them. This question may seem strange or even irrelevant, but if you consider that humans are the only animals with chins, a great many questions begin to arise. “In some way, it seems trivial, but a reason why chins are so interesting is we’re the only ones who have them,” Nathan Holton, who studies craniofacial features and mechanics at the University of Iowa, said. “It’s unique to us.” 
In fact, one of the ways by which archaeologists differentiate neanderthal skulls from those of modern humans is whether or not the skull has a chin. The “chin,” is a bony protrusion of the mandible, or the jawbone. One of the reasons chin-origin is interesting is that it “implies that there was some sort of behavioral or dietary shift between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans that caused the chin to form,” said Zaneta Thayer, an anthropologist and biologist researcher from the University of Colorado, Denver. 
One theory for why chins became necessary is that they help us chew food by dealing with the stresses of chewing. This explanation, however, is not robust, considering most of what we eat is cooked — not difficult to consume. Nobody can form a truly robust theory for the ori-chin of this uniquely human trait.

Unnatural selection causes man-made changes in species
Human activity may be affecting animal populations more than previously thought. Rather than simply eating our fellow creatures, researchers at the University of California Santa Cruz, led by Dr. Eric Palkovacs, are finding that “unnatural selection,” or the idea that human behavior rather than nature itself is causing adaptation within organisms, is becoming an increasingly prevalent phenomenon. 
This new development in evolution is beginning to shape much of the wildlife we encounter on a daily basis. His research focuses on large fish and the ocean ecosystem: since larger fish are removed during fishing practices, the natural population has become smaller because the genes for largeness have been unnaturally “bred out.” 
General examples of unnatural selection are commercial agricultural and hunting practices, which tend to favor the fatter, bigger, better specimens. 
Another example is antibiotic treatments which impose an immense selection pressure on certain bacteria, providing massive benefits to those who can resist. Urbanization is also a massive environmental constraint we are placing on wildlife. Urban environments breed animals able to survive them.

This past Friday, Feb. 13, Carnegie Mellon’s annual Lunar Gala was held in Wiegand Gymnasium. This year was the show’s 20th anniversary, so the hype was pretty grand. With separate teams for producing, modeling, designing, dancing, tech, and others, this event really showcases the incredible passion of Carnegie Mellon students who have spent much of last semester and January preparing for it. But I know that’s not why you’re reading this article. So without further adieu, let’s review the good, the bad, and the downright strange looks that graced LG’s 20th anniversary stage.
The first line, Polymorphism, by senior architecture major Richard Chou and junior art major Katherine Zhao, was described by the viewer’s pamphlet as a collection of pieces that represent “a structural form of data.” This collection featured a good amount of leather, blacks, grays, and metallics alongside hard, metal accents such as a giant, jauntily angled wire cube surrounding one of the models’ heads, and two wing-like forearm wraps, which seemed to hold the model’s arms in place. In all, this was a very solid collection. The geometries were unexpected and intricate, and the overall effect was interesting to watch.
Next, we had Cymatics by first-year design major Anna Gusman and first-year art major Ariana Nathani. Described as “an exploration of the way sound interacts with its environment on a molecular level,” Cymatics displayed quite an intriguing set of patterned pieces. My personal favorite was the first look — an overlarge, short- sleeved top whose entire front was cut into a gorgeously intricate and fluid pattern that struck the right balance between sexy and tasteful. The only glaring negative I saw in this collection were the clear plastic visors some models wore over their faces; they looked a bit like cut-up Coke bottles to me.
Up next was The Barracks by junior industrial design major Linny Tan. Tan’s line was described as “a series
of military-style lingerie that investigates the clash of hyper masculine and feminine in a quest for androgyny.” This collection played a lot with hints of color, using a primarily black base fabric and adding accents of a not-quite-floral pattern. There were many interesting pieces here, particularly a mesh top with a folded lapel- like chest covering which looked very luxurious. Also, many of the bottom pieces were beautifully executed.
Exuviae, a line built around the idea of exoskeletons, featured beautifully crafted plastic accessories, which made the relatively simply blue pieces come alive. Most times with fitted undergarments, they can end up looking bunchy or awkward, but these fit each model’s curves perfectly. This collection was an overall success.
Moving on, we had Dauntless by junior chemistry major Eunice Oh, and senior electrical and computer engineering majors Katherine Wang and Yiru Yao. This collection “incorporate[d] elements which highlight the elegance of a woman and the fierce nature of a warrior.” Dauntless featured a primarily black base garment embellished with some large, structured, gold armor pieces. This collection seemed to be an immediate crowd favorite, with the first look — a fitted leather and fabric cocktail dress with gold, wing-like shoulder pads — earning several hoots and hollers. Overall, this collection had a toe in dynastic style, with bright reds, golds, and blacks, and a toe in Alice and Wonderland, with the rose accents and the regality of many of the pieces.
Next was Abraxas by junior mechanical engineering major Melissa Zucker, junior humanities and arts major Catherine Zheng, and senior architecture major Shanna Chan. Described as “an exploration of the classic female silhouette through abstract mathematical concepts,” Abraxas had a few striking pieces — namely the cut-up black leather dress with huge shoulders and a slight accentuation of the hips, which looked like something straight out of this world. Overall, this collection was a nice sight. 
Imperatrice, by sophomore business major Angela Liang, first-year design major Shannon Lin, and first-year humanities and arts major Hilary Lai, was inspired by Wu Zetian, “the only woman ever to rule China.” This collection played with cute, girly silhouettes, but each piece had a little bit of an edge to it. My favorite of the harder accents were the pyramid accents, placed on the models’ tops in the center of their chests. It was
just enough point to say “I’m coming for you,” but not enough for you to be super nervous about that fact.
Next was Filigree by junior neuroscience major Noa Fineout. Fineout’s collection was a journey for me. At first, I absolutely hated all six of the garments. But when Fineout herself came out to receive her flowers, she was wearing a piece as well, and it all kind of made sense. What I hated about the collection was that it seemed very unfinished and sloppy, but when Fineout came out, with her unsewn sleeves and busting seams, I figured that it was all part of the concept — a deconstruction of these multi-layered, Victorian undergarments. I believe that Fineout’s own garment was the highlight of her collection.
Up next, we had XOAIX, pronounced just like it looks, by senior drama major Becki Liu. This collection, described as a “daydream inspired by the romantic colors of the south of France,” had its good points and its not-so-good points. With the exception of the very first garment — a short dress with a lace neck accent — many of the pieces just didn’t do it for me. They hung a little strangely and didn’t flatter the models’ figures enough to look good, but didn’t break away enough to look very conceptual. This was a miss, in my opinion.
One of the most exciting and innovative lines was Pom by sophomore design majors Emily Mongilio and Lily Fulop. This collection was all “crochet lingerie.” I’ll let that sink in. Blending the “soft, and fun” aspects of yarn work with the “risque and provocative,” Pom was one of the standout collections and took the idea of hooking to a whole new level. This was one of the few collections where the models actually had some fun. Adorned in a rain of pom-pom puffs, two of the models spun around their poms, and this brought a slightly sexy aspect to this already out-there line. Plus, the fits on these bottoms were impressive; as a crocheter myself, I was super impressed with how well the booties were cradled. It was one of the night’s highlight lines.
Next was Decay by first-year drama major Michelle Li. In her description, Li characterizes her collection through the phases of decay the moon experiences. Her collection was earthy and exciting — the first piece was accompanied by antlers. It was a very cool collection, incorporating a lot of late-fall colors and a bomb soundtrack. There were many notable pieces, but the one that I remember best was a huge, fluffy, folded leaf- looking garment which looked at once soft and brittle. Li’s was a very interesting concept, which was executed flawlessly.
Crest, by senior industrial design major Sophie Parrinello, was described as “free-spirited and easy going.” I think that’s a pretty apt description. The fabrics incorporated “traditional Japanese shibori indigo dy[e]ing” techniques, which resulted in a very interesting set of fabrics, which was used all throughout the line. This was the most cohesive line in terms of fabric choices — the indigo fabric and yellow undertones made up each garment — and I’m not sure if that was detrimental or beneficial to this collection as a whole.
Up next was Corpus by junior design major Rachel Chang and junior science and arts major Christine Shen, described as an exploration of “the conflict between vulnerability and protection in human relationships.” Personally, this was one of my least favorite lines. It tried to incorporate some fringy accents and some plastics and whites and beiges, but the overall effect gave me baby’s-first-Halloween-cowboy-costume. It wasn’t quite a success, but I did appreciate some of what they tried to do — the diagonal slit up one of the skirts, for one.
Next was Fukkatsu by sophomore art major Cindy Hsu and sophomore communication design major Sharon Yu. Fukkatsu “means revival in Japanese,” and this collection was pretty lively. With some stunning patterns, the pieces seemed to flow and swim together alongside the Koi fish pictured on nearly each garment. This collection played with geometries and strictness — ranging from sharp shoulder pad wings to slouchy hoods — and I quite enjoyed it.
Exuviae, by senior architecture majors Noopur Suckhlecha, Jenny Wong, and Marnfah Kanjanavanit
was an experience. This was hands-down tied for my favorite collection, and let me tell you why: exoskeletons. “Exuviae are the empty exoskeleton remains...after a skin-shedding process.” This collection featured beautifully crafted plastic accessories which made the relatively simply blue pieces come alive. From a beautiful and realistic spinal cord to some clipped wings, this collection stood out as not only one of the best concepts, but also a great experience. The spinal cord, modeled by model coordinator and fine arts senior, Alex Walker, was the only real reveal of the show; he strutted down the runway and turned around, and I swear, the front row just gasped.
Up next was Erode by sophomore mechanical engineering major Jonathan Lopez, junior design major Zai Aliyu, and sophomore art major Kate Werth. This collection “explores continually changing environments ... through the use of black, white, and an organically manipulated grid structure.” For me, this is a collection that could have benefited from a different order. I think that there was some potential here for a clearer narrative to be told, but I didn’t quite see it in action. Most of the pieces had some bits cut out, in varying depths and revealing various shades of black/gray, and a more coherent sequence might have made this collection stand out more.
Last, but certainly not least, was Sanctum by senior decision science major Sasha Kerbel and senior humanities and arts major Madalyn Gryger. This collection “explores the experience of living with mental illness.” It. was. amazing. Absolutely grand. The soundtrack was completely mood-setting and terrifying, and the second this collection hit the runway, all eyes were glued. This collection featured some intricate beadwork, and nearly all of the models were wearing masks, some more aggressive than others. The first model wore a ripped leather bodysuit and a leather head covering with a ripped cut-out a la Hannibal Lecter. Another model wore a pretty masquerade mask, which I thought was very fitting for the concept, and still another wore a wire mesh face covering, which looked horribly painful. This collection was tied with Exuviae, in my opinion, for overall best collection.
And there you have it! The 20th anniversary of Lunar Gala was quite an experience, and it serves as a stylish reminder of the power of our student community here at Carnegie Mellon.

I have always dreamt that one day I would have a local eatery where I would be able to greet the staff with an air of familiarity. I hoped to know the menu by heart and to be in a position where I could make recommendations with a sense of experience to back me up. I still haven’t reached the epitome of this aspiration, but if I had to pick a place that brings me the closest to it, that place would be Crepes Parisiennes.
During orientation 2014, like many freshmen, I found myself strolling along the lengths of South Craig Street day in and day out. Given its proximity to campus, I felt a need to familiarize myself with the various establishments positioned along the road, and before long I started planning out which restaurants to eat at on those weekends when I ran out of blocks. Crepes Parisiennes stood out to me mostly because I walked down to Craig from Fifth Avenue more often than not, and because of its simple facade with charming black tables positioned outside and a large glass window up front allowing passersby a glance within.
My roommate and I quickly set a date to try the place out, and it has since become our favorite brunch place, so, as you can imagine, I’ve tried my fair share of their dishes. Here are some that I find myself going back for:
Crepes:
The Smoked Icelandic Salmon: This is the first crepe I ever had there and it will always be my favorite. Perhaps it was the sense of entitlement I felt when asking for “Icelandic Salmon” (which I assume is superior to your everyday salmon) that lured me to this menu item, or perhaps the intrigue that arose with putting salmon in a crepe. Either way, I’ve never looked back. The crepe comes topped with creme fraiche and a salmon and chives filling. What’s beautiful about this crepe is the delicate nature of the crepe itself, and the simplicity of the dish as a whole. Like every crepe, the Smoked Icelandic Salmon crepe comes with a light salad (with some lovely mandarin orange wedges and a light garlic-infused olive oil dressing), and not much more. Because the filling is kept so simple, the strong flavor of the salmon really speaks for itself without being overwhelmed by accessory elements. It’s a classic.
The Breakfast Crepe: with sausage, egg, and cheese tastes just like it sounds. It’s a match made in heaven and is very filling, making it great for the meal its name alludes to. The flavor of the cheese was just sharp enough not to challenge the spice of the sausage, and the egg brings a nice volume to the dish.
The Mushroom and Cheese Crepe: is a great vegetarian option. It’s a classic savory crepe that stays true to the quality that the restaurant promises. Don’t be fooled by the name. Yes, it’s a very simple dish, but it’s a very simple dish done well.
On Sweet Crepes: I like to go with simple ones, just because a whole plate of sugar really overwhelms my palette. The White Forest Crepe with raspberries is light and comprised of well-balanced flavors. The intensity of the sweetness from the white chocolate filling is already brought down by the crepe itself, and the raspberries provide a nice level of acidity that cleanses the palette in between bites. I love this with walnuts and the fresh whipped cream that Crepes Parisiennes has to offer with their sweet crepes, and highly appreciate the fresh berries, and other berry items on the menu, that come with each dish. It’s nice to get a break from the canned berries doused in syrup that I’ve come in contact with around campus and at fast food establishments.
Some Non-Crepes:
Tuna, Olive Tapenade, and Tomato Panini: Crepes Parisiennes has four paninis on their menu, but this one is by far my favorite, mostly because of the complexity of the flavor interaction between the tuna and the olive tapenade. All in all, the panini has a rich Mediterranean feel to it, which I really appreciated.
Belgian Liege Waffles: The waffles here are unlike your typical waffles. The waffles themselves taste fresh, not just in terms of how warm and soft they are, but in terms of the batter used to make them. Instead of your typical blended-brand-frozen waffle flavor, I found that I could really taste the different components that went into the batter and feel the synergy that resulted from tasting all of them at once. It was a unique and rather enlightening experience. There are a few options to choose from, but I stay true to my love for white chocolate, so that’s the only one I’ve tried and tested.
Tea Babble:
Tea is one of my favorite things on this planet, and Crepes Parisiennes really helped me embrace my inner tea enthusiast. The restaurant offers a selection of 23 Mariage Fréres tea flavors, all of which I have had the pleasure to enjoy — during separate sittings, of course. There are five types of tea available, so I’ll go ahead and state my favorites and those that I thought stood out for each category:
Black Tea:  Favorite: Ceylon — Orange Pekoe. Stand out: Emperor Chen-Nung — Smoky Blend. This last one is the most interesting tea that I’ve tried from those available at Crepes Parisiennes. The taste is as the name suggests: SMOKY, which is hard to describe. You really need to taste this to appreciate it.
Green Tea: Favorite: Casablanca. Stand out: Thé Sur le nil — perfumed with fruits. The accents of fruit play in this are lovely; it’s a really unique flavor for a green tea.
White Tea: There’s only one White Tea, the Blanc and Rose, and it’s very light and great for people who like the scent of tea, but not necessarily the intensity. Great with sweet or savory crepes. It’s lovely. The word lovely is lovely. Tea is lovely. Lovely.
Red Tea: Favorite: Rouge Bourbon. This is my favorite tea from this restaurant. Red tea has a beautiful rich flavor and aroma about it that goes perfectly with very meal I’ve had at Crepes Parisiennes. They also have a christmas version of this tea called “Noel” which has some classic holiday spices mixed in, and it’s divine.
Herbal Tea: Favorite: The Chamomille is organic, and my go-to calming tea. Stand out: The Dream Tea is a layered Herbal tea in terms of flavor. The flavor is unusual, but pleasant.
Heads Up:
Cha-ching: Until recently, Crepes Parisiennes only took cash, but now they take cards and that has made the lives of so many people better. You pay at the counter before you get your food and your order is served at your table.
Herbivores, Omnivores and Carnivores: This place is vegetarian friendly, carnivore friendly, and had lots of options on both ends of the spectrum. Because everything is made fresh, if you ask for a little modification with your order, the staff is usually happy to do it for you, so don’t be afraid to ask.
Are we there yet?: It’s right on South Craig Street, walking distance from campus. Take any of the inbound buses running down Fifth or Forbes if you’re near campus.
Click, click: Currently, there is no official website, but there are Yelp and Zomato pages that have been set up with reviews, critiques, menu items, and other information. Here they are:
http://www.yelp.com/biz/crepes-parisiennes-pittsburgh-2
https://www.zomato.com/pittsburgh/crepes-parisiennes-pittsburgh
For those stay-at-home days: There is no home delivery option, but the restaurant does offer take out.
Hours: Closed on Mondays
Tuesday to Friday: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Closed on major holidays
21+: Crepes Parisiennes now offers a range of hard ciders that you can pick up for a meal or to go.
Rash Alert: Gluten, nuts, dairy, eggs, are the things I can think of off the top of my head. There are of course walnut-free options for the sweet crepes, and you can ask for some without creme fraiche or whipped cream. The staff is very accommodating, so be sure to ask when substitutes are available and to make sure what you’re order is clear of any allergic triggers.
Ambience: In a word: warm. The interior boasts some lovely aesthetic pieces such as brick walls, framed vintage photographs, some magazines, and a small eiffel tower by the windowsill. There are high tables and low tables, and the staff makes sure that tables are available for customers before they take their order. The kitchen is sectioned off from the rest of the restaurant by a thick counter with glass panes lining the top, so you can see into the kitchen and observe how they make the crepes.
College student friendly?: Of course, but I’ve seen pretty much every age group seated here at some time or another, so it’s a nice mixed bag of customers.
Shoutout: I’d like to insert a quick shout out to David, one of the wonderful people that works at Crepes Parisienne and makes this restaurant what it is. David has seen me maneuver my way through the list of teas, and made some of the most delicious crepes I’ve ever tasted. He’s the familiar face that I see every time I stop by and he’s always kind enough to give me a quick wave and ask me about my day. Thank you David for being so warm over the past two years, and to anyone who gets the chance to see him, tell him I said hey.
Overall rating: 4.5 melons

Sometimes I feel like there is just so much happening at and around Carnegie Mellon, featuring our students and alumni, that it is impossible to actually soak it all in. If we wanted to have the fullest college experience possible, doing and seeing all of the coolest stuff, we would probably have to stop going to class and doing our homework. But we can’t so we prioritize what we like and what we can afford, letting so much fall by the wayside. For me, Eastend Mile was one of those things.
I’ve heard of the band. Two of its members are current students, and one is an alumni. I’ve been invited to their shows on Facebook quite a few times, but, because there are only so many hours in the day, I usually ignore the invite (sorry, guys!). But let me tell you here and now: Go see these guys. Make it a priority to see an Eastend Mile show.
I have to admit, reading “contemporary jazz sound for a new generation” on their website did sort of concern me. It gave me flashbacks to the hours I’ve spent trapped in the car with my dad listening to NPR. I’ve always found jazz, or at least my dad’s jazz, to be so irritatingly dissonant. Perhaps I’ve been ruined by Top 40, or I’m not as intelligent of a music-consumer as he would have liked, but something about jazz has just always gotten under my skin. What really bothers me is that there are upwards of six instruments that don’t always feel like they’re working towards the same goal. It’s like One Direction, several units all going different directions, not really on the same page.
But what was great about Eastend Mile, and what has made me a contemporary jazz convert, is that we have all classic jazzy instruments — saxophone, keyboards, bass, and drums — but they’re all on the same team here. The instrumentalists were all working toward the same goal, and that goal was making me dance.
Holding down the beat on drums was junior ethics, history, and public policy and professional writing double major Dhruva Krishna. To his right was the unsung hero and groove keeper, senior mathematical sciences major Christoffer Thygesen, or Tiggy. When the band originally formed back in 2013, these two hadn’t joined yet. Eastend Mile consisted only of Caleb Lombardi and Roger Romero (COE ‘14). With Lombardi on the keys and Romero on the saxophone, the duo recorded their debut album City Limits, shortly after adding in the beat and groove characteristic of good jazz music.
Because there was no vocalist to hide behind, you really got to hear and appreciate the skill of these four musicians. As someone who cannot keep an actual beat, I’ve always just been impressed by middle school snare drum players. Krishna and Thygesen really did more than keep a beat for the group; they weren’t playing back-up, which I feel tends to happen to rhythm instruments. The drums and bass really did carry as much musical weight as the keys or saxophone. I was very impressed by their presence within the band dynamic on stage.
And since they don’t have a lead vocalist, Romero and Lombardi split the duty. Lombardi took over the emcee duties, communicating with the audience, introducing songs, and giving shout-outs to the other musicians. I must admit, he and his tiny man-bun really were quite charming. But charm isn’t all you expect from the lead of your favorite band — there has to be some kind of swoon-factor. Enter Roger Romero. I can’t remember him saying anything, but he didn’t have to. All he had to do was finger out a melody and we as the audience knew we were under his loving care. Not only is Romero a technically skilled musician, he is basically a modern crooner. During the song “I’m the Realest” Romero descended into the crowd, playing as he walked, and stopping to make some very intense eye contact with women along the way. Not to brag, but I got a slice of this.
What was also really fun about their set was how they used covers. It’s smart to acknowledge that not everyone in the crowd will know original songs, but they will know, and get down to, dance jams like The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face” and a mashup of Justin Bieber’s “What Do You Mean” and “Sorry.” Not only did I have a great time dancing to these, I felt like it also showed the group’s sense of humor. While some consider these songs pop trash, Eastend Mile saw a good beat and an opportunity to please crowds. And Romero did these tunes great justice, firing out the recognizable melodies.
While Eastend Mile does deserve a lot of credit for a great show, I must tip my hat as well to openers, Sea Rights and Wreck Loose, both local groups, as well as booking group Found Sound Music, founded by another Carnegie Mellon alumni and former Tartan staffwriter, Kyle Henson (TSB ‘14). Henson pulled together a great crew and picked a great venue. I highly recommend Cattivo’s beef and cheese fries and four dollar whiskey sours, which both warmed me up on a chilly night.
As much as I was dreading bearing the elements on Friday night to trek to Lawrenceville, the night was all-around worth the 4.9x Uber surge pricing.

I love Beyoncé probably more than the average person. I feel connected to her on such a deep level that sometimes I think we are the same person. Think about it, have you ever seen both of us in the same room at the same time? I didn’t think so. When she released her video for “Formation” the day before the Super Bowl, I literally lost it. 
As someone who grew up in Houston, whose parents are from New Orleans, and whose grandfather is from Alabama, I felt a personal connection when she says in the song “My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana. You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bamma.” Beyoncé channeled her southern, black roots in this song and video inspired by New Orleans. You can call me biased because I am a black, southern girl, but I loved every minute of it.
New Orleans has a special spot in my heart. Not only are my parents from there, but I grew up spending a month there every summer and I consider it my second home. The music video opens with a female voice asking in a New Orleans accent, “What happened after New Orleans?” As she says this, houses are shown submerged in water to recreate scenes from Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst storms that the city has ever had to try and bounce back from. 
Beyoncé, in all her glory, is perched on top of a submerged police car dismissing her haters for accusing her of being in the Illuminati. While Beyoncé is singing, the music builds up as various scenes of New Orleans are shown. Finally, the beat drops as Beyoncé and her backup dancers begin to dance inside a beautiful house modeled to look like one of the many plantation homes in New Orleans.
Beyoncé then goes on to acknowledge that she loves the very things about Blue Ivy and Jay Z that they have been criticized for their black features such as afro hair, big lips, and noses. She compares Jay Z’s nose to those of the Jackson 5, and shows Blue Ivy dancing in a group with two younger girls which is probably the cutest thing I’ve seen all year.
Beyoncé has always received criticism from the black community for being a “sell out” because she presents herself with blond, unnatural hair and because she has lighter skin. This was simultaneously a testament to mainstream media that she loves features that have historically not been seen as beautiful, and to the black community that she appreciates our natural beauty despite how she presents herself.
She also acknowledges that despite her success, she’s still a country girl that carries hot sauce with her everywhere. While hot sauce is not my preferred method of spicing food, I do understand where she’s coming from. Spicy food is the best thing to ever grace the face of the Earth, and I always keep a jar of jalapeños in my fridge that I have been known to put on everything.
Then there is another break in the music as local New Orleans celebrity and Bounce music artist Big Freedia asserts that she is not here to play around. Through the line “I like cornbreads and collard greens,” Big Freedia sends a message that you can still love soul food and be “hood” even if you’re successful.
Beyonce’s success has not changed her personality. While this is being said, Beyoncé shows several scenes of different New Orleans neighborhoods. What I love about this part of the music video is that she doesn’t show the parts of New Orleans that everyone always sees such as St. Charles Ave, the French Quarter, and the Natchez ferry on the Mississippi River. Instead, she shows scenes that aren’t typically seen, scenes meant to represent the poorer neighborhoods of New Orleans such as the ninth and seventh wards. She shows a different side of the city — the side that didn’t bounce back from Katrina despite being home to a majority of the city’s population.
Following this are several scenes of Beyoncé dancing with all-black backup dancers, which only adds to her message of how much she loves her people. The song then switches gears as Beyoncé goes on a cocky, but well-earned rant about how much she slays. She asserts her dominance by saying things like she’s going to take Jay-Z to Red Lobster and she’s going to take him to the mall and let him buy shoes and ride in her helicopter. Typically in songs, men are talking about how they’re going to do these things for women, but I love the way Beyoncé lets everyone know that she is in charge and Jay-Z is just along for the ride.
Beyoncé is then shown riding in an old school style car with her hair hanging out looking like a beautiful, black Rapunzel. The music video then ends with more scenes of submerged houses being shown as the police car that Beyoncé is sitting on sinks with her on top of it. Voices can be heard saying “Look at that water,” which is another allusion to Hurricane Katrina.
Personally, I love this music video. I love the imagery, the bragging, the pride, and the representation of Beyoncé as someone who got taken out of the country, but didn’t get the country taken out of her.
However, there has been a lot of backlash to this music video from white people because only black people are shown in the video, to which I would respond: pro-black is not anti-white. Beyoncé is making a testament about how proud she is to be what she is and to be where she’s from. She does not once even mention white people. Beyoncé is black, let her be black. This song is to remind everyone that despite the glitz and glamour and how much everyone seems to love her, she’s still black and she is still with us during racial injustice. 
I loved every minute of this video and definitely think it is worth the watch. Hopefully it will make some people think that us loving ourselves does not mean we hate white people; it just means we want you to also accept us as we are without conforming to societal, white beauty standards.

Valentine’s Day may have officially passed, but its themes of love and cross-gender understanding continue Monday night in a student-run production of Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues. Presented by Mobilization of Resolute Feminists (MORF), a campus organization meant to spread awareness of feminism and women’s issues, and directed by senior Science and Humanities Scholar Sophie Zucker, The Vagina Monologues will be performed at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 15, in the Cohon Center’s Peter/Wright/McKenna rooms. Tickets are $5 and all proceeds will be donated to New Voices Pittsburgh, a charity representing the rights and health of local women of color.
The Vagina Monologues, rather than being a typical piece of illusory theater, sets out to create a conversation between its actors and the audience about the female experience. In line with this goal, MORF’s production will take place in the close-knit space of Peter/Wright/McKenna as opposed to the distanced McConomy and audience members will be seated in a semi-circle. Rather than passive entertainment and a traditional story arc, The Vagina Monologues is much more about engagement with the themes of each stand-alone narrative.
Premiering in 1996, The Vagina Monologues has garnered a reputation as both a feminist statement and a celebrated piece of theater. The play is structured around a series of one-off scenes, some of which are individual monologues and others are in groups, all concerning the female experience. Ensler interviewed over 200 women to collect material for the episodes. The monologues cover a range of topics stemming from the trans experience and survivors of rape to concerns over pubic hair.
Zucker, who also sits on the MORF executive board, says that while the play is focused on women, one hardly needs a vagina to enjoy it. “Even though it’s typically branded as a feminist piece of theater, it’s really more universal than that. It’s not really about the vagina, but about women’s experiences and how women are defined by their bodies, and that takes on different forms throughout the piece... you don’t need to be a woman or identify as a feminist to learn something from it, and it’s a really interesting piece of theater no matter where you’re coming from,” she said.
The 21-person cast is an eclectic mix of ages, backgrounds, and acting experience. Rather than source from a single pool — such as Scotch’n’Soda — MORF wanted to ensure that they had a diverse cast, so they put out a general casting call throughout campus as well as approached like-minded organizations such as ALLIES. The result is a cast of players committed to the project itself and its ideas.
While it may seem coincidence that this production is occurring around Valentine’s Day, it’s actually quite a common date for productions of The Vagina Monologues. The reason for this is that Ensler doesn’t require that community productions of her play pay for the rights during the month of February as part of the V-Day Movement, a global effort to end violence against women inspired by The Vagina Monologues. An additional requirement of the deal is that the production benefit a women’s charity, which is why MORF will be donating all proceeds to New Voices Pittsburgh. According to their website, New Voices “promotes the compete health and well-being of Black women and girls in the Greater Pittsburgh Region [and] amplifies the voices of Black women and girls to advance Sexual & Reproductive Health, LGBTQ Rights, Health Care Access, Ending Gender-Based Violence, Ending Mass Incarceration, and Environmental Justice.”

Hey Joshua!
I’ve got a little bit of a medical issue, and I’m not quite sure where to turn. I’ve talked to Health Services and even CaPS, but nobody can really understand me like you, you beautiful, faceless man.
I’ve got a recurring sickness issue. It’s nothing life-threatening or anything, but it’s like super annoying. I’ve had a cold for like seventeen years now, and every time I get better, one of my friends or relatives or coworkers or a random woman on the subway and her snot-nosed children will get me sick again. I don’t know if I just have a weak immune system or I’m cursed by the Dark Lord Himself, but I feel like I’m getting really old really fast. 
Since I can’t get any help from medical professionals, I’ve decided to sequester myself and become a monk in the Himalayas where I’ll never have to deal with sick people again, and I can live a long, happy life while trying to find inner peace, nothingness, death, a plant to take care of, or whatever monks like to find. Do you think that’s a good idea? I’d love your opinion, O’ wise one.
Signed, 
Malady-Oriented, Nice Kid Yearning for 
Battling Unusual Sickness, Illness, Nasty Effluvium; Snotty Suzie
Dear MONK-Y BUSINESS,
That doesn’t sound healthy at all! The first thing to do is make sure that you’re eating and sleeping and hydrating enough so your body is healthy and strong. Then, you can start really considering why your immune system seems to be so weak. It’s a very valid concern, but becoming a monk and running away from the world of modern medicine isn’t quite the solution I would have hoped you’d turn to. I suggest really taking an inventory of your own habits and making sure that you have all your bases covered in terms of your own health. If all else fails, drink some orange juice!
Peace, Love, and Puppy Dog Tails,
Joshua Brown

Last Friday and Saturday, Scotch’n’Soda’s production of The Outsiders played at McConomy Auditorium in the Cohon Center. Based on a book by classic American author S.E. Hinton, the story explores themes of gang violence, youth, and social status.
The protagonist is the young Ponyboy growing up in the streets of 1960s Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is a member of the Greasers, one of two gangs in the area; the “Socs,” or Socials, are their rivals. The Socials are better off than the Greasers, and Ponyboy laments the condition of his friends compared to the Socs. His opinion changes after he meets a friendly Soc, Cherry Valence, the girlfriend of Bob Sheldon. Sheldon is a Soc who has previously jumped Ponyboy and his friend Johnny. The action is set in motion when Johnny kills Sheldon when he tries to drown Ponyboy in a confrontation. Dallas, another Greaser, gives Ponyboy and Johnny money and instructs them to flee the city. The rest of the story centers on the perils and heartbreak Ponyboy faces following this life changing moment.
The Scotch’n’Soda production is different from the original in several notable ways. The directors have “reimagined the 1960s as a place where one’s gender, sexuality and race are not aspects that hold one back.” The directors note that although the story has many universal themes, the cast is very heterogenous. There are more people than “straight white boys” who felt pain while growing up. The cast was is diverse, with every group playing a significant role.
Two of the leading characters are played by women, rather than the men in the original; first-year humanities major Anna Beck is cast as Ponyboy and junior music major Bryn Scharenberg is cast as Johnny. Senior humanities and arts major Sam Riordan takes the role of Dallas, now a lesbian who is attracted to Cherry Valence. Sodapop, who in the story is Ponyboy’s protective older brother, is played by Sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Russell Hawkins, an African American; all the while Beck, who plays Ponyboy, is Caucasian. This is made light of in one of the scenes when Cherry comments that she should have known that the two were siblings because they “look alike,” which prompted laughter from the audience.
The set consists of a platform on the left hand side that depicts a drawing room, presumably in Ponyboy’s house. This is the focal point of the play. To the right end of the stage, there is a wall with graffiti and a chain-link fence, which indicates the concrete jungle outdoors. The props work well with the story, even though they are fairly standard. One creative prop used is the fountain in which Ponyboy is nearly drowned by Bob. The fountain, which was rolled out onto stage, had a basin filled with water and a functional spout. While the set does not change drastically over the course of the play, the lighting and sound effects serve to transport the audience to each one of the scenes, from a burning building to a hospital room.
The execution of the play is impeccable; all of the actors are beyond professional and well rehearsed. I can imagine that the props crew is especially meticulous in not dropping any parts on stage during the production, and the lighting is very good at casting a spotlight or obscuring parts of the stage. The vocal performance was loud, clear, and consistent. The movements of the actors are well timed and coordinated, and the overall flow from one scene to the other was consistent.
The story focuses on the theme of coming of age. An emphasis is placed on the importance of shaping the future, as Ponyboy’s brothers encourage him to stay in school and get good grades. Ponyboy and his gang are met with the reality of an unfair and class-based society, and the feeling that they are not treated the same because of their social status. In the middle of his ordeal, Ponyboy learns not to think of his relationship with the Socs as “us versus them” when he eventually gets to know Cherry and the other sons.
The audience had an overall positive reaction to the play. Many of the scenes were met with laughter, cheers, and applause. The more serious scenes were quiet and somber. First-year Shubhangi Bhotika said that the play was “extremely relevant, making me think more deeply about politics, and societal structures in general.” First-year Sanjna Bhartiya called the play “emotional, entertaining, and really well done.”

This Thursday, Feb. 11, Carnegie Mellon University hosted author, historian, and educator William Jelani Cobb as the featured speaker for its Martin Luther King Day Celebration. Cobb, an award - winning writer and Fulbright fellow, delivered his lecture entitled “The Half Life of Freedom: Race and Justice in America Today” as part of a series of lectures addressing the issue of race in America.
Cobb grew up in Queens, but both his parents have a southern background. After attending Howard University for his undergraduate degree, Cobb is now a writer for The New Yorker and an associate professor of history and director of the Institute for African American Studies at the University of Connecticut. “These are interesting times we live in,” Cobb said. “Because I’m a historian, I recognize the grasp that the past has on the present.” Throughout his speech, Cobb connected events in the past to events in the present, and used his expertise as a historian to compare past themes and current headlines. His lecture touched upon events ranging from the Missouri Compromise to more recent conflicts, such as those in Ferguson, Missouri.
While the physical insights of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein may not seem related to the struggles of African-Americans, Cobb showed how they mimic the way human rights has evolved in the U.S. Newton created the theory of gravity, and used that to predict the motion of celestial bodies. However, Cobb notes that his predictions were never quite right, always just slightly off the center of what was factually recorded. Then came Einstein, whose theories gave us the final information we needed to fully understand how bodies of mass react with one another. Cobb states that these discoveries follow the same path as the foundation of civil liberties in that there is a slight difference between the theory and reality. “If we look at these principles as they are enshrined within the Constitution, we can predict how the society will look,” Cobb said. “Yet our society is not quite where we want it to be. There is a nagging discrepancy in America today that does not follow according to our founding fathers’ beliefs, and that is the history of African-Americans in this country.”
According to Cobb, the present mimics history in what he calls “mini EKG’s,” with “racial flash points” that spark up. Ferguson is one of these flash points. So was the Missouri Compromise. These events are not new, nor have they ceased occurring. In fact, upon taking trips to Baltimore, Washington D.C., and St. Louis, Cobb noted that “[his] syllabus had jumped right off the page.”
Later on in the lecture, Cobb talked about the denial of segregation in America. He accused the U.S. of being a “nation of innocents,” unwilling to talk about the prolific and prominent racial issues of today. Cobb shared an anecdote of an area where the hypocrisy of the people becomes clear.
“When we take about slavery, we get the reaction of saying, ‘Well that was a long time ago, that had nothing to do with me, that was decades ago,’ but you know what’s interesting is that people never say that about the Revolutionary War.”
Perhaps the lack of culpability for things done in the past is preventing the nation from moving forward. Cobb is optimistic about the future of this country, as he believes “history favors those on the side of right.”
Overall, Cobb stressed the fact that ignorance of the past would leave the country ignorant of the future, and prevent any possible change that is needed in the present. He ended with powerful messages from Martin Luther King Jr., who was the reason for Cobb’s presence on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. He mentions that King’s message was one of progress, the mantra of the civil rights movement “we shall overcome” meaning that the people would keep moving forward, would keep addressing these issues until there was an objective, just democracy in America.
Cobb is one of several speakers included in Carnegie Mellon University’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month presentations occurring throughout the month of February.

Blood drives on college campuses have soared in popularity in recent years. Over the past few years, posters are often seen around campus that advertise blood donations and there have been multiple occasions where students could walk by Rangos Hall in the University Center and see donors reclining on gurneys. In fact, Carnegie Mellon is one of the leading universities in blood donations, a fact that is especially relevant in a city as medically advanced as Pittsburgh. This past Thursday, Feb.  was the University’s most recent blood drive, which was held in the Connan Room in the Cohon Center from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Debra James Bailey, a scheduling services specialist in the university registrar’s office and Carnegie Mellon’s blood drive coordinator, has been involved with the Central Blood Bank (CBB) since 1988. As a survivor and recipient of blood transfusions, Bailey has since coordinated the campus blood drives as a means of giving back. She believes that though Carnegie Mellon students are highly involved, they stand to gain a lot by donating blood. “By taking an hour of their busy schedules and focusing on another individual’s needs, [the act of donating] should have [students] totally experiencing a high like no other,” Bailey said.
While many people may regard giving blood as a tedious charity, it only takes one hour and is a fairly simple process. In order to give blood, blood drive coordinators advise donors to eat before and after donating blood and to be in good health, all of which lends donors to being in the best state possible so they can lie down and allow a nurse to pump a healthy amount of blood from their body.
While the process is far from fun, the importance of giving blood is unparalleled when considering the impact just one donation makes. For every bag of blood donated, three hospital patients are helped. “A person can have a dramatic impact on others who they most likely will never have the opportunity to meet,” Bailey said. The city of Pittsburgh, recognized internationally for its advanced medical facilities, has a high demand for such donations, given that patients from across the country come to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center for its advanced health care and facilities that other hospitals often do not provide.
The CBB is one of four centers overseen by the Institute of Transfusion Medicine throughout the country. Locally, CBB is the sole provider for over 40 medical facilities in the region. They are also in a partnership with the National Bone Marrow Registry to assist in research and provide components for patients that may need transplants. For instance, the “Be the Match” registry is a program that matches donors with patients. Additionally, CBB is a member of the Western Pennsylvania Hemophilia Center to provide care for those with bleeding disorders. CBB is a vital contributor to the medical profession, and is thus appropriately reliant on Carnegie Mellon’s donations.
Both Bailey and John R. Papinchak, Carnegie Mellon’s university registrar, have been engaged in this program for nearly thirty years. While Bailey can no longer donate blood due to an autoimmune disorder, her efforts with Papinchak have not gone unnoticed. The University is widely recognized and lauded for its ability to give back to the community, and Carnegie Mellon University received an award for “The Top Twenty Corporate Donor Program with The Central Blood Bank” in 2015, along with an additional fifteen awards.
Blood drives take place at Carnegie Mellon University every semester. Information is posted around campus prior to the event. For more information about upcoming blood drives at Carnegie Mellon and how to get involved, students can contact Bailey at dj0y@andrew.cmu.edu.

Last week, various events at Carnegie Mellon University and around the Pittsburgh area were held to honor the Chinese Lunar New Year, which fell on Monday, Feb. 8 this year. Major celebrations at Carnegie Mellon included a Chinese New Year Extravaganza, which was featured on Friday, Feb. 5, for Carnegie Mellon’s weekly Late Night series, and Lunar Gala, an annual student-led fashion show that consistently boasts one of the largest attendance rates for a university event, which took place Saturday, Feb. 13. Additionally, in Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill and the Chinese community of the city of Pittsburgh teamed up to host a two week celebration, which featured a Lunar New Year Kick-Off Festival on Feb. 6, as well as an upcoming Year of the Monkey Lunar New Year Parade on Feb. 21, both of which are open to the public.
On Friday, Feb. 5, over 400 people gathered on the first floor of the University Center to attend the festivities at the Chinese New Year Extravaganza. The event was co-hosted by the Chinese Students Association and Late Night at CMU, but included participation from numerous other campus organizations. Various Asian organizations — including AKDPhi, JSA, TSA, HKSA, and SIAM — sold food from their respective cuisines, in addition to providing free dim sum, a type of Asian cuisine. Dance performances were provided by the Carnegie Mellon group Sahara, a Bollywood fusion dance group, and Carnegie Mellon’s K-Pop Dance Club, as well as the University of Pittsburgh’s FRESA. Additionally, there were musical instrument performances and a magic show. The extravaganza also featured various cultural games and activities, which included writing calligraphy, playing Ping Pong, and a pre-extravaganza dumpling-making event.
Cultural elements were weaved throughout the festivities by the presence of lanterns, the use of the Chinese character “Fu,” meaning happiness, and other traditional Chinese decorations, many of which were brought back from China by students over winter break. In terms of Lunar New Year celebrations, the annual extravaganza is the major cultural event open to the Carnegie Mellon community. Although the Lunar Gala fashion show, covered in this week’s Pillbox section, is a prominent campus event that also honors the Chinese New Year, the actual show is not Chinese New Year themed in any way and is instead a fashion show that relies on the creativity of students interested in fashion, design and dance.
“I definitely believe that Chinese New Year Extravaganza is the most important event during the year in terms of really bringing together the Asian and the non-Asian cultures,” said Ximin “Teddy” Ding, a sophomore math major and member of CSA. “Students from all races, countries and backgrounds were writing calligraphy, practicing chopstick and Ping Pong skills, and having a fun time together,” Ding said. “Scenes like this are definitely a big part of our motivation to keep doing the New Year Extravaganza every year.”
Apart from the festivities held at Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh residents traveled to Squirrel Hill where they enjoyed an afternoon of live dance and music performances at the Lunar New Year Kick-Off Festival, which featured the Pittsburgh Steel Dragon acrobatic lion dance team, the Pittsburgh Taiko Drummers, the Organization of Chinese Americans Cultural Youth Dance Ensemble and Tzu Chi Academy, Pittsburgh Chinese School, Silk Elephant Thai dancers, Oom Yung Doe Martial Arts, U.S.A. Pro Karate, and the Yanlai Dance Academy, as well as performances on the guzheng and hulusi, two types of Chinese instruments. The festival also featured arts and crafts such as origami, Chinese astrology coloring, dumpling making, paper lanterns, calligraphy, and painting.
The upcoming Year of the Monkey Lunar New Year Parade will take place on Murray Avenue from 11 a.m. to noon on Feb. 21, and will feature costumes, music, a marching band, and traditional Chinese and Thai dragons. From Feb. 6 to Feb. 21, participating Squirrel Hill restaurants and cafés will also offer a 10 percent discount via the “Passport to Asian Eats” program, as part of the celebration.

Earlier in the semester, the Carnegie Mellon community was notified that there would be a 3.2 percent tuition increase for students, which would take effect for the 2016-2017 academic year. Upon further inspection, many noticed that the separate fees that contribute to the total cost of tuition varied in how much their prices increased. The most notable disparity was the drastic increase in the transportation fee, which will spike from its current standing at $150 to $180, totaling to a 20 percent jump. In response to concerns and questions posed by the Carnegie Mellon community, The Tartan sat down with Gregory Billy, director of campus services and director of risk services, and Michelle Porter, director of parking and transportation services, to understand the cause of the transportation fee increase.
In order to understand the factors that resulted in the 2016-2017 transportation fee increase, it is important to understand exactly what this fee covers. Billy broke down the factors contributing to this fee by noting that 2.4 percent of the fee is directed towards all the campus shuttles, with the exceptions of Bakery Square, while another 0.6 percent is directed towards the administrative cost of managing transportation. Unsurprisingly, the remaining 97 percent of this money is directed towards the Port Authority of Allegheny County bus services that carry students all around the Pittsburgh area.
What many current students aren’t aware of is the relative newness of the card tapping system that is used in Port Authority transit today. From 2002-2012, Carnegie Mellon University was engaged in a contract with Port Authority which allowed students to engage in this mode of transportation for a flat rate which was paid by the university. “The university paid a flat rate, students got on the bus, and the bus driver had a little clicker that counted how many students from Carnegie Mellon rode the bus,” Billy said. As the Port Authority prices increased, so did the flat rate paid by the university.
In 2012, however, Carnegie Mellon University entered into a new contract with the Port Authority of Allegheny County, with the awareness that there would be two major changes. “At that time, it was known that Port Authority would increase rates and also switch to this new technology,” Billy said. This “new technology” referred to the card tapping system that allows students to tap their ID card to ride the bus, a major change from the clickers that were previously used by the bus drivers. The efficiency of this new technology led to more precision when taking into account just how many Carnegie Mellon students were taking advantage of the bus services. As it turned out, the previous method used by Port Authority bus drivers actually under-counted the number of Carnegie Mellon students that rode the bus and exactly how much the average student would use the bus services per year. According to Billy, information gathered from this new system concluded that “the average student rides the bus 135 times a year,” which showed “40 percent more ridership than had been projected” when compared to the old system.
The precision of the new card-tapping technology also led to more precision in the amount of money that Carnegie Mellon would pay to allow students to use the Port Authority bus services. Instead of paying a flat rate to Port Authority, which had been implemented in the old contract, the 2012 agreement between the university and Port Authority stated that the university would pay half of the normal bus fare for students. The regular bus fare for Port Authority is $2.50, but with the aid of the university, students would only have to pay $1.25 per ride. Taking into account that the average student rides the bus about 135 times a year, this number times $1.25 resulted in the final transportation fee price of $180 that was announced earlier in the semester. It should be noted that the price of $180 should be compared to the $338 that students would have to pay without aid from the university.
So what can students take away from this information? It is important for students to be aware that taking advantage of the Port Authority bus services is not free, as we usually like to think of it. Despite the ease of access that comes with simply tapping your card to ride the bus, there is actually a fee associated with the number of rides students take, and this price does eventually make its way back to students through the university’s transportation fee based on the data collected from the previous year.
As a potential solution to this issue, Billy suggested that students only use the bus when necessary, if they’re concerned about the jump in price. “If you’re just taking a short ride, like down Beeler Street, and it’s safe to walk and a nice day, you’re helping everyone to walk a block or two,” Billy said. As another example, Michelle Porter noted that the distance from Hamburg Hall to Morewood Avenue is a short enough distance for students to choose walking over the bus. This advice, however, should be taken with students’ safety in mind. “Sometimes it’s a safety issue. If it’s 2 o’clock In the morning and you’re walking up Beeler, for example, take the bus if it seems like the thing to do,” Billy said.
For those that were shocked by the drastic increase in the transportation fee for the upcoming academic year, maybe this newly acquired information will allow students to be more reflective in just how much their actions make their way back to their tuition costs.

The Game Theorist’s Guide to Parenting
On April 15, Kevin Zollman, an associate professor of philosophy at Carnegie Mellon, along with co-author Paul Raeburn, author of Psychology Today’s blog “About Fathers,” will release their novel The Game Theorist’s Guide to Parenting: How the Science of Strategic Thinking Can Help You Deal with the Toughest Negotiators You Know — Your Kids.
Zollman’s first presentation of game theory was in an advice column he wrote for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2013. In response to this, Jennifer Breheny Wallace, a former journalist currently working as a freelance writer and television commentator, used Zollman’s article to examine the struggles that parents and their children face. This ignited an interest in the idea of game theory in parenting, and soon enough Zollman was approached with the opportunity to create a book based on this idea.
Part of the knowledge that goes in to writing a book such as this one involves some history with parenting, something that the childless Zollman did not have. Raeburn, who has written many times on the combination of science and parenting, and who is the father of five children, entered the project by helping Zollman devise realistic scenarios of how game theory and parenting intersect.
When discussing the impact of the ideas in the book, Zollman said, “Game theory is exciting because it applies to almost all of our social lives...It’s only natural that game theory should work for one of the toughest aspects of our lives — dealing with children.”
Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut
Patrick Wilson, a 1995 graduate of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama and prolific actor of the stage and screen, has returned to his alma mater to direct The Full Monty. He will be making his directorial debut as a director-in-residence in the John Wells Directing Program.
The Broadway production of The Full Monty, adapted from the 1997 movie of the same name, made its debut in 2000 and was directed by Terrence McNally with music and lyrics by David Yazbek. Wilson earned a Tony Award nomination for best leading actor for his performance as Jerry. It’s safe to say that Wilson is very qualified to take on Carnegie Mellon’s production of the musical, which will run Feb. 18-27 in the Philip Chosky Theatre in the Purnell Center for the Arts.
“I’ve been talking with [professors] Gary Kline and Don Wadsworth about finding or making time to direct for years,” Wilson said. “Gary suggested this was the perfect fit because I know the show and we had the right class for it.”
Some of Wilson’s other acting credits include the characters of Raoul in The Phantom of the Opera movie, Josh Feldman in the movie Insidious, and, more recently, Lou Solverson on the second season of FX’s television series Fargo, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

Cultural appropriation is a very complicated topic, despite what many seem to think. There is no clear black and white distinction between right and wrong here — it is all a gray area. The gray is something that I think gets lost in a lot of the debates surrounding the issue. You cannot clearly define lines between what is correct and what is not when it comes to taking things from another culture. When is it appropriative, and when is it just exchange?
One of the most recent controversies about this issue was the new Coldplay and Beyoncé video: For some reason, Beyoncé got all of the flak for something that was mostly Coldplay’s doing.
The video for their new song, “Hymn for the Weekend,” is set in India, with all of the stereotypes of India and Indians that the Western world likes to place on us. Chris Martin and his band run through colored powder in a ready-made Holi festival, past Hindu gurus in their orange attire, and past children dressed up as Hindu gods. It features Beyoncé as a Bollywood heroine, singing on the big screen in front of throngs of Indian people, covered with more Western ideas of what Indian fashion and headwear look like. As soon as the video came out, hordes of people, both Indian and non-Indian, condemned Beyoncé for her culturally appropriative fashion choices, but there was much less of a backlash against the video itself.
The thing to consider, however, is that cultural appropriation is about power — it’s not just people wearing things from other cultures. Cultural appropriation is what happens when people are lionized and profiting from donning a part of another race’s culture, while members of the race or culture are ostracized and othered for doing the same things. This is especially evident in Iggy Azalea’s video "Bounce" and Selena Gomez’s "Come and Get It." There are also everyday examples of white girls wearing henna and bindis who get praised for being hip and trendy while Indian girls and woman wearing henna and bindi’s are not.
This power dynamic does not exist here — Beyoncé, as a black person, has no structural power over South Asians in America. She was invited to participate in the video, she made none of the artistic design choices, and had none of the power there either. The issue with this video is more Chris Martin and his band white-girling their way through India and upholding all of the tired, old stereotypes of my country, than it is Beyoncé in the vaguely Indian headgear and fashion.
South Asians are very frequently extremely anti-black as a culture as well, and this is incredibly evident in the way that I’ve seen the backlash against Beyoncé go so far beyond the backlash for the video in its entirety, which was much more harmful than Beyoncé’s attire.
The way that Chris Martin and Coldplay aestheticized hundreds of years of Indian culture and history is significantly more damaging to the way that South Asians are portrayed in the Western mind than Beyoncé participating in this video while wearing vaguely Indian attire. The only things that the Western world knows about India or its culture are fun colors, dark-skinned orphans, and caricatures of Hindu gods and goddesses, and this video does nothing to subvert that. In fact, it encouraged those ideas. The salt in the wound is that the song itself had absolutely nothing to do with India — there was absolutely no reason for this video to be set in that country or have any of the scenes of India that it did.
The controversy surrounding the cultural appropriation of this video is not taking into account the real issue of cultural appropriation, which is the question of who has the power in this situation. It’s not Beyoncé, and it’s not South Asians. It’s Coldplay. That’s the conversation we should be having, not discussing whether or not Beyoncé’s attire — that, again, she didn’t choose herself — was or wasn’t appropriative.

My mom can fly an airplane. This is a fact that I gleefully share with anyone who is willing to listen, not only because I think it’s a very exciting skill to hone, but also because I love the story behind it. When my mom had just finished her undergraduate studies, she planned to enlist in the Air Force to pay for medical school. The United States Military would pay for her schooling and then she would serve as a doctor and pilot for four years to pay back her dues. It was a plan she had all ready to go until her boyfriend at the time, soon to be her fiancé, and later my father, talked her out of it. He was worried about her, and he did not want anything bad to happen to the woman he loved. It is a sweet and romantic story, but one that is complex and intriguing, especially given the new developments with regards to women in the military.
My mother had a choice in deciding if she wanted to pursue a military career. She ended up not doing so, but what if my mother didn’t had the option to say no and was drafted? It is strange to imagine how my life would have been different if this occurred, or even if this was possibility back then. But what was once only speculative is now an emerging possibility for young women today, and is a topic that should not be ignored.
Women have long played an important role during wartime, from taking charge on the homefront by filling men’s jobs left vacant from the draft, to serving in war zones as cooks and nurses, to, more recently, serving in combat roles on the front lines. However, women and men have been unequal in military service up until this past December when the United States Secretary of Defense, Ashton B. Carter, announced that all combat roles will now be open to women. This includes all five branches of the United States military and all of their special forces. Men and women are now equal on the battlefield. This is an enormous step in gender equality and a huge win for feminists; there is one little thing that many people have forgotten about, however, and that is Selective Service, more commonly known as the draft.
It is a topic we all have a tendency to ignore as there has not been a draft since the early 1970s, but it is a valid and important topic. It is astounding how flustered Republican candidates were at last week’s GOP debate when asked “Should young women be required to sign up for selective service?” Candidates were at a loss for words. This was not a question they had been expecting. But really, why not? It is an extremely relevant subject given the fact that women have now been fully integrated into the United States military service. If women are now fully equal to men in the military, why should this not extend to conscription?
The responses of the candidates were appalling. Skewed logic, evasion of the question at hand, and blatant dismissal of the question abounded. In fact, Jeb Bush flatly stated “the draft is not going to be reinstated.” Without omniscient knowledge of the future, he cannot make that claim. Many argue that the draft should be reinstated for the conflicts our country is dealing with today. This clear and utter disregard of the topic is the true issue at hand here. A GOP debate is the place where these difficult questions are supposed to be discussed, yet the issue was dismissed.
All things being equal, it is not fair if women are not required to register for Selective Service when their male counterparts are. Yes, maybe Jeb Bush is right and there will never be another draft and this whole conversation will prove irrelevant in a literal sense, but on an ideological level it is an important discussion to have, and let us not forget it is possible that we may have another draft.
We cannot live in a world of fantastical hypotheticals. To state that men and women are equal in military service, they must be equal in every sense, which includes the draft.

On Feb. 2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published their recommendation that sexually active women who are not using birth control should avoid all alcohol consumption in order to reduce the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).
The announcement, titled “Alcohol and Pregnancy: Why take the risk?” explains that individuals with FASDs can have lifelong physical, behavioral, and intellectual issues that severely affect their quality of life, and notes that 100 percent of FASDs are completely preventable. The announcement goes on to explain that over three million women in the U.S., despite being sexually active, drink alcohol without the safety of birth control. The report notes that approximately half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, and that most planned pregnancies are not noticed until four to six weeks after conception, which means that if a sexually active woman is drinking and not on birth control, she could be unintentionally exposing an unborn child to alcohol. In order to prevent this from happening, the CDC recommends that women in this situation avoid alcohol altogether.
The CDC’s announcement was met with mixed reactions, with many people saying the CDC’s recommendation was impractical, sexist, and condescending. Of interest to The Tartan, however, is the implication that the announcement has for the prescription of birth control and other pharmaceuticals in general.
While the CDC’s announcement can be viewed as a call for women to abstain from alcohol consumption out of concern for their potential unborn child, it can also be viewed as a promotion for the prescription of birth control. The CDC notes that abstaining from alcohol is only necessary if a woman is sexually active and not on birth control, and suggests that healthcare providers recommend birth control to women who are sexually active, not planning to get pregnant, and wish to drink alcohol. This push for all sexually active women to be on birth control poses problems, however, with regard to the over-prescription of pharmaceuticals.
The pill, which is currently the most common form of contraceptive, was approved for use by the FDA in 1960, and has been the most commonly used contraceptive since 1982. Since then, the pill has become a widely prescribed cure-all for a variety of issues beyond contraception including menstrual pain, acne, and endometriosis, a chronic disease of the uterine lining that causes severe pain and can lead to ovarian cysts, lesions, and infertility. As of 2011, 58 percent of all pill users said they used the pill for noncontraceptive reasons, with 14 percent saying they used the pill for only noncontraceptive reasons.
While it is undeniable that contraceptives like the pill provide a variety of benefits to many women, these types of contraceptives are also linked to an assortment of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, weight gain, and loss of libido. However, contraceptives have also been linked to more serious issues such as strokes, heart disease, and mental illness. A 2007 study from the Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre in Australia, for example, suggests a link between contraceptives and depression, although the study itself notes that more research is needed to reach a definitive conclusion.
The hazards of contraceptive pills were brought to the forefront in the early 2000s when a controversy exploded around Yaz, a new contraceptive released in 2001 by Bayer. The contraceptive was heavily advertised, and by 2006 it was the number one contraceptive. The overnight success of Yaz was short-lived, however, as reports of the drug causing an increased risk of blood clots began to surface. While all contraceptives can cause blood clots — approximately two in every 10,000 women taking contraceptives will experience a blood clot — studies reported to the FDA in 2009 suggested that Yaz put women at increased risk. 
Once again, research on the topic proved frustrating, and definite conclusions were elusive. Some studies suggested that Yaz increased a woman’s risk of acquiring a blood clot by two to five times, while others suggested that there was no extra risk associated with Yaz. Various reports associated Yaz with approximately 100 deaths and thousands of injuries, although Yaz could not be definitively named as the cause. Bayer denied knowing anything about this increased risk, and was involved in a $20 million settlement that attempted to determine the risk associated with the drug, but no definite conclusions were ever made. Today, Yaz is still on the market, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has altered the Yaz warning label to include a warning about the potential increased risk of blood clots.
The idea that contraceptives like the pill are widely accepted and heavily prescribed by health care providers, despite the colossal uncertainty that exists in the scientific community, raises questions about the safety of their prescription. Certainly they can provide many benefits, and could be preferable to unplanned pregnancy or severe disorders such as endometriosis, but do we really know enough about the side effects of these drugs to prescribe them to teens struggling with acne or women with any sort of menstrual discomfort?
Unfortunately, the story behind Yaz, and contraceptives in general, is far from unusual. There have been countless instances of other pharmaceuticals initially marketed for their remarkable effects that were later discovered to have calamitous side effects. Take Vioxx, for example, a drug first released in 1999 as a pain reliever for arthritis that was recalled five years later after being linked to a significant increased risk of heart attack and stroke. With an increase in pharmaceutical advertisements, consumers are now exposed to more synthetic drugs than ever before. In 2002, pharmaceutical companies spent approximately $4 billion on pharmaceutical advertisements. A third of all consumers who saw a pharmaceutical advertisement asked their doctor about the drug, and two thirds of these individuals eventually asked for a prescription. Since then, pharmaceutical advertisements have only increased, with many consumers gaining most or all of their information about pharmaceutical drugs from advertisements.
This is not to say that prescription drugs shouldn’t exist. The pharmaceutical industry helps billions of people deal with illnesses that could be crippling or life threatening without the aid of synthetic medication, but consumers need to be educated about all the risks and benefits associated with these drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs can have serious side effects; these drugs should be viewed with caution and used only when absolutely necessary in order to prevent over-prescription and undesired consequences.

This past Tuesday, Feb. 9, people flocked from far and wide to New Orleans in search of plastic beads among other, more decadent indulgences to celebrate the beginning of the Lenten season. But did you know the first American Mardi Gras was celebrated in Mobile, Alabama?
No. Of course you didn’t. Alabama lives mostly in a Lynyrd Skynyrd song. In FX’s You’re the Worst, Lindsay even refers to Jimmy’s less than pleasant family as “Alabama English people.” In our cultural consciousness, Alabama is basically a stand in for gun-toting hicks.
It’s time for that to change.
The state of Alabama has been the centerpiece of many societies throughout its history. Mobile was the home of the first Mardi Gras because it was the capital of French Louisiana from 1702 to 1720 due to its strategic positioning as a saltwater port on the Gulf Coast. While Alabama has not always housed the capital of the societies it was part of, it has always stood out in the American south as a vital home to many social movements, becoming a capital to all of them in its own way.
Alabama was ceded from France to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, at which point Britain allowed Jewish people to enter the territory for the first time since it was colonized by France. Communities of Sephardic Jews were able to establish trading posts and the largest antebellum Jewish settlement in America was located in Mobile, Alabama. The most famous settler is Abraham Mordecai, who came in 1785. Mordecai believed the Native Americans were members of the lost tribe of Israel, so he felt a connection to them and preferred to negotiate on their terms rather than trying to forcibly expand Alabaman territory. During the Civil War, Jews largely migrated north — an order from General Ulysses S. Grant for all Jewish people to evacuate his military district was a large reason for the mass migration. However, that settlement in Mobile was one of the first instances of America’s Jewish community, one that continues to thrive.
Nearly one hundred years after the Civil War and only 61 years ago, Alabama became one of the most prominent battlegrounds in the Civil Rights Movement. These events are all well-known and incredibly important historical moments, but don’t seem to resonate when people talk about Alabama. Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger occurred in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955 along with the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote the Letter from Birmingham Jail in 1963 and led the Selma to Montgomery marches with James Bevel, Hosea Williams, and John Lewis.
Even before the Civil Rights Movement hit its peak, Alabama was home to large-scale racial activism. Julius Rosenwald’s schools, which were funded in part by donations from Andrew Carnegie, attempted to remedy the stark disparities between opportunities of black and white students in the early 1900s.
All of this is without even mentioning the Native American tribes who occupied the land before France and have reason to call the state home, even if their families have been separated from the land for generations.
Of course, Alabama has had its demons in the past. Montgomery was the first Confederate capital; racial terrorism ran rampant for much of the state’s history; former governor George Wallace campaigned for president based on expanding segregation as recently as 1968; and President Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act devastated Native American tribes living in the state. The centuries of violence and strife are important to a meaningful examination of the state’s history. This article is not a meaningful examination of anything, just a call to attention for a state that provided some of the most visible front lines for this nation’s deepest and most violent existential crises since the Civil War.
Given its past, it is frustrating that the history of the Yellowhammer State often gets condensed into being a breeding ground for stereotypes of bible-belt rednecks (Then again I said New Hampshire only had one demographic in this same issue, so I’m a hypocrite). The ties Mardi Gras has to Alabama offers an opportunity to examine the state with one of the most complicated legacies in a nation that is itself wrapped in a complicated legacy.

Mental illness is a hard thing to talk about. It’s difficult because a person’s mental health is so incredibly personal and often a source of shame. What we’ve seen recently is that people are trying to be more open about having mental health conversations and discussing mental health care options. While this is really important, it’s also quite obvious that we’re far from where we need to be, and cultural perceptions and popular psychology assumptions around self care can add obstacles to improving the social support for people with mental illnesses.
In my experience, one of the most prominent points of frustration for people with mental illnesses is the umbrella prescription of meditation and yoga for every disorder. This tends to be a well-intentioned recommendation, but it also tends to be invalidating. It is worth unpacking the application of yoga and mindfulness in a clinical setting to explain why this can come across as insensitive.
Yoga and meditation interventions are increasingly becoming topics of interests in clinical and health psychology. Several studies have suggested that mindfulness based therapies for depression and anxiety are as effective as medication in both the short and long term. Mindfulness interventions have also been shown to lower cortisol levels and decrease blood pressure. It is connected with improved self-regulation, and researchers are currently investigating its potential for reducing high risk behavior in children and adolescents. Research has also found that mindfulness tends to be most effective in high stress populations, which makes it promising for clinical social work.
This is just a broad overview of the body of mindfulness research, and scientists are working on identifying the specific mechanisms at play in mindfulness meditation, as well as its limitations. Mindfulness is defined by an observation and an acceptance of experiences, so it can really be taught and practiced in a wide variety of situations. The wide range of practices is significant because in a clinical setting, meditation and yoga interventions are going to be very different from the classes at a generic yoga studio. Consider the difficulty a person suffering with a mental illness faces entering a space of slim, upper-middle class, Lululemon-wearing women to deal with their most personal problems. While all practices of yoga should include the cognitive portion of mindfulness, this component looks very different in a clinical setting, both in content and culture.
Part of this difference is a modification of language that could be triggering to people with mental illnesses. There are also certain parts of mediation are going to actually be more harmful than helpful. For example, a traditional mindful practice might include sitting with an emotion with your eyes closed in silence for long periods of time. This means that you take time to be present and allow yourself to experience your emotions fully, without judgement or trying to change it. This would not work for everyone, and certainly not for someone dealing with severe mental illnesses where certain emotions can be damaging or scary. This means that included in the diverse practices of mindfulness are therapies designed for specific disorders. Furthermore, these therapies often use mindfulness as a component of the treatment plan rather than the sole focus.
Because mental illnesses are so complicated, with a multitude of influences from environmental, to genetic, to hormonal, treatment plans usually require a diverse approach. Medication can be a part of someone’s treatment — sometimes it is a necessary step — but generally doctors also work with lifestyle and cognitive changes. A therapist and psychiatrist works with their clients to figure out what strategies work best, and this may not include yoga or meditation in the traditional sense. In therapies such as dialectical behavioral therapy, the idea behind mindfulness is incorporated in more subtle ways than breathing exercises and downward dog. What that boils down to is the idea that mindful meditation is just a tool in a toolbox of strategies to deal with psychological distress, and it may not be useful for everyone.
The “Well, have you tried yoga?” question comes across as thoughtless when it doesn’t take into consideration how recovery is complicated and sometimes not the current goal. Mindfulness, yoga, exercise, diet, and sleep are all important for stress management and mood, but they are not cure-all remedies for every disease. Suggesting lifestyle changes like taking up yoga or getting a full night’s sleep to someone with severe mental disorders is insensitive not only because problematic sleep patterns or discomfort in your body that can make yoga triggering are part of the disorder, but it also implies that disorders can be cured by trying harder.
People often see those with mental illness as weak, lazy, or attention-seeking, and that has a serious impact on how they seek out treatment. Because of this, it’s important to be careful about providing support in a way that doesn’t blame people for their mental illness. There is not a one size fits all approach to being supportive and discussing mental health care. What is relatable and relevant will change from person to person. It it is important to have conversations about ways you can take care of your mental health, especially considering that 20 percent of Americans have never even tried stress reducing activities. But a good place to start is listening first to what someone is actually going through and working with them, based on their resources and needs, to find the best next step whether that is treatment, a consultation, a lifestyle change, or a mindfulness based intervention.
