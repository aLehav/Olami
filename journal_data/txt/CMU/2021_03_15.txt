NBA Press Release - February 18th, 2024
With COVID-19 cases on the rise and the recent declaration of the factory farm antibiotic-resistant bacteria pandemic, the NBA is pleased to announce that the 2024 All-Star Game will continue as planned today. Jaylen Brown and James Harden will serve as team captains for their respective conferences. Harden is replacing Obadiah Toppin as captain after Toppin broke his ankles during a pick-up game with Dennis Smith Jr.  
The NBA protocols and guidelines will continue to be as stringent as ever, and the safety of our players and their families is of utmost importance to our public relations team. In the week-long break between today’s All-Star Game and finals, players were tested six times a day for both diseases using anal swabs. Players also had an enforced curfew from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m., with the Detroit Pistons 2005 lineup enforcing the curfew.
Players also traveled in four layers of hazmat suits to minimize their exposure to potential diseases. In a break from the 2021 All-Star Game’s pandemic guidelines, friends and family are not allowed to join players for this year’s game. Instead, the NBA will be microchipping each player with nanotechnology body sensors and contact lens cameras that project a live feed of their activity on the court so that their friends and family can be with them at all times during the game.
During the game, the players will be tested at the beginning and end of each quarter, and the court will be sanitized after every point scored. This will prevent players from making excessive contact with each other, and will prevent James Harden from fouling every player in the Western Conference. In addition, players will have to continue playing in their hazmat suits for the safety of everyone involved in making this All-Star Game a success.
We have received criticism from players, fans, the media, and the Golden State Warriors that these precautions are absurd and that we are jeopardizing the safety of our players by having an All-Star Game. These claims are entirely true. While the players make up the NBA, our advertisers are the only reason any of them can afford their lavish lifestyles. So the next time someone complains that, “It’s a slap in the face to have an All-Star Game during a pandemic for the second time in the last four years,” we are here to remind all of you players and Chandler Parsons that you only have 25 million dollar salaries because Tencent and Microsoft are buying primetime advertising slots. Your move, players. What are you going to do? Unionize? Get real.
The All-Star Game is tonight, and we hope to have a fun, positive environment for players and fans to enjoy themselves. We aim to provide some normalcy in these trying times to the best of our ability, and we hope you enjoy our efforts to do so.
-Commissioner of the NBA, Adam Silver

For the past couple of weeks, there has been a fierce debate over the University of Texas at Austin’s school spirit song, “The Eyes of Texas.” The song has been embraced by the Longhorns for decades, and it is tradition for the football team to stay on the field after games to sing along to the band’s performance of  “The Eyes of Texas.” However, as the student body became more and more aware of the song’s ties to minstrel shows and, reportedly, a saying by Confederate General Robert E. Lee, more and more athletes began to refuse to stay on the field and sing the song.
All this came to a head in a football game against Oklahoma last October, when only a single player stayed on the field when the song played. This enraged many of UT Austin’s donors and resulted in a flood of angry emails that came to light at the beginning of this month. Donors demanded not only that the song continue to be played as UT Austin’s school spirit song, but also that athletes continue the traditions surrounding it.
As a result, waves of panic ran through the administration. President of the Longhorn Alumni Band Charitable Fund Board of Trustees Kent Kostka told the The Texas Tribune, “[Alumni] are pulling planned gifts, canceling donations, walking away from causes and programs that have been their passion for years, even decades, and turning away in disgust. Last night one texted me at 1:00 a.m., trying to find a way to revoke a seven-figure donation." Kostka added, "This is not hyperbole or exaggeration. Real damage is being done every day by the ongoing silence.”
In an attempt to reconcile the student body and the upset alumni donors, the university commissioned a committee to research the meaning and origins of the song. Last Tuesday, the committee released a paper on its findings.
While the committee concluded that there was no concrete evidence to support the rumor that the song was based on a saying of Robert E. Lee’s, it confirmed that “The Eyes of Texas” made its debut at a minstrel show in which blackface was used. However, as the lyrics were not written in the minstrel dialect, the committee argued that the timing of its debut, while unfortunate, was simply in parody of the university's then-president, who attended the show. Furthermore, while the tune of the song is borrowed from “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad,” a racist song which has historically been used to caricature Black railroad workers, the committee found no traces of slavery in the lyrics of “The Eyes of Texas.”
As a result of the committee’s findings, “The Eyes of Texas” remains UT Austin’s school spirit song, because, they claim, there is no “racist intent”. However, the committee conceded, the university must be accountable for its past, and the way in which it debuted. While the song will continue to be played, including at sporting events, the university will not mandate the participation of its athletes.
Needless to say, this was a compromise that truly satisfied neither side. It also goes to show that, not unexpectedly, the university decided that while it could not ignore the will of the student body, the value of having donor support was significant enough to continue to allow the song to be played and celebrated despite very strong ties to past societal practices that were undoubtedly racist. Ultimately, this compromise was a band-aid on a very deep wound separating the student body from a far more conservative and traditional group of donors. Going forward, similar incidents requiring a reexamination of the university’s present practices passed down from a problematic past are bound to occur, and, sooner or later, the university will have to solidify its stance once and for all.

Everything is slowly becoming digital, including sound. However, it's difficult to synthetically create different sounds like dog barks, pianos, and human voices in bits and bytes without having premade recordings. So how do sound engineers do it?
Well, for starters, sound engineers have to understand musical pitch. Every note and sound at a given moment vibrates at a certain frequency. You can think of a given note "wiggling" through space in a series of high-pressure and low-pressure regions, known as a compression wave. These compression waves can then be visualized as sine waves. For example, the note “A4” is widely accepted to be 440 hertz, hertz being wave cycles per second.
But wait, the note A on the piano still sounds way different from when a human sings the note A. What makes these As different and how do you recreate that?
The answer to that is harmonics. When you hear the note A, you aren't actually only hearing the note A. You're also secretly hearing other notes overlayed on top of the A, and those notes are called harmonics. Any given note has a set of harmonics that you will hear with it, but different instruments and voices will play some harmonic notes louder than others, which is what gives you a different sound.
Harmonics are lots of fun to investigate. You can press the A key on a piano and try to pick out the notes you hear other than A. If you're a mathematician, there are lots to explore in the realm of harmonic series, a series that tells you what harmonics should appear with a given note. As a sound engineer, you can utilize this knowledge by altering wave formulas until you get the same harmonics as the instrument or voice you are interested in recreating. In the end, this should get you a digital sound that resembles the actual sound.
To alter the typical sine wave, you can subtract sine waves (subtractive synthesis), add sine waves (additive synthesis), or change the frequency of the sine wave (frequency modulation). This will give you very wonky-looking squiggles that will produce different frequencies and different subsequent harmonics to get you your desired sound.
While this is a very broad overview of the ideas in synthetic sound, there is so much to explore for a person of any field. And as virtual reality and synthetic voices like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri grow in capabilities, there may come a time when every single sound in reality will be able to be reproduced synthetically.

"100 articles for The Tartan: a tortured writer’s guide of trying to make a relatively menial accomplishment feel meaningful because life no longer has joy."
No, that’s an edgy, terrible title. Let’s think. What does one write about for the 100th article? I could write an article about writing articles. But I’m not an authority on writing. I am not even an English major.
But I have to do something for this milestone though don’t I? Every person has talked about doing something special for their 100th article and then they never actually get to do it.
Well you don’t have to do it. You’re forcing yourself to do it.
Ok, how about an article about writing an article about writing articles?
That is far too confusing. Are you ok Sujay? Have you been sleeping properly?
No, that doesn’t make sense either. That’s getting to a level of meta even Dan Harmon would find confusing.
Forced reference there. Are you even listening to me?
No, that’s the whole point, conscience. I’m not supposed to be listening to you.
Yeah and that’s why you’re a failed wreck who is creatively struggling, mentally tired, and relying on YouTube yoga lessons from a white guy named Tim to keep yourself from spiraling further.
Ouch. Thank you for that.
You’re not welcome. And while you’re at it, ease up on the politics articles. No one cares about your opinions.
Oh maybe I can write something about the unsustainability of our modern socioeconomic landscape and how it’s resulting in the decline of our collective mental health.
Who cares about that?
I do.
There you go, more reason not to write it.
Alright fine, that’s a bit too broad anyway. Maybe for this 100th article I could do something about my favorite movies of all time.
No one cares about that either. You watch arthouse films to make yourself feel better that you’re artistically inclined when all you’d rather do is just rewatch Velocipastor and Birdemic until the end of time.
I don’t like you, conscience.
Yeah, and no one likes you.
Whoa, let’s take it easy for a second. This 100th article special is going off the rails.
Hold on I’m sorry, does my conscience have a conscience?
Yes.
Yes, he’s the worst. He’s the reason you don’t eat Tide Pods for fun.
Alright, let’s take a second and gather ourselves. You want to write something fun for your 100th article right?
Yes.
But your concern is that you don’t think it’s worth celebrating this milestone?
Well sort of.
Oh god here he goes again.
So what’s the problem?
It’s not that it isn’t worth celebrating, but more that I feel that I myself don’t feel I am worthy of celebrating this. Because not all of my articles are even good. Some of them are just downright terrible.
Yeah remember the Columbus Day article you wrote?
Oh yeah... that one.
I don’t even know what I was arguing there either. Like Columbus was a terrible dude and I argued that he was and we should get rid of Columbus Day. But for some reason, I was focusing on the semantics of genocide for no reason like I was some enlightened centrist even though I wasn't and still am not?
Or what about that filler joke article you wrote about ranking campus buildings? No one got your joke about your hatred of glass buildings. It makes no sense.
Ok let’s stop there. The point is that I already don’t like celebrating myself, talking about myself, or even talking about my opinions of other things. Yet I do it, and I am unsure if it’s because I enjoy writing or if I find some practical use for doing it. So why do something special for 100 articles when I’m not even sure about my own enjoyment of it? Plus it’s not like I’m the only one in The Tartan who’s written 100 articles, so what makes it so special for me to write something about it?
Alright. So what you’ve done instead is make personifications of your inner thought processes to express your paranoid process of writing this 100th article?
Precisely.
It’s a classic sign of creative bankruptcy.
You need to shut up because you are so annoying. Sujay, here’s my first question. Why on earth would you do something 100 times if you don’t enjoy it?
…….
Hello?
He’s probably day-dreaming about his crush again.
No, I’m actually thinking for once. I do like writing for The Tartan, and I do enjoy it. I just don’t like myself.
Well, there’s your problem.
Did Sujay just write out a therapy session on paper?
Yes, and he should do that. Now say something nice to him.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Ugh. Alright. I guess it’s cool that you enjoy writing a lot and you’ll push to finish what you’ve committed to even if it’s two days after the article deadline.
Thank you conscience, for that begrudging compliment.
So with that, here’s my second question: why did you write this if you didn’t want to write something for the 100th article?
A cry for help?
Who knows? But this is the end of it and I’ve written it.
This is a waste of time for anyone reading this. There’s nothing valuable in here.
And that’s fine. Maybe that’s the point of this. It’s the 100th article. It means a lot and nothing simultaneously.
That’s a weirdly unsatisfying conclusion to this whole ordeal.
Well, that’s how all my writing usually ends. Might as well stick with that theme.
God, you suck.

Last week, President Biden ordered a review of the Department of Education’s policies and regulations to ensure an "educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex," including sexual orientation and gender identity. He also directed the Secretary of Education to review a controversial rule enacted last year that overhauled the disciplinary process for sexual misconduct.
The rule, put in place by Betsy DeVos during her tenure as Secretary of Education, changed the disciplinary process for those accused of sexual misconduct at universities. Some of the changes included requiring that complainants and respondents to complaints can be cross-examined in live hearings. At Carnegie Mellon, the rule led to the creation and adoption of an interim Sexual Misconduct Policy.
Speaking on the review of the rules under the new administration, Carnegie Mellon University Spokesperson Jason Maderer said, "While the recent executive order by President Biden signals the intent to change Title IX regulations, the existing Title IX regulations issued by the prior administration remain in effect unless and until new regulations are enacted by the U.S. Department of Education." Maderer continued, "In anticipation of further changes to Title IX regulations, the university is extending the interim status of the Sexual Misconduct Policy. Once new regulations are issued, the university will revise the policy as necessary and move towards the adoption of a new final policy." Maderer directed students to send any comments on the interim policy to the Office of Title IX Initiatives.
The rule DeVos championed was controversial. It received over 120,000 public comments, and after the rule was finalized in May of last year, 17 states and the District of Columbia sued to stop its implementation. The lawsuit was dismissed and the rule went into effect on Aug. 14. Carnegie Mellon University announced its new Sexual Misconduct Policy Aug. 12 in an email from the provost.
Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) also submitted a comment on the rule before it was finalized. While praising some changes, like allowing both complainants and respondents to appeal a case, the GSA expressed concern over other parts of the rule. For example, in response to the requirement that representatives are allowed to cross-examine complainants, the GSA wrote, "Questioning the survivors of assault can retraumatize them, especially in a live hearing." 
GSA Vice President for External Affairs Divyansh Kaushik, who was one of the signees, noted, "Department of Education Title IX rules are the floor, they're not the ceiling." Kaushik noted that the rule leaves the decision of whether to pursue Title IX proceedings for some off-campus sexual misconduct cases up to schools, so they do not need to pursue these cases to receive Title IX funds. In their comment, the GSA also objected to this provision leaving the decision of whether to pursue cases occurring off-campus up to schools, noting that Carnegie Mellon does not have housing on campus for graduate students. This provision remained in the final rule, but schools can still prohibit this conduct, as Carnegie Mellon University's interim Sexual Misconduct Policy strictly prohibits off-campus misconduct. The interim policy has kept other standards from the previous Sexual Misconduct Policy, such as using the "preponderance of evidence" (more likely than not) standard to determine whether respondents are responsible.
Kaushik worries about sexual violence at Carnegie Mellon University. "How often do we have a proactive discussion about sexual violence on campus? Never," Kaushik said. He added, "There are a lot of problems at CMU, and some of them are due to the federal government, but most of them are due to the inactions of the university administration."

On March 11, the Senate discussed a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Initiative, percentage minimums in student government elections, the rise in hate crimes toward Asian-Americans, and the announcement of unlimited digital access to The New York Times for all Carnegie Mellon students.
The Undergraduate Senate Finance Committee proposed an initiative to encourage the university to pay undergraduates on DEI committees. The committee asserted that these committees, both academic and non-academic, benefit undergraduates greatly and involve emotional labor, and students at other universities, such as the University of Michigan, have called for compensating their students doing diversity work. The committee proposed writing a letter to the Carnegie Mellon administration to pay students on DEI committees, having it be endorsed by the Senate, and allowing the general student body to sign the letter as well. Also, since the Senate cannot compensate students, the committee proposed paying for a meal for students on DEI committees and giving them special allocation funding for certain items. As part of the proposal, the Finance Committee, in collaboration with the Advocacy Committee, would also send out a survey to DEI students to gather more information on what they do, giving them compensation for completing the survey. The proposal passed 16-0-1.
The Senate also continued its discussion of whether to change the current policy on percentage minimums from last week. The Elections Board already voted to assess percentage minimums after every round of the single transferable vote (STV) process but wanted further input from senators. Percentage minimums in the past were shown to have affected one election, in which two candidates were running for the Student Body Vice President for Finance position. One candidate, who ended up winning the position, secured 80 percent of the graduate vote, while the other secured 10 to 20 percent of the graduate vote. However, graduate student turnout has historically been low, and in that election, only one-third of the graduate student body voted. Senator James Gallicchio (SCS) argued that it could be unfair to implement percentage minimums, as it could penalize candidates for low graduate turnout. However, Senator Diana Crookston (DEH) countered that it was reasonable to ask candidates to meet the percentage minimum, as it was only one percent the day before the meeting. They further discussed whether to assess percentage minimums after the entire STV process to avoid eliminating as many candidates as possible. As this discussion did not concern a bylaw override, it was not voted upon.
The Advocacy Committee also brought forth discussion on the recent rise in hate crimes toward Asian-Americans. They considered releasing a statement on social media to show their stance and redirecting students to resources such as Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), DEI, and reportit. They also deliberated sending out an anonymous survey to assess the campus atmosphere with respect to these hate crimes and garner testimonies. 
The Senate was also able to secure unlimited digital access to The New York Times (NYT) for all Carnegie Mellon students. In a statement to The Tartan, Coordinator of Student Leadership, Involvement, & Civic Engagement Andrew Greenwald said, "Whether you’re writing a paper or planning for the weekend ahead, discover original, quality journalism that helps you understand the world — and make the most of every part of life. You now have access to The New York Times, compliments of the Undergraduate Student Senate and University Library. Activate your access today by visiting www.accessnyt.com, search for Carnegie Mellon University, and use your .edu email address to sign up. If you already have an account associated with your .edu email address, there is an option to link your existing account."

Pittsburgh has never been mistaken for a clean city. It is surrounded by clouds and smog, and its rivers are the last stop for sewage overflow. Still yet, the air quality in Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania faces a stubborn enemy in fracking.
Fracking is a process used to extract oil and gas from deep underground. In simplest terms, it involves digging wells deep underground and then pumping mixtures of water and other chemicals to break rocks containing the oil and gas. It has been hailed as a job creator and economic boon, and it became a 2020 presidential campaign issue when former President Trump falsely accused then-candidate Joe Biden of wanting to ban fracking.
Nonetheless, fracking has continued in the United States following a recent surge since the beginning of the 21st century. Now, fracking operations in Pennsylvania are concentrated in southwest Pennsylvania. Washington County and Westmoreland County are both in the top 10 counties in Pennsylvania in terms of active natural gas wells, and they both neighbor Allegheny County. Washington County has the most active natural gas wells with 1146 wells according to StateImpact Pennsylvania.
Fracking has continued at a great cost to Americans. A recent investigation by Environmental Health News (EHN) tested the urine of residents of Washington and Westmoreland counties, and they found troubling signs. Every single urine test they processed was in the 95th percentile among Americans for mandelic acid, which is a biomarker for ethylbenzene, found in coal tar and petroleum, and styrene. Styrene, a derivative of ethylbenzene, is usually found in cigarette smoke and is classified by the National Toxicology Program as "reasonably anticipated" to be carcinogenic. While the study was only of a small group in Pennsylvania, the results do not bode well for other areas with lots of fracking operations.
The most worrying part of fracking is how much fracking operations can damage their communities with little pushback. For instance, one landfill in Kentucky illegally buried radioactive fracking waste. Additionally, the landfill in which the waste was buried was just a few hundred feet from middle and high schools. In the same EHN investigation, one man said he leased some of his land to a fracking operation and caught workers illegally dumping water from a fracking pit (which they claimed was stormwater) near his property. His water became undrinkable.
The fracking industry seems to just wait for something to go wrong before they take any action. One fracking operation in Ohio had one of the largest methane leaks in U.S. history in 2019, which took 20 days to plug. Researchers estimated it emitted 120 metric tons per hour of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Additionally, the EPA concluded in 2016 that water produced as a byproduct of fracking can get into and contaminate waterways, as seen in an almost three-million-gallon spill in North Dakota in 2015. They also found that when some plants attempted to treat this water, they ended up releasing contaminated water.
Fracking has not always delivered on its economic promises either. One study by the Ohio River Valley Institute found that despite promising hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the natural gas industry added jobs in counties with a lot of fracking at just a fraction of the rate of job growth nationally and at the state level. 
Fracking has fueled a rush of illegal dumping, spills, leaks, and pollution overall, and it has not always delivered on its promises to Pennsylvanians. While fracking has, thankfully, lost some ground in recent years as Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf banned it in state parks, we must act swiftly still. Even now, a new plant is being built upriver in Beaver County. For the sake of Pittsburgh's air and the people who breathe it, we need to change. There is no more time to wait — fracking has to be either heavily restricted or banned altogether.
