The AFC Championship brutally outlived all the expectations. Three years after the Pittsburgh Steelers won the coveted Lombardi Trophy that sealed head coach Bill Cowher’s place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and sent off veteran running back Jerome Bettis off as a champion, the Steelers are going back to the Super Bowl, this time with second-year head coach Mike Tomlin.
The Pittsburgh Steelers entered the season against a schedule ranked toughest in the league, a not so desired honor. Facing the league’s top teams week in and week out, the biggest challenge may have been to come out in one piece. The Steelers did 12 better, wrapping up the season 12–4.
The Steelers pulled out 12 victories by developing the league’s best defense. Appropriately nicknamed Blitzburgh, this phenomenal defense dominated opponents by pressuring quarterbacks and stopping the run. Facing many of the league’s most potent offenses, the Steelers allowed only an average of 13.9 points per game. The defensive unit recorded 51 sacks and forced 20 interceptions and nine fumbles. So impressive was this group that many sports analysts have asked, is this the Steel Curtain II? There may never be a defense that will rule the field the way the Steel Curtain of the 1970s did, but if the this defense can start off the ring collection for the other hand, then perhaps a legitimate comparison can be made.
When a team has the luxury of such stingy defense, the offense is not asked to do much, and Pittsburgh’s offense certainly benefited from this advantage. Despite a rich tradition in running the ball, the run game only produced 1690 yards (23rd most in the NFL) due to injuries to star running back Willie Parker and a sometimes inconsistent offensive line. Ultimately, the Steelers were able to win the AFC North division because they won the close games and rallied together to overcome key injuries. In a league filled with tremendous physical talent, injuries can end a team’s hopes for success, but great teams win with great chemistry and clutch performances, and there were certainly many memorable dramatic endings.
Not many other cities come alive during playoff runs the way Pittsburgh does. The Steelers play the game with a blue-collar, hard-hitting style that mirrors the hardworking middle-class characteristics of Pittsburghers. The humble demeanor of the franchise owner, Dan Rooney, sets the tone from the top by hiring the right personnel and trusting them to steer the team. Since 1969 the Steelers have had three coaches — Chuck Noll, Bill Cowher, and Mike Tomlin. In an era of free agency and instant gratification, such a statistic deserves an asterisk. The Steelers may not be the winningest franchise, but it's certainly the most consistent.
You can tell a lot about a team by the way they win the ugly games. This team has character, chemistry and trust in each other. Sometimes, that's all you need.

While most students studied busily for finals and then headed home for winter break, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team improved on its 11–2 overall record. The Tartans are currently ranked 19th in the nation and are on track for an extremely successful second half of the season.
The team received its first national ranking after defeating 21st-ranked Wooster 74–68 at home Nov. 25. Junior Jack Anderson led the Tartans with 19 points, followed by senior Ryan Einwag with 14 and senior Corey O’Rourke and sophomore Shane Rife with 13 each. Defensively, senior Terrance Bouldin-Johnson dominated with five blocks and five boards.
The Tartans continued their success as the host team of the Carnegie Mellon Invitational going undefeated to eventually win the tournament. In their first game, they defeated John Carroll University 81–79 with the game-winning basket scored by Einwag with 7.7 seconds left. In the championship game, the Tartans came away with a 61–56 victory over Catholic University.
In the last game before commencing University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play, the Tartans defeated the Eagles of Juniata College 75–56 to bring their record to 6–0. In the first UAA game of the season, the Tartans defeated the University of Rochester Yellowjackets 58–55. Defense made the difference in the close game, especially in the final five minutes when the Tartans forced the Yellowjackets into four turnovers. Bouldin-Johnson secured the win for the Tartans with a three-point play and a blocked shot in the final three minutes. The win moved the Tartans to 7–0 overall record, moving them to the 11th standing in national rankings.
The men’s basketball team continued its streak with a 79–64 win over La Roche College. Consistency on offense was key to the Tartans’ success, as the attack shot 56.7 percent from the field. Once again, Einwag led the offense with 19 points, followed by masters student Jon Wolleben with 14 and O’Rourke with 13.
On Saturday, Dec. 20, the Tartans recorded their first loss of the season, falling 70–82 to Richard Stockton College in Pomona, N.J. The Tartans started strong with a 14–5 lead, but could not hold onto it as the Ospreys went on a 10–0 run. Turnovers seemed to be the cause of the Tartans’ demise, as Richard Stockton scored 20 points off of 16 turnovers. Rife led the Tartans with 22 points, followed by Anderson with 13.
The Tartans rallied at the Cougar Classic held at Averett University, recording victories over the host and Ferrum College. The Tartans defeated Averett 69–59 and topped Ferrum 76–67. The unstoppable Einwag came away with 32 points and went on two 8–0 runs in the second half. O’Rourke helped Einwag tally the points as he contributed seven assists. 
The Tartans opened with a 6–0 run against Ferrum and went into the second half with a 36–28 lead. The Tartans shot 45 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three-point line.
In their second UAA contest, the Tartans toppled New York University 78–57. The win moved the Tartans to an 11–1 overall record, while the Violets recorded their first loss of the season to bring their record to 9–1. With the score tied 9–9, the Tartans cashed in three straight three-pointers with two from Einwag and one from Anderson. 
The Tartans took a commanding 32–18 lead with 5:43 to play in the half, but the Violets rallied to bring the score to 36–25 at the half. With less than two minutes to play, the Tartans sealed the victory with back-to-back three-point plays from Bouldin-Johnson and Rife.
Most recently, the Tartans recorded their second loss of the season to Brandeis University. The Tartans came out slowly, only shooting 2–14 while the Judges went on a 14–2 run to bring the score to 20–9. The Tartans battled throughout the game, but could not find a rhythm and fell to the Judges 69–57.
The Tartans next head to Lycoming College for their final non-conference game of the season on Tuesday.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams started the semester off strong after completing their annual winter break training in Florida. The men’s and women’s teams have winning records of 6–2 and 2–1 since returning from their training trip. After defeating Case Western Reserve University at home Jan. 10, the Tartans came out of this past weekend at 1–1, defeating Allegheny College Friday night but unable to continue their success on Saturday against visiting Kenyon College.
Highlights of the Case Western Reserve weekend included great swims from senior Tom McConnell and sophomore Molly Evans. Evans set season best and school record times in her heats on Saturday.
The Tartans finished one and two for a number of events. First-years Olivia DeFazio and Kendra Gaul took the top two places in the 1- and 3-meter diving events, and Hannah Gonzales and sophomore Rebecca Ussai followed suit, finishing one and two in the 100-yard butterfly.
Sophomore Brianne Burton recorded a first place finish in the 50-yard freestyle in 25.06 and Evans won both the 400-yard IM and 100-yard backstroke.
The Carnegie Mellon men swept both the 500- and 1000-yard freestyles with McConnell finishing first in both events with times of 4:45.03 and 9:40.99, respectively. Junior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki joined in the sweep to finish second in the 1000 and third in the 500. Teammates Alex Hanson and Gates Winkler closed out the top three finishes, with Hanson finishing second in the 500 and Winkler coming in third in the 1000-meter. Junior Jeff Dahlen had a strong showing against Case Western Reserve, touching the wall first in both the 100-yard backstroke and the 200-yard freestyle. Sophomore Joshua Mathews also recorded dual victories in both the 100 and 200-yard freestyle events. First-year Mike Alexovich secured first place in the one-meter diving event and junior Matt Kuhn took first in the three-meter event.
Both teams came out on top in their meet Friday night against Allegheny College. The men posted a 167–122 victory, and the women held their own as they defeated their opponents with a final score of 158–141. The men swept the 200-yard freestyle when McConnell finished first in 1:46.84, followed closely by second-place finisher senior Ron Papa in 1:47.64, and first-year Ben Cohen closed out the top three with a time of 1:52.91. McConnell recorded another first in the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 50.23. Hanson recorded two first-place finishes, completing the 200-yard backstroke in 1:58.11 and the 200-yard freestyle in 2:00.71. 
Sophomore Michael Panzitta took the 100-yard backstroke in 55.33, while first-year Michael Rong had a strong showing in the 1000-yard freestyle, completing the race in 10.13.56.
On the other end of the pool, Alexovich put points on the board for the Tartans by wining both the one- and three-meter diving events.
The women’s team recorded eight first-place finishes in their victory over Allegheny. Evans won the 100-yard backstroke, the 200-yard backstroke, and the 100-yard butterfly. First-year Victoria Adams won the 1000-yard freestyle in 10:59.35, and senior Allison Retotar took the 200-yard IM in 2:16.22. Junior Sara Andrews won both the 100-yard breaststroke and the 100-yard freestyle and on the diving board DeFazio won the one- and three-meter diving events.
Saturday, the Tartans suffered two tough losses in their home pool. The men fell to Kenyon by a final score of 141.5–115.5 and the women by a score of 174–83.
On the men’s side, McConnell had another strong showing winning the 500-yard freestyle in 4:43.18 and swimming a season-best 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:40.44. First-place finishers included junior Jason Huber, junior Andrew Seo, and Hanson. Huber completed the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 59.76, Seo won the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:11.19, and Hanson took the 400-yard IM in 4:11.04.
On the women’s side, Evans secured three first-place victories, qualifying for the NCAA meet in the 200-yard freestyle, the 200-yard backstroke, and the 400-yard IM. 
For the second week in a row, Evans set a school record in the 400-yard IM, this time with a time of 4:31.47. Also swimming strong for the Tartans, Andrews and Ussai finished third in their respective races. 
Evans was positive about the weekend. “We had a chance to race a team that was faster than us, and everyone competed extremely well, especially considering that we had a meet at Allegheny the night before,” she said. 
The Tartans will soon have their University Athletic Association (UAA) team chosen and ready to go for the conference meet. Evans, one of the Tartans already qualified for  NCAA competition, shared her thoughts on the later half of the season. 
“I think being on training trip allows us to refocus and concentrate on the rest of the season. Once we get back, there is only a month and a half before conferences, so we need to be focused in order to prepare for UAAs.”
Carnegie Mellon swim and dive will be home again this Saturday against Westminster College at 1 p.m. for Senior Day. This is the final home meet of the season and for the seniors.

As a noteworthy member of the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team, senior Terrance Bouldin-Johnson stays involved with the sports community in other ways than just varsity competition. He shows his dedication to the athletics programs through his responsibilities with intramural sports and as an avid sideline worker for home soccer matches in the fall. 
Bouldin-Johnson gave The Tartan some insight into the playing, dining, and personal hairstyling aspects of his college life while in the midst of his senior season with the Tartans.
The Tartan: While each University Athletic Association (UAA) game is as intense as the one before it, are there any conference match-ups coming up that you are particularly excited to play? 
Bouldin-Johson: I just look forward to the next game. I try not to look too far down the line so that I don’t lose focus on what I have to do to help us win the next one.
T: What has been your favorite place that you have eaten while on the road traveling as a team, and while here in Pittsburgh?
B: Tough one. I would say it is a tie between Grandlux Café in Chicago and Fire and Ice in Boston for team trips. When it comes to the ‘burgh, my tops are Fiori’s (pizza), New China Inn (Chinese), Tessaro’s (burgers), Fatheads (signature sandwiches), and Pizza Perfectta (hoagies).
T: What has been the best part about senior year so far? Is there anything left that you are still hoping to do before you graduate? 
B: The best part of this year for me was spending winter break in Pittsburgh with all of my teammates. I just hope to help the team win as many games as possible before I graduate.
T: If you could own any kind of car, what type would you own and why? 
B: I look forward to riding my bike and taking the train to work when I graduate and hardly ever using a car. That being said, I would take the Batmobile from The Dark Knight, but only the motorcycle version in order to reduce my carbon footprint.
T: What do you enjoy most, and least, about the Tepper School of Business? 
B: The one thing I enjoy the most about Tepper is getting graded on presentations. It’s like cheating: You just decide what you are going to say and look good while you do it, and bang, you get an A. The biggest downfall of being in Tepper would be the tremendous workload.
T: You’ve been sporting some pretty original hairstyles the past couple of seasons. Is there any inspiration behind them?
B: Let me break it down. I let my hair grow for about three months and then I tell my teammate Elliot [Curtis] I need a haircut. I simply wear his masterpieces.
T: Did you have a basketball idol while you were growing up? If you could be compared to any player, who would it be?
B: My uncle was my only basketball idol when I was younger because I have never really followed the sport outside of playing it myself. As far as players to be compared to, I would call myself a rich man’s Mittens.
The Tartans hit the hardwood next at Lycoming College this Tuesday, followed by a men’s and women’s UAA double-header weekend at Skibo Gymnasium with match-ups against the University of Chicago on Friday and Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to Kent State University Saturday to compete at the Doug Raymond Invitational for their season’s first indoor meet with competition against 39 Division I, II, and III schools. 
Last summer, Kent State installed the new Mondo FTX track surface used at the Beijing Olympics, which makes their field house the only indoor facility in the nation to have such a running surface.
Head coach Dario Donatelli was pleased with the results and especially proud of the first-years competing in their first collegiate meet.
For the men, junior Chris Bogie took 23rd in the 400-meter dash in a time of 51.53 with fellow classmate senior Stephano Dubuc trailing behind with a 25th finish in a time of 52.22. 
Senior Ryan Anderson ran a 4:28.83 mile to place 14th in the race. First-year Rob Morhard finished 11th in the 800-meter run in 1:57.72 and sophomore J.P. Allera placed the same in the 5000-meter run with a time of 16:29.45.
Unsurprisingly, senior Brian Harvey took the spotlight for the Tartans with a solid fifth-place finish in the 3000-meter race with a 8:38.1 time.
For the field events, junior James Huley placed 22nd in the weight throw event making a distance of 13.56 meters and first-year Anthony Hernandez placed right after with a toss of 13.55 meters.
For the women, in her first collegiate meet, first-year Chelsea Grindle set a school record in the long jump with 5.08 meters to take 10th place. 
Senior Carolyn Clayton finished the mile run in the 15th standing with a time of 5:38.61, and junior Diane Mattingly placed 20th in the 400-meter dash in 1:01.96.
First-years Christine Warner and Cassie Wallace ran the 3000-meter with times of 11:18.96 and 11:20.75 to finish 18th and 19th, respectively. Sophomore Melissa Hwang made a 9.69-meter triple jump to land an eighth-place finish.
Carnegie Mellon track and field next competes this Saturday at Denison University.

November and December yielded mixed results for the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team, with wins against La Roche College, Grove City College, and Hiram College, but losses to Hanover College, Capital University, and top 15 teams like University Athletic Association (UAA) competitors New York University and Brandeis University. With a busy schedule over winter break, the Tartans' record is 4–9 overall, after a solid defeat over the visiting Hiram.
In mid-December, the Tartans traveled to La Roche where they picked up a decisive win, 55–51. Senior Rachelle Roll and first-year Jacki Cortese led the team with 13 and 10 points, respectively. With little over a minute remaining in the game and a narrow Tartan 53–51 lead, senior Stacie Aleski secured the win with a two-point shot in the last few seconds, which brought the overall season record to 2–5.
Despite the exciting win, the following tournament at the Eleanore Moyer Classic held in Hanover, Ind. did not give the Tartans good results, with an initial loss to host Hanover 72–63 and a disappointing second-round defeat to Capital 70–44. Against Hanover, Cortese stood out with 17 points and 10 rebounds, while first-year Ali Aunkst contributed 11 points. Capital proved to be a tougher opponent, and the Tartans found themselves behind in points throughout most of the second half, but Roll stood out with 13 points for the Tartan side. Carnegie Mellon ended the Classic with a 2–7 overall record.
The following week gave the Tartans a chance for redemption when they played their last game of 2008 in Skibo Gymnasium, recording a 53–48 win over Grove City. The Tartans started out strong, leading for most of the first half until the Wolverines caught up and tied the game at 22. In the second half, the Tartans constantly fought off a Wolverine lead, and with 2:51 left on the clock, Carnegie Mellon temporarily fell behind 45–48. The team finished off the game by scoring eight points to mark another win, bringing them to a 3–7 record. Cortese, proving to be a top scorer for the Tartans, once again led the team with a game high 13 points, followed by Aleski and first-year Jennifer Larsen with 10 points each. 
When asked about her individual and team performance, Cortese noted, "Well, most of points come from awesome passes from my teammates, but before games I just try to warm-up like I would play in the game and just have fun. I feel like the team has made a lot of progress over the past two months and we've definitely started to mesh well together. I think that we're going to continue progressing and getting some wins along the way."
The Tartans faced tougher competition in the next few games and fell short of securing any wins against 13th-ranked New York and 5th-ranked Brandeis, 55–42 and 65–44, respectively. In New York, the Violets maintained a definite lead over the Tartans for the entire game. Senior Colleen Light contributed 11 points for the Tartans, while Cortese contributed 10. Against higher-ranked Brandeis in Waltham, Mass., the Judges’ offense proved lethal, with a score of 39–22 at the end of the first half. The Judges maintained the lead till the end. Senior guard Corey Innes scored 12 points while Cortese and Roll added 10 each. 
Finally, just last week in Skibo Gymansium, the Tartans defeated Hiram 70–53. Cortese led the team with 20 points, while Roll nabbed 20 rebounds and 12 points, and Innes also gave 12 points. Also putting in an outstanding performance was sophomore Jessica Buranovsky, with five rebounds and five assists. The Tartans dominated, in points, the entire game and brought their record to 4–9.  
The Tartans will play tonight against Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio with game time set for 7 p.m.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and SUNY Buffalo (UB) are combining information systems technology with design to bring about better public transportation for the disabled. Led by co-directors Aaron Steinfeld, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, and his father, Edward Steinfeld, an architecture professor and head of UB’s Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access (IDEA), this five-year project will help in identifying transportation problems, creating new solutions, and utilizing the public to raise awareness of any issues regarding the transportation system. The U.S. Department of Education’s National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research has granted this project $4.7 million.
Also a major part of the project is the establishment of a new Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Accessible Public Transportation. As stated on rercapt.org, the mission of this center is to “develop ways to empower consumers and transit service providers in the design and evaluation of accessible transportation equipment, information services and physical environments.” This center is the collaborative effort of the IDEA center at UB and Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. As described on its website, the IDEA center focuses on improving the design of products and the environment to make it “more usable, safer and appealing to people,” especially people with disabilities.
Aaron Steinfeld is working on the part of the project that will help the transit industry to identify and deal with accessibility issues. The planned final part of the project will be the launch of a website where riders of buses can report any problems they encounter.
“From the systems level perspective, it is very hard to know where all these problems are and keep track of where they are. We are going to be looking at using information technology to make it easier for people to identify and keep track of all the different problems that may be occurring in a transit environment,” Steinfeld said. “It is really difficult to do an accessibility assessment for an entire transit system and maintain that over time. [We want to] develop this kind of collaborative environment where the riders are identifying problems and the agencies are finding out where the problems are occurring.”
Steinfeld and other teams will be working on trying to make transportation as accessible as possible to the disabled, both in interior design and for boarding and disembarking. “Many of the design requirements for those particular processes are based on either educated guesses or knowledge from the architectural guidelines,” he said. 
“They are not really specialized to the question of transit vehicles, so we’re trying to fill that gap and collect real evidence on how to improve the physical accessibility of getting in and out of a vehicle and moving around a vehicle.”
Other associates that are part of this project include the Gilleg Corp., a California-based bus company and the United Spinal Association, an organization dedicated to helping paralyzed Americans and furthering research for spinal problems. The Quality of Life Technologies Engineering Research Center at Carnegie Mellon and Grimshaw Architects are also associated partners and centers.
The research Steinfeld and his teams are doing can improve the lives of people nationwide. “If we’re able to validate this website approach, we do envision [nationwide use of the designs as] something we could then transfer out to actual practice. For the bus modifications, a major focus is to develop new standards and new design tools to make it more likely that new designs could incorporate the findings.”
This new technology will be initially used for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) and the Port Authority of Allegheny County, both of which will work on the project. One important concept they will be working on is improving the ease of access and design of bus entryways. When the designs are ready to be implemented into a prototype, Gillig Corp., a bus manufacturer, will provide the buses to try out the new designs. This prototype will then be used by the NTFA for commercial testing.
“We expect this partnership to make a significant impact on the usability of public transportation for all riders. We will be completing research that is extremely timely and needed by the industry,” said co-director Edward Steinfeld, who is working on improving vehicle interiors, in an official press release from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute. 
“We have business partners, including manufacturers and consumer advocacy organizations, that will help to implement research findings and disseminate information that directly improve transportation services, vehicles, and facilities.”

In 1939, Captain Bartlett of the Effie M. Morrissey witnessed a remarkable feature while traveling on the waters between Greenland and Iceland. To the southwest of Iceland appeared a glacier around 30 miles away. This appearance would not have been remarkable if the captain had not known that that very glacier, called the Snaefells Jökull glacier, was nearly 350 miles away. On sailing closer, the glacier suddenly seemed to disappear. The captain had seen what we now know to be a mirage. This account, reported in an article in the Alaska Science Forum, is now called the “Arctic mirage.”
The Arctic mirage is not the typical image that comes to one’s mind on hearing the word “mirage.” People usually tend to associate mirages with images of oases floating mysteriously in the midst of deserts. Cartoons usually embellish their oasis-mirages with palm trees and pools of water, and have the characters walk tantalizingly toward the island and jump into a pool, only to taste a mouthful of sand. 
While mirages may not exactly be fanciful images of oases, people have reported seeing complex images like glaciers and simple ones like pools of water on highways. What is more, these images are neither the figments of a person’s imagination nor are they are the products of hallucination; in fact, mirages can be photographed and can be seen by anyone. The cause of these mysterious images is a relatively simple phenomenon known as “refraction.”
Refraction is a phenomenon in which light bends while traveling from one medium, such as air, to another, such as water. The simplest example of refraction is the famous “pencil in water” experiment, in which a pencil kept in a clear glass of water appears bent due to the bending of the rays of light coming out of the water into the air. Mirages are formed by a similar principle. 
For mirages to form, the most important condition is that there have to be two distinct media for the light to pass through. Mirages are formed in regions where one part of the atmosphere is quite hot and hence not very dense, and another part of the atmosphere is relatively colder and much denser. 
The junction of this cold and hot air thus provides an excellent place for the bending of light to occur. The next question that arises is how this simple bending of light causes viewers to see images of objects that don’t even exist.
The simplest example of a mirage is the pool of water that appears to be present in front of cars on highways on hot summer days. On such hot days, the roads are usually very hot and tend to the make the air right above them very hot as well. Higher above, however, the air is much cooler and also denser. 
Thus, there are now two media: the hot air right above the road, and the colder air higher above. The light rays coming from the vehicles on the road that travel straight through the cooler air cause one to perceive the normal image of the car. However, it is the rays of light that travel downward toward the ground that make things interesting.
Rays traveling toward the ground enter the hot air above the road from the cooler air higher above. This change in media causes the light rays to bend upwards. Thus, instead of hitting the surface of the road, the rays of light enter a viewer’s eyes causing the viewer to see an inverted image of the car below the actual car. The brain perceives the inverted image of the car as a reflection of the car in a pool of water, and thus viewers see their “non-existent” pool of water on the highway. 
Such mirages, formed due to the upward bending of light, are called “inferior mirages,” as the mirages normally appear below the actual object. The reverse of this phenomenon causes the formation of “superior mirages,” or inverted images above the actual object.
Perhaps the most intriguing example of a superior mirage is that of the sun. Light rays traveling from the sun to the earth travel from the hot air near the sun to the cooler air near the earth. This situation is the opposite of what happens in inferior mirages. 
When the sun sets and sinks below the horizon, the bending of the light rays cause a mirage of the sun to appear above the actual sun. Thus, one perceives the sun to be well above the horizon when it has actually sunk. Another example of a superior mirage is the Arctic mirage described earlier.
More complex mirages, called “Fata Morgana,” are named after King Arthur’s shapeshifting half-sister.  Fata Morgana are formed mostly in the polar regions, but have sometimes been formed in the deserts as well. These are formed when there are multiple layers of air of different densities. The effect of having such layers in the air is that distorted images of objects can be formed above, below, or even in front of the actual objects. 
The images formed in a Fata Morgana may not necessarily be inverted but can be erect. An interesting effect of the Fata Morgana seems to be that many Arctic explorers in the early days recorded the existence of landmarks that never existed. 
Distant objects projected their images in such a way that explorers claimed to see mountain ranges, peaks, or glaciers in places where there was actually nothing.

Imagine looking in a mirror and seeing a distorted self-image in which one’s hands and legs seem to grow or shrink right before one’s eyes. Although this may seem like a hallucination to the uninformed, those with the Alice in Wonderland Syndrome can experience these symptoms every day.
Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is not caused by a malfunctioning of the eyes, but by an altered perception of images in the brain. It is thus a neurological disease in which patients experience micropsia (a condition where an object appears smaller than usual), macropsia (where an object appears larger than normal), or size distortion. The syndrome is characterized by metamorphosia, which is a distortion of visual images. These distortions can be of two types: a distortion of one’s own body image or an alteration of visual perception, which means that the patients are unable to judge the size of everyday objects like cars and trees and are also unable to judge distances. Other symptoms can include distorted time perception (things moving too quickly or slowly), touch perception (such as feeling oneself sink into the ground), and sound perception.  Scientists have actually been able to look inside a patient’s brain while he or she is experiencing the symptoms of AIWS. An electroencephalogram (EEG) of such patients reveals a sudden increase in electrical activity in the areas of the brain that control vision and the part that processes texture, shape, and size.
This syndrome is often seen in people who experience migraine headaches or in patients who have a family history of severe migraines. In fact, a person who experiences the symptoms of AIWS can sometimes interpret them as an indication of an oncoming severe migraine. Besides migraines, other causes of the disorder include temporal lobe epilepsy or the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause infectious mononucleosis (commonly known as “mono”). Since migraines are linked to AIWS, the treatments for this illness are often drugs that are used against migraines. These can include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, or drugs that activate serotonin receptors in the brain, such as sumatriptan.
The disease’s curious name was coined by John Todd and came from the scene in Lewis Carroll’s novel in which Alice drinks the shrinking potion and becomes but a couple of inches tall. This name, however, may not have been such a coincidence, since Carroll was also speculated to have suffered from migraines and may have been in such a state while writing Alice. Although this illness does not seem very serious, it can be extremely destructive to a person’s everyday life. Rik Helmsey, a patient with AIWS, wrote about his experience in The Guardian and recalled that “seeing the world through a fisheye made my day-to-day life very difficult.... Soon I found it a struggle to leave the house; I had difficulty correctly perceiving the ground, so walking was tricky.... Crossing the road began to feel dangerous; when I saw a car coming, I had no idea what size it was, or how far away.” This illness is more frequently reported in children and can be especially destructive for them, as they sometimes associate AIWS with a psychological problem or believe they are going insane.
Although this illness can be detrimental, symptoms often get less severe and disruptive as the patient grows older. Helmsey stated, “I’m 31 now and, thankfully, experience spatial distortions only about once a month. I’ve got a job ... so I’m not yearning for an explanation or a miracle cure in the way that I was.” However, until a certain cure or treatment is found, these people will continue to live their lives in a wonderland and see the world through their own looking glass.

Studies link singing origins to fish
When most people think of singing animals, they think of birds. However, recent research shows that songbirds’ singing actually originated in a fish called the lungfish. The studies also show that the development of singing in songbirds and humans progresses similarly, starting with little singing abilities until they are tutored by an adult.
Studies of sparrows and northern cardinals, which have very different singing voices, show that both birds’ sounds are produced in the syrinx, or voice box, and are modified by the upper vocal tract and beak movements. Researchers believe that this method of singing in birds originated from the gulping movements that lungfish made to take in air. Such information on the techniques that fish and birds use to sing could improve speech impediment treatments and human singing.

Polarized light impacts wildlife
Scientists have discovered that artificially generated polarized light, which consists of waves vibrating in only one plane, could have dangerous effects on wildlife.
Polarized light occurs in nature as well and is used by many animals as a cue to make different decisions. Due to the horizontal polarized light in water, animals such as birds, insects, and reptiles recognize and respond to polarized light. Additionally, over 300 insect species use polarized light to assist them in navigating while flying. Polarized light generated by roads and buildings is much more intense than natural light and could interfere with animals’ ability to function properly.

Hydrocarbons expose cheating ant
Ants typically take care of their queen’s offspring, rather than reproducing. Some ants, however, attempt to cheat and reproduce. A new study published in Current Biology reveals that these cheaters are caught and attacked by other worker ants due to chemical hydrocarbons that show their fertility status. Other ants could also differentiate eggs based on hydrocarbons and determine if they were laid by the queen.
Fertility hydrocarbons are a reliable method for determining cheaters, because ants cannot concurrently mask their own fertility and make their egg’s hydrocarbons seem like a queen’s egg.

Scientist finds ways  to study sand
Rob Holman, an oceanographer at Oregon State University and an avid collector of sand, has a thousand samples of sand from around the world. His collection is studied by geology students, as well as presented in front of audiences when he gives lectures about oceanography.  Along with collecting sand, Holman has also developed a computerized photography system called Argus to observe the sand at various beaches.
Argus measures the formation and movement of sandbars, and has shown that sandbars move in much more complex patterns than scientists expected. The data collected from Argus is helpful in teaching scientists about beach erosion and rising sea levels due to climate changes.

Patients struggle to pay medical bills
As healthcare costs continue to skyrocket, health is becoming a luxury rather than a priority for many Americans. 
According to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit healthcare research team, about one in three Americans faced difficulties meeting medical payments last year. 
The poll also revealed that nearly half of the Americans surveyed claimed that a family member was postponing or not undergoing medical treatment that they needed. 
In the midst of a deep recession, with daily expenses, monthly bills, and college fees bleeding finances dry, health problems seem to have become a less urgent expense. 
While some health concerns could wait, others could lead to more serious consequences if left untreated.

Coffee addicts more likely to hallucinate
Research conducted in the UK has shown that students who drink large amounts of coffee daily are more likely to “see things” or “hear voices” than those who do not. 
The study, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, tested 200 students and found out that those who drank seven cups of coffee in a day were thrice as likely to see visions than those who drank just one cup. Stress causes the body to release cortisol, a hormone associated with hallucinations. Excessive caffeine intake produces cortisol in larger quantities, leading to delusional behavior. However, academics insist that minor hallucination is not a sign of mental illness, and therefore does not deem coffee injurious to health.

FDA says peanut butter unsafe
The FDA  discourages people from consuming cookies, ice-cream, and other foodstuff that contains peanut butter and peanut paste due to possible salmonella contamination. 
Salmonella poisoning causes diarrhea, fever, and cramps. It is the most common cause of food poisoning in the United States. 
According to federal health officials, over 470 people in 43 states have been affected, including six deaths that could have been caused by the contamination.
Officials are monitoring major peanut butter producers and distributors around the country for further information.

UPMC sues former employee
UPMC filed a lawsuit against former employee and security official Michael R. Tantlinger over confidential patient safety data that could influence the investigation into the death of 89-year-old Rose Lee Diggs, who died on the roof of UPMC Monterfiore last month.
The hospital has accused Tantlinger of stealing the documents and thus violating the employee confidentiality agreement. 
The documents could work against UPMC since they describe in detail how Tantlinger warned the hospital several months ago regarding safety problems with doors that led to the roof.

Christina Cowan has discovered the recipe for success.
Cowan, executive assistant to the director and special projects coordinator at the Institute for Complex Engineered Systems (ICES), is currently working to publish the Carnegie Institute of Technology Staff and Faculty Cookbook, a book that contains treasured recipes contributed by CIT’s very own professors and researchers.
The book is a fund-raising project that will benefit the National Pancreas Foundation. Through this project, Cowan hopes to achieve a dual aim: raise awareness and help for pancreatic illnesses, and unite the CIT faculty behind this cause.
Pancreatic cancer is a life-threatening disease that has recently come to the forefront because of patients like Randy Pausch and Patrick Swayze speaking out. But the idea to raise money for and awareness about pancreatic illnesses actually arose from Cowan’s own personal experience. Two and a half years ago, Cowan was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, an acutely painful disease about which little is known and which, to date, does not have a cure. Cowan recounts her initial fear and frustration after discovering her ailment. When she was initially diagnosed, the only other person she knew with pancreatitis (not knowing it was cancer then) was Randy Pausch. “[Pausch’s] attitude through it all gave me hope,” she wrote in an e-mail. “I got frustrated because every time I would go to the doctor, the answer was always the same, ‘We don’t know.’”
Spurred on by Pausch’s example and her own despair about not being given any answers, Cowan decided to try and make a difference herself by raising money and donating it to the National Pancreas Foundation. “[Throughout] my ordeal with this illness, the National Pancreas Foundation was a real resource for help and information,” Cowan explained. “When you get sick with an illness that is chronic, it helps to know that you are not alone. There is a support network through this foundation that others like me find very helpful. Their mission is to support the research of diseases of the pancreas and to provide information and humanitarian services to those people who are suffering from such illnesses.”
In order to raise funds and awareness, Cowan came up with the idea of putting together a cookbook containing recipes contributed by CIT’s faculty and staff. “I thought of a way that we could raise money and have the CIT faculty and staff want to participate and [the cookbook] idea came to me,” Cowan wrote. “We all love food; I have taken cooking classes in the past; I love to cook, and it seemed like a great idea to get involvement from others as well as a way to raise money.” She approached the rest of her staff at ICES, and along with their support began to put the book together.
The book features a variety of recipes that cater to everyone’s taste buds, as well as diet restrictions. For example, one of the recipes featured is couscous with feta, which makes a healthy; low-fat meal for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. A richer meal can be created by following the delicious Easy Chicken Bake recipe, which is also included in the book.
The book also creates mass appeal — after all, who can resist the great combination of good food and a good cause? “CIT does a lot of programs to help the community, but this one will be more special because we are actually supporting the cause of someone amongst us,” commented Manasi Kishor Patil, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major. “Also, I love food, so I will definitely buy the book to support this cause.”
The book is set to be published this summer. Cowan says that the response has been flattering so far, and the support and encouragement even more so. Recipes are being procured from many other places as well. Restaurants in Squirrel Hill and Shadyside have agreed to contribute recipes to the book. This is especially kind of these restaurants, as usually in the restaurant business recipes are kept top secret.
Cowan confides that among the recipes she has so far, she thinks Research Professor Phil Campbell’s picadillo recipe is quite excellent. Of course, the only way to get that recipe would be to buy the book.
More information of the project and a way to submit recipes can be found at http://www.ices.cmu.edu/cookbookproject.

When asked about what made her show special, Lara Hillier, a senior in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama, had to laugh. Hillier, a seasoned actor and multiple-time winner of the Pittsburgh Public Theater’s annual Shakespeare Monologue and Scene Competition, has never done a show quite like this before.
“It’s an entirely different theatrical experience because of the swimming pool on stage,” she said, referring to the 4500-gallon goliath that occupies center stage, with a boardwalk and staircases surrounding it.
Hillier first got into acting as a child, when she began singing with a choir. When her group was working on a song that called for some acting, she stepped up to the role and fell in love. “I caught the bug early on,” she recalled, giggling. “I was a little ham as a kid.”
Since then, Hillier soared through the ranks, enrolling in Shakespeare competitions at the Public since age 11, falling in love with the Bard, and even playing Miranda in the Public’s production of The Tempest during her senior year of high school. Though she confessed herself “spoiled to be exposed to classical text at an early age,” since coming to college, she found herself enjoying more contemporary pieces as well. Now, participating in what must be one of the most intriguing mixes of classical and contemporary theater in Pittsburgh, Hillier is ideally suited for her roles.
Metamorphoses, the Pittsburgh Public Theater’s current production, draws on classical myths and tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, which were themselves a Latin collection of familiar Greek myths, all having to do with the subject of miraculous transformation. Many of the myths are no doubt familiar: “Orpheus and Eurydice,” “Baucis and Philemon,” and “Cupid and Psyche” are just a few of the tales that lie in store for the audience.
The play itself was a contemporary take on classic myths, interwoven with modern situations and often containing stories within stories. Phaeton saw a psychiatrist for counseling after his ill-fated attempt at guiding his father’s chariot across the sky, and businessman Midas tried to make amends for what his “gift” had done. Many more such twists and turns kept viewers unfamiliar with the myths enthralled while providing a treat for curious classicists.
Admittedly, working with a pool on stage and in use during every scene did have some drawbacks. After the first scene, Hillier was completely drenched and had to change into dry clothing in under a minute before she came on stage again.
“It’s a challenge,” she noted, but added that the pool has brought with it more fun moments than hassle.
“When you’re rehearsing in your bikinis, you become really close,” she laughed, explaining that though the group is half-local and half-international, everyone has become great friends. Hillier, the youngest of the cast, loves it. “It’s a lot of fun watching them work.”
Hillier, who plays Alcyone, as well as several other roles ranging from goddess to wood nymph, was mesmerizing to watch on stage. Her posture, moods, and countenance all altered to reflect the kind of person (or divinity) she portrayed, and, as Alcyone, she delivered her lines with such raw emotion that the audience gasped, captivated by her all-encompassing character and her desperate plea. “She’s in love with her husband and has enormous heart,” Hillier said, commenting on her character. “The moral of her story is that good things happen to good people. She has this amazing, fiery spirit.”
And, sure enough, Hillier’s Alcyone set the audience on fire. Her words reached the theater’s rafters, compelling and bewitching her listeners and rousing the crowd to an enthusiastic applause at the end of her performance.
Metamorphoses progressed cleanly from story to story, with some stories made clearer for those unfamiliar with them, and some subtly interwoven into the show. There was always something going on during the performance, always some story being told, whether in the foreground or the background, and it kept the audience constantly intrigued, always anxious to see what the cast would do next.
From (literally) jovial moments to the depths of despair, Metamorphoses showcased the extremes of human emotion, reminding the audience that sometimes the greatest transformation is not visible nor always readily apparent to others. The play ended with a unique knitting together of the stories involved and a scene that showed a slower, but more meaningful, transformation of the self.
After the production, the audience milled around the lobby floor while a jazz singer crooned out favorite tunes and the cast fanned through the crowd. Hillier, who will be graduating this spring, is looking forward to traveling to New York and Los Angeles in March and May.
“I just want to keep working,” she said. “I would love to stay here on the East Coast or in New York.” Hillier’s dream role would be to play Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, but for now, she’ll see where the world takes her. From memorizing lines to belting them out on stage, she puts her whole self into all aspects of her career.
“You’d probably catch me roaming the streets of Shadyside, taking to myself like a crazy person,” Hillier laughed, describing her technique for getting her lines down. But, all in all, she noted, “It’s an amazing lifestyle.”
Metamorphoses will be showing at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in the Cultural District until Feb. 15. Tickets are $15.50 for students and the show starts at 8 p.m.

With much anticipated pomp and circumstance, the inauguration of Barack Obama promises this nation fresh hope and proof of the landmark changes promised in his campaign. About 2 million people are expected to make the pilgrimage to the capital to hear President-elect Obama recite the classic words. For many, Obama’s speeches represent the fundamental themes of American greatness.
As he explained to ABC news, Obama wishes to “project confidence that if we take the right measures, that we can once again be that country, that beacon for the world.” And the whole country, too, is waiting to see the defining moment of America’s “rebirth” and rise of a modern Geist.
Coinciding with the inauguration, Future Tenant Galleries and guest curator Lauri Mancuso (BFA ’91) are exhibiting Sworn In, a multimedia group show featuring politically-minded works. The exhibit was modeled after the Presidential Art Collection, with works mimicking those in the White House salon. However, unlike the Presidential Art Collection, the gallery had a slouchy air with dimmed lights, free beer, and sinfully casual red walls.
The exhibit opened on Friday, Jan. 16 with amateur video showings, and live music that seemed to be a cross between Meredith Monk and The Cranberries. The works ranged from presidential portraits to ironic presidential pet portrait tapestries. The most notable works included “American Landscape,” an oil on linen by David Mirello, and “Reprobate’s Offering,” an oil on canvas by Darien D’Alfonzo (BFA ‘84). 
“American Landscape” has a surreal aesthetic depicting a mythical siren and a flame-breathing unicorn battling in a bleak, Waiting for Godot reminiscent landscape. The metaphors evaded most viewers, yet it was nonetheless inventive and technically masterful. 
“Reprobate’s Offering” depicted a man in a bedroom, stepping on glass and placing an empty jar on top of a closet. The painting echoed the style of Diego Rivera, with flat and geometric planes of color. The title suggests that the man in the painting was a reprobate, or Catholic soul pre-ordained to damnation. This nihilistic imagery was the most critical foreshadowing of the years to come.
The exhibit also included works by Edgar Um Bucholtz (BFA ‘92), Sarah Smith (San Francisco, Calif. and Carnegie Mellon alumna, BFA ‘91), Akil Harris, Spoon Popkin, Ben Gersch, Jennifer Lee (BFA ‘00), Suzann Miriello, and John Riegert (BFA ‘92). Overall, the rest of the works seem inconsequential to the inauguration.
While Tuesday’s events grip the nation with unbridled joy and anticipation, this show failed to replicate or subvert the same energy. When one first thinks of “political” art, he or she might envision cynical leftist propaganda exposing the alleged idiocy, injustice, or immoderation of our nation’s leaders. Yet, the art works exhibited did not portray any political agendas or initiatives. Most of the works failed to exploit or appropriate current political ideologies or symbols. While many locals braved the cold to attend the opening, the audience was overwhelmingly apathetic and disinterested. The inauguration itself is a parade of the American ego, a celebration of our very own national identity, but Sworn In failed to embody this spirit.

Sunday night’s Golden Globes ceremony provided entertainment for all — including avid movie-goers, dedicated sitcom fans, and students dreading classes the next morning — with surprising winners, a seemingly drunk presenter, and a moment between director and actor that was censored for the West Coast broadcast.
Jennifer Lopez opened the show with a brief greeting. No time for fancy words, folks, this isn’t the Oscars. Not to mention NBC had until 11 p.m. to air the entire live broadcast of the awards show before “the 11 o’clock news” cut them off. Wait a tick — that practically happened!
Winners were giving long speeches and presenters were trying (and failing) to add humorous improvisation to the show. As the last award was being announced, patrons could be seen leaving the gala early.
Kyra Singh, a sophomore economics and statistics major, found the show “surprisingly boring. It wasn’t as entertaining as I thought it would be, and I felt like the affair was treated very informally, which isn’t what I expect when I think of the Golden Globes.”
Others agreed, such as Leonie Barrett, a sophomore biological sciences major, who was really excited when Kate Winslet won Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Reader. “I mean, her speech was a little long,” said Barrett, “but I love Kate and she looked gorgeous. For some reason, though, the celebrities didn’t seem as elegant as they usually do.”
Kate Winslet also received a Golden Globe for Best Actress, winning over Meryl Streep and Angelina Jolie, meaning she won awards in both categories in which she was nominated. Saskia Op den Bosch, a sophomore cognitive science and Chinese studies major, was very surprised “to see Meryl and Angelina leave the Golden Globes without an award. I’m happy for Kate, but wow, what a surprise!” Ricky Gervais was not surprised. As a presenter, Gervais was, to some, a highlight of the show. Barrett felt the best parts of the night were “Kate winning two awards and that drunken British guy killing time.”
With beer in his hand and resentment in his heart, Gervais shushed the crowd, and with a “how rude are you lot?” the show suddenly became so much more entertaining. On live television for almost two full minutes, Gervais, an English actor, comedian, and former Golden Globe winner, admitted that it’s “kinda annoying” not being nominated this year. His plan of having “sex with 200 middle-aged journalists ... was horrible,” and with jokes about how Holocaust films — like The Reader — always win awards, he became one of the funniest presenters of the night.
Kate Winslet’s second win left her flabbergasted. She managed to sputter out her apologies to “Anne, Meryl, Kristin, oh God who’s the other one… Angelina,” before forcing herself to “gather” and continue on with a proper speech thanking her husband and fellow cast-member Leonardo DiCaprio.
After all the amusement and absurdity of the night, two awards had yet to be announced: Best Actor and Best Picture. By this time the speeches and presenters had left little time to announce the winners! 
Against highly respected names and established films, the biggest winners — and surprises — came when Mickey Rourke won Best Actor and Slumdog Millionaire won Best Picture. Slumdog Millionaire won an award in every category it was nominated for, four total, leaving both Frost/Nixon and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with no awards, each having received five nominations.
This year’s Golden Globes was highly anticipated after last year’s writers’ strike prevented an actual awards show to be aired. While drawing in fewer viewers than the 2007 Golden Globes, this year’s show is likely to be remembered due to the unexpected wins and the number of complaints filed to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
As The Wrestler director Darren Aronofsky playfully gave his actor, Mickey Rourke, “the finger,” cameras just so happened to catch the moment and broadcast it live. More than 22 complaints have been filed with the FCC concerning this gesture as well as foul language caught on microphone by some of the winners and presenters.
With all the excitement of this year’s show, we can only wait eagerly to see what next year will bring.

With the recession being heard and felt around the world, it’s now common practice to cut back on spending, and there’s been a wake-up call to everyone to only spend within their means. With every sector performing worse now than even a year ago, it can be difficult to remain optimistic for the future. The fashion world, too, has not been invulnerable to what feels like a rolling river of unemployment, volatile oil prices, bankrupt banks, and an overall feeling of shock and anxiety as everyone waits for the next wave to hit.
Department stores from Macy’s to Saks have reported much lower revenue earnings for 2008, and prominent fashion designers also took the economic downtown seriously, with Betsey Johnson and Vera Wang taking their spring 2009 shows off Bryant Park and into more down-to-earth, intimate settings. Even during New York Fashion Week, there was a noticeable pattern of reuse — patterns and silhouettes from past years made a comeback, like the use of strong shoulders harmonious to those in the 1980s. At Bryant Park, there was a resurgence of extravagant accessories, ones that could easily drape, match, or contrast for easy, long-term use.
Amid the array of shows, there were also murmurs of bringing back denim, a long-time controversial material that seems to be on most critics’ good sides now. On campus, Hannah Lee, a 2008 graduate in business administration, wore a fitted, perfectly broken-in denim jacket over a colorful geometric shift dress, a combination that’s unexpected but looks modern and slightly edgy. Lee’s use of denim is an excellent example of how one does not need to keep spending on the latest trends, instead revamping outfits with pieces one already owns, which can be just as chic, if not more so.
With accessories as the focal point of many spring shows, it’s no surprise that it’s also easiest to take advantage of, since people already own a variety of bags, shoes, and jewelry. Annie Teng, a junior design major, showed off her effortless ability to infuse a shot of color and texture into her outfit with a satin deep purple bag, and almost-as-purple suede peep-toe pumps. Like with her Dolce and Gabbana jeans, Teng knows how to spot a great investment piece, one that is timeless, excellent quality and that will never go out of style.
The overall message emanating from fashion designers and fashion lovers alike seems to be that in times of hardship, it’s important to be creative in recycling what’s already in your closet and putting them to good use. If you own an oversized piece like a cardigan or blazer, pick up a belt or two garnished with jewels or sequins at a vintage or thrift shop to go with it. If you have a classic, feminine bag collecting dust, it’s time to break it out again and pair it with simple, slightly masculine outfits to exude a mysterious, ultra-modern look. For someone with lots of outdated jewelry, consider visiting a craft store to deconstruct and reassemble them to create one-of-a-kind pieces.

By now, you’ve probably all heard TBS’s motto: “very funny.” Well, if they keep churning out original comedies like 10 Items or Less, that moniker will be more than rightly deserved. Taking place in a grocery store that has served customers for over 150 years, the setting offers plenty of opportunities for grocer-related jokes and pratfalls. And if nothing else, the show’s setting is definitely unique and, from what I know, unheard of. John Lehr, who plays store manager Leslie, leads a cast full of relative unknowns in this largely improvised show that has just now entered its third season.
As Leslie, John Lehr is hilarious, and is the heir of Greens & Grains, a small mom-and-pop grocery store in Dayton, Ohio. Leslie was a struggling New York City businessman who moved back to his hometown after inheriting the store following his father’s death. As the lovable yet somewhat absentminded and oblivious owner, Lehr is the catalyst of the show, and every scene with him is one laugh after another. He is supported by a wide array of co-workers, most of whom are forgettable. However, Carl, played by Bob Clendenin, and Todd, played by Chris Payne Gilbert, usually perform at least up to the level of Leslie. Carl, who you may recognize as an extra in one of many other shows, plays a goofy yet lovable stock boy who fathered a Latino co-worker’s child and gets most of the face time apart from Lehr. Todd, the butcher whose dream is to make it as a NASCAR driver, is off the wall as the loose cannon of the cast, prone to abrupt displays of outrage but also shown to have a gentler side.
Each episode usually plays out in similar fashion. Taking a chip off the Seinfeld block, and for newer folks, the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia block, the show really is about nothing, though the gang is constantly trying not to get run out of business by the Super Value Mart across the street — to varying degrees of success, of course. In fact, veteran TV actress Kim Coles (In Living Color) recently joined the cast as the manager of the Super Value Mart, though she was rather unimpressive in her season three debut episode. Lehr is usually the centerpiece in getting his store involved in some foolhardy scheme, during which things go awry, although the staff of Greens & Grains somehow make it out of every mess better off than they were before it. Occasionally, Leslie’s co-workers start off as the ringleaders in some ridiculous project; those episodes are usually varied in their success rates, but keep on the lookout for a Todd- or Carl-centric episode.
The show itself is well-written, drawing a few similarities to hit Comedy Central show Reno 911!, with veteran writers Robert Hickey, Nancy Hower, and Lehr himself taking the helm since the series premiere. The trio first banded together on the set of the critically acclaimed mockumentary Memron, which poked fun at the Enron scandal. However, as with Reno, the show is completely unscripted, with only the situations set up in advance. Lehr provides the basis for much of the improvisation, with his fellow actors joining in alongside him, and has stated that each 25-minute episode is constructed using about 30 hours of dialogue that was filmed.
This show definitely has a chance to compete during its less-than-stellar timeslot on Tuesdays at 11 p.m. It already has a steady, though not large, following that has pushed the series into its third season, and it has the makings of, at worst, a cult hit. It’s definitely better than what the ratings suggest and deserves more than other still-on-air shows, like Tyler Perry’s House of Payne.
In the end, give this upstart comedy a chance. It’s clever and will assuredly give you a good laugh. Also, 10 Items or Less is a breath of fresh air from the same old recycled garbage that other networks spit out every year. It’s well worth the 20 minutes of your week you’ll spend on it. 10 Items or Less airs on Tuesdays at 11 p.m. on TBS.

Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes, is set in a suburban New York neighborhood in 1955. Originally a novel written by Richard Yates, this film explores the troubled marriage of two unhappy and unsatisfied individuals who live life in suburbia. Revolutionary Road takes its audience on the tumultuous and sometimes overly dramatic journey of settling for a life that is less than acceptable, a life filled with cigarette smoke, alcohol, yelling, and chair-throwing. Despite some of the unrealistic points in the plot, the acting and directing are successful in keeping the audience intrigued.
Mendes begins this film with April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) playing the lead role in a local and quite unsuccessful theater production of The Petrified Forest, while her husband Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) sits in the audience. Knowing that the production was a complete failure, April takes out her anger on Frank and he does nothing to help improve this touchy situation. After the first of many violent arguments, Frank and April make it pretty clear that they ruined each other’s lives. With the opening 30 minutes looking like this, it seems that things for the Wheelers won’t improve. 
In an attempt to give the audience a much less intense moment, Frank and April decide to pack up their lives and their kids and move to Paris; this had been a dream of Frank’s for a long time. Don’t get too happy, though: this joy doesn’t last for long. While preparing to move, April gets pregnant, Frank gets offered a better job, and they meet an insane man (Michael Shannon) who can see through their phony suburban lifestyle. All of these things combined with more drama makes their departure from their house on Revolutionary Road nearly impossible.
Winslet’s performance in Revolutionary Road — for which she was awarded a Golden Globe — is remarkable. Not only does she deliver a memorable portrayal of her character, but she makes all of the right acting decisions in terms of actions and physicality. DiCaprio certainly does well, but it isn’t his best performance. In some scenes he seems as if he is forcing himself to become Frank. The friendship that Winslet and DiCaprio share in real life certainly spills into Revolutionary Road. Choosing these two actors was a wise choice. Their on-screen chemistry is not only natural, but equally heartfelt. 
It would seem that Mendes was trying to create a film that could speak to the masses, and Revolutionary Road certainly is capable of doing so. Even though some moments are too dramatic, the journey that the audience takes with the Wheelers is disturbingly thought-provoking. Everyone either knows the Wheelers — people who have bought into the falsity of settling down and watching dreams fade away — or actually are the Wheelers.

In an age of rampant indulgence and lollygagging, The Oakland Savings and Trust Company advertises with a good dose of moderation. Boasting that it tries to “treat its patrons just a little better than any other bank,” Oakland Savings offers superior service, but nothing that would cause you to succumb to a hedonist lifestyle.

Carnegie Mellon chooses the representative from Delta Gamma as its Thistle Queen. The decision process was “very difficult,” and involved interviews that covered art, show business, and future plans for education. The winner is a major in home economics. However, she is not planning on attending graduate school, as a doctoral thesis would prove to be too theoretical.

Core curriculum coordinator Andrew Achenbaum vows to crack down on poor writing by instituting university-wide standards on required writing courses. The current basic level writing class may accept fewer exemptions for incoming freshmen. Thankfully, we can all see that this writing problem has been remedied. Now, if only we can solve the problem of computer literacy on our technology-disabled campus!

“A Person’s Opinion” asks students about traditions they follow during the  holiday season. A history major eats greens and black-eyed peas for money. Another student washes her face in a water and silver coin solution for wealth in the new year. Not all traditions were so innocent to the economy. An economics major claimed that his family invested in sub-prime mortgage lending.

The Zebra Lounge is finally open to the public. The lounge, which was a dream of CFA’s Dean Martin Prekop, had been in construction for a few months. Prekop led the creative design of the café, built tables and chairs, and painted the furniture with the characteristic black and white stripes that lend the coffee shop its name.

Beyoncé. Mary J. Blige. Bono. Garth Brooks. Sheryl Crow. Renee Fleming. Josh Groban. Herbie Hancock. Heather Headley. John Legend. Jennifer Nettles. John Mellencamp. Usher Raymond IV. Shakira. Bruce Springsteen. James Taylor. will.i.am. Jonas Brothers. Stevie Wonder.
Throw in a hundred marching bands, Yo-Yo Ma, and a pheasant in a sour cherry chutney, and you’ve got yourself an inauguration. Slate’s Jack Shafer recently described Barack Obama as “an ocean that refuses no river,” and the smorgasbord of inaugural music seems to confirm that appraisal. Obama’s also been called the first president of the iPod generation, thanks to the eclecticism of his musical taste (first revealed in Rolling Stone last summer) and his popularity among blog darlings like The Arcade Fire and their fans. Don’t doubt the shrewdness of this particular medley, though: Obama is gunning for the pleasure centers of pretty much every demographic except metalheads and noiseniks. My parents will nod approvingly to the crooning of James Taylor and Garth Brooks — Garth Brooks?! — even though it’s likely that my dad wouldn’t know Beyoncé from Blagojevich. “If you liked it [the Ill. Senate seat], then you shoulda put a ring on it [my corrupt gubernatorial finger]!” My sister and I will suffer through Sheryl Crow and Josh Groban for the sake of Mary J. Blige.
A lot of the pundit chatter since Nov. 4 has been speculation about what kind of president Obama will be — liberal? centrist? spendthrift? pragmatist? — much of which has been fueled by supposed discord in the blogosphere regarding his Cabinet choices. With these musical selections, I think we can see yet again that Obama’s initial strategy is to cast his net wide, pitch a rather gigantic tent, and build his coalition big. No red states, no blue states… Ladies and gentlemen, The United Playlist of America!
Perhaps all of this is just inaugural bluster that will dissipate as soon as the president-elect is done high-fiving the Lincoln Bible. We will all retreat to our respective Blogspots and Twitters — Republicans to lick their raw electoral wounds, Democrats to gloat and hope. But for now, I think it’s worth noting that for at least a few days, the Beltway has become the click wheel of the world’s largest iPod: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States ... so help me Steve Jobs.”

Dear Joe,
In class, I always like to give my view of what’s happening. Because of this, I frequently raise my hand and ask many questions. While I find that my questions often give insight to problems, some fellow students think otherwise. I was told by someone that I was distracting the entire class. In a democratic classroom, shouldn’t I be allowed to have my say?
—Hands Up in Hamerschlag
Dear Hands,
Yes, you do have a right to raise your hand. You also have the right to nag your waiter for a new spoon, or take an inordinate amount of pennies from the “give a penny, take a penny” tray. However, Hands, rights aren’t always right. Questions in class should be saved for when a student is confused, or when a comment helps express a viewpoint that facilitates the class. All too often, though, we are faced with students who ask questions that divert attention, waste class time, or demand praise. 
Maybe it’s true that your questions are helpful, but if they’re starting to annoy other students, then maybe it’s time to start questioning your questions. How much time are your questions taking? Are you rambling? Could you just ask the professor after class? You may just find that you fall under the classification of “That Guy.”
“That Guy” is notorious for always raising his hand, giving “insight,” and using words such as “ignorant” and “esoteric” to describe basically everything. No cure is yet known for “That Guy,” so I can only hope, Hands, that your issue is an isolated incident. If you have any questions about this article, please wait until you’ve read it in its entirety, and then e-mail me afterward. And no, I will not award extra credit if your response is over five pages long.
Happy handed, 
Joe
Dear Joe,
Brrr! It’s frigid outside! As a freshman from Hawaii, I’m starting to think about whether going to college in a freezer is a good idea. How do I get through this period of frigidness and keep my sanity?
—Frigid in Fairfax
Dear Frigid,
As a northerner, I have grown used to (but not affectionate toward) the annual arctic blast. What’s resulted is a pretty systematic method toward surviving the cold. Granted, it may seem somewhat unorthodox, but if you want to feel your hands, then you’ll listen. First off, on an especially freezing day, try to dress in layers. Given the current weather, I would suggest seven to eight layers. From outside in, this includes a parka, a winter jacket, a hoodie, a sweater, a long-sleeved T-shirt, a short-sleeved T-shirt, an undershirt, and a layer of petroleum gel to guard against any water. Scarves, earmuffs, gloves, and snow goggles are also necessary to the equation. We’ll leave from the waist down as an exercise for the reader.
Besides dress, keeping warm in a cold, cold world requires hot food and drink. With that said, scrap your iced coffee and fruit salad, and instead choose hearty foods with large amounts of fat and salt so as to provide a layer of blubber to protect you from the elements. Choosing any food that includes bacon, sour cream, or chili is moving in the right direction. For drinks, just put whatever you’re about to drink in the microwave for 30 seconds, and your beverage becomes “hot.” This is great for hot tea, hot soda, and hot water. Finally, winter’s dreariness can sometimes cause not only coldness of the body, but coldness of the soul. Stay warm with your family, friends, and acquaintances. Remember, they have to deal with this misery of bitterness for the next three months as well.
Stay warm, 
Joe

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that over 1 billion people worldwide have little or no access to safe, clean water. UNICEF launched the Tap Project in New York City in 2007 when they discovered that $1 can provide clean drinking water for a child for 40 days.
According to the project’s website, www.tapproject.org, the Tap Project is “based on the simple concept that restaurants would ask their patrons to donate $1 or more for the tap water they usually enjoy for free, and all funds raised would support UNICEF’s efforts to bring clean and accessible water to millions of children around the world.” In 2007, 300 restaurants in New York agreed to be part of the Tap Project, and in 2008, over 2000 more restaurants nationwide signed on. Now, in 2009, Carnegie Mellon is getting involved.
Amy Badiani, a sophomore in H&SS and the Carnegie Mellon Awareness Chair for Amnesty International, recently noticed that Pittsburgh was not on the list of cities participating in the Tap Project. She decided to partner with Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) to get Carnegie Mellon to play an instrumental role in this cause.
“Amnesty International is a group dedicated to promoting human rights and equality,” said Badiani, “and SIFE is a group dedicated to sustaining business leadership and economic opportunity. We are excited to combine forces and bring the Tap Project to our campus and the Pittsburgh community.”
Amnesty and SIFE will be joining thousands of volunteers across the nation to ask local restaurants to participate in the project during World Water Week, which is March 22–28.
“We also plan to reach out to Pittsburgh government officials,” Badiani said, “asking them to support us by reading and signing a proclamation. In addition to this, we would like to raise more awareness of the Tap Project cause on campus through multiple events during each day of World Water Week, including an exhibition on the world water crisis.”
Sruthi Reddy Chintakunta, a sophomore in electrical and computer engineering, develops project initiatives for SIFE. She explained that “SIFE is a business organization trying to bring about economic sustainability in different communities around the world, and the UNICEF Tap Project was a perfect opportunity to collaborate with a humanitarian organization like Amnesty.”
Students interested in being a part of the Carnegie Mellon Tap Project initiative should send an e-mail to tapprojectcmu@gmail.com. The details for the group’s first volunteer meeting will be announced soon.
Editor’s Note: Amy Badiani is a junior staffwriter for The Tartan.

Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon has made efforts to improve environmental sustainability on campus, such as establishing the campus policy to make all newly constructed buildings meet Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) silver certification. Cohon has an undergraduate degree in civil engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Cohon has recently received criticism for his failure to join over 600 of his peers in signing what has become a highly publicized and scrutinized document: the Presidents Climate Compact (PCC).
The compact aims to “address the climate challenge by eliminating global warming emissions and by integrating sustainability into [the university’s] curriculum ... [and to] better serve their students and meet their social mandate to help create a thriving, ethical and civil society.”
This past November, the William J. Clinton Foundation announced a partnership with five major banks, including Citibank, J.P. Morgan Chase, and UBS, that will provide universities that sign the compact with financial incentives to achieve carbon neutrality. Carnegie Mellon demonstrates the qualities valued by the compact in numerous ways. Various organizations on campus such as Sustainable Earth and Eco-Reps provide outlets for students to impact the sustainability of our campus and talk with fellow students about environmental issues.
Carnegie Mellon’s interdisciplinary departments, such as the engineering and public policy (EPP)  department, offer classes that entail interactive research. In the spring of 2008, EPP students completed a carbon emissions inventory and made recommendations for carbon reductions on the Carnegie Mellon campus.
By agreeing to sign the compact, the president of the university agrees to make certain efforts towards achieving carbon neutrality.
The requirements are numerous and include benchmarks that Carnegie Mellon has already surpassed. 
For example, the compact requires that participating universities purchase at least 15 percent of electricity from renewable sources within one year of signing. 
In 2009, 21 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s electricity will come from renewable or “green” sources, including landfill gas and wind energy.
Although Carnegie Mellon is ahead of many peer institutions who have signed the compact, there remains no single way to compare carbon emissions of one university to another. 
The compact requires all universities to perform a calculation of total carbon emissions but requires no uniform standards, making it impossible to measure one university’s progress against another.
The compact website verifies there is currently “no established certification system for carbon offsets” and recommends that participating campuses use the “Clean Air Cool Planet’s Campus Carbon Calculator.” One member of the compact, the College of the Atlantic, is heading a committee to establish these standards, but there is no timeline available for anticipated results. The interim “Clean Air Cool Planet” calculating tool that was recommended tells those collecting data to “be creative and be patient; the process may be imperfect but the results will be worth it.” 
Carnegie Mellon researchers in the engineering and public policy department were so concerned about the implications of the sudden appearance of online carbon calculation tools that they published their concerns and co-authored an article for Environmental Science & Technology in summer 2008.
One of the authors, associate professor of engineering and public policy H. Scott Matthews, collaborated with decision science and EPP professor Paul Fischbeck to develop an alternative plan meant to accomplish the same goals as the President’s Climate Compact, but in a more efficient manner.
Matthews and Fischbeck restructured the chronology of the compact, the main difference being that they ask universities to make the carbon-neutral pledge only after extensive investigative research and future planning. 
This way, universities will not commit to an unrealistic goal before committing fully to a strict pledge. This more flexible process allows universities to work at their own pace while still taking the necessary steps to become carbon-neutral.
While the PCC addresses the larger issues of global warming, officials addressed the role of university students in increasing sustainability on campus. Austin Redwood, president of Sustainable Earth, was quoted last month in The Tartan noting that “simple, easy things can make a huge impact. Our role as students is to do our part because there is still room for improvement.... Start a recycle-a-thon. Turn off the lights.”
Students asked to respond to this advice seemed intrigued about how small changes in their lifestyles could collectively decrease the size of Carnegie Mellon’s carbon footprint.
Sophomore business major Josh Weiner and sophomore chemical engineering major Briana Wallace both agreed that they would be more than happy to try some of Redwood’s simple suggestions. 
Weiner mentioned that he makes a point to turn off his lights in his room: “When I’m going to class or whatever, it’s something I just trained myself to do because I know it’s right.” Wallace said that she often forgot to use the recycling bins located around campus, but “it’s good that they’re there; when I do remember, I feel good about making a difference, even though it’s a small one.”
In its Nov./Dec. 2007 issue, the Sierra Club Magazine named Carnegie Mellon one of the “Top 10 Schools That Get It,” praising our campus for its green roofs and the country’s first LEED- certified residence hall. 
Of the 10 schools that made the Sierra Club list, Carnegie Mellon, Tufts University, Harvard College, and Pennsylvania State University have yet to sign the PCC, while six of the top 10, including Oberlin College, Duke University, and Middlebury College, have all committed.
If  Cohon continues to leave the President’s Climate Compact unsigned, he can be confident the Carnegie Mellon community has already proved it may be the best possible place to come up with an alternative.

Carngie Mellon’s Project Build Your Own Business, which is part of Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE), sponsored the Build Your Own Business (BYOB) Idea Competition on Dec. 3, 2008.
Participants submitted business proposals and were interviewed, and the top five presented in front of a panel of judges featuring Lauren Weinstein, academic adviser for the Tepper School of Business;  Robert Culbertson, professor of entrepreneurship; and Gordon Vanscoy, a junior business administration major who won the BYOB Idea Competition two years ago. The winning student will get a chance to work with Project BYOB over this spring semester in order to implement his or her idea.
This BYOB event was sponsored by Infosys Technologies, a global leader in the “next generation” of IT and consulting with revenues of over $4 billion, 
alongside InStep, their global internship program for undergraduate, graduate, MBA, and Ph.D. students.
The Idea Competition resulted in an extremely close call between Joshua Kresge, a junior business administration student, with his idea of Rebate Rabbit, and Abhinav Gautam, a first-year computer science major, with his idea of iCampus. Kresge won the competition by one point, but SIFE decided to work with both Kresge and Gautam. Their ideas will be implemented this semester.
The judges mentioned that “Kresge had an advantage owing to his presentation and prior experience.” This was reflected in the way he went about Rebate Rabbit, which Kresge explained “is a portal site for the web-hosting industry. It is the perfect solution for both web hosts and web-hosting customers. The concept of RebateRabbit.com is simple: Consumers who are looking to create a website need to find the web host that is right for them.”
When asked about the scope of such a business, Kresge said, “It is a highly competitive market that no one company really dominates. 
Some estimates from the web hosts we currently deal with are as high as 20,000 new customers a month. This market will continue to grow exponentially for as long as the Internet is around.”
Abhinav Gautam’s idea involves building iPhone applications to make life at Carnegie Mellon easier. 
He mentions that he would start with one application, iChalk, and then build more around it.
Gautam explained, “iChalk is an application that will bring all Carnegie Mellon events to the user on their iPhone. It should have a complimentary website where student organizations, academic departments, and other organizations can upload their event information for free.”
Users can run the application to automatically download all the events. 
They will then have the option to delete and save their favorite events, and even export their events to other calendars.
Yamna Khan and Swati Gupta, both first-year CIT majors, proposed the idea of a handicrafts store that would import and sell Asian goods at a reasonable price.
Even though they did not win, both Gupta explained that, “BYOB caught our attention, since as a freshman engineer we don’t really get to be entrepreneurial. It was a truly invigorating experience and we got to learn a lot from it.”
The Idea Competition promoted the spirit of entrepreneurship in the Carnegie Mellon community. “There is definitely a need for entrepreneurship in the Carnegie Mellon community,” Vanscoy said. “It is a great asset to people not just from business administration, but for people from all majors. The BYOB Idea Competition is an initiative which encourages people to come forward with their ideas and learn some important skills at the same time.”

The issue of gay rights has been the subject of debate for several decades and has spun off into different arenas including marriage and the military.
Actions of student groups like ALLIES take the position that, according to ALLIES president and electrical and computer engineering junior Jordan Rubenstein, it is essential to “promote tolerance and prevent discrimination through various programming.”
A recent piece of legislation considered by the Human Relations Commission of Allegheny County seems to suggest increasing support for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals by including clauses which assure that all individuals, “regardless of ... gender identity or sexual orientation” be afforded “equal opportunities for employment, housing and use of public accommodation facilities.”
With the passing of this legislation, the county would be adopting the anti-discriminatory laws that seem commonplace within the city limits of Pittsburgh. Many students, including sophomore materials science major Youngeun Kim, believe that this is a step in the right direction.
Kim stated that “everyone should be treated equally regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation.” However, the reaction of the American Family Association (AFA) of Pennsylvania, an organization based on traditional Judeo-Christian values, demonstrates a counterview expressed by many religious conservative groups.
In an action alert sent out to residents of Allegheny County by e-mail, the AFA urges citizens to “call your County Council member and ask him or her not to support the formation of a County Human Relations Commission or changes in the county non-discrimination laws” because of its inclusion of protection for LGBT individuals.
The group’s opposition to the ordinance is one of the more recent developments in a series of lobbying efforts and boycotts against companies who show “support of the homosexual agenda including same-sex marriage,” according to the AFA of Pennsylvania’s webpage.
In the past, this has included boycotts against McDonald’s for using their corporate power and money to support “the gay agenda” and against Hallmark for the sale of gay wedding and coming-out cards.
However, as Rubenstein points out, there are many different cards, “including those made by Hallmark, for those who entered into a heterosexual marriage.” She maintains that the support shown by these companies for gay rights should not instigate such an extreme reaction from the AFA because “same-sex marriage would in no way make heterosexual marriages less valid or valuable” and would not diminish the significance of traditional families, which the AFA claims to “encourage, promote, and defend.”
The AFA states on its website that the group’s main concern is that gay rights legislation will detract from their ability to voice their religious beliefs concerning the inappropriateness of the homosexual lifestyle. Matthew D. Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel and Dean of Liberty University School of Law, commented in a Dec. 30 news report that “whenever a right is granted to same-sex unions, then a right is taken from religious liberty and freedom of speech.”
Rubenstein brings up the counterpoint that “restricting freedom to homosexuals does not protect heterosexuals; it only hurts those who are facing discrimination.”
The participation of the ALLIES group in activities like Coming Out Day, World AIDS Day, and the Day of Silence are all designed to promote tolerance throughout campus. The possibility of the passing of a human relations ordinance in Allegheny County could further improve opportunities for the LGBT community, yet, from the standpoint of the AFA of Pennsylvania, dampen the freedom of speech and belief for many religious conservatives.

Sonya Barclay, a recent Ph.D. graduate from Carnegie Mellon, died of cancer Dec. 25 at Presbyterian Hospital. Barclay, 49, received her Ph.D. in history last spring.
Barclay did not pursue the common path in life. She devoted herself to taking care of her sick parents for much of her adulthood, putting off her aspirations of obtaining a college degree until she was in her 30s.
Barclay earned her degree in history from Indiana University of Pennsylvania before coming to Carnegie Mellon.
“When she got to Carnegie Mellon, her first year or two in graduate school were very difficult and very rough,” said Scott Sandage, an associate professor in history and one of Barclay’s advisers. “Five of the six students that came in with her didn’t stay past the first year.”
Barclay, however, was not discouraged. She continued her study of history to the end, despite many hurdles placed in her way.
“Sonya was the bravest person that I ever knew, and that had more to do with the way she lived than the way she died.… The reason that I think Sonya was so brave was that she was the first person in her family to go to college, and many people her hometown and her family circle didn’t understand why she wanted to go to college at all,” Sandage said.
Nothing could stop Barclay from following her dream, though, and receiving her degree last May was the culmination of years of hard work and waiting. 
After graduation, Barclay began a job at her undergraduate alma mater as a history professor while continuing to teach her course, “American Countryside: A Survey of Rural America,” at Carnegie Mellon.
“She was a genuine rural American, from Indiana County, Pa. It seemed to me most remarkable that she was able to engage CMU undergraduates — who must be the least rural student body in the U.S. — in the subject. 
But she did,” said David Miller, one of Barclay’s teachers and a reader for her dissertation.
Others agree that Barclay’s ability to engage her students — especially in rural American history — was remarkable. 
Paul Eiss, an associate professor of history, said, “I remember her walking off to class, carrying farm implements like a butter churn, or a scythe, or any number of other things that I can’t even identify, looking forward to yet another class in which she would use those objects to make rural history vivid and vital to her students.”
Everyone that came into contact with Barclay seems to view her as a talented, committed, and remarkable person, as well as a thoughtful and engaging student and teacher. “She was a determined and creative scholar, as well as a generous one,” said Diane Shaw, an associate professor of architecture and reader of Barclay’s dissertation. “More than that, Sonya genuinely cared about people and had a knack for making us feel special, and that’s why we will miss her so.”
Barclay’s interactions with friend and fellow history Ph.D. candidate Ruth Kittner reflect this as well.
“When I was in Germany, conducting research for my dissertation, she visited my elderly mother nearly every week. I know my mother appreciated her regular visits, hearing about CMU, Sonya’s students, life in the department, and Sonya’s many adventures searching Indiana County for old barns and houses,” she said. “I will miss her far more than I can appreciate now.”
As a teacher, Barclay was dedicated and compassionate, Kittner said. “She cared deeply for her students. She would spend hours reviewing student papers, for example, commenting, suggesting revisions, praising, and encouraging.”
“The other thing I have gathered about Sonya is that she had built up a devoted following among undergraduate students,” Sandage said. “You wouldn’t necessarily expect that a non-traditional student like Sonya from a farming background in a very rural part of Pennsylvania would become a role model for Carnegie Mellon students, and my understanding is that she did, and that undergraduate students really admired her in addition to feeling like they learned a lot from her.”
An on-campus memorial is being planned for Barclay. For more information regarding the date, time, and location of the memorial, contact Scott Sandage (sandage@andrew.cmu.edu).

Students are coming back to Carnegie Mellon from winter break in a new year and with new Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations. The new revisions expanded the scope of “confidential information,” and gave schools more power to notify parents or health officials in emergencies.
The original FERPA bill was passed in 1974 under the Nixon administration. According to John Papinchak, the Co-Director of Enrollment Services and Registrar, FERPA in general serves to “afford students certain rights with respect to their educational records, including the right to inspect their education record, the right to request an amendment of the records that the student believes are inaccurate, and the right to control disclosures of their records.”
Since 1974, the Department of Education bill has occasionally revised FERPA to fit the evolving methods of record keeping and discourses that schools employ, as well as the changing needs of modern students.
The most recent revisions were passed on Dec. 9 and have significantly changed the statutes limiting access to a student’s personal information in the event of an emergency. “In the wake of the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, there has been renewed interest for guidance on when and how information about students can be shared in an emergency, especially with regard to the parents of college students,” explained Papinchak. “Effective Jan. 8, 2009, the new FERPA rules will help school officials respond to emergencies more quickly and effectively.”
Previously, schools would have needed to obtain written consent from a troubled student in order to notify that student’s parents or health services that his or her judgment may be impaired. “The final regulations afford greater flexibility and deference to administrators so that they can bring appropriate resources to bear when there is a threat to the health or safety of students,” said Raymond Simon, Deputy Director of the Department of Education. “The final regulations also clarify that ... an educational agency or institution may disclose information to an eligible student's parents in a health or safety emergency.”
However, these new regulations are redundant for many families at Carnegie Mellon, as the school has already taken a proactive approach to the disclosure of student information to parents. “We created a brochure for parents. It was mailed to all undergraduates at their home address this past fall,” Papinchak said.
More relevant to Carnegie Mellon students are new regulations limiting the disclosure of information in non-emergency situations to parties other than a student’s parents. “The final rules include changes and clarifications to FERPA legislation regarding electronic records, students' Social Security numbers, and outside contractors hired by educational institutions who are given access to student records to perform services for the institution,” Papinchak said.
Specifically, the new regulations expanded the definitions of confidential information to include “any information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student ... and information, even in redacted form, that is requested by a party if the school reasonably believes the party knows the identity of the student to whom the record relates.”
While these new definitions are broader, they also could create opportunities for fraud on behalf of a deceitful student.
For example, the new regulations prevent employers from verifying without consent a student's grade point average with that student’s school. “Technically, yes, a student could lie about his GPA,” academic adviser Lauren Weinstein admitted. “However, companies can check the GPA by requesting that he send in his transcript, and that would have the GPA and could cause an issue for them if they saw he had misrepresented himself on his résumé.” Joseph Lum, a first-year computer science major, also added, “I would not lie [about my GPA] even if I could get away with it.... It’s wrong and it probably won’t help much anyway.” Papinchak also added, “The student may try to hide attendance at an institution by restricting their directory information disclosure.”  
Despite these potential dangers, Papinchak said, “We get great guidance from the Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO), which administers the FERPA regulations.”

Members of the Carnegie Mellon community will join together today to celebrate the work and mission of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
The events include presentations throughout the day where Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff can learn and discuss those things most important to King’s mission — the promotion of diversity in all respects.
The celebration begins at 12:30 p.m. with a choral and community tribute to King in Kirr Commons, followed by the “State of Diversity Address,” which will be delivered by Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon in McConomy Auditorium. 
Other events include a presentation of readings from and awards to local high school students and Carnegie Mellon students, a discussion about Alternative Spring Break with students who went on last year’s trips, and a community conversation about expanding the boundaries of civil rights.
The day ends with a keynote address titled “King, Obama, and the American Dream,” to be given by Michael Eric Dyson, an acclaimed author and Georgetown University professor.
Dyson is known by many as the “Hip-Hop Intellectual” and has been named on Ebony’s list of the “100 Most Influential Black Americans.” 
All programs will be held in the University Center and are sponsored by the Office of the President and Student Affairs.
Carnegie Mellon’s M. Granger Morgan, head of the department of engineering and public policy, has unveiled a two-stage approach for developing new energy technologies that can help society reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
With the help of a team of investigators from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Minnesota, the Vermont Law School, and Washington, D.C.-based energy law firm Van Ness Feldman, Morgan discussed the creation of a new regulatory structure to economically capture, transport, and sequester carbon dioxide in the United States.
Recommendations that Morgan and his committee developed include the creation of an independent Federal Carbon Sequestration Commission, with a chair appointed by President-elect Obama, as well as a report that recommends developing regulations for the creation of a widespread commercial-scale carbon sequestration operation in the United States.
“This report is designed to get governments and scientists excited about cutting carbon emissions without disrupting energy supplies” since the U.S. makes roughly half its electricity from coal, Morgan said.
Copies of the new report can be obtained online at www.CCSReg.org.

It’s time to color inside the lines.
Following several tragic episodes of violence at the Homestead Waterfront in the past several months, a new surveillance system is set to be installed, possibly within 90 days. Such a system will help the local police stay alert of any suspicious activity that could upset the delicate balance of the sprawling big-box development — or, better yet, deter such activity from ever even happening. A watchful eye in the form of megapixel cameras mounted on the corners of buildings and over the entrances of retail hot spots will let criminals know that their malicious actions will be recorded and traced back to them.
Such an omnipresent security eye, however, could do more than deter criminals: It could impede the creativity and freedom of the intended users of the site.
I recognize that creativity may not have been on the agenda originally. In 2007, I interviewed a source who worked for Allegheny County at the time of the Waterfront’s development, serving as a facilitator of discussion between the people of Homestead and the site developer, Continental Retail Development. Wishing to remain anonymous, she divulged some information about the creation of the site that makes any student of urban design cringe: The Waterfront was not developed to better the community and economy of Homestead. It was designed as a business opportunity, a “money maker,” and Homestead served merely as an empty backdrop. Designed like other large retail projects, the Waterfront’s layout is, more or less, formulaic. Its parking lots are sprawling, its sidewalks are in the proper places, its Starbucks is centrally located. Creativity of usage wasn’t in the books.
But just because creativity wasn’t part of the original plan of the site doesn’t mean the Waterfront should stay as it is — or become even more stifling, which could happen with the imposition of a system of security cameras.
Another important piece of information that the former county employee divulged is that the people of Homestead were not only underrepresented in the discussion of the site’s plan, but were altogether avoided in its final representation. The railroad tracks that are crossed as cars leave the development was used as a barrier between the people of Homestead and the intended population of shoppers, movie watchers, and restaurant patrons of the Waterfront.
The criminals who robbed and murdered innocent employees and patrons of the Waterfront last summer are segregated from the users of the site. The two groups are at odds; their separation is physically represented through the railroad tracks bordering the development. But they will be united in the surveillance system of the new cameras — and not necessarily in a healthy way.
Who will the cameras protect? It’s easy to simply say everyone. But there are several distinct parties invested in the site. There is the realty company, Developers Diversified Realty, which is interested in protecting its assets. There is the Continental Retail Development, which likely would like to keep the Waterfront as a successful wealth center in its development portfolio. There are parents visiting their first-year students at Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, eager to stock their children’s dorm rooms with sufficient amounts of paper towels, Gatorade, and Hot Pockets.
In this vein, the realty company released the following statement through WTAE and www.ThePittsburghChannel.com: “The Waterfront is an integral part of the community and the mayors, police chiefs, the Waterfront Owners Association and Developers Diversified are all committed to keeping it that way.” But the community in question involves even those who don’t shop at Abercrombie & Fitch or Victoria’s Secret — it involves everyone in close proximity to the site, including the residents of Homestead. All of these “community” members will be watched by the cameras — and will never be able to do the watching.
According to a July 14 article from the same news source, Developers Diversified Realty also released a statement insisting that the safety of the Waterfront’s customers, tenants, and staff is the top priority. This is noble, for sure. But any move that could serve to track the activity of those populating the Waterfront — even the innocent visitors stopping in to pick up some jeans at American Eagle — will impede their sense of free will, their ability to act at random, such as to park across two spaces instead of one or toss an empty water bottle into a trash can instead of the recycling bin 10 feet farther away.
Increased security doesn’t just keep out predators. It keeps out free will, random activity, and free motion. Even subconsciously, intended users of the site could find themselves more obligated to walk the 15 extra feet to the crosswalk rather than crossing the road closer to where they parked. If you’re being watched, and you don’t know when, or why, or by whom — even if it’s not you that they’re after — you’ll behave. You’ll play within the lines. You won’t hop or skip. You’ll walk.

One of the most laudable tenets of American law is the assurance that anyone accused of a crime is “innocent until proven guilty.” However, this fundamental legal right seems to have taken a reverse path in the post 9/11 world, especially when it comes to Muslims. These racially targeted individuals are more often “guilty until proven innocent,” and this is a rather disturbing vein in the realm of American democracy and international human rights.
A hair-raising account of such injustice is the case of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Brandeis alumnus from Pakistan pronounced by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as “the new face of al Qaeda.” Siddiqui is currently in U.S. custody after being detained for five years at a U.S. military detention center in Afghanistan. Siddiqui was beaten, repeatedly raped, forced to be strip-searched in front of male officers every time she had a visitor, and is currently in critical health. While the Islamabad and Sindh High Courts of Pakistan aggressively seek Siddiqui’s repatriation to Pakistan, the Pakistani government’s promises to ensure justice for Siddiqui resonate a hollow ring.
The mentally and physically disabled Siddiqui is considered a “high-risk” criminal accused of shooting at U.S. military personnel while in custody in Afghanistan last year. As Pakistanis await Siddiqui’s trial, many questions remain unanswered. Who is Aafia Siddiqui — a dangerous al Qaeda operative or an innocent woman who has been subjected to extreme mortification at the hands of the politically motivated? And what of her husband, who is a free man working in Karachi and who, according to the FBI, was a suspect even before she was?
Siddiqui initially moved to the U.S. from Pakistan in 1990 to pursue her undergraduate studies at MIT. She joined her school’s Muslim Students Association (MSA) and participated in charity for Islamic organizations. After spending over 10 years in the U.S., during which Siddiqui married anesthesiologist Amjad Khan, Siddiqui returned to Karachi with her three children. Khan, who was initially perceived as open-minded, had started to impose restrictions on Siddiqui and insisted that their children be raised in Pakistan according to strict Islamic principles, an incompatibility that led to Khan divorcing Siddiqui.
Meanwhile, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an alleged al Qaeda terrorist who admitted to plotting the Sept. 11 attacks, was arrested by the FBI in Pakistan. Despite the charges against Mohammed, U.S. intelligence did not hesitate in taking his word when he “gave up” Siddiqui’s name as one of his associates in the terrorist attacks. Later that month, Siddiqui and her three children mysteriously disappeared, and while American media outlets rushed to announce the capture of a possible al Qaeda terrorist, the U.S. and Pakistan claimed ignorance of Siddiqui’s whereabouts. And here is where the loopholes begin to emerge and make this case the body of complications that it is.
To this date, there is no official record of what Mohammed allegedly stated to U.S. intelligence. The claim that Siddiqui’s arrest is linked to Mohammed was only mentioned by the U.S. in passing when the Pakistani media and human rights activists bombarded the international community with demands of her whereabouts. Furthermore, soon after Siddiqui’s disappearance in 2003, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan maintained that the U.S. had nothing to do with the missing woman or her children.
Secondly, the U.S.’s assertion that Siddiqui was not arrested until 2008, when she mysteriously appeared outside the Governor’s house in Ghazni with a bag containing bomb-making instructions, a map of New York City, and diagrams of the Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge, is not just highly flawed but also childish. If Siddiqui was such a shrewd terrorist, why would she bring her recipe-book to a monitored site? More importantly, the Governor declined her arrest outside his house.
Another aspect of this case that remains unexamined is the role of Khan, Siddiqui’s ex-husband, who did not make any effort to find his wife, nor to speak to the media in her absence.
Siddiqui was briefly interrogated with Khan about the money she donated to Islamic charities — which proves that the FBI already had its eyes on the woman who “disappeared” for five years. After five years of torturing an innocent woman, the U.S. authorities could not simultaneously let her go and save themselves global embarrassment — what would that mean for the volumes of women’s rights and liberation that the U.S. advocates to “barbaric” third-world nations? Thus, the terror suspect was metamorphosed into a criminal who attacked a member of the U.S. military, a religious fanatic that challenged American freedom.
In the Pakistani political sphere, things are murkier. Bilal Musharraf, the son of former President Pervez Musharraf, is accused of selling Siddiqui to the FBI for a lump sum of bounty money. If Siddiqui has already been sold to the FBI, then Gilani’s plea is nothing but a performance to hush Pakistani sentiments on the issue. An American lawyer who spoke anonymously told Pakistan’s Daily News that even though charges against Siddiqui are clearly baseless, “the Americans will not let her go.”
Siddiqui’s case represents a classic model of parallel disparity. U.S. authorities are taking extreme measures in the name of protecting its citizens — without conforming to international norms of human rights they so boldly advocate to the rest of the world — and the Pakistani government is failing to ensure the rights and protection of its citizens. Taking precaution against potential terrorist attacks is justifiable, but not to the extent where the cop becomes the thief.
Following the closure of Guantanamo Bay, the Obama administration must make a sincere effort to rectify its anti-terror legislation concerning suspects whose guilt has not been proven. Whether Siddiqui has deliberately been marked out as the scapegoat in some bigger plan or not, Pakistan must not negotiate its “sovereign partnership” with the U.S. at the expense of its citizens. And it would be a shame if the U.S. allowed this infant democracy to strip its citizens of human rights.

As anyone who thought Proposition 8 was certain to fail in California before Election Day will tell you, some people tend to overestimate the degree of tolerance in society when it comes gay rights issues. This is why I was not surprised to read last week that a local “family” organization is trying to stop the passing of a county bill that would outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Last summer, Allegheny County councilwoman Amanda Green introduced Bill No. 4201-08, which would create a 16-member Human Relations Commission to enforce a nondiscrimination policy in housing, employment, public accommodations, and other areas that we’d categorize as “basic rights.” But the American Family Association of Pennsylvania (AFA) and other organizations, such as the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), are taking steps to derail progress in the fight for equality by advocating that the bill be overturned.
While these groups sound benign, they are actually socially and politically conservative groups that often have subtle — or not-so-subtle — religious undertones. The first tenet of the AFA’s mission statement is “to make a positive difference in our community by standing up for traditional Judeo-Christian values.”
I was raised Christian and taught to embody Judeo-Christian values, namely that of tolerance. My church had an openly gay curate and an openly lesbian director of Christian education, and both of these individuals were active in our faith community. The fact that members of the AFA not only exhibit intolerance of those who are different from them, but do so in the name of God, is abominable.
There is already a statewide Human Rights Commission; however, it cannot protect those who are discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. It can protect against discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, and physical handicaps — which means that a member of a religious group that openly persecutes, or at best shuns, homosexuals is more protected under the law in the workplace than homosexuals themselves.
“Realistically, there is no need to set up a Human Relations Commission ... except for the fact that the proposed ordinance is extended on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,” said Patricia Weaver of Fox Chapel on behalf of the Pennsylvania Family Institute at a public hearing about the bill held on Thursday, according to The Daily News.
Oh, that.
The AFA claims it is a “voice for pro-family values.” I’m here to tell them that we in this country are past the era of traditional gender roles and nuclear families. Gay couples work harder to adopt children and start families than any straight couple could ever know. So if the organization truly wants to be a voice for family values, it should be a voice for all families, regardless of color, creed, shape, size, or gender.
Pittsburgh prides itself on being a forward-thinking city in a forward-thinking county. Yet the majority of other regions throughout the state already have such commissions on the books. And if groups like the AFA have their way, Ordinance 4201-08 will fail to get the support it needs to pass and Allegheny County will trail behind the majority of Pennsylvania in standards of basic equality.
The numbers show that such appeals to councilmen and women have been heeded — several members of the council have already withdrawn their support for the ordinance. There are currently a total of eight council members supporting the bill. If there are fewer than eight votes in favor of the bill, it will not pass.
We cannot let an ill-informed, narrow-minded minority set a tone of intolerance for the entire county. We cannot let people hold us back because they cannot accept others who are different from them.
If that’s what God wants, then I guess I’m going to hell. And I’m okay with that.

The conflict in Gaza is all over the news. We know this.
There are numerous reports, anecdotes, and statistical figures about the multitude of attacks going on between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip in the Middle East — details of locations, times, and responsible actors of missiles launched from either side. In the United States, a country more sympathetic to Israel than others, the media is laden with pro-Israel sentiments, while the realities of life on the ground, for both Israelis and Palestinians, is a story often lost to Americans.
We don’t know what to make of the conflict or which side to take. As the war in Israel continues, even more mainstream media sources seem muddled and the act of side-taking is drowning in a sea of deadly facts and figures that the American populace as a whole seems to be challenged to wrap its head around.
Two weeks ago, when demonstrators rallied in Oakland regarding the conflict in Gaza, the absurdity of choosing sides in a war against humanity in the Middle East hit home in our own city. As pro-Palestinian supporters rallied on one side of Forbes Avenue, a smaller, and seemingly less organized, contingent rallied in support of Israel on the other side of the busy street. The monstrous act of choosing sides had come to Oakland — and still didn’t seem to accomplish much of anything.
President Bush supported Israel while in office, and his support has been echoed in the media, particularly during the start of this Gaza conflict. To Israel-friendly sources (such as the U.S. media), the country is acting out of self-defense against animalistic attacks from Hamas. To others, a story often untold that must be explained is the fact that Israel is occupying Gaza — a move that much of the world finds illegal. Regardless, 22 days of fighting have passed, and as of the time of this editorial’s publication, a tentative week-long cease-fire agreement has been reached. Strong arguments in favor of either side in the media have seemingly faded into confusion over responsibility and a plethora of overwhelming data pouring out of the Middle East.
This issue is one of a humanitarian crisis. While we are not necessarily in a position to fully comprehend the details and intricacies of the conflict, we do not want to be caught in the wave of unbalanced journalism simply in favor of either Israel or Hamas. We should all stop taking sides, and recognize that the human lives at stake are more important than choosing sides.

Tomorrow, Barack Obama will become the 44th President of the United States. However, the change promised throughout his campaign wasn’t something that waited until the inauguration. As early as Nov. 5, his transition team was announced and immediately began work.
In the past two months we have seen nearly all of the key Obama administration designates announced, many controversial and surprising. Change is indeed occurring, but it is the relevance of these new appointments in comparison to officials of past administrations that merits a significant understanding and respect.
A number of the choices have been noteworthy, including selection of alternative-energy advocate and Nobel prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as Secretary of Energy and  intelligence community outsider Leon Panetta as CIA head. By bringing in Chu, an academic, and Panetta to the Obama administration, the American people are seeing that change is indeed a tangible concept that Obama is bringing to the Oval Office. These people, though they may lack direct experience, will bring fresh opinions and (hopefully) the eagerly awaited change to Obama’s administration. 
Possibly his most discussed designee has been Obama’s pick for Surgeon General, Sanjay Gupta, known widely as CNN’s chief health corespondent. Several forward-looking positions have also been created, such as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, Chief Performance Officer, and Federal Chief Technology Officer.
With the creation of these new positions, Obama shows that as times are changing, so are the priorities of the presidency. Obama is not shying away from this change, but rather embracing it — another example of the multi-faceted change Obama has promised us.
This last position, Federal Chief Technology Officer, is of particular importance as we see the reach of technology broadening with the Obama administration. Obama has already brought many web-community changes to the “Office of the President-elect,” as evidenced by his website and his weekly videos, which can be watched on YouTube. Even early reports that Obama would be asked to give up his Blackberry have now been directly contradicted by Obama, who said last week that he would be able to hold onto it. We have also now seen the first President to have his official portrait taken with a digital camera.
So even as discussions to shut down Guantanamo Bay continue and the legislation for a new financial relief plan is still in the works, Barack Obama and his transition team have hit the ground running. Obama stated that we needed change and he was going to bring it. If his actions during his time as the President-elect are any indication of what we are likely to see for the next four years, we will have change in spades, possibly more than we ever hoped and dreamed, and possibly more than we want.

Though Carnegie Mellon is located in a busy city, the campus lacks the often intimidating urban atmosphere of other big-city schools due to its set-back, enclosed campus feel. Most students can walk around Carnegie Mellon at almost any time of the day (or night) and feel safe; thoughts of getting mugged are not likely on anyone’s mind, even while walking back to their dorms after a late night at the computer cluster.
Recently, however, there has been a surge in theft on campus. Last semester, an Official Communications e-mail that was sent out warned the student body of an increase in break-ins and thefts in the East Campus Garage. The e-mail went on to state that a number of cars had their windows shattered, and that belongings were stolen from inside the parked cars.
Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole, Student Body President and Vice President,  respectively, made campus safety part of their election platform and thus far have successfully stuck to their goal of reconsidering safety options, especially with a report they completed over break assessing overall campus safety. The pair stated that they believed safety was a growing concern on campus, and as a result, they came up with a number of suggestions to improve the matter. Their plans for doing so included improving the existing SafeWalk program, starting a Safe Rider cab service, and increasing police patrolling on Fifth Avenue; all progams would help Carnegie Mellon students continue to feel safe on campus.
We are glad Jared and Pooja are aware of the current safety concerns on campus, that they realize there are steps that can be taken to improve safety, and that they have plans in place to work to make those improvements. Safety is an important concern on any college campus, and even more so for a college campus in a busy city like Pittsburgh.
Hopefully, their plans for increasing safety will take into consideration not only the safety of the students, with their suggestions for SafeWalk and a Safe Rider cab, but also the safety of students’ belongings, with plans for added security to decrease theft on campus.

In the article “Students spread green knowledge” (Nov. 24), The Tartan reported about various students, faculty, and staff who attended the national AASHE conference on green campuses. The article correctly notes that a priority of AASHE is getting campuses to sign the President’s Climate Commitment (PCC), which commits campuses to becoming carbon neutral, i.e., having zero carbon footprint. It also noted that Carnegie Mellon has not signed the PCC.
Unfortunately the article misrepresented various campus groups’ recommendations as to whether President Cohon should sign the PCC. In fact, both parties mentioned — the Green Practices Committee and the referenced spring 2008 student project on Sustainable Campuses — recommend that we NOT sign the PCC. The whole report of the student project is available on the “Reports” section of Carnegie Mellon’s Steinbrenner Institute website.
Let me very briefly summarize our position. First note that the PCC is essentially a 10-step plan for creating a system on a campus that can eventually lead to lower carbon emissions, of which the first step is a commitment to being carbon neutral. For example, one of the early steps is an inventory of our current carbon dioxide emissions (which we estimate at about 160,000 metric tons per year). Other steps include committing to purchasing 15 percent green electricity (we currently purchase about 30 percent). Carnegie Mellon is already doing nine of the 10 steps required of schools after pledging to become carbon neutral.
In our case, the numerous steps we have taken to date — many of them years before the PCC was created — make us realize how challenging (and potentially impossible) it might be to completely eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions of the university. Furthermore, the PCC is non-binding. If someone fails to meet the PCC by their target date, there are no repercussions. It is a very weak commitment.
As a result, we do not feel it benefits anyone on campus to sign it, and further sets a bad educational example by suggesting the way to make a hard decision is to determine the answer first instead of researching how to achieve it.
In short, our decision not to sign the PCC is being construed as a lack of commitment to campus sustainability, climate change, etc., which is inconsistent with the past 10 years of campus activities. Our “commitment” is in question. But we feel we have been following a fairly simple rule: faced with the choice of doing the work to mitigate our impacts or making shallow commitments, we have chosen to mitigate.

Hey Tartans,
Welcome back! I hope that everyone had a relaxing winter break and is rejuvenated for another great spring semester. Today, I want to touch on one of the more controversial issues of university policy that Student Government has been involved with recently: the university smoking policy. I’d like to take this column to clarify where the current policy stands post-Jan. 1 and to discuss Pooja’s and my stance on the issue.
On Dec. 21, an official communication was sent out to the campus community helping to  explain the current nature of the smoking policy. As of Jan. 1, smokers are restricted from smoking in several smoke-free zones: The Cut, Hamerschlag Mall, tennis courts, Cyert Center, and areas around athletic fields. For the time being, campus police are instructed to warn students who are violating this policy. In addition, smoking is not permitted within 20 feet of any building entrance or air intake as per the university’s previous policy.
While designated smoking areas outside of these areas have not yet been officially decided by a group of students and faculty/staff, smokers are asked to abide by the previous rules, but can smoke in any other location on campus — although those locations are now more limited.
Since Anita Barkin, the director of Health Services and chair of Healthy Campus 2010, introduced the new smoking policy, I’ll admit that I have been generally in favor of it. I recognize that  Healthy Campus 2010 is trying to look out for the well-being of the campus community, and that the new policy is in accord with the university’s overall stance about the importance of wellness.
That being said, I must say that I am disappointed with the current “we’re trying to remove smoking containers so that you cannot smoke on most of campus, but we haven’t outlined the designated areas where you can smoke” temporary policy. It doesn’t make sense why the committee doesn’t take the next semester to thoughtfully plan out where the designated smoking areas should be and then allow for the new smoking policy to take effect in full in September.
The current “limbo” period is nothing more than confusing and will only make enforcing the policy later that much harder. Will what one day was a warning card be a monetary fine the next day? I suggest that Healthy Campus 2010 use the remainder of this semester to plan a comprehensive publicity campaign so that when students return in September, they’ll be aware of the change in policy — and that means more than a few official communication e-mails.
