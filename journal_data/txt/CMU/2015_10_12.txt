The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team competed against New York University (NYU) on Saturday. The largely defensive battle ended in a 1–0 victory for the Tartans, improving their overall record to 8–2–1 and their University Athletic Association (UAA) record to 1–1.
After a delayed start due to the women’s soccer game, the Violets led an aggressive start against the Tartans, earning two free kick attempts within the first five minutes of the game. However, senior goalkeeper Eric Bykowsky diligently blocked both shots, setting the tone for Carnegie Mellon’s defensive unit. The Tartans then took the offensive, setting up five attacks against the NYU defense. However, the NYU goalkeeper was able to match the Tartan attacks, negating the efforts of the offense. The duel between defenses intensified throughout the half until sophomore midfielder Matt De Jesus netted a pass from first-year forward Sean MacPherson into the game’s only goal in the 44th minute. First-year midfielder Anthony Gulli and senior midfielder Jordan Friedlander had put pressure on the Violet goalie, forcing him to save their three shots before De Jesus managed to break through.
At the start of the second half, Carnegie Mellon continued to press their advantage against the Violets, able to keep the ball on NYU’s side of the field for much of the half. Though the Tartans did not score another goal, the team was able to make quite a few attempts, leading to many spectacular saves by the NYU keeper. As the game entered the final 20 minutes, NYU became increasingly aggressive, driving the ball to the Tartans’ side very often in an attempt to take the game into overtime. Though the Violets were able to take a few shots, the Tartan defense kept NYU out of the goal, sealing the victory as time expired. “We fought really hard,” Bykowsky said after the game. “That was the key: fighting to the end.”
The win marks the sixth shutout for the Tartans this season and improves their home record to 5–0–1. More importantly, it has put the Tartans back on track following the loss against Brandeis University. “The win was nice coming off of Brandeis,” Bykowsky said. “We really turned our game around. It was the type of game that we need to continue playing going forward.” Bykowsky expects that the team will continue to face tough challenges from their UAA rivals, but he also believes that the Tartans are on an “upward trajectory,” ready to take on whatever their rivals dish out.
The Tartans will need to remain vigilant as they face their UAA rivals. Of the eight schools in the UAA, including Carnegie Mellon, seven currently have overall winning records. The Tartans currently sit in fourth place behind Emory, Brandeis, and Case Western Reserve. With almost all of their remaining games against UAA rivals, this is the time when the Tartans will need to continue their strong defensive play while also being able to navigate their offense through difficult defensive fronts.
The Tartans will return to action on Friday, Oct. 16 when they host the University of Rochester.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took the field under a cloudless sky on Saturday to face off against the New York University (NYU) Violets. After a 5–1 victory at LaRoche earlier in the week, the Tartans were defending their still undefeated record. The NYU squad had only one loss before this game, but the Tartan women prevailed on their homecoming weekend in a nail-biting, double overtime, 1–0 victory to hand the Violets their second loss of the season, putting the Tartans at a solid 2–0 in conference play.
These teams were very evenly matched coming into this game, and it showed in the opening minutes of the game as each team aggressively traded possession of the ball in an attempt to establish early pressure and set the pace of the game. Carnegie Mellon began to take control of the ball more readily as time progressed, but not without a formidable resistance from the NYU defense. The Violet goalkeeper made multiple crucial saves midway into the first half to prevent the Tartans from gaining much needed momentum. The Tartans continued to put shots on goal, however, and the Violets began to look flustered in their lack of ability to pressure the opponent’s side, even resulting in a yellow card for the visiting side. The lack of ability to score for either team, however, made this game very physical with aggressive slide tackles and defensive positioning from both sides throughout the game. Carnegie Mellon maintained a slight control of the game for the majority of the first half, but not so much that they were able to score. NYU appeared to be playing the Tartan squad closer than any other team had all season.
Carnegie Mellon maintained their characteristic lockdown defense as the game moved into the second half, but NYU would not go down without a fight. With some good positioning, the Violets managed to finally get some pressure onto the Tartans’ side, but did not manage to score thanks to a couple great saves from junior goalkeeper Katie Liston to keep her team in the game. The Tartans managed to regain possession at the end of the second half, putting multiple shots on goal, but every attempt seemed to miss by a small margin. In the waning minutes of the half, NYU began to pressure Carnegie Mellon, and the Tartans were forced to play dangerously close to their own goal until they managed to get the ball across midfield in the final minute and force an offensive break. The Tartans could not manage to make the goal, however, and full time ended in a draw 0–0.
The first overtime carried on much in the same way as the game did in regulation time; each team traded possession of the ball aggressively but the defense of each team seemed to be outshining the offense. Each goalkeeper managed multiple saves in overtime, and it almost looked as if there would be no obvious winner in this contest. Outstanding defensive play from each team kept the game scoreless throughout the entire first overtime, forcing double overtime.
The Tartan women are no strangers to clutch overtime play. The team’s only non–win of the season was a draw against Ohio Northern that was the result of a scoreless double overtime, and the Tartans even pulled out a 3–2 win against Capital in overtime in their closest game of the season up to that point. The Tartan women show up when it matters, and this game was no different. The second overtime period began with each team getting an unsuccessful offensive break and neither team managing to score. Once the Tartans gained possession after the offensive move from the Violets, it became clear who would be the victor. The Tartan women gained possession of the ball and did not give it up until they emerged victorious.
Multiple aggressive pushes from the Tartans finally resulted in the first and only goal of the game in the 103rd minute, as junior defender Amelia Clark touched the ball into the opposite corner of the goal off of a corner kick from sophomore midfielder Tori Iatarola. A crowd of alumni and students alike erupted, and with that goal the Tartans managed their 11th win of the season and their second win in conference play, putting them on a clear path to the playoffs at the end of the season. The Tartan women showed that not only can they dominate opponents of clearly lower skill level, but they can also compete head to head with teams of equal skill and still perform when it matters most. The Tartan women look to continue running the table this Friday, Oct. 16 at home against Rochester University in another conference game to determine their fate in the playoffs, and they don’t plan on losing any time soon.

The Carnegie Mellon football team came into the evening with three losses on its ledger, the same number as their opposition, Bethany (W.V.). It turned out to be the visitors who would live up to that dismal billing as the Tartans victimized a defense that seemed out of sorts and disorganized. The 56–35 final score accurately reflects a game where the defenses were largely irrelevant. Bethany’s inability to keep pace with the Tartans’ offense was less due to the Carnegie Mellon defense — the pass coverage was actually one of the Tartans’ major weak points — and more the result of an endless barrage of overthrows by the Bethany quarterback.
The story of the game was mostly told in the first half. On the Tartans’ first possession, a long punt return by sophomore safety Drew Fitzsimmons and a long run by running back Sam Benger set up a 31-yard strike from senior quarterback Andrew Hearon to sophomore wide receiver John Prather who laid out to haul in the opening score.
After a squib kick gave Bethany solid field position, four runs and a pass over the head of senior cornerback Vince Demarchi allowed Bethany to tie up the game. The Tartans responded quickly, however. Hearon hit senior wide receiver Graham Schilling for a 66-yard pass which set up a 14-yard Benger run for a touchdown. That touchdown was wiped by a holding penalty, but a Hearon pass to senior wide receiver Max Reinertsen and a 1-yard Benger run outside the right tackle gave the Tartans the lead again.
This lead was nearly short lived, but after driving deep into Carnegie Mellon territory, the Bethany quarterback overthrew a pass on fourth down through the back of the end zone, turning the ball back to the Tartans. Benger nearly took the ball to the house on the first run of the ensuing drive, but was tripped up at midfield. The Tartans eventually scored when Hearon again connected with Prather, this time on a 44-yard pass. The score prompted a meeting of the defense on the Bethany sideline, which did absolutely nothing. While Bethany was able to trim the lead to 7 with a touchdown on its possession, the Tartans were able to score on their fourth consecutive drive, this time on a one handed snag by Prather.
At that point, trouble began for the Tartans. Bethany was able to put points up with 23 seconds left in the first half. When the Tartans failed to score to open the second, Bethany was threatening, sitting on the edge of the red zone. On a curious decision to go for 4th and 20 from the 25 yard line, the Bethany quarterback overthrew his receiver on a route to the corner of the endzone.
After the play, the receiver audibly yelled “He was holding me. He was holding me. Are you f—ing kidding me?” The receiver had a point, as the defender trailing him appeared to have hold of his jersey, but the referee disagreed and the turnover was turned into a 75-yard touchdown drive finished off by a 7-yard run from Benger to extend the Tartan lead to 42–21 that probably signaled the end of competitive play, as Bethany never got closer than 14 points again.
There was one moment towards the end of the third quarter that encapsulated the day for the Bethany defense. After a successful overload, Hearon was hit as he launched a pass to junior wide receiver Matt Forjan, who had beaten his man. The hit caused the ball to be underthrown and hit the Bethany defender squarely in the hands. The defender proceeded to drop the ball three more times before it hit the ground, mercifully ending the play.
The pass was a hiccup in an otherwise strong performance from Hearon, who spread the ball around well and hit many long throws despite only completing 50 percent of his passes.
Prather in particular was doing a good job of finding space deep, as evidenced by his three touchdowns.
As usual, Benger also turned in a dominant performance, rushing for 200 yards yet again, helped by a strong performance from the offensive line.
The Tartan defense struggled, giving up 35 points but forcing five interceptions. Despite often spotty coverage, two tipped passes and — say it with me — several overthrows from the Bethany quarterback simply piled up and became a barrage of turnovers and allowed the Tartans to win by a lopsided margin.
The Tartans improved their record to 2–3, going 2–2 in conference play.
They continue their schedule Saturday Oct. 17, when they travel to Grove City.

Over the past few years, Sunday has always been highly anticipated, as the growth of fantasy football has generated excitement beyond game expectations. Even if the Tampa Bay Buccaneers seem likely to lose another game, it’s up in the air whether their running back Doug Martin is likely to score enough fantasy points to play in your starting lineup. But what if we raise the stakes even more? Pick any player in the league, and win money on a daily basis based on their performance. The format of daily fantasy football has been met with controversy, as critics argue that the rapidly expanding phenomenon consists of little more than gambling.
In traditional fantasy football, a player runs a fantasy football team throughout the football season, managing a roster and making decisions on which players to leave on the bench each Sunday. Each week, each player plays a “game” against another member of their fantasy league, and attempts to win the requisite number of games to qualify for, and hopefully win, their league championship.
However, in daily fantasy football, a player pays an entry fee to submit to a contest a team of any players they want. The entry is only restricted by a “salary cap,” which prevents a player from selecting all the top players for their lineup. Hypothetically, a skilled daily fantasy player will use their superior knowledge of football to select lesser-known football players for their lineup, which will allow them to often win the contests they enter.
Is this gambling? In an Oct. 5 op-ed, “Rein In Online Fantasy Sports Gambling,” The New York Times argued that it was, while the leagues took advantage of gambling law exemptions for mainstream fantasy sports. Regular fantasy sports, like traditional fantasy football, are exempted from online gambling regulations. There is a question of whether a game like daily fantasy football deserves to be exempted from these gambling rules.
One issue with daily fantasy is its similarity with other forms of sports gambling. In horse racing, individuals place bets on horses, guessing which horses will place, in what order they will finish, and what place those horses will be in partway through the race. Compare this to daily fantasy, where users put money down on players who will run the most yards and score the most touchdowns, in their respective football games.
In horse racing, a winner receives a larger payout for a larger investment and wins nothing most of the time. In daily fantasy, the winner also receives a larger payout if he paid a larger entry fee, and most players also win nothing.
There is a small difference though. In horse racing, winnings are decided by betting lines, which reflect how likely each horse is to win. When American Pharaoh was the favorite to win the Triple Crown, the return on investment for betting on the horse was pretty small. You can win by betting on an outcome, and you will get what you earned if the outcome you choose occurs.
In daily fantasy, the entry fees are fixed. You can enter a 5-dollar league, a 25-cent league, or a 50-dollar league. The winnings are fixed, too, but what you need to win is not. In order to win in fantasy, you must beat other individuals, and the best performing team determines the winner.
This distinction can be seen in two very different lights. On the one hand, daily fantasy is arguably more of a competition, just like when you pay an entry fee to enter a local 5k. You might win the race and the prize, but a lot of the time you lose your entry fee. But it could be similarly argued that daily fantasy is more unpredictable than betting on horse racing. At least in the local 5k run, a good runner can expect to do well in the race. In fantasy, it is possible that the difference between winners and losers is pretty much guessing.
While we wait to see what the courts will say, and whether they’ll make daily fantasy deal with all the gambling rules of other online gambling websites, we can rest assured the NFL will hang tight. Commissioner Roger Goodell states that “The first thing we do is protect the integrity of the game.” He explains that while it isn’t clear whether daily fantasy is legal or not, right now, the league is comfortable with the fact that daily fantasy isn’t changing how football games are being played.

Now that the actual NFL season is beginning to heat up, I’m realizing what it actually takes to run a solid fantasy team. I’m also realizing that following the projections is not going to cut it much longer. I should start to maybe understand football and follow my players more seriously.
Even though I had a great week, coming out of it with twice my opponent’s points (80-40), I made some mistakes in creating my starting lineup. I had a few players with injuries listed as questionable. Chargers tight end Ladarius Green suffered a concussion in week 3, Jets wide receiver Eric Decker had a knee injury but was still expected to play through it, and Texans wide receiver Nate Washington hurt his hamstring. I made the wrong call by starting Decker as flex, Washington as a wide receiver alongside Garcon, and leaving Green on the bench.
Unfortunately, Washington did not play and Green did. Not only did he start, but he scored 11 points. Sure, I won by 40 points, but I could have won by 51 points and scored 91 points, which could have been my highest scoring week to date! To be honest, I blame sports editor Zeke Rosenberg, who told me not to start Green, even though I would have benched Decker anyway [ed. note: at the time of the inquiry, Green was in the NFL’s concussion protocol.]
Also to anyone who’s been following my burning hatred for Vikings running back Jerick McKinnon, he scored zero points again, and I’m very close to dropping him. The next eligible available running back in my league is Titans running back/wide receiver Dexter McCluster. His name is just hilarious enough for me to consider the switch.
I’m actually slightly nervous for week 5. I have four players with bye weeks, including two of my consistent performers, Decker and the Jets D/ST. My lineup overall just looks really mediocre, with the exception of Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell and Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.
As it turns out, Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount might even be something of a saving grace for Team Ya Gurl Gutie. Team Alexander is carrying five running backs, except two of them are out with injuries and the other three are just terrible. Thank God I have one excellent running back and one that is acceptable, because this is the only spot where I have a significant edge over the enemy.
I’m not worried about Wilson’s performance, because he’s yet to disappoint me. His counterpoint on Team Alexander is Kirk Cousins of Washington. His performance so far this season has been highly variable — seven points week one to 21 points week four, depending on the worthiness of their adversary. This week Washington will face Atlanta, ranked 11th in the league. Hopefully Wilson will be able to outscore Cousins because I need to close the gap somewhere, which will be created in every other position.
At wide receiver, Alexander has Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown and Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman. Even though I don’t know a huge amount about football, I know those names. Facing them, I have Washington‘s Pierre Garcon and the Titans’ Justin Hunter. Garcon is usually a solid player, but Hunter is only starting this week because Decker has a bye week and Washington is officially out right now with his hamstring injury. Now I have to start my worst wide receiver. There is no conceivable way that I will best Team Alexander at wide receiver.
My starting tight end this week is the Rams’ Jared Cook, matched up against Travis Kelce of the Chiefs. From what I can glean of Kelce, he’s a talented tight end on a pretty bad team. When he’s good, he is really good. Also helpful is that he’s number one receiver for the Chiefs. Cook, however, sits in the back seat while the Rams’ Kenny Britt and Tavon Austin get most of the action. Plus they’re facing the Green Bay Packers this week, whose defense is really solid. I don’t expect excellent things.
I’m putting Green in as my flex, but I have my reservations about him moving forward in the season. After serving a four week suspension for using performance enhancing drugs — which seems short in my opinion — the Chargers’ top tight end Antonio Gates will see the field again this week. I’ll have to see how the Chargers choose to play Green and Gates in order to determine whether to keep him around for the rest of the season.
As if Team Alexander couldn’t be more blessed by solid wide receivers, he will also start Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen as his flex. With the exception of week two, Allen has been scoring in the double digits. I expect that this is just another position where I’ll lose more points.
With the Jets out, I’ll have to start the Giants D/ST, going head to head against the Broncos. I’ve been pretty happy with the Jets this season, and it pains me to have to play anyone but them. The Giants have yet to break double digits yet this season, while the Broncos have been solid in every outing they’ve had so far. Their worst showing was nine points in week four, while coincidentally, the Giants’ best showing so far has been nine points in weeks one and four. I expect this matchup to create a deficit.
Finally at kicker, I still have a strong love for the Broncos’ Brian McManus. He’s matched up against the Cowboys’ Dan Bailey. In reality, I feel like there isn’t much strategy to being a kicker. The offense can either score a touchdown and give him an opportunity to kick an extra point, or the offense can screw up and give him an opportunity to kick a field goal. Either way, the offense decides when it’s time for him to kick, and all he has to do is not screw up. This is just my observer’s perspective though.
The projections have the matchup coming out tied 72–72. The projections are never reliable though, and I have a feeling my two game winning streak will come to an end this week.

It’s frustrating to see the Pirates stuck in the N.L. Wild Card game for the third time in three years. For the past two years, there has been a real argument that the Pirates were actually the best team in Major League Baseball, yet they lost fantastic seasons in just one game. Last year, it was to World Series hero and possible actual superhero, Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner. This year, it was to Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta, who has been continuously improving over the last two years from average starter to destroyer of worlds. This Pirates team — particularly the outfield and the injured shortstop Jung Ho Kang — was incredibly fun and will be sorely missed.
In the A.L. Wild Card Game, the Yankees were kept down by the Astros’ likely Cy Young Winner Dallas Keuchel. Nothing really happened over the course of the entire game, as a homer by outfielder Colby Rasmus effectively ended the game in the second inning. The Yankees were unable to score consistently for the last month of the season, so their winning against Keuchel always seemed hopeless.
The Divisional Round has started with a bang as the favorite, the Toronto Blue Jays, has been put down two games to none at the time of this article. The Blue Jays will need to win three consecutive games to advance, with two of them in Texas against the Rangers. Speaking of the Rangers, while they’re on the brink of the American League Championship Series, they were supposed to be a bad team that lost their best player (pitcher Yu Darvish) to injury. Instead, outfielder Shin-Soo Choo and first baseman Prince Fielder decided it was 2007 and carried the team to a shocking division crown, despite the Mariners, Athletics, and Angels all predicted to field strong clubs this year. Of course, all of those teams missed the playoffs, beaten out by the Rangers and aforementioned Astros.
Baseball is weird.
In a fun bit of trivia, the Cubs, who have not won a World Series since 1908, were predicted to win the 2015 World Series in Back to the Future. They are currently tied with the Cardinals in their series and Arrieta has not pitched yet, so there is certainly hope.
Either way, this was a bizarre season where preseason favorites like the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Seattle Mariners, and Washington Nationals were usurped after disappointing seasons that placed them near the bottom of the barrel. Hopefully, an equally unpredictable and exciting postseason is to follow.

If you are reading this, then you are most likely one of the estimated two billion people in the world that can communicate using the English language. If this is so, you are able to take advantage of the benefits provided by the English language, a language that allows millions of people to establish connections within the global workforce and access half the content published on the World Wide Web. You also likely enjoy the fact that you have access to a wealth of entertainment and knowledge written in English, such as this week’s edition of The Tartan.
These concepts were on the mind of Amy Ogan, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), as she journeyed to Washington, D.C. last month to attend a day-long workshop, called Technology in English, at the White House Conference Center. “This workshop was about providing quality English education on a global scale, so that learners outside of the U.S. have access to opportunities to learn English for jobs, travel, and even entertainment,” Ogan said.
Every year, the U.S. State Department spends approximately $250 million on English education in order to provide resources such as instructional material and scholarships for learners. Regional English language offices are located in embassies around the world, and aim to foster mutual understanding between the U.S. and other countries. Currently, State Department officials are also interested in incorporating technology to enhance access to their resources.
With undergraduate degrees in computer science, Spanish, and human-computer interaction, as well as a Ph.D in human-computer interaction, Ogan is interested in creating effective learning technologies that engage people coming from diverse backgrounds. “I’m particularly interested in thinking about students who have different cultural backgrounds than the people who typically develop the technology,” Ogan said. “For example, how do we use technology to support students whose first language is Tagalog, but who learn math in English, as in the policy in the Philippines? Or students who live in cultures that strongly value collaboration, when the technology we build here is intended to be very personalized?”
Ogan, along with colleagues, has talked to the State Department about creating various technologies to promote English learning, such as mobile technology, natural language processing, open learning platforms, and massive open online courses (MOOCs). As a part of that collaboration, the White House workshop brought together leaders in academics, industry and government.
“We went through brainstorming and ideating exercises that were intended to find connections between the participants around the topic of teaching English language and culture,” Ogan said. “It’s a great way to be creative and find the synergy between people with very different expertise.”
During the workshop, Ogan was able to share her background in learning technology with participants that were specifically experts in English language education. The group also developed solutions that incorporated human-centered design with the purpose of engaging learners.
“It was quite fun to engage in design exercises with the other participants who had deep knowledge about the skills that we want students to learn, while I could think about how to achieve those goals with technology,” Ogan said.
Ogan’s experience with the workshop builds upon the nature of her research at the HCII. For example, Ogan has developed methods designed to help international student teaching assistants adjust to what may be a new learning environment in the U.S. Ogan has also researched ways to make MOOCs more accessible to underrepresented demographics, including those in developing countries.
“I love the HCII because it lets me combine so many aspects of what I find fascinating about the world — [t]he way people learn, the way they interact with one another, the way they use technology, and how it can support better outcomes for the things that people care about,” Ogan said.
Ogan remains in touch online with the people she met during the White House workshop, which has allowed them to maintain a constant dialogue. With plans of meeting again in the coming spring, the group aspires to continue researching and creating systems that will enable American English learners to attain their goals.
“I’m excited about giving people a glimpse into American culture, [w]hether they will come here one day and want to be more effective at communicating in the U.S., or just want to understand American cultural artifacts like movies and music,” Ogan said.

Peeple, an unreleased app that’s been called “Yelp for people,” would allow users to give 1–5 star ratings to other people, along with comments, without the consent of the person being rated. Although the future of the app is uncertain — after public outrage, including death threats, the app’s online presence went dark and the founders restated the app’s purpose to be spreading positivity — Pugwash still found the concept interesting to discuss. After all, aren’t there systems in place that almost do the same thing the app would do? And since the technology is there, what’s to stop another person or group from making a new app with the same, original function of Peeple?
The meeting began with a discussion of why Peeple is no longer scheduled to be released in its original form. One member suggested that public outrage isn’t the best way to decide what should or shouldn’t happen, because it’s basically censorship by mob rule. Peeple was entirely legal, but it still got shut down, or radically changed, because enough people got angry.
Other Pugwash members didn’t see a problem with this reaction. While they agreed that death threats aren’t acceptable in any circumstances, they argued that society’s reaction to certain things, whether it be an app or anything else, can work almost as an immune system. Just because certain things are legal doesn’t mean they should exist, and cultural or societal backlash is one way to stop them from happening. If something is bad, then bad publicity is warranted.
As an aside, one member pointed out the irony in the fact that an app based on rating people was seemingly unprepared for receiving negative ratings itself. 
The discussion then moved on to the app itself. Two questions started this debate. First, do people have a “right to be forgotten?” Should we be able to stop others from talking about us online? And secondly, what does it even mean to rate a person?
In order to start this discussion, Pugwash questioned how Peeple would be different from current technologies. Several members noted that Yik Yak already allows anonymous comments, which can lead to personal attacks, and RateMyProfessors.com (RMP) exists solely as a method to rate individuals. Even going through daily life exposes people to criticism, others noted. It’s not hard to find out what people think of a certain individual, you just have to ask.
But that’s the difference, argued some Pugwash members. At least now you need to do some digging around to find out what people think of someone. Peeple would centralize and summarize all the gossip and comments that already exist about a person in one place.
The comparison between Peeple and RMP was also a point of contention. Some members argued that although RMP allows users to give anonymous ratings to other individuals, it’s used to judge a specific product offered by that individual: their teaching. It doesn’t purport to give an entirely holistic rating of the person, but instead only asks about a single aspect, which is broken down into understandable criteria; Peeple, on the other hand, asks users to provide a holistic rating by reducing a person’s total worth to a rating between one and five.
Other members noted that just because RMP is supposed to focus on a single issue, doesn’t mean it actually does. Professors’ personal lives are still involved in their teaching. Some comments or ratings reflect how much the teacher talks about their kids or other similar information, and there’s an entire category devoted to how attractive the professor is.
One concern was that Peeple could be used by potential employers, or in other high-stakes scenarios. Should people really be judged by anonymous online ratings? In response to this, however, someone pointed out that the Carnegie Mellon administration probably doesn’t take into account professor David Kosbie’s chili peppers on RMP when it’s time to review his performance.
After considering how the app would or wouldn’t be used in a professional setting, the discussion turned to more informal settings. The app’s original intention was to help people find friends, and one member noted that it’s not so different from real life. When you meet someone, you’re constantly sizing them up and wondering if they would be a good person to get to know further, and Peeple just does this for you. However, this goes back to the question of whether a one to five rating can really convey all the information needed. What one person might find weird or off-putting, another person might find quirky and enjoyable. Collapsing all the various information about a person into a single scale seems impractical.
Also, would anyone even trust the app? For information like height, weight, etc., it seems like it would be fine. But for “shady facts,” as one Pugwash member called them, it would be less reliable. Examples of “shady facts” included comments or reviews accusing people of certain nefarious actions or character defects. Would there be a way to fact check those? What about criminal records, should they be made public? Even more subjective reviews would be reviews about beauty or likability. Fact-checking would be a necessary skill for anyone using the app, and Pugwash members noted that a few negative reviews probably wouldn’t stop someone from being friends with another person if they enjoyed the other person’s company.
Instead of just ratings or anonymous comments, Pugwash members suggested that maybe it would be better for a more authoritative source to compile the information. Google already produces blurbs about celebrities when their names are searched, and they could probably do the same about everyday people as well. While this might make the descriptions more “objective” and less liable to be abused in witch hunts, it could release a lot more information than wanted. Some facts about a person aren’t always negative or positive; their impact depends on context. For example, maybe someone is open about their sexuality or gender in college, but they don’t share it with their conservative family and friends back home. If there was a central place to look up whatever information Google had on a person, it could create a lot of awkward social situations.
One example that was brought up to support this point was the incident a few years ago when Target found out a teenage girl was pregnant based on data about what she was purchasing. Target sent advertisements for baby supplies to the girl’s home before her parents knew she was pregnant, which shows how tracking patterns and using the vast amounts of data available can expose all sorts of things about people.
Finally, one member made an analogy between getting to know someone and data encryption. The more dollars it takes to break an encryption, the saying goes, the better the encryption. Similarly, we want people to have to invest time to get to know us, and not be able to “crack our encryption” just by visiting a one-stop rating app.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the app Peeple.

Dennis Trumble, an assistant research professor in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), received a $1.2M NIH R01 grant to support his research on developing a totally self-contained, biologically powered, implantable cardiac assist device to treat the rapidly growing population of patients suffering from congestive heart failure.
The prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) on a worldwide scale provides a clear application for Trumble’s research. “Congestive heart failure is a highly debilitating and progressive illness that afflicts tens of millions of people worldwide,” Trumble stated in his research strategy, which was composed specifically for the R01 grant. “In the United States over 5.8 million people currently suffer from this condition, and it is estimated that CHF will ultimately affect one in every five Americans.”
Trumble’s research strategy also noted the need for innovative treatments for CHF. “With over 500,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States alone, CHF is a rapidly growing public health problem that has proved difficult to treat. Current pharmacologic therapies can relieve symptoms in most patients but do not appreciably stem the course of the disease,” Trumble said. “At present, heart transplantation remains the most effective treatment, but this approach is limited by a small donor pool and the serious side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. A safe and effective permanent ventricular assist device would be a powerful tool.”
Trumble’s research focuses on left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), which have been shown to effectively reverse the effects of CHF when used short-term, but give rise to complications when used over long time periods. Trumble ultimately hopes to develop and test a non-blood-contacting muscle-powered LVAD system without these complications. 
“As a first step toward this goal, we have developed an implantable muscle energy converter (MEC) capable of transforming contractile energy into hydraulic power,” Trumble wrote in the project’s abstract. “The objective of this project is to assemble and test a non-blood-contacting ventricular assist system powered by this device.” The R01 grant has been approved for the next four years and will hopefully carry the project to the animal research stage.
In an interview with The Tartan, Trumble discussed two distinct features of his design. First, it’s a non-blood contacting device that avoids blood congestion problems. Most cardiac assisting devices are blood pumps, so they have to be in contact with the blood in order to achieve their functions. But blood has a tendency to clot, and blood clots tend to form inside these devices. Blood clots that get big enough can break free and travel from the device to other parts of the body. If they end up in the patient’s head, they can give the patient a stroke; similarly if they end up in the patient’s organ, they can lead to organ damage.
Because of these issues, doctors have to give the patients drugs to prevent the blood from clotting, but these drugs can have adverse effects. Often the drugs overcompensate, which can lead to patients losing too much blood since their blood is unable to clot if they are bleeding or injured. Trumble’s device solves this dilemma by not touching the blood at all. A part of the device goes around the aorta, the main artery that comes out of your heart, and squeezes the artery to displace the blood instead of pumping blood in the vessel.
The second key feature of Trumble’s device is that it’s a muscle-power-driven device that avoids infection caused by skin drivelines. Most cardiac assisting devices are electrical devices that have an electric cord that goes through the skin. The cord, which is called a driveline, can get infected and lead to death. Trumble’s device fixes this issue as it is totally internal and has no contact with the skin, which removes the risk of infection; the device is instead driven by muscle power. 
Researchers connect the muscle-power device to the latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and provide stimulants to activate the muscle so it does not fatigue. But trade-offs are that the muscle works slower and may not have enough power to completely facilitate the whole device. Fortunately, the research has proved that though energy output decreases, it’s still enough to sustain the device.
The idea of harnessing muscle power originated from Trumble’s prior studies at both Allegheny General Hospital and Carnegie Mellon University. Despite the team’s recent success, developing and modifying the device to its current design has been a long process. The first cylinder piston design was only able to last about 100 million cycles. The team’s recently completed research was focused on the seventh version of the original design.
Trumble’s device has a variety of possible future applications, including the development of a device that squeezes the heart directly. The research still needs time to be tested on patients before it becomes commercially available, but the researchers hope that the results from the research supported by the R01 grant will demonstrate the viability of harnessing energy from in situ muscle for long-term circulatory support, which has the potential to drastically reduce the cost of long-term cardiac support.

In the words of philosopher and politician Benjamin Franklin, “Time is money.” In the equally esteemed words of writer K. Bromberg, “Time is precious. Waste it wisely.” The idea that time is a finite commodity has stretched across generations, and we are often encouraged to use time as effectively as possible because eventually it runs out, or so it seems. Recent research in theoretical physics is questioning this finite view of time, and scientists in the field are beginning to postulate the feasibility of time travel.
Since Einstein presented his theory of general relativity in 1915, stating that time passes differently for objects moving at different velocities, the concept of time has been warped dramatically. Whereas time used to be viewed as a universal, linear progression of existence, physicists today debate the fundamental properties of time, such as whether it is continuous or quantized, unidirectional (only moving forward) or directionless (capable of moving forward and backward). These mysterious properties of time have given rise to the consideration of time travel, and many physicists argue that it is, in theory, possible.
For time travel to be possible, a body must move from one point in time to another, either to a point in the future or the past. 
Time travel into the future is conceptually much easier to understand and much more feasible than time travel into the past. As mentioned earlier, Einstein’s theory of relativity states that time moves differently for observers moving at different speeds. In application, this observation implies that if a body were to accelerate to a sufficient speed approximately near the speed of light, time for the moving body would move more slowly relative to a resting body. 
This observation is popularly presented in theoretical physics through the twin paradox: if Twin A were to remain on Earth, and Twin B got in a rocket and traveled near the speed of light some distance into space and then turned around and came back to Earth, more time will have passed for Twin A relative to Twin B’s frame of reference, and Twin A will have aged more than Twin B. Although Twin B has done nothing else other than travel at a very high speed, he has in effect traveled to the future through time dilation.
Time travel into the past uses the same principles of Einstein’s relativity, but in a much more complicated way. There are several ways in which a body can effectively move backward in time, the first of which relies on the above-mentioned principle of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Because objects at faster speeds move slower through time, if an object were to travel faster than the speed of light, it would reach a point before the light gets there itself, thereby reaching a point before we can perceive it in time, effectively causing travel into the past.
Alternatively, another method of time travel to the past relies on another principle of Einstein’s theory: that different gravitational fields pull on objects differently, more specifically that stronger gravitational fields cause time to travel more slowly. As an example, much like the Earth has a gravitational pull on all bodies around it, other bodies also have a gravitational field that pull on surrounding bodies. These gravitational pulls affect the passage of time differently for bodies within each gravitational field. Applying this to the theory of time travel, some physicists argue that time travel into the past could be achieved through the use of wormholes. 
A wormhole is a phenomenon that provides a shortcut between two points in space-time. A wormhole functions much like a tunnel: Instead of going over the length of the points between space-time, a wormhole simply goes through them. Connecting these two pieces of information, physicists suggest placing one wormhole near a very dense gravitational field and another near a much less dense gravitational field could create a potential time machine. 
Because time is synchronized within a wormhole, but unsynchronized outside the wormhole, the observer could travel through the wormhole at the gravitationally dense end at time A, and exit the wormhole at the other end at time A. However, because the dense gravitational field slows down time relative to the un-dense gravitational field, the observer is exiting at time A from the dense end, which has already passed in the un-dense field. This time dilation effectively causes a movement backward in time relative to the gravitationally weak region.
Although advancements have been made supporting time travel, it is still only a theoretical possibility. Applying these arguments in real-world experiments requires a much more technical and rigorous understanding of physics. Still, for something that was considered utter fiction only 100 years ago, time travel is an example of one of the ways science pushes the bounds toward making the seemingly impossible real.

Facebook testing alternative to Like button
Facebook’s hope to evolve the 1-D like button has garnered much interest in the past, but this week, Facebook released “Reactions,” a set of six emoji’s that will join the traditional like button. They hope that this new feature will make it easier for users to better express their feelings towards a post by choosing from love, laughter, happiness, shock, sadness and anger. Prior to a universal release, Facebook will test the experience in only Spain and Ireland. They hope to use the tests and user feedback to better fine-tune the service. Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s director of product, stated in an interview that these countries both have largely national user bases without extensive international friend networks, and it would be easier to analyze data on how the emoji-based system would benefit users.

Microsoft receives praise for additions to product line
This past week, Microsoft held a media event and introduced the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book, and new Lumina smartphones. Their release garnered much media attention and many positive reviews from tech insiders and users alike. The Surface Pro 4 is a strong follow-up to the Surface 3, and showcased a kickstand, stylus, improved keyboard cover, and powerful Windows 10 experience. The newer model is thinner, faster, has a fingerprint sensor, and allows users to interact with their device in a myriad of ways. Microsoft also showed their first ever in-house designed laptop, the Surface Book, which is a larger version of the Surface that can dock into an attached keyboard and provides a more powerful machine with stronger battery life.

Supercomputer simulates small part of rat’s brain
Scientists participating in the Blue Brain Project shared a supercomputer that is a digital imitation of an extremely small part of a mouse’s brain. The simulation models roughly 31,000 virtual brain cells and 37 million synapses. The project was based out of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and led by neurobiologist Henry Markram as part of an attempt to eventually simulate the human brain. The simulation uses experimental data to construct a relatively accurate model of neurons’ 3-D shapes, their electrical properties, and the ion channels and other proteins that different cell types produce. Their work thus far was featured in the Oct. 8 edition of the journal Cell detailing the collaboration between 80 researchers from 12 countries.

No new cases of Ebola documented in the past week
The African countries of Liberia, Guiena, and Sierra Leone have been plagued by an Ebola outbreak that has taken 11,000 lives over the past year, but there has been no new case of the disease reported within the past week. The most recent outbreak has been the worst in Ebola history due to the disease’s ease of transmission, poor cultural and medical practices, and infrastructural inadequacies. While the recent statistic is promising, officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged everyone to continue to be cautious, because it only requires one poorly handled case to cause another outbreak. While there is yet much to learn and the battle is far from over, the recent suppression of new cases provides optimism for an Ebola-free world.

Farmer unearths woolly mammoth in Michigan farm field
Michigan farmer James Bristle found buried bone eight feet underground while digging to install a drainage pipe in his wheat field last week. A team of paleontologists and students from the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology uncovered the remains of a woolly mammoth. They collected about 20 percent of the bones, including a massive skull with tusks. Researchers estimated that the mammoth lived between 11,700 and 15,000 years ago and was in its forties when it died. In addition to the remains, the paleontologists found evidence of human activity, revealing that the animal may have been intentionally buried. The specimen has been donated to the University of Michigan for further analysis, and the bones will likely be displayed in the university’s museum of natural history.

SpaceIL leads in Google Lunar X Prize challenge
The Google Lunar X Prize challenge is a competition that calls for teams to land on the moon, roam at least 500 meters, and return hi-res video and images to Earth. The Israeli Team SpaceIL established themselves as the clear front-runnner by being the first of the remaining groups to finalize a verified launch contract with the competition’s organizers. The winner of the project aims to be the first-ever privately funded lunar mission. The contract with SpaceX covers multiple missions and extends the deadline for the competition through 2017. The other teams remaining in the competition have stated that they have plans to launch their own probes, but have failed to produce a formal contract proving their plans.

Furious 8 finds its director
If my memory serves me right, speculation began last week regarding Vin Diesel’s role in the next Fast and Furious film. Could he be directing the eighth chapter? Past Fast and Furious directors Justin Lin and James Wan are off developing their next project, leading to the assumption that Vin could have a chance to sit in the directors chair. Well, the verdict is in, and it turns out that Diesel will serve as simply actor-producer.
The Italian Job and Straight Outta Compton director F. Gary Gray took to his Twitter account to announce that he will be helming the next chapter of the “Furious Family”. The decision to attach Gray could not be more appropriate. His directing history has shown him to be able to handle ensemble casts and achieve the difficult task of telling each character’s individual story while maintaining the integrity of the ensemble’s tale. Car — and boat — chases from The Italian Job coupled with Straight Outta Compton’s elements of family and brotherhood through intense situations, not to mention Gray’s well-standing with Universal Studios makes me say, with ease, that Furious 8 is in the best possible hands. And if you happened to be in the mood, Gray’s directorial effort in Law Abiding Citizen created, what I argue, one of the best villains in cinema of the last decade in Gerard Butler’s character Clyde Shelton. Furious 8 will hit theaters on April 14, 2017.
Cast of Harry Potter spinoff adds exciting talent
If the Harry Potter franchise is going to continue its expansion on the big screen, director David Yates knows full well the weight that comes with doing so. What’s the best way to put together an outstanding film? I’m not sure anyone knows for sure, but putting together a knockout cast isn’t a bad start and Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is doing exactly that. Already being led by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, the film has acquired yet another lead in Jon Voight (Coming Home, Midnight Cowboy). The excitement doesn’t stop there. The producers have also signed on Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Pacific Rim). The roles of Voight and Perlman are unknown, though Perlman is rumored to be playing a goblin. The cast is filled out by the likes of Colin Farrell, Dan Fogler, Katherine Waterston, and Ezra Miller. Yates, director of the last four Harry Potter films, is more than capable of delivering another magical thrill ride from the wizarding world and has some particularly impressive talent at his disposal. It seems as if Yates would solemnly swear that he is up to no good. Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them will open in theaters on Nov. 18, 2016.
Marvel Studios chooses writer to pen Black Panther script
Marvel Studios seems to have found a rhythm in their preproduction stages. Developing a character and a story arc seems to be simple due to their origins in the vast source material of the comic books. Then attaching a director and a star flows rather smoothly, as virtually every director and actor would be interested in playing a role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The director then has his hands deep in the development and writing stages of the script. With Black Panther, though, it seems Marvel is taking a new approach with the process. Chadwick Boseman has been attached to play the titular role since Oct. 2014, and Marvel has locked up writer Joe Robert Cole to put together the script, before a director has even been publicly announced. Despite this, however, I have to give Marvel the benefit of the doubt. They have consistently released high quality films since the beginning. Sure, a few efforts have missed the bull’s-eye, but the MCU has the ability to give an audience an exhilarating experience in the theater no matter what order they hire their talent. Captain America: Civil War is coming down the pike, and all signs point to another wild ride. Black Panther is scheduled to hit theaters July 6, 2018.
Could Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams pilot a Jaeger?
Director Guillermo del Toro is gearing up to release his newest project, Crimson Peak, but the looming thoughts of a sequel to his 2013 robots vs. monsters sci-fi film Pacific Rim are still up in the air. Del Toro was able to sit down with Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams and took to his Twitter account to tease us fans. “Had lunch with Maisie Williams yesterday. Remarkable. Dammit- if PR2 happens, that girl is getting a Jaeger.” The film has hit the skids in recent days, being eliminated from Universal Pictures’ release schedule, but this is something exciting to think about. Arya Stark piloting a Jaeger? Are you kidding me? These are the kinds of things fans talk about in living rooms all over the world: “Wouldn’t it be awesome if Arya fought Kaiju?” Williams is an outstanding actor with attitude, charisma, and talent to spare. I’m personally rooting for a sequel to Pacific Rim. I reluctantly entered the theater back in 2013 but walked out thoroughly entertained. I said it would be a waste. I said the effects couldn’t be good enough to make up for the terrible film. I was wrong. I was dead wrong, and now, I can’t cheer loud enough for chapter two. Come on, Universal! Pony up the dough and give us Arya Stark in a giant robot fighting giant monsters!

I love a cappella music. I love skillful arrangements; I love impassioned soloists and flailing beatboxers; and I love the overall power, artistry, and variability in the human voice. Because of that fact, AcaPitt is something I always look forward to because of its variety.
The concert was held in Rangos Ballroom, so the energy in the room was buzzing simply because of the sheer number of people. The night started out with a performance from Counterpoint, sporting fancy t-shirts with the event’s logo printed on them. It was a rather rough start for Counterpoint, as there appeared to be a fuddling of lyrics during their first song, a cover of Clean Bandit’s “Rather Be.” But Counterpoint hardly missed a beat, smiling and enjoying themselves the entire time. Their second song, an oldie and a goodie, “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” by the 4 Seasons, was a pleasant listen. Overall, I loved Counterpoint’s energy, and their beatboxer was pretty fly, making quite a few fun facial expressions throughout the night.
After Counterpoint left the stage, singers of the organization being benefited, Arts Greenhouse, a local hip-hop outreach group for high-school-age artists, came to perform. The first performance featured a soloist and a line of backup singers, and though I can’t quite remember it, I know that the tone was pretty lax and sad. Two members of the backup brigade then came forward and delivered some spoken word poetry, which I normally adore. This performance featured recitation of the pledge of allegiance, followed by a string of personal condemnations of the country’s despicable treatment of African Americans. The poetry, however, seemed a bit out of place and too aggressive for the overall tone of the night, which was whimsical (as a cappella usually is) and light-hearted. While the first poet did deliver some powerful lines and a message that is very relevant and very real these days, an audience member commented that he felt “very attacked” because of the sudden pejorative mood change. The third performance featured a young woman and two others singing a song that she wrote called, from what I could gather, “Six-String Soul”, which was very nice. I tend to really enjoy trio arrangements, and this one was not an exception. The main singer had such an expressive voice and body that I could really tell she was connected to the song, and it was pleasant to watch.
The Originals were next. The group, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this school year, is always a pleasure to watch. The group started their set with The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face,” featuring soloist Erik Fredriksen and his hair. It was pretty intense and heightened the mood of the room. The audience really enjoyed it, and while I hate the song, I enjoyed the arrangement. Their second song featured a puppy-eyed soloist whose rendition of Ed Sheeran’s “Give Me Love” was a great emotional contrast and compliment to the intensity of their first song. Their third song featured spunky soloist Angelo Ragghianti singing “Classic” with all of the backwards-hat swag he could muster. It was fun to watch, especially because of the song’s general lyrics which are quite uncharacteristic of him. I believe that backwards hats signal a personality shift that can only be measured in factors of swag, and Angelo’s swag factor was a good 3/5: not enough to be off-putting, but just enough to give him some measure of street cred.
Next up was the club group C#, who started with Coldplay’s “Magic”. The group was rather low-energy — perhaps a fault of the song — and parts were pitchy, but when member Christian Bernard came out from the back and started harmonizing, the pitchiness was less noticeable. The group then transitioned into Katy Perry’s “Birthday,” which was also a bit pitchy, but the soloist seemed to be having a great time, even bouncing up and yelling “Drop it!” at one point during her singing, cementing her as the only performer during the night to have both feet leave the stage. The final song in C#’s set was an Ariana Grande’s medley, which was pleasant, if a little loud.
Next up was Saans, a Western-South-Asian fusion group whose style was both fresh and enjoyable. Their first song was a mix between a song I didn’t recognize and Tiesto’s “Wasted,” which was really cute. The second song was what really caught my attention, though, because it incorporated some great soloists and a background harmony which created a very mystical atmosphere, and there’s hardly anything I love more than atmosphere of any kind. I absolutely adore the incorporation of South Asian lyrics and styles of singing into an English song-- it melded very well and was very enjoyable. The third combination, Kimbra’s “Settle Down” and “Zubi Dubi Zubi Dubi” from the movie 3 Idiots was very nice, though the soloist of “Settle Down” had a bit of a brittle high register.
Next up were the Soundbytes with Hozier’s “Someone New”. The soloist had a good voice for this song’s genre, and the background harmonies were buoyant and enjoyable. I was especially impressed by the overall cheekbone definition of this group — they had quite the architectural bone structure. The second song was mellow and worked perfectly for the soloist’s voice. The Soundbytes impressed me with their attention to soloist’s strongest styles and the genre of the song they sang. The final transition was into The Script’s “Breakeven,” which was great and high-energy.
Representing the University of Pittsburgh, Pitch Please was next. I remember them being quite good last year, and they did not disappoint. This year, however, they sported fancy baseball uniforms — get it? Pitch? Double entendre, there. Pitch Please had what I will call the most aggressively developed falsetto of the night. These guys even sounded like a women’s choir at one point — it was sensational. The beatboxer from the first song was especially fun to watch — he was getting so into every song, flailing his limbs in that good shadow-drumming, beatboxer way.
Next up was Joyful Noise, and the noise they made was true to their name. I really enjoy the passion that these singers bring to their performances. Their faith is mirrored so closely to their lyrics and overall presentation that any audience member can feel their sincerity. Overall, I adored this group and their performance.
The male equivalent to Saans, Deewane, was interesting. As I’ve said, I love the flavors of different styles coming together, but the arrangements seemed overly ambitious for the group. As the group sang Justin Timberlake's "Suit and Tie" there was a major issue in the soloists’ use of falsetto. It reminded me a little of Mariah Carey’s flubbed whistle tones at last year’s Rockefeller Center performance. Their saving grace, however, proved to be their soloists who sang in languages other than English, which the audience and I went crazy for.
The highlight of the night was the Treblemakers’ performance of B.O.B.’s “Magic”, which started off tender and sweet, and then out from nowhere, a woman from the middle busted out rhymes so fluid, I thought she would wash away the audience. She was sassing all over that stage, and the audience was going crazy. The second singer on melody was snapping and sassing alongside her, and their energy and talent were absolutely fantastic.
Counterpoint closed out the show with a second set which featured a mash-up of Lorde’s “Buzzcut Season” and Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek”, and with the naturally amazing harmonies that song presents, it was a very pleasant, calming listen. They finished the concert with Sia’s “Elastic Heart.” Sia, in my opinion, is one of the most difficult artists to cover because her songs are so aggressively crafted to her vocal style. That being said, it was a valiant effort on the part of Counterpoint’s final soloist.
AcaPittsburgh is an annual benefit concert started eight years ago by the all-female group Counterpoint. The concert features all eight of Carnegie Mellon’s acappella groups. This year, the charity concert benefited Arts Greenhouse, a local hip-hop outreach program, and raised over $3,000 for the organization.

Hello, Josh
I’m a man with a smooth, buttery, crystal-clear voice. When I was growing up, I always sang for my parents and my siblings and at church sometimes, and tens of people have told me that they loved my voice. I even have a YouTube channel where I get tens of hits a month. My problem is that nobody in Pittsburgh wants me. I auditioned for literally every single singing group on campus, and even some off-campus. I tried to get into a cappella groups, choirs, and even some high-quality voice lessons, but I’ve been shunned at every angle. I think that maybe people are intimidated of my dulcet, creamy tones, and that’s why they rejected me — they didn’t want me taking all of the spotlights, obviously. I mean, I expected people to be less selfish and appreciate amazing talent when they see it, but I guess that’s not a valid expectation. 
The most notable example I can remember is when I had my audition with a group that shall remain nameless, and by the end of my audition, the judging members were so touched by the beauty and the majesty and the incredible power of my voice that they were speechless. I waited outside the door and listened as they deliberated, and they were so severe in their biased critiques of the sensuous jiggling of my vocal chords that I knew immediately that they were threatened by me. I love to sing, but I can’t find a group that’s up to my caliber. Do you have any advice? I have included a recording of myself singing “Rolling in the Deep” with my signature roller-derby-punk-gospel-fusion style, for reference.
Signed
Totally Offended, Never Enough,
Dulcet, Euphonious, Awesome Fellow.
Dear TONE DEAF,
Since this is a newspaper, we cannot publish sound clips. I listened to your track, and I have some tough love for you: You are an objectively bad singer. You’re off pitch, your tone is strange, and it’s usually frowned upon to mimic whale calls in a Mickey Mouse falsetto. Your voice is some kind of mix between Crazy Frog, Nicki Minaj, and the Keebler Elf. It’s unpleasant. That’s just the fact of the matter. I may be serving you some Simon Cowell realness right now, but it comes from a place of honesty and compassion. If you really are dead-set on performing, I would take some intensive voice lessons over the next few years. If you work hard enough, I believe that one day, you may well be able to call yourself a singer. Also, it wouldn’t help to have some humility, hun. Even if you were a phenomenal singer, nobody wants to work with someone who thinks he’s all that and a bag of chips.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

Las Vegas, NV — “VEGAS, BABY!” Devin shrieks. You know what that means. The America’s Next Top Model (ANTM) contestants are heading to Sin City to pursue their modeling careers and undergo a slew of new challenges set forth by the queen of smize*, Tyra Banks.
This is cycle* 22, so if you haven’t heard of ANTM yet, it’s about time. Just in case you’re a little lost, here is some backstory: Tyra Banks started this crazy ride back in 2003 with 10 cycle-one finalists that were eliminated one-by-one each week until there was only one model left standing: America’s top model, if you will or, America’s next top model, since it takes a while to get her career going. It’s slightly ambiguous, but that’s the way Tyra likes it. Since that first season, Banks has worked to provide unexpected and entertaining variations on this basic premise. Cycle 13 featured a cast of comparably “short” models giving the writers inspiration for three amazing taglines that they could not decide between. Instead, they simply merged them into one: “The Lineup Is 5’ 7” And Under. Not The Usual Suspects. BOOK ‘EM!” Five cycles later, “British Invasion” brought us a competition within a competition as seven American contestants and seven British contestants vied for the overall title. And then there was the revolutionary cycle 20 “Guys & Girls: Who Will Dominate?” which introduced male models into the mix. This addition has stuck. Cycle 20, 21, and now 22 have all included male models in their casting. I guess the introduction of romantic drama is good for ratings. Who would’ve thought?
This season has pushed the cast to their limits. Even living with other models in a single mansion can be a feat of psychological willpower. The cast is varied, featuring two pageant queens, two high school students, a shaggy-haired womanizer, and a whole lot of crazies. Within the first week, cliques formed and confrontations abounded. From dirty dishes to bathroom walk-ins, there were plenty of reasons for individuals to butt heads. Not literally though, because, as faithful ANTM fans will remember, Romeo got kicked out of the competition for doing just that in cycle 21. While some of the cast are prone to fights, there are always a few that keep the peace, or at least minimize the damage. Nyle is one of these voices of reason. He was born deaf and communicates with the others by signing with an interpreter or by texting over a phone. He is always able to get into the middle of these senseless verbal smack downs and remind everyone of what is really important.
We are now down to the final six: Mamé, Hadassah, Mikey, Lacey, Nyle, and Devin. The previous week, 18-year-old Dustin was brought back into the competition after being eliminated previously (just go with it) and Devin was almost eliminated after delivering a divisive photograph at the previous photoshoot. Tyra will always love the uniqueness of Devin’s look, but the other judges, while intrigued at first, are growing tired of his immaturity on set.
This week’s shoot moved away from the classic photoshoot and had the models act in a music video promoting TYRA Beauty “cosmetics experience.” TYRA Beauty is a direct-selling cosmetics business enabling self-funded individuals to begin a career as a Beautytainer*. The music video is set to the TYRA Beauty theme song “BOOTYful.” “Not beautiful, ‘BOOTY-ful’” Tyra explains to the contestants. A couple of the performances stood out. For instance, despite his hearing impairment, Nyle had an incredible and unique performance in the music video by signing the lyrics to the beat of the song. He studied the lyrics and the beats (which he felt through headphones) in parallel in order to feel how the words might sound and impressed the judges with his ability to not only participate, but to excel in the music video shoot. Meanwhile, Mikey’s “rocker” energy and hair flips earned him major points with the judges. As for high-schooler Dustin, the judges cited his inability to take direction and his timidity as reasons for his lackluster performance. As a result, Dustin was sent home again, just one week after being offered a second chance.
Glossary
Beautytainer: “Fierce, independent sales reps who share and sell TYRA Beauty”.
Cycle: The term used to describe a season of America’s Next Top Model since the rate at which they are produced is faster than a classic season.
Smize: A modeling technique wherein the model smiles with their eyes and not their lips.

Feeling sad? Well then “get thee a wife!” says Benedick, a character in William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing, currently in performance at the Phillip Chosky Theater through next weekend. Opening the School of Drama’s 2015-16 main stage season, director Anthony McKay, a professor of acting at Carnegie Mellon, sets Shakespeare’s comedy of dueling wits and mistaken identity in the bright colors and innovative fashions of 1960’s Italy and plays up the slapstick comedy inherent in the Bard’s words to great effect.
Much Ado About Nothing is one of the more accessible and crowd-pleasing works in Shakespeare’s canon, and much of that comes from the wonderfully drawn characters and rapid-fire wordplay. McKay’s production stars senior musical theatre major Joshua Grosso as Benedick, a soldier who returns to Messina and claims to be free of any interest in the opposite sex, but nonetheless is engaged in an ongoing battle of wits with Beatrice, played by senior acting major Molly Griggs. They both claim to hate each other, but that outward disdain simply masks a deep attraction that everyone else can see. Benedick’s friend, Claudio, played by senior acting major Ben Mathews, is himself earnestly in love with Beatrice’s cousin Hero, played by senior acting major Caroline Pluta. Don John, played by senior acting major Casey Cott, hatches a plan to ruin the impending marriage between Claudio and Hero in order to get revenge on his brother and friend of both Benedick and Claudio, Don Pedro, played by senior acting major Chris Garber. The play follows the redemption of honor as well as the characters’ reconciliation of their inner and outer selves, and the School of Drama’s production hits all the right notes.
Looking at the acting, all of the leads handle Much Ado’s shifts from nimble-tongued comedy to personal drama naturally and smoothly, especially Grosso. We first meet his Benedick as a broadly drawn funnyman full of machismo, and over the course of the show Grosso maneuvers the character’s growth towards accepting his inner feelings expertly. Griggs’s Beatrice spits her words sharply and always impressively allows an undercurrent of affection to bleed into her venomous insults. Pluta injects Hero with strength and confidence, a welcome variation on a character often played as timid and delicate. Cott’s Don John skulks around the stage with a constant look of spite, and often has to fight against showing his inner joy when his plan begins to work, and Hero is publicly shamed. Joseph Essig also shines as Don John’s henchman Borachio, inhabiting his character with a devilish swagger that lights up all of his scenes.
One of the more interesting choices in the production is the 1960’s Italian setting, expressed predominantly by the set and costumes. The set, designed by drama masters student Alison Gondek, features scaffolding surrounding Roman ruins, red-and-white checkered tablecloths, and a giant marquee spelling out an unfinished “Campari” advertisement. Large video screens on either side of the stage project images reflecting what’s occurring on stage, and range from vintage Vespa ads to character mug shots. A stage in the upper right corner allows live musicians to perform in various scenes, and the keyboards and electric guitar help establish a sense of time and place well. The lights in the Campari ad also react to the action of the play itself, flickering and shorting out when trust between the characters is broken and coming back to life when balance is restored to the world. Characters dress in the bright colors and thin skirts of the era, making the production a visual buffet that is never boring to look at.
Much Ado About Nothing is playing Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Phillip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center for the Arts, with an additional matinee at 2 p.m. on Saturday. Tickets are $10 for students and available at the Purnell box office. It’s an entertaining and lively show that offers an enjoyable experience whether or not you count yourself a Shakespeare fan. The characters and jokes are some of the most beloved in the English language, and McKay’s bright production adds relevance to the words without drowning the script in historical kitsch.

The Flash is a CW television series built around its namesake DC superhero character. Season One, which ended early this year, was a well written, briskly paced, lighthearted look at one of DC’s most entertaining characters. Unlike most superhero productions today, whether TV or film, one of the ways The Flash excelled is that it was deeply personal — there were very few over-the-top “end of the world” cliffhangers. The show was more about Barry Allen learning to be the Flash as he dealt with his own personal demons.
Season Two premiered a couple of days ago, and it seems to have an unmistakably different tone than the first. Personally, I can’t quite decide if whether or not I like it, but it definitely has my attention. Episode 1, “The Man Who Saved Central City,” deals with some of the end-of-season cliffhangers from the first season. Six months have passed since the cataclysmic conclusion of the last season, and Barry Allen has isolated himself from his friends and family. He works alone, struggling with guilt over his inability to save everyone, and is afraid that those he loves will be hurt if he lets them get too close. In most situations, this kind of moping would seem coy and cloying, but Grant Gustin’s charming and lighthearted portrayal of Barry Allen seems to pull it off. Cisco Ramone, the designated comic-relief/whiz kid, has joined the police’s anti-metahuman task force. Dorky and daft as ever, he brings the laughs in an otherwise heavy episode (by this series’s standards). Caitlin, the only character even more shattered than Barry after last season’s conclusion, has left the old team behind and taken a job at Mercury labs.
As such, the first episode has plenty on its plate to deal with in terms of just winding up loose ends. The way a season one Flash episode would have done this would have been by starting to make progress on cleaning up last season’s mess, while trotting out the weekly villain and maybe, just maybe, introducing a new story thread or two to build on in the next episode. “The Man Who Saved Central City,” on the other hand, pretty much reveals all its cards within the first twenty minutes and goes for broke story-wise in the next twenty. While it is admirable how much the status quo seems to change within one episode, I can’t help but feel like no one plot thread was really done justice.
The entire team reunites just a little too easily, for example. Caitlin, having lost the love of her life, has been running away from everyone for an entire six months. When she comes back, no real explanation is given, other than that curiosity gets the better of her when Cisco shows her a drained radiation tag from this week’s baddie, Atom Smasher. Barry resists a bit more, but even he comes around quickly enough when he has some trouble defeating Atom Smasher. Strangest of all, however, is Iris West — the girl Barry is crazy about, who was engaged to be married to Eddie Thawne last season. She saw Eddie put a gun to his own heart and shoot last season, and she seems to have recovered from that experience just a little too quickly. If anything, she’s the pillar of strength that brings everyone back together.
Another seemingly unnecessary thread concerns how Henry Allen, Barry’s father, is dealt with in this episode. It turns out that Harrison Wells, last season’s main villain, left a living will that confesses to the murder of Nora Allen, thereby exonerating Henry. In one fell swoop, last season’s principal dramatic arc is dealt with in five minutes. But what comes next is even stranger: Henry, a free man after nearly twenty years, decides he’d rather not be a “weight on Barry” and decides to leave town within a day of getting out. In the middle of all this, the episode also manages to introduce Jay Garrick, a speedster from another universe, and Zoom, who will presumably become this season’s big baddie.
The Flash is one of those rare superhero productions that wholeheartedly embraces its comic book origins, for better or worse. This week’s episode fell somewhere in the middle, with both the strengths and flaws of the format in full focus. Pulling off a series premiere like this is a very ambitious gamble, and the writers and cast would’ve pulled it off if not for some minor missteps. However, as a viewer, all I ended up noticing was that this week The Flash went a little too fast.

Walk The Moon once again graced Pittsburgh with their presence on Sunday Oct. 4 at the University of Pittsburgh’s Fall Fest. After a week of bad weather, it seemed as if the skies cleared just in time for this outdoor performance. Surprisingly, the turnout was nowhere near as large as expected for a university the size of Pitt.
There were two openers before Walk the Moon took the stage: The first was a band comprised of Pitt students, and the second was Coin, a nascent band based out of Nashville who performed songs from their self-titled debut album. However, before Coin was able to take the stage, there appeared to be several technical difficulties that left the crowd waiting in anticipation for quite a few hours. As two Carnegie Mellon students in a sea full of Pitt students, we had half a mind to call AB Tech to resolve the problem. Eventually, all issues were fixed and Coin’s performance went off without any more hitches.
Luckily, the waiting time between Coin and Walk the Moon was far shorter. The sun had been hidden behind buildings for hours; it finally emerged as Walk the Moon came to stage with “Circle of Life” playing in the background. It felt like a scene out of a movie, and it was the first of many times throughout the performance that we had to resist the urge to start crying. Unfortunately, there didn’t seem to be as large a number of Walk the Moon fans as there were general concertgoers, which seemed to lower the overall crowd enthusiasm. We missed the general excitement that the intimate feel of Carnegie Mellon’s fall concert tends to induce. But nevertheless, we were excited, and that was all that really mattered.
The band opened with “Jenny,” a debut album favorite about a summer fling. Opening with this song showed their dedication to pleasing the fans that have been there since the beginning of their music career. Following this, they launched into songs from their second album Talking Is Hard. The crowd seemed to be a little more into songs from the new album, as this is the album that really put Walk the Moon on mainstream radio. The energy picked up and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.
One thing about Walk the Moon that is always enjoyable, whether you’ve been a fan since the band’s beginning or only really know the tune to a song or two, is their overall sense of positivity. This is reflected in their song “Different Colors” which the lead singer, Nick Petricca, prefaced with a message about how important diversity and equality are. The lyrics “different colors/we carry each other” show how much they value the acceptance of differences between people.
After this song, they took listeners back to the band’s start with “Tightrope,” another favorite from their debut album. The set list seemed very well planned. They went back and forth between old and new songs to keep the crowd of varied fans interested, no matter which point they began listening to Walk The Moon. Beginning with “Tightrope,” the band transitioned into the high intensity, fast paced, self-empowerment song lineup from their new album, such as “Up 2 U” and “Work This Body.” The crowd loved it. Nick’s high energy and over-the-top dancing also satisfied the audience.
A slight technical bump occurred as Nick began to set up his keyboard. As self-proclaimed Walk the Moon experts, we knew the keyboard meant one thing — it was time for the love songs. The band shifted gears and transitioned into songs “Portugal” and “Aquaman,” which never fail to take any Walk the Moon fan on a trip through all of their emotions. This was the second time we had the urge to cry, only this time there was no stopping the tears. The whole crowd was swaying in unison, and we were pretty sure that everyone was on a feels trip.
After drying our tears, we waited in anticipation for what direction the concert would go in next. In true Walk the Moon fashion, the audience members were  initiated into proper Walk the Moon fans via the song “I Can Lift a Car.” At each concert that the band puts on, they open this song with a speech about letting go of all of your worries and nervousness about the past and future and just enjoying where you are right now. Nick begins to push his arms up to the sky to symbolize the letting go of his troubles, and he invites the entire crowd to do the same. During the chorus of the song, the band and the entirety of the crowd pump their arms up and down in perfect unison. The collective feel of happiness and positive energy was thrilling for old and new fans alike.
The band closed with the very popular and arguably the crowd’s favorite “Shut Up and Dance.” The band sang the chorus of the song in a repeat-after-me fashion, and the crowd ate it up. The crowd half sang and half screamed the lyrics “shut up and dance with me” in sync with the band, and the energy of the audience was at an all-time high.
As the band exited the stage, the post-concert depression started to kick in. But the familiar screams of “Encore! Encore!” reminded us that there was definitely something else in store. The band rushed back on stage and the excitement level immediately skyrocketed back up. The band played “Anna Sun,” one of the band’s first songs to get popular, as the encore. The song wound down and brought the concert to its close. The band thanked the audience for their love and support, said one final “We love you, Pittsburgh,” and we once again felt the need to cry.
Whether you watched the concert as a returning fan or had never heard a Walk The Moon song before this occasion, we believe the band succeeded in entertaining the crowd. Despite the late arrival from the airport and several technical difficulties that had to be overcome, Walk the Moon still gave this concert their all. Needless to say, Walk The Moon is always welcome here in Pittsburgh.

“The Mysterious Nature of Fungi” has been on display for three weeks now at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon, located on the fifth floor of the Hunt Library. The exhibit provides visitors with an overview of the small inconspicuous fungal organisms that can be found in abundance almost anywhere on the planet. According to the exhibition’s website, the exhibit addresses important issues such as the characteristics of these organisms that create delirium, their relationship to disease and death, their use as wild and cultivated edibles, and the beneficial parasitic relationships they have with other organisms. The display explains the different types of fungi and provides insight into common misconceptions like “magic mushrooms,” or “the cereal killer.”
Lugene Bruno, Curator of Art for the Hunt Institute, believes that fungi “have a strong relationship to so many disciplines, not only their sculptural structures but also what is going on underground,” and is fascinated with the strong and intricate network they create. Choosing the topic of fungi for the exhibition stemmed from his curiosity about fungi and desire to understand the importance of these organisms. This was aided by the willingness to investigate the crucial role that fungi play in our survival by passing along nutrients to other plants or accumulating debris, and the dangerous properties they possess that can cause disease or crop damage. The Institute has been collecting several images of fungi for many months now, and they have come across several fascinating species. The cabinet of curiosities in the Hunt Institute lobby will also display a series of lithographs from a limited-edition portfolio by 20th-century American avant-garde composer, writer, and visual artist John Cage.
Having been recognized in 1969 as the fifth kingdom of organisms, the characteristics and properties of fungi are still largely unknown to larger audiences and experts alike, with many species still undiscovered. By introducing this exhibit to Carnegie Mellon, Lugene Bruno hopes to instill a greater respect and interest in the organism in all who attend.
The exhibition was opened to the public on Sept. 17, with an audience of 70 to 80 guests, and attendance has been regular since then. 
While most visitors aren’t affiliated with the school, an increase in student activity has been observed. Responses have been positive, and visitors have shown a great interest in this subject. The exhibit attracts not only people with backgrounds in biology, but also visitors from other, only tangentially related disciplines such as design, art, and music.
The fifth floor of the Hunt Institute is surrounded by a mix of pictures, illustrations, and historical contexts in a variety of formats, intended to make “The Mysterious Nature of Fungi” an experience of visual and intellectual discovery. 
As part of an effort to engage students, the Hunt Institute is reaching out to faculty and encouraging teachers to promote the exhibit. One recently developed initiative brought a class of artists to the exhibition to draw based on the illustrations and pictures on display.
The Mysterious Nature of Fungi will be on display in the Hunt Library until Dec. 17, free of charge.

Investors and start-up heads alike sat around white-clothed tables in the Rangos Ballroom last Thursday for the third annual LaunchCMU showcase. Hosted twice a year by the university’s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), LaunchCMU is a presentation of technology inspired by Carnegie Mellon research, according to co-director of the CIE and opening speaker Dave Mawhinney.
This year’s theme, “the business of learning,” focused on technologies aimed at improving education. According to director of the Simon Initiative, Norman Bier, this field has been steadily growing since Herb Simon introduced an approach to “learning science,” or the idea of improving education through data-driven analysis. Bier was one of the eight speakers at the showcase.
According to Bier, the Simon Initiative, launched in 2013, is what President Subra Suresh was told to “get excited about” when he ascended to university presidency the year after. Along with its breakthroughs in research, the Initiative also forged better relationships between other industries and the university, through projects such as DataLab, which uses data-driven analysis to improve learning outcomes, and the Global Learning Council, which unites global leaders in technology-based learning. Such partnerships further the university’s entrepreneurial aims, according to Provost Farnam Jahanian. Jahanian cited the CIE’s mission statement toward the end of his opening words as making the university a “destination of choice” for all those interested in entrepreneurship.
Several different Pittsburgh-area and Carnegie Mellon-based startups presented at LaunchCMU.
Expii
Carnegie Mellon math professor Po-Shen Loh brings attention to the Pittsburgh area not only for coaching the winning United States team in the international Math Olympiad, but also because of the fact that Expii, the startup he founded, is headquartered in Bakery Square.
Expii, an online tutoring tool, has brought $1 million dollars in local investments. Loh described the app as “Wikipedia on steroids.” All “course materials” on Expii — whether text, video, or even questions — are crowdsourced by contributing authors. As students progress through each topic, they get feedback on questions they missed and concepts they did not understand.
Such availability of information, Loh said, perfectly embodies two American principles to which he credits his famous Olympiad win: “freedom of happiness, and freedom to pursue information.”
Duolingo
In his presentation, Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and founder of Duolingo, Luis von Ahn, explained that education, rather than being a great equalizer, could in fact be a cause of inequality. In this talk, he cited learning a language as one such example. Although the most in-demand second language is English, and those motivated to learn it are usually lower-class immigrants, software tools like Rosetta Stone can cost around $500. 
Thus came the inception of Duolingo: a completely free online language learning tool. Duolingo proves to be about as effective in 36 hours as one semester of foreign language in college.
Like its user-base, Duolingo is constantly improving its abilities: within six hours, the website can gather enough data on users to compare whether one method of language learning is stronger than another. “It’s not based on philosophy, or anything,” von Ahn said. “It’s based on data collected from our users.”
TutorGen Inc.
Next came HCII professor and founder of TutorGen, Inc., John Stamper. Digital adaptive learning — or teaching tools that “adapt” to individual students’ needs — can often be expensive and difficult to implement. With TutorGen, Stamper strives to provide a solution to his own question: “How can we make adaptive learning broader and more usable around the world?” With its components, SCALE (Student-Centered Adaptive Learning Engine) and DataLab, TutorGen brings a quantitative approach to improving currently existing educational technology by using machine learning to identify “gaps” in students’ knowledge.
Acrobatiq
Acrobatiq, a branding and advertising company, finds its biggest enemy in the graduation crisis, according to Chief Marketing Officer Allison Pendergast. Half of U.S. students who start college will never finish their degrees. 
The Open Learning Initiative (OLI) already exists at Carnegie Mellon to provide free and open online courseware. “If the OLI was a medical trial, it would have to be stopped because of its success,” Pendergast said.
Acrobatiq aims to rebuild the OLI on a more localized scale, so that faculties of individual universities can author content and use data analytics to keep track of each student’s progress in the course to determine “who needs help, when, and where,” Pendergast said.
Digital Dream Labs
“Imagine a world where we solve No Child Left Behind,” stated Chief Executive Officer Jacob Hanchar, “and we did that through gamification.” 
Digital Dream Labs was launched by graduates from the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon.
Hanchar hopes to bring a vibrancy to education, similar to Pixar’s vibrancy in the arena of entertainment, by having students interact with games. For young children, he believes that the most effective learning should be tactile, not abstract. “We need to have something in our hands,” he said.
Simcoach Games
“In many ways, [games and learning] are intertwined,” stated Chief Executive Officer Jessica Trybus, another graduate of the Entertainment Technology Center. Simcoach Games was developed in order to educate an especially large niche: employees.
In a demonstration, Trybus played a game that trained cashiers at grocery stores in methods that could prevent the risk of overexertion, such as grabbing heavy items with two hands, while still being efficient. If the potential employee doesn’t win the game, explained Trybus, they would not pass the training — a much larger indicator of readiness than simply “showing up” to a presentation.
Interstacks
While technology increasingly takes the shape of “an Internet of things,” as phrased by Chief Executive Officer Gary Kiliany, engineering hardware remains an especially slow and expensive process.
Interstacks’s solution to this problem is as simple as snappable electronic “blocks,” each of which can be programmed to serve a single function, ranging from sending a tweet, turning on the remote, or raising the volume.
With this technology, Kiliany hopes to not only support large industries, but also a growing DIY culture.
“The smartphone/Facebook generation is not just consuming mass-produced products from mass-produced companies,” Kiliany said. “They’re taking advantage of these new technologies.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Rick Atkinson spoke at Carnegie Mellon as part of the Cèilidh Weekend homecoming celebrations this Thursday. Atkinson is the author of the Liberation trilogy, consisting of An Army at Dawn, The Day of Battle, and The Guns at Last Night, which give a narrative history of the United States’ military role in the liberation of Europe in World War II. As part of his talk, Atkinson spoke about World War II and the information he collected during his writing process.
World War II began on Sept. 1, 1939 with the German invasion of Poland, and lasted until Sept. 2, 1945 with the surrender of Japan. It lasted a total of 2,174 days and caused over 60 million casualties. “That’s 27,600 dead every day for six years, 1150 an hour… .a death every three seconds,” Atkinson said. Last month marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, leading many to reflect on the consequences of this historical event and what exactly it means to the world so many years later. 
Before the war, the United States Army was not a dominant force on the world stage. With a growing need for manpower, the U.S. grew drastic in its search for men. “By 1944, 11,000 young men every day were being drafted into the United States Army and Navy,” Atkinson said. Because it was the ‘40s-era United States, there was an an initial selective recruitment of young white men of good health between the ages of 18 and 45. However, because of the effects of the Depression and the desperate need for manpower, the standards for the “ideal soldier” had to be lowered.
“The desperate need for bodies in uniform….led to the drafting of what were known as physically imperfect men,” Atkinson said. 
The requirement for soldiers to have 12 of their 32 teeth intact was now lowered to zero. Good vision and hearing — even having your trigger finger intact — were now a thing of the past. “They no longer examined eyes; they just counted them,” according to Atkinson. By the end of the war in 1945, the U.S. army had grown to 8.3 million soldiers.
It should also be noted that, as a result of this issue, the war also created progress for racial minorities and women. During World War I, black men were seen as incompetent, subservient, and unfit to fight in the war. At the start of World War II “fewer than 4,000 blacks served in the army,” Atkinson said. By the end of the war, this number was approaching one million. This proved to be beneficial to the civil rights movement, as the black American population fought battles abroad and at home. Today, the United States Army comprises 20 percent black soldiers. 
In the same vein, it is no surprise that the army during this time was an overwhelmingly male institution. But the demand for manpower challenged this quota as well. With so many of the men off fighting, women were rapidly being drawn into workplaces back at home, and their numbers in the military started to rise. According to Atkinson, “In today’s military, about 16 percent of the officers and 7 percent of general officers are women.”
Many fighters returned from the war blinded, paralyzed, or as amputees. At the very least, they could say that they returned home alive — 400,000 Americans died as a result of the war. 
Atkinson went on to recount the stories of individuals that were affected by the war. “Patricia O’Malley was a year old when her father, Major Richard James O’Malley, was killed by a sniper,” Atkinson said. After seeing his headstone for the first time, Patricia wrote, “I cried for the joy of being there and the sadness of my father’s death.… I’d cried for all the words I’d wanted to say and wanted to hear, but had not.… I cried.”
Henry A. Wright was a widower who lived on a farm in southwestern Missouri. “One by one, his dead sons arrived at the local train station” recounted Atkinson. “The elder Wright watched as the caskets were carried into the rusty bedroom where each of those boys had been born…. In the morning they bore the brothers to the hilltop cemetery side by side by side. That’s how the dead came home.”
Whether it was the death of a friend, a lover, a father, or a son, few could say that their lives were not affected by this catastrophic war. Rick Atkinson delivers his talk on the war with poignant details, causing a hushed silence in the audience at the most emotional of moments, and even laughter at the absurdity of some of the historical facts. 
Director of the Humanities Scholars Program and history professor at Tim Haggerty said, “I was pretty sure I knew how the Second World War ended when I began An Army at Dawn, but the means by which the author combined primary research, biography, tactics, topography, politics, and history just kept me turning pages.”

“I’m a fighter, and I don’t give up,” former U.S. Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, said at Carnegie Mellon last Friday. In her speech “What’s Gone Wrong in Washington, and Why It Doesn’t Have To Be This Way,” Snowe addressed the Senate’s dysfunction and political polarization. Nowadays, she said, this polarization makes it more difficult for the government to effectively solve problems. Associate Dean of Dietrich College, Joseph Devine, moderated Snowe’s speech.
Snowe also criticized the Senate for not living up to what the Founding Fathers envisioned. She points out that the status quo becomes problematic because the electorate of America is divided, and it is difficult to motivate officials to look past their differences and reconcile through bipartisanship. She explained that the reasons for this division are deeply rooted in the evolution of the government over the last three decades, which make it no longer viable for the majority of senators and congresspeople to work across the party line.
Snowe also said that political realignment is fundamental. “Republicans dominate the South and much of the West, while Democrats take the Northeast and many West coast states,” Snowe said, and Republicans have become “monolithic and ideologically intolerant.” In other words, the widening divergence between the two parties is harming the U.S. political system.
To improve the political system, Snowe called for reconciliation — something that she has been fighting for for decades. 
Moreover, she emphasized the participation of people, saying that politics are too dangerous to be left to politicians. She proposed that the Congress should work on a five-day-a-week basis. She said this five-day workweek would be more efficient compared to the existing (and insufficient) two-and-a-half-day workweek.
Snowe also spoke about her career and early life. Snowe’s independence and passion for serving others stemmed from losing both her parents before she was 10 years old. In 1973, when Snowe was 26, her first husband and Maine state congressman Peter Snowe was killed in a car accident. Since she was already dedicated to public service, Olympia ran for the open seat, representing her hometown of Auburn, and won. Thus began her 40 years in politics.
Snowe served in both Houses of the Maine Legislature. She was re-elected in 1974, then moved to the Maine Senate, representing Androscoggin County in 1976. Snowe was U.S. Senator from Maine (1995-2013) and Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-1995). Her work in the U.S. Senate garnered her nationwide recognition as a leading policymaker in Washington. In 2005, she was named the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine. With her election in 1994, Olympia J. Snowe became only the second female Senator in history to represent Maine, following the late Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, who served from 1949-1973. 
In November 2006, Snowe was reelected to a third six-year term in the United States Senate with 74 percent of the vote. Before her election to the Senate, Olympia Snowe represented Maine’s Second Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives for sixteen years.
Senator Snowe is only the fourth woman in history to be elected to both houses of Congress, and the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of state legislature as well as both houses of Congress. Additionally, she is the first Greek-American woman ever elected to Congress. She has won more federal elections in Maine than any other person since World War II.
Snowe had a reputation as one of the Congress’ leading moderates, as she aided in bipartisan consensus on key issues that matter to Maine and America. In 1999, she was cited by Congressional Quarterly for her centrist leadership, and was co-chair with Senator Mary Landrieu of the Common Ground Coalition, a bipartisan, consensus-building forum for communication and cooperation between Senate Democrats and Republicans.
When Snowe was still in the Senate, she worked extensively on a number of issues, such as budget and fiscal responsibility; education, including student financial aid and education technology; national security; women’s issues; health care, including prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients; welfare reform; issues surrounding oceans and fisheries; and campaign finance reform. During her tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, she co-chaired the Congressional Caucus on Women’s issues for ten years and provided leadership in establishing the Office of Women’s Health at the National Institutes of Health. She also served as a member of the House Budget Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where she was Ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on International Operations; and the former House Select Committee on Aging, where she was Ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Human Services.
Snowe stunned Washington when she announced in February 2012 that she would not seek re-election. 
Snowe had recognized, she said, that “changes always occur on the other side and not from within,” and decided to take her battle against partisanship outside the institution of government. It was that year that she realized that legistlative polarization is not a short-term problem, so she decided that she would work throughout the country to accomplish her goals. “I’m a fighter and I don’t give up,” Snowe said.
Snowe has published three books, including Women in Congress 1917-2006, Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate, and her most recent book, Fighting for Common Ground: How We Can Fix the Stalemate in Congress. In Fighting for Common Ground, published in 2013, Snowe wrote about her political and personal beliefs and goals.

Last April, 34.4 percent of the student body on the Pittsburgh campus of Carnegie Mellon University participated in a survey that measured students’ experiences with sexual assault and relationship violence (SARV). On Thursday, the results of that survey were released via an email from University President Subra Suresh and Provost Farnam Jahanian. The email not only included a link to the results document, but also a plan for the upcoming town hall meetings on Oct. 19, 27, and 28 to discuss the findings.
According to the email, the town hall meetings will focus on “community discussions about how this information should further influence our priorities moving forward.” Referencing the Oct. 3 email from Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, the email urged students and faculty to participate in these discussions in order to help steer the direction of prevention efforts on campus.  
“Students should know that we did this study to inform our planning and actions. It was designed not just to share experiences but to be action-oriented and guide next steps,” said Holly Hippensteel, assistant dean of student affairs and interim director of the Office of Title IX Initiatives, in an email to The Tartan. “I hope that students, and everyone, will consider the results and then participate in our town hall discussions. I believe that the only way we will make headway in reducing the incidence of sexual misconduct is by working together as a community.”
The results of the survey were presented in the form of a 60-page PDF that outlined every step of the study, from the committee that worked to create it to the measures that they took to ensure that the questions were sensitively phrased. Hippensteel said that the survey’s inception and administration went well. “We had to make some difficult choices about what to include in this study and what were our highest priorities among things that were all very important to us,” she wrote.
The major findings of the study were reported, but so were the responses to every question. Written by Janel Sutkus, director of Institutional Research and Analysis, the results broke every element of the survey down. “Since this was the first time that we asked these questions of [Carnegie Mellon] students, I did not have any hypotheses about what we would learn,” Sutkus said in an email to The Tartan. 
According to Sutkus, the committee is comfortable that the majority of students who took the survey interpreted it in the way that the questions were intended to be read, an important part of creating a survey that deals with such sensitive data. Given that April’s iteration of the survey was the first of its kind on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, there was a lot of attention given to getting the most accurate results. Sutkus and her team first presented test questions to the student government executive branch, the SARV Prevention Committee, and the Survivor’s Support Network (SSN) and then administered the survey to three groups of pilot-test students.
The major takeaways of the study include data about overall rates of sexual assault—both attempted and perpetrated—amongst Carnegie Mellon students, rates of reporting, the effectiveness of Carnegie Mellon’s prevention programming, and the perceptions on campus about SARV. According to the study, 26 percent of undergraduate women at Carnegie Mellon have experienced sexual assault since they enrolled at the university, which is on par with the nationwide reports. Among the undergraduate male population, 9 percent experienced sexual assault since enrolling. 
The data indicates that across all responders, 12 percent reported experiencing completed assault during their time enrolled at Carnegie Mellon, and that of the 438 students, one-third had experienced multiple assaults. Rates of sexual assault went up with age: while 18.9 percent of female undergraduates and 4.1 percent of male undergraduates experienced a completed sexual assault, those rates both increased by the time the responders were upperclassmen, to 34 percent and 15.1 percent respectively. 
As far as reporting rates went, the survey reports that “less than 5% of each type of attempted or completed sexual assault type is reported to CMU: however, given our measurement of ‘any experience since enrolling’ not all sexual assaults are within CMU’s purview.”
For nearly every type of attempted or completed sexual assault about which the survey asked, it was found that the majority of students were most likely to have told another student about the assault without a follow up report to the university. Rates of telling the university, via University Health Services (UHS), Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), faculty and staff outside of those two departments, or Carnegie Mellon law enforcement, are extremely low across the board, especially among male graduate students, none of whom reported telling anyone at Carnegie Mellon about the attempted or completed assault.
The data reported in this survey is far too vast to be reported in just one article in The Tartan and can be found online at http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/sarv-study/index.html.
The study did not cover sexual harassment and stalking. However, an additional survey to be released later this fall will collect that data from Carnegie Mellon students, according to Sutkus. The SARV study will be repeated every three years to keep up with any changing trends, said Sutkus.
All who were a part of producing the survey expressed their gratitude toward the students who participated.
 “I am incredibly grateful to each student who participated in the study, and in particular, to those who never told anyone about their experiences with sexual assault or relationship violence but chose to share those experiences with us on the survey,” Sutkus wrote.

Recently PocketGuardian, an app to alert parents when cyberbullying or sexting has occurred on their child’s phone, launched for iOS and Android devices. According to PocketGuardian’s website, the purpose of PocketGuardian is not for parents to spy on their child, but to “help prevent the devastating consequences of sexting and cyberbullying.” The app was founded by parents and software developers James Ryan and Jason France, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who completed both his undergraduate and graduate studies here, graduating from Heinz College in 2004.
The idea for PocketGuardian came from a story that Ryan and France had heard in the news: A teenage girl had committed suicide after a nude photo of her was spread amongst her classmates. Moved by the tragic yet all-too-familiar case of cyberbullying, France and Ryan wanted to use their technological skills to prevent such an event from happening again. After investigating similar cases in which cyberbullying and sexting were involved, they found that oftentimes parents were unaware that their child was being cyberbullied or involved in sexting.
Their solution was simple: alert parents if their child sends or receives messages with offending content, in order to at least start a conversation between both parties. The alert would contain a timestamp, alert type, and whether the content was sent or received, but would not actually show any part of the actual message in order to maintain the child’s privacy. In this way, PocketGuardian aims to promote communication between parents and children, while still maintaining a level of trust between the two.
In addition to monitoring texts, PocketGuardian can also monitor the messaging apps WhatsApp and Kik, although with some limited functionality on iPhones. Its detection software relies not on keywords, but rather on context, by determining “the statistical probability that content in a given context is inappropriate,” and constantly “learning the latest nuances in speech,” according to PocketGuardian’s website.
Although PocketGuardian is available for both Android and iOS, it is not found in the usual app store on each device. In order to download PocketGuardian, users must register at gopocketguardian.com, which will enable parents to enroll their child’s mobile device. For parents with multiple children, the addition of more devices comes at no extra cost. From there, Android users will be able to download an app from the website, whereas for iPhone users, PocketGuardian works as a cloud service and does not require an app to download or function. PocketGuardian costs $3.99 a month.

Professor presents at 2015 Seattle IDSA
Assistant Professor of Design at Carnegie Mellon Peter Scupelli recently attended a conference in Seattle to present the work of his students who envision the future in Scupelli’s course “Dexign the Future.” At the 2015 International Conference for the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), one of the largest organizations for design professionals, Scupelli and Arnold Wasserman (CFA ‘56) talked about visions for the future that include solutions for some of the major problems facing the world today, like global warming.
“This is perhaps the most important conference in our history,” wrote IDSA Board of Directors Chair Emeritus Charles Austen Angell to Carnegie Mellon Today, as designs play an increasingly important role in consulting with top businesses to find creative and innovative solutions.
In Scupelli’s studio, students are challenged to create a vision of the world they wanted to see. Using Pittsburgh as a focus, the designers worked with the local initiative Plan Pittsburgh to outline the city in 2050. To successfully “dexign the future,” students have to take into account trends and problems facing Pittsburgh today, from transportation to communication strategy to climate change.
Scupelli’s studio did so well that he also created an introductory course and is working with the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence’s Judy Brooks to pilot the course through the Open Learning Initiative.
CMU families celebrate Cèilidh weekend 
Although Carnegie Mellon’s football team lost its homecoming game to the Bethany College Bisons, students and alumni alike have taken Cèilidh weekend as an opportunity to revel in all that Pittsburgh has to offer in the fall.
Part of the festivities was the reveal of this year’s Spring Carnival theme — “Game Night” — on Thursday at The Fence. The annual Chili Cookoff, now under the auspices of the Activities Board, was held on Saturday.
Cèilidh weekend also brought several prominent speakers to Carnegie Mellon, including Rick Atkinson, a Pulitzer-prize winning writer, on Thursday, and Olympia Snowe, a former U.S. Senator, on Friday. 
The Department of Psychology also celebrated its centennial, while Scotch’n’Soda held its eighth annual Charity Cabaret. Alumni also had the chance to see the School of Drama’s first main stage production of the semester, a retelling of Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing set in 1960s Italy.

Germans protest trade deal
BERLIN—Nearly 150,000 protesters marched on the streets last Friday, protesting a trade deal proposed between the U.S. and Germany. Critics say that the deal could to saturate the German market with U.S. goods. A growing fear also exists of powerful multinational conglomerates endangering the market.

White House seeks out in Syrian War
WASHINGTON — Since the escalation of the Syrian Civil War, the Obama administration has sought to quell the violence. That is, until now, when the White House announced on Friday that it would end its training of Syrian opposition forces in the region. The government now only performs screening processes that evaluate existing rebel commanders.

Tunisian Quartet given Peace Prize
OSLO — This year’s recipient of the esteemed Nobel Peace Prize is a relatively unknown organization: the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet. The award accentuates the fact that within a region of growing tensions and violence, Tunisia has managed to emerge as an area of “relative stability.” The famous “Arab Spring” actually originated in Tunisia.

A new report published by University of Washington's Center on Reinventing Public Education reveals that in 50 of America's largest cities, less than one third of high school students have taken the SAT or ACT, which is required by most institutions of higher education in the country. Memphis had the highest numbers, at 30 percent, while in 30 of the 50 cities only 15 percent of students take the SAT or ACT.
Because most colleges in America require these tests as part of admissions packets, this study shows the clear impact such a trend has on students' future education and employment. Without a college education, these students will have a much harder time finding stable, well-paying jobs that will enable them to break the poverty cycle. In fact, the study revealed that 40 percent of schools performing in the bottom five percent of the state remained stuck there for all three years that the report examined.
The study also showcases a strong correlation between class and educational background. It examines the relationship between students receiving free or reduced lunches and those enrolled in top or bottom scoring elementary schools based on math and reading. The results showed, with very few exceptions, that students enrolled in free or reduced lunch programs tended to be enrolled most often in schools that performed in the bottom 20 percent in either math or reading. In many cases, Hispanic and black students were at a much higher disadvantage than white students in the same city.
The overall takeaway from this study is that economic status and race have a disturbingly high influence on education, and that without sufficient intervention this trend will continue. It costs a lot of money to take the SAT or ACT, send scores to colleges, and apply. All of these costs are incurred before enrolling and paying deposits, tuition, and room and board fees.
Quality education should not be such a luxury. The high costs that come with education create significant barriers to what should be a basic right for all citizens.

Last Monday, every university in the Philadelphia area was put on high alert. The University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Temple University, Villanova University, and other schools throughout the Delaware Valley sent out security alert emails to their students and added police officers to shifts. Some professors canceled classes, while others excused students who chose to not leave their homes. 
This was the threat that threw the City of Brotherly Love into disarray: an anonymous post found on a 4chan message board,  accompanied by a meme of Pepe the Frog wearing a ski mask and holding a gun. “The Beta Rebellion has begun," the post read. "On October 5, 2015 at 1:00 PM CT, a fellow robot will take up arms against a university near Philadelphia. His cries will be heard, his victims will cower in fear, and the strength of the Union will decay a little more.” 
It sounds like the ranting of a madman. Yet it bears a sinister similarity to another anonymous 4chan post from Sept. 30, 2015, the day before Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and himself at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. 
“Some of you guys are all right.” the now-deleted post says, followed by an angry-looking Pepe the Frog holding a gun. “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest … so long space robots.” 
The Philadelphia threat, thankfully, did not end up amounting to any violence in the area. The threat to the northwest has not been linked to the Umpqua shootings. However, they both point to a horrifying trend: Internet users are more and more frequently using social media, especially anonymous forums, as a platform for threats of violence. More often than not, these threats are hoaxes — sometimes, however, they hold true. 
It is more important now more than ever to realize the consequences of posting online for the world to see. Empty threats made behind computer screens are nothing to joke about and nothing to write in a brief moment of anger. They waste law enforcement's time and money, cause widespread panic, and take attention away from credible threats. Violence is no joking matter, and threats of violence should not be casually thrown around on the Internet. 
Now, it is easy to say that many of these threats should just be written off as emotional ramblings. For example, when a high school student posts on Facebook that “there are times I want to kill everyone I see,” it seems like a classic — albeit extreme — outburst of teenage angst. The 4chan forum that the Philadelphia threat was posted on, "/r9k/," is known for anonymous contributors who write racist, sexist, misogynistic, violent, and homophobic comments; in other words, it's not a typically credible source of information. 
On the other hand, when wild claims can be linked to actual acts of violence, they may be cause for concern. With the devastating abundance of mass shootings in the United States, who can tell if a high school student's Facebook post could have a greater meaning? In order to keep innocent bystanders safe, it is the job of law enforcement to investigate any potential threat detected online, no matter how innocent it may seem. Many who write threats online are arrested because there is no saying which social media user has violent inclinations and which tweet might foreshadow mass casualties.
So think before you post. Every word that is published online no longer belongs solely to its publisher — it becomes a public matter. A seemingly harmless “joke” about violence will not seem funny to law enforcement officials who are constantly monitoring social media. An empty threat made in a moment of anger will not seem innocent to the family and friends of those targeted. Think about the time, money, and energy that will be wasted investigating, defending against, and worrying about some words on a computer screen. 
The poster of the Philadelphia threat probably just wanted to stir up commotion. They probably wanted to ride on the coattails of the panic surrounding Umpqua, and they probably thought that their threat would be seen as a sarcastic response. Maybe they knew that they would cause panic, or maybe that was the goal. But in no way was such a post representative of the privileges and responsibilities that come with being an Internet user. When the lives of others are potentially at stake, no joke should be made.

Pope Francis has done a spectacular job of modernizing the Catholic Church and opening it up to ideas and people that it would have turned away in the past. However, the Catholic Church will never be a champion for liberal ideas and social constructs. 
As recently pointed out in an article entitled "Pope Francis is unlikely, powerful voice for new generation," Pope Francis is indeed revolutionary. He refuses to live in the hypocritical luxury that many in his position have enjoyed, instead living a life of relative poverty as dictated by his vows. When he visits different countries, he spends his time meeting with impoverished individuals. Just a few days after his appointment, he even washed and kissed the feet of twelve juvenile offenders, including two Muslims. He will clearly not be dedicating his time to politicians and celebrities. 
He is also a scholar. In his journey to priesthood he studied philosophy and theology; he focused on social justice — albeit a Catholic brand. He also extensively studied chemistry in high school, although he does not have the "advanced degree” that many people have claimed him to have.
Pope Francis is extremely concerned about global warming, and has criticized politicians and global warming deniers for not taking action to combat its dangerous path. He preaches for peace and forgiveness, denounces absolute capitalism, stresses the need for interfaith communication, and believes that both capital punishment and life imprisonment should be abolished. 
At the beginning of his tenure as pope, it also seemed that he might fight for LGBTQ+ rights. "If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him," he said early on, and there were rumors that as a bishop he had supported civil unions. However, the Vatican quickly announced that the Pope did not support civil unions, and the Pope himself said that he still views homosexuality as immoral. 
But it still seemed as if the Pope would be a passive ally for LGBTQ+ individuals. His “welcoming” stance is miles ahead of any opinion held by any former Pope, and many gay Catholics found themselves relieved that their church would at least tolerate their identity. 
During his American tour, the Pope continued to be his charismatic, happy, typical self. He stopped his caravan to greet disabled children, met with prisoners in Philadelphia, and became the first Pope to visit a Jewish synagogue in the United States. 
In the days following his visit, another stop on his schedule was announced and his support for LGBTQ+ individuals crumbled. The Pope met with Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who was arrested for infamously refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling. 
When Davis announced that the Pope had met with her in secret, many people thought it was just another lie. Davis claimed that the Pope had thanked her for being courageous and encouraged her to keep fighting. Meanwhile, the Vatican scrambled to cover up its tracks, first refusing to comment and later confirming that there had been a meeting, but the meeting did not necessarily mean that the Pope was expressing his support for Kim Davis. 
While it is still unclear exactly what happened during this meeting, the simple fact is that the Pope met with a woman who discriminated against people that he claims to love. The most telling evidence in this fiasco is that the Church attempted to cover it up. It realized that the public would not condone this meeting, yet thought that if it conducted the meeting in secret it would avoid angering people. The Vatican clearly knew that their stance on this particular issue was not favored by popular opinion. 
If anyone thought that the Catholic Church would turn into a liberal institution with the induction of the new pope, they unfortunately were wrong. Perhaps the Catholic Church will allow same-sex marriages in our lifetime, but that is extremely doubtful. While it is indeed groundbreaking that the Pope supports acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals, his opinions on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ rights remain stuck in the past, along with his stance on women's reproductive rights. 
While Pope Francis has led the Catholic Church into an evolution to fit the current needs and desires of the Catholic community, he is not the voice of a new generation. He is a symbol of an ancient institution that is struggling with the decision to evolve or face extinction.

University President Subra Suresh and Provost Farnam Jahanian sent an email out on Thursday that contained the results of the sexual assault and relationship violence (SARV) survey that was given in April of last year to the undergraduate and graduate students of Carnegie Mellon.
The survey was part of an effort by the Office of Student Affairs, the Office of Student Life, the Office of Title IX Initiatives, General Counsel, and the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis. A campus-wide advisory committee began meeting in 2014 to develop the survey. 
In addition to the link to a 60-page document of the survey results, the email noted that many of our peer institutions are releasing data from similar surveys, and that the survey represents a concerted effort by the university to address sexual assault on campus. The email also announced three university-wide town hall events that will be taking place from Oct. 19-28. 
The Tartan is happy that the university is sharing the results of this detailed survey with students, faculty, and staff. It is of the utmost importance that the most recent data be available to the members of the community that it describes. 
However, sending this information out just once in a long email leaves much to be desired. The administration should have made a more serious effort to publicize the survey's results and produce a condensed version of them that would give people their major takeaway. A Thursday afternoon email with a buried link does not show a commitment to getting the word out there. Additionally, we are hopeful that there will be more than just three town halls at which students will have the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions about sexual assault in our campus community. 
The efforts of the survey show a hopeful beginning for launching these tough conversations from an administrative level, but more follow-up and attention is necessary for a commitment that will last beyond the survey.

If you were given the option to kill one terrorist leader with a drone strike but kill 28 innocent Americans as a result, would you do so? If the United States government openly took such an approach, there would be global outrage. Why, then, has the international community tolerated and ignored a similar scenario in the Middle East? 
According to The Guardian, 1147 civilians have been killed in the Middle East (as of Nov. 24 2014) as a result of United States drone strikes that targeted 41 terrorist leaders. Considering this pattern, it was hard to be surprised last week when at least 22 innocents were killed by an American airstrike that hit a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan.
After this news story exploded, President Obama formally apologized, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest added that there is no evidence "that this was anything other than a terrible, tragic mistake.” However, too many “terrible, tragic mistakes” have been linked to drone strikes, and it is time to re-evaluate the way that we as a nation use them.
Occasional civilian casualties are inevitable, but why has it taken the United States so long to realize how bad the situation has truly become? Do people only care about this tragedy because Doctors Without Borders is an American organization? If Doctors Without Borders was based in Afghanistan, this story wouldn't make a single America news cover, but it would certainly be used by terrorist organizations as a recruiting tool. 
The irony of American drone use is that it “terrorizes” civilians in the Middle East. According to a 2004 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 67.7 percent of Afghans had symptoms of depression, 72.2 percent had symptoms of anxiety, and 42 percent had symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This is a result of living in constant fear of drone strikes and other life-threatening tragedies.
As Rooj Alwazir told Rolling Stone, “This feeling of infringement of privacy, combined with civilian casualties and constant fear and anxiety has a profound psychological effect on those living under drones.” 
The Central Intelligence Agency even acknowledged this in a document leaked by WikiLeaks.org last year, stating that “The potential negative effect of operations include increasing the level of insurgent support … strengthening an armed group’s bonds with the population … [and] creating a vacuum into which more radical groups can enter.”
 Countless stories already exist of American drones devastating weddings, funerals, and other gatherings of innocent civilians. However, no matter how many times they go public, nothing happens. The United States simply continues its current drone strategies and continues taking many innocent lives. 
If anyone is truly surprised by the Doctors Without Borders incident, they have little idea what has been happening overseas over the last decade. Civilian casualties have simply become a number, and respect for human life has been lost. Doctors Without Borders asserts that “[the drone attack] was not just an attack on our hospital, but it was an attack on the Geneva Conventions.” With its unchanging drone policy, America has crossed the border of both virtue and international law.

For 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, premiums may soon rise from $104.90 to $159.30 per month, a 52 percent increase. The spike is the result of Medicare's “hold harmless” provision.
Since Medicare provides insurance for citizens aged 65 and over, most people’s Medicare premiums are simply deducted from their Social Security benefits. The "hold harmless" provision means that an individual will never see their Social Security benefits decline from the previous year as a result of an increase in Part B Medicare costs. 
Since oil prices crashed and caused deflation this year, Social Security’s cost of living adjustment is $0. This means that the increase in premiums is shifted entirely onto people who do not have the premium deducted from their Social Security check, as any deduction would cause a decline in the Social Security benefits of those who do collect checks.
There are three groups of people who generally fall into this category. The first is high-income individuals who don’t really need the protection. The second is low-income individuals who are dual eligible for Medicare and Medicaid; this does not directly affect the insured citizen, as the state Medicaid budget would pay the increased premium. The third group includes individuals over the age of 65 who delayed Social Security Benefits and are still working; these are often citizens who need to continue working because they did not have the savings necessary to retire comfortably.
Shifting the cost of increased Medicare premiums onto people who still have to work hits one group particularly hard: the mentally ill. Private health insurance is often incredibly expensive, and since mental health issues often arise in a person’s early twenties, the condition will often be classified as preexisting. A spike in Medicare insurance premiums could cause a person to forgo Medicare entirely, meaning they lose prescription insurance as well as medical care insurance. 
Seeing a psychologist can be wildly expensive when co-pays become weekly necessities. Psychiatric medication can also be expensive because relatively little information exists about mental health treatment, and companies claim research and development of such treatment is extremely expensive. Without medical care, a person could lose their job due to an episode or difficulties related to losing mental health care; they could end up in the uncomfortable retirement they were working to avoid.
While the “hold harmless” provision is important to prevent Medicare from hurting people’s Social Security benefits, it is encouraging to see Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell say that she is exploring policy options to make sure this increase in premiums does not hurt working people of retirement age. However, more steps need to be taken to make sure that the mentally ill population is adequately cared for, and cost control remains in place to allow them to live comfortably despite mental illness.
