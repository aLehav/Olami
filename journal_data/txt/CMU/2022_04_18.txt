Game 3: win, at St. Louis, 9-4
The Pirates closed the series out in St. Louis with a win, and it was a dominant one. It looked like the Cardinals were heading for a sweep when they put three men across the plate in the bottom of the first. But in the top of the third, the Pirates loaded the bases, and in a rare example of clutch play, Michael Chavis hit it out of the park for a grand slam to give the Pirates the lead. Before the inning was over, they’d tacked on one more. They added two more in the fourth, chasing starter Stephen Matz from the game before a single man was out, and the rout was on. The Bucs cruised to their first win of the season, lighting up the board for fifteen hits. Miguel Yajure worked the fifth and sixth innings in relief, allowed no runs, and was credited with the win.
Game 4: loss, vs. Chicago, 2-1
The home opener at PNC Park is always an exciting day because it’s the only time the team fills the park. José Quintana was on the mound for Pittsburgh and threw a beautiful game while being the first Pirate all season to make it to the sixth inning; Drew Smyly pitched five scoreless innings. Chicago drew first blood when Seiya Suzuki went deep in the fifth and then did it again in the seventh, making it a 2-0 game. But it looked like a comeback was possible when Brian Reynolds hit another solo shot in the eighth, cutting the deficit to one run, and when Kevin Newman crushed one with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, it looked like we were going to extras. But the wind had other ideas, and the ball settled into Ian Happ’s glove at the warning track to seal the win for Chicago.
Game 5: win, vs. Chicago, 6-2
After losing the opener to the Cubs in large part because of an inability to provide the pitching staff with run support, the offense exploded early in this one. A Wilson Contreras shot made it 1-0 Cubs, but in the bottom of the inning, Ke’Bryan Hayes beat out an infield single, Yoshi Tsutsugo walked, and Ben Gamel hit it out of the yard to put the Pirates up two. Then, in the third, the Pirates did it again; Hayes hit a scrappy double, Gamel walked, and Kevin Newman made up for his almost-heroics the day before by beating out a triple to score them both. Hayes went four-for-four, and he’s on a hot streak, having gone nine for 17 since the opener. Each team would score once more in the fourth, and that did it for the runs, with the Pirates taking their first home win of the year to split the two-game series.
Game 6: win, vs. Washington, 9-4
It’s not often that everything comes together for the Pirates, but when it does, it can be beautiful to watch. After the Nationals scored one run on a hit and two on an error, Daniel Vogelbach hit the Nationals’ third pitch of the game over the fence. Then in the third, Reynolds — who has been terrific to start the season — hit a two-run homer to tie the game at three, and after hits by Tsutsugo and Gamel, Newman doubled them both in before being caught trying to stretch it into a triple. Later, reliever Roansy Contreras would pick up the win while allowing only one hit and fanning five in three innings of relief, and he earned every bit of it. His pitches were breaking up, down, inside, outside, all over the place, and the likes of Juan Soto were left flailing aimlessly at the baseball. At the plate, Vogelbach went four-for-six, while Tucker broke out of his slump to go three-for-five. Pittsburgh has now won three of their last four and sits a game behind the Cubs in the NL Central standings.
Game 7: loss, vs. Washington, 7-2
This was the first game all season that the Pirates have been really, truly, badly outplayed. Starting pitcher Mitch Keller, billed before the season as a possible all-star, gave up four hits and two runs before registering a single out in the top of the first; he ultimately got out of the inning by leaving the bases loaded. Washington added another in the second, but Hoy Park knocked home his first two runs of the season to pull within one. After that, though, we were treated to classic Pirate baseball — the team never really threatened again, and the Nationals scored four more runs to make it seven to two by the end of the game.
Game 8: win, vs. Washington, 6-4
The Pirates put it all together on Saturday, giving them a chance to win a series for the first time in the young season. (The team went 1-2 against the Cardinals, 1-1 against the Cubs, and is ahead 2-1 against the Nationals.) The Nationals started strong with a run in the second, but the Bucs got them both back in the bottom of the frame; Juan Soto struck back for the Nationals with a solo shot to tie the game 2-2. But their defense couldn’t escape the inning without allowing another run, and a messy fielding play by Washington in the eighth inning allowed the Pirates to take a huge 6-2 lead. Washington clawed two back in the top of the ninth inning, but they couldn’t finish the comeback. Michael Chavis brought his season average to .500 with a three-for-four night, Ke’Bryan Hayes went two-for-four, and Cole Tucker knocked in his first run of the season as reliever Dillon Peters picked up his second win.
Bottom Line:
The Pirates played well this week, and made up for the abomination of a first week that they had. The hitting’s been good, the pitching’s been okay, and they’ve put it all together when they’ve had to. Right now, they’re playing like a team that deserves to sit in the middle of the pack, and that’s exactly where they are: a game and a half behind the Cardinals and half a game behind the Cubs. How long this goes on, only time will tell. It could end next week, it could end in May, or this team could by some miracle finish at .500. But however it goes down, Pirates fans, let’s enjoy it.

Benfica vs. Liverpool
The first leg of this head-to-head went as expected — the English side was in full control for most of the match, recording around double the amount of shots, possession, and passes in comparison to the Portuguese side, as well as around triple the number of shots on target and corners. It came as no surprise when Liverpool opened the scoring, with Ibrahima Konaté firing one home in the 17th minute. The visitors doubled their lead when Sadio Mané scored with a clinical finish in the 34th minute. Darwin Núñez pulled one back for the hosts shortly after halftime in the 49th minute, but Liverpool remained dominant and Luis Díaz’s 87th minute effort sealed the first leg 3-1 for the Reds.
Benfica, however, would not be going quietly. Despite Liverpool’s home-field advantage in the second leg, the Portuguese side played phenomenally. Again, the statistics were completely in the English side’s favor, and again, Konaté opened the scoring for the home side, this time in the 21st minute. Benfica struck back, however, and Gonçalo Ramos leveled the visitors in the 32nd minute. It seemed all over for Benfica when Roberto Firmino scored in the 55th minute and followed it up with a 65th minute volley to complete his brace, but the Portuguese side went down swinging. Roman Yaremchuk rounded Alisson Becker in the 73rd minute to bring the visitors within one of an equalizer, and Núñez made the scoreline 3-3 in the 82nd minute. Despite Benfica’s incredible effort in the second leg (converting three of their four shots on target), however, Liverpool will move on to the semifinals on a 6-4 aggregate.
Man City vs. Atlético Madrid
This was arguably the least exciting fixture of the quarterfinals but interesting nonetheless. As expected, Atleti played deeper in their own half as Manchester City took control of possession. What no one expected was that the Spanish side made no attempted shots. Despite having played the full 90 minutes, Atlético ended the fixture with zero corners, shots, or shots on target. Despite a less-than-stellar performance on offense, Atleti played better defensively, limiting City to just two shots on target. Two shots, however, would be enough for the English side, with Kevin De Bruyne slotting one past Jan Oblak in the 70th minute to make the final scoreline 1-0 to the hosts.
Despite the second leg of this head-to-head ending scoreless, tensions ran higher than in the first leg. Both sides reached double-digits in terms of shots, but neither side was able to capitalize. The first half was relatively quieter, with the only real threat coming from İlkay Gündoğan, whose shot on the home side’s goal was deflected off the post. Atleti ramped it up in the second leg, but their efforts weren’t enough to break through Man City’s goal. Despite multiple attempts, the scoreboard remained blank. Things came to a head in the 90th minute when Felipe brought down Phil Foden, who stayed down. Stefan Savić’s attempt to pick up the Englishman resulted in a brief confrontation between players on both sides. Following six yellow cards and one red within the first seven minutes of stoppage time, the match was drawn out into the 90+13th minute when at last the final whistle sounded. Despite a scoreless second leg, De Bruyne’s goal in the first makes the aggregate 1-0 in City’s favor, knocking Atlético out of Europe.
Villareal vs. Bayern Munich
The first leg of the quarterfinal between Villareal and Bayern Munich ended in favor of the Spanish side. A sharp Arnaut Danjuma took advantage of carelessness in the Bayern defense to give the home side the lead with just eight minutes on the clock. Despite the visitors’ best efforts, only four of their 22 shots fell on target, and the Germans were unable to convert any of them. Both sides had close calls in the second half, but the scoreline remained 1-0 at the end of 90 minutes.
Bayern played well in the second leg of the head-to-head, but Villareal remained staunch. A mistake in the Villareal midfield gave Bayern the opportunity to take the lead, and Robert Lewandowski fired one into the back of the net to bring the home side level on aggregate. However, despite 22 more shots (three on target), the German side were unable to extend their lead any further. This gave Villareal the chance to complete the upset, and they did in the 88th minute, with Samuel Chukwueze scoring to make it 2-1 on aggregate and taking the Spanish side into their second-ever UEFA Champions League semifinals.
Chelsea vs. Real Madrid
As predicted, the two legs of the Chelsea-Real Madrid matchup proved to be the games to watch, with nine goals being scored across the two games. Real Madrid played well in the first leg, tallying just eight shots to Chelsea’s 20, but equaling Chelsea’s five shots on target. Karim Benzema opened up the scoring for the visitors in the 21st minute, then doubled Real’s lead in the 24th minute. Kai Havertz fired one back in the 40th minute to bring the English side within one of equalizing going into halftime. The second half began terribly for Chelsea as a horribly-placed pass by Edouard Mendy caught Antonio Rüdiger off-guard, allowing Benzema to score on an empty net and complete his hat-trick in the 46th minute, making the final scoreline 3-1.
Chelsea began the second leg with renewed energy. Across the second leg, Chelsea recorded 28 total shots, and the effort showed. Mason Mount’s 15th minute effort was the first to hit the back of the net, and Chelsea found themselves within one of equalizing on aggregate. Rüdiger then scored in the 51st minute to make it 2-0 to Chelsea and 3-3 on aggregate. Timo Werner then drove a third shot into the Real Madrid net to make it 3-0 to the English side, seemingly setting up the Blues for a semifinal spot. However, it was not meant to be. Minutes after, Rodrygo finished off a beautiful cross by Luka Modrić in the 80th minute to pull one back for the home side, making it 4-4 on aggregate and forcing the game into extra time. Benzema’s goal in the 96th minute, his fourth across the two legs, spelled heartbreak for the visitors, who were unable to convert any extra time efforts. Despite the final scoreline reading 3-2 in favor of Chelsea, their first-leg deficit meant that Real Madrid will move on to the Champions League semifinals on a 5-4 aggregate.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Pittsburgh Pirates owner  Bob Nutting and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that, in an extraordinary move, the Pittsburgh Pirates cut every single player on their 28-player roster.
In a recent press conference, a beaming Rob Manfred hailed the cost-cutting move, calling it “a true innovation and a real testament to the Pirates Front Office.” Nutting himself also (mis)spoke, saying, “It’s a real enriching — I mean winning move.”
In response, the MLB Players’ Association (MLBPA) swiftly decried the move and threatened a strike. “It’s an insult to the sport,” said Tony Clark, the MLBPA head. The MLBPA announced that they were exploring options regarding collective action against the MLB. Manfred’s office shot back that such a move was unprecedented and dangerous. An anonymous source close to Manfred said that the MLB was considering preemptively locking out the players. According to this source, Manfred sees this possibility as a "defensive lockout."
As another shutdown looms, the Pittsburgh Pirates have made short work of fielding a new team. As of Monday morning, they had filled almost half of their roster. Highlights include the returning Chris Archer, who the Pirates obtained in exchange for their dignity; Air Bud, the basketball-phenom turned slugger; and a man calling himself “Joe Baseball.”
When asked by The Tartan about his credentials, Baseball shrugged. “I mean, I had on my resume that I played Little League, and the hiring managers were really impressed,” Baseball explained matter-of-factly. He continued, “You see, I was applying for concessions. But it turns out that Dippin’ Dots needs people on the field, or else customers won’t come.”
TMZ also obtained a phone recording of forsaken Pirates star Ke’Bryan Hayes confronting Nutting in PNC Park. Hayes can be heard saying, “You think you can steal from us and just walk away?” Nutting replied, “Yeah.”
In other news, a spokesperson for Nutting confirmed that the Pirates’ MLB-issued money printer was still working. There had been cause for concern after the Pirates stopped investing their money in paper.
“I mean, it’s incredible. This thing hasn’t been serviced since 2015 when we laid off the IT department,” the spokesperson said. Still, they explained, “the MLB’s paper-sharing system really came through. I mean, I don’t even know a paper company. So it’s a real godsend.”
In the same press conference, Professional Game-Canceller Manfred also announced that all of the Pirates’ games will be canceled for the next week as the new-look Pirates learn to play baseball. “Me and the owners all care about competitive balance. It just wasn’t fair to put them up against big-market teams,” Manfred said.
One of the reasons for the 2022 lockout was owners’ worries of competitive balance. The small teams just couldn’t spend enough to beat the big teams, the owners reasoned. Now, the Pirates roster is stuffed with players on the league-minimum salary — except Baseball, who is earning the federal minimum wage as a Dippin’ Dots employee.
The canceled games will go into the “L” column for the Pirates.

CMU RESEARCH: 
Creating artificial gravity in space
As NASA continues to answer our questions about space, they will require increasingly longer trips in space. To do so, their personnel will likely need to stay in a station with artificial gravity, but generating artificial gravity requires the station to spin, and people can't handle too much spinning without getting sick. But, to get the same artificial gravity with minimal spinning, you need a giant station. Zac Manchester, an assistant professor in the Robotics Institute, paired up with Jeff Lipton from the University of Washington to propose an idea to create a kilometer-length station that folds up into a small space during launch, but will unfold to its full length in space. NASA granted the pair $500,000 over the next two years to continue their research and build prototypes of their proposal.
Using extracellular vesicles in body tissues
When body parts like joints fail, some get metal implants that supplement or restore their body's function. But sometimes the body recognizes the metal as a foreign object and tries to reject it. Researchers in the biomedical engineering and material science engineering department are investigating a way to build body tissues that are less likely to be rejected by the body using extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles can encapsulate lipids, nucleotides, enzymes, and other things used to repair body tissues, with an outer layer that prevents the immune system from reacting. However, extracellular vesicles are often cleared from the body very quickly, requiring high doses to offset how quickly they are cleared. To combat this, the researchers added a chemical tag to the outer layer of the extracellular vesicles that better immobilizes them in implants, allowing them to more effectively repair body tissues.

SCIENCE: Controversial biophysicist who gene-edited children released from prison
He Jiankui caused an uproar in the international science community after he announced that he had successfully created two genetically modified babies. He and collaborators illegally used CRISPR gene-editing technology by forging ethical review documents, then attempted to edit genes in twin embryos that were in-vitro fertilized before implanting them into the uterus. While scientists don't completely know the status of the babies' health, critics say that we do not understand the repercussions of gene-editing technology enough to warrant its use. He Jiankui was released from prison in the beginning of April after a three-year prison sentence.
TECH: Elon Musk tries to buy out Twitter
Elon Musk is offering to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, amounting to $43 billion in total. Musk wants to privatize Twitter, though he insisted in a Vancouver TED conference that this was not for profit. He claims his main objective is to promote Twitter as a platform of free speech by adding features such as editing tweets, making the Twitter algorithm open-source, and changing content moderation. He already has a 9.2 percent stake in the company, and was offered a board position, which he initially accepted but later rejected. It is possible that he will not go forward with the offer. However, Musk says that if his requested changes are made, he may retract his bid, and experts doubt whether he truly has the spending money to buy another company when most of his wealth is tied up with his other companies. Twitter's board of directors also do not seem to take kindly to Musk's offer, responding with a "shareholder rights plan" that would allow other shareholders to buy stock at a discounted price if Musk attempts to buy out the company's shares, diluting Musk's share.
COVID-19: As COVID-19 cases rise again, Shanghai goes on lockdown
As cases in Shanghai climb, China's zero-COVID policy means that the city is to be completely locked down until there are no more cases. In the current situation, many Shanghai residents are losing income, lack access to food, and have to stay in poorly maintained quarantine centers. So far there have been few serious cases: 90 percent of cases are asymptomatic, with only nine becoming seriously ill, and no deaths. Experts say that severity is low right now only because the cases are in the younger generation, but since China has not focused on vaccinating older generations, if the elderly get infected, their cases could be more severe. Many cities in China are now trying to incentivize the elderly to get vaccinated, with door-to-door campaigns and even giving out 500 yuan ($78) gift cards.

‘Club Penguin Rewritten’ shuts down after Disney request
“Club Penguin Rewritten” (CPRewritten) was shut down following a notice from Disney. This was announced by an admin on the CPRewritten Discord. The Discord server has since been completely wiped of all messages except the announcement. The server name was changed to “Rewritten.” Three individuals were arrested in connection with the shutdown, but have since been released.
The website for the game was turned over to Operation Creative, the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit. CPRewritten was a fan-made remake of “Club Penguin,” a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game created in 2005 by New Horizon Interactive, now known as Walt Disney Online Studios Canada. The original game shut down in 2017 when its sequel, “Club Penguin Island,” was released, which shut down a year later. 
CPWritten released in early 2017 when the original shut down. It allowed users to create free accounts and had no  revenue generation until recently when the creators introduced advertisements on the website. Some have speculated that this is the reason for Disney’s request for the website to shut down. In contrast, “Toontown Rewritten,” a fan-made remake of Disney’s MMO “Toontown” that shut down in 2013, has been in development since 2013 and is still available online. “Toontown Rewritten” has no revenue source. 
CPRewritten is not the first fan-made “Club Penguin” remake to be shut down by Disney. Several other remakes like “Club Penguin Online” were shut down following accusations of pedophiles approaching children on the platform, along with distribution of child pornography.
CD Projekt Red: ‘Witcher 3,’ ‘Cyberpunk 2077’
CD Projekt Red (CDPR) announced on April 13 that they would be taking over the development of “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt” for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. This announcement was paired with news that the game will not make its original release window, the first half of 2022. CDPR did not give a new release date for the project, but did state that they will give an update as soon as they could.
Two days later, on April 15, CDPR clarified during an investor teleconference that the game was not in “development hell.” The in-house development of the rest of “The Witcher 3” port will not affect the development of the studio’s next game.
Saber Interactive was previously completing the work at their Russia office. The company was also responsible for the Nintendo Switch and 4K ports of “The Witcher 3,” released in 2019. Though Saber Interactive is headquartered in Florida, its first game studio is located in St. Petersburg, Russia. CDPR has not made any comment regarding why they are not completing development in-house, but CDPR condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
During the earnings call for investors on April 15, CDPR also commented on one of their more recent large releases, “Cyberpunk 2077.” The company stated they will shift their resources from the game to focus on other projects, but the game will be receiving a story expansion in 2023 with no more major overhauls planned. 
The game’s launch received several delays and was met with harsh criticism upon its launch due to many bugs and glitches. The game released its version 1.5 update in February alongside its release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. With this update, CDPR believes they have finished most of the development on the game. The game reached 18 million units sold according to its investor relations Twitter account.
‘No Man’s Sky’ OUTLAWS update
On April 13, the “No Man’s Sky” development team announced the latest update for the game: OUTLAWS. This is the 19th update to the game since its 2016 launch, and the second update of the game this year; the SENTINEL update was released in February.
There have been pirates in the game since its launch, but this update “represents the moment where the pirates have started to put down roots, occupy space stations and colonize the surrounding system.” According to the post, pirates represent an increased threat and planetary dog-fights are now more common in pirate-controlled systems. The outlaw systems also have their own technology merchants and marketplaces for contraband items, on top of unique mission agents. 
Space combat has also been improved as part of this update — it was rebalanced for “challenge, flow, and speed.” The destruction effects also received an overhaul; ships, asteroids, freighters, and space cargo also got redesigns for their destruction effects, which makes gunning them down “more satisfying than ever.” Some warp and engine effects for frigates and freighters were also updated for flair and impact. When on planet surfaces, players occasionally see a fleet of frigates in the sky.
A new type of high-tech starship class was also introduced: Solar Ships. Procedurally-generated variations give a diverse range of designs and introduce unique technologies. Players can recruit other pilots into their squadron who will automatically warp to the player’s location during space combat. The complete list of changes included in this update is available on the “No Man’s Sky” website.
‘13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim’ launches on Nintendo Switch
“13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim” released on Nintendo Switch on April 12, nearly a year-and-a-half after its initial PlayStation 4 release in Japan. While the PlayStation 4 release would launch worldwide the year following its Japan release in 2020, the Nintendo Switch version launched two days earlier in the West than in Japan. The Vanillaware-developed game is a combination of side-scrolling adventure segments followed by real-time strategy battle segments that focuses on the stories of thirteen high-school students who are dragged into a futuristic war between mechas and hostile Kaiju in a nonlinear fashion. The Nintendo Switch version of the game adds new weapons for the thirteen playable mechs.
To celebrate the launch, Atlus, the game’s publisher, held a “13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim” art exhibit at the Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus art museum for two days. People who attended the event could purchase prints of the new pieces; leftover prints will be sold online starting April 18. Atlus had a livestream that featured a giveaway of 13 OLED Switch models on April 15. A 1/16 scale statue of one of the mechs from the game appeared at the JR Akihabara Station in Tokyo, Japan to commemorate the game’s launch on Nintendo Switch.

This past week, “Chainsaw Man” and “Fire Punch” author Tatsuki Fujimoto released a new one-shot titled “Goodbye, Eri.” Since the ending of the first part of “Chainsaw Man,” Fujimoto has published another one-shot, “Look Back.” (Both “Look Back” and “Chainsaw Man” are phenomenal reads; I would highly recommend them.) At a glance, it’s a 200-page story of a boy expressing his grief through film. At its core, it’s so much more.
The manga opens with the main character Yuta Ito’s 12th birthday and his mom asking him to record videos of her because she doesn’t have long to live. On the fifth page we can already see how Fujimoto can express emotions without the characters even speaking. The father is going to say something but cuts himself off; there are no words but so much is said in these three panels.
It’s also easy to see how much care and effort went into the art of the entire story. Many (and arguably all, but I will touch on this later) of the panels are from the perspective of a phone camera. The perspectives of some of the frames perfectly encapsulate shots from a phone, as demonstrated by the slight shake effect on some panels and the angles on others. 
The first twist of the story is the main character running away from the hospital where his mother is dying, only for it to explode. We then see that we’ve been watching a movie the main character made to commemorate his mom’s request to film her until she dies. The shots of her, paired with the silent tears of Ito’s father, demonstrate the toll her death takes on the family, even if she’s smiling in most panels.
This leads us right into Fujimoto’s next strength: his dialogue writing. The responses from the audience feel so genuine — reactions that one would expect from high schoolers. Ito’s response to the crowd disliking his film is brilliant: He plans to kill himself. His line, “Are you thinking, ‘Why would you kill yourself over that?’ If that’s how you feel, you deserve to die too,” perfectly captures the feelings of a new high school student who believes his life has been ruined by his peers. The camera angles as Ito walks to the roof to jump are chilling; the hesitation shown from the repeated panels of the parking lot leaves the reader in brief suspense, until we’re surprised to see there’s someone else on the roof with Ito: enter Eri.
Eri convinces Ito to come with her to an abandoned building, which sets up the next stage of the story: Ito’s desire to produce a new movie that will “make them all bawl their eyes out” after encouragement from Eri. Despite her critics, Eri loved Ito’s film and wanted him to make another.
The next section focuses on developing the relationship between Eri and Ito. Once again, Fujimoto’s character development strength shines through. The bond between the two feels genuine, like a real-life relationship. In my experience, a lot of authors struggle to create a close bond between two characters that doesn’t feel superficial and Fujimoto manages to do it with less than 100 panels. 
When Ito finally asks for his father's opinion on his films, Ito's father says Ito always manages to sprinkle a pitch of fantasy into everything. To me, this is a reflection of Fujimoto’s writing: a realistic story with just a pinch of fantasy. While his other works probably are better described as having a heap of fantasy, a pinch is the best way to describe “Goodbye, Eri.”
After Eri rejects many of his ideas, Ito finally develops the idea for his next movie: a continuation of his first film. The protagonist of his new film regrets running away from his mom’s death (Ito at the end of his first film) and he befriends a vampire who will fall in love with the protagonist. Like the protagonist’s mother, the vampire also doesn’t have long to live, so she wants the protagonist to film her last moments. This is a clear reflection of Ito’s experience with his mother, which felt oddly wholesome considering what we had seen of her in the early parts of the story.
The following panels are Eri meeting Ito’s father before shooting the next film. Suddenly, Ito’s father starts tearing into Eri, telling her to stay away from Ito, which caught me very off guard. This story has many moments like that — everything seems fine and then you’re caught off guard. We learn it’s a scene for Ito’s new movie, much to my relief.
While shooting a scene at the beach, the reader is greeted by the next tragedy: Eri, who is playing the vampire that doesn’t have long to live, doesn’t have long to live. This came as no surprise to me, but it still caught me off guard. The clear parallels between Ito's mom's story and that of the vampire made a perfect setup for Eri to have some sort of accident, meaning Ito would be forced to record the death of someone he loves. 
Much like Ito’s mother requested, Eri requests that he record her until her last moments. Ito, not wanting to have to repeat the experience he had with his mother, asks her why she’d ask him to do that, and once again runs away. To me, this shows that despite all the development Ito has had since his mom died, he still can’t face the death of that love even though he was ready to kill himself about a year prior. 
After this, Ito’s father confronts him and asks if he wants to see his mother’s last moments, which he had recorded. We now learn who Ito’s mom was, and it’s heartbreaking. His mom calls Ito useless because he refused to watch her die in the hospital, something no sane parent should expect of their child.
The mother that we saw at the beginning of the story was who she wanted the world to see: caring, humorous, and loving, but we now see she’s nothing short of abusive to Ito. This reveal puts everything into a new context and I love it; it’s a completely unexpected twist that explains so much. Seeing Ito’s father break down and apologize to his son for failing him and acting like everything was okay paired with the tears on his cheeks is nothing short of cathartic. It’s the perfect depiction of how people cope with losing a loved one: painting them in the best possible light, wanting the best about them to be remembered even if they weren’t a good person. Fujimoto nails this point and makes the reader feel it. 
Ito’s father points out that Eri probably wants Ito to choose how she will be remembered, so Ito resolves to continue filming her until she dies. As we start to see the decline of Eri, it’s hard not to feel bad for Ito, who is forced to go through this again. Eri is painted as someone who is ready for her end and the last conversation between Ito and Eri hits hard. But in the end, Ito does deliver on his promise to Eri: he makes a movie that will make the same audience that laughed at his last movie bawl their eyes out. The page with Ito’s peace sign seems so mundane, but in context, it’s depressing. He’s delivered on his promise; the movie has fulfilled its goal, but Eri isn’t there to see it.
The ensuing conversation between Ito and Eri’s friend once again brings the story full circle. Just like how Ito had made a film that painted his mom in the best possible light, he did the same thing for Eri. Eri’s friend thanks him for doing so, which feels so bittersweet given the situation. 
After this, we jump forward several years and find out Ito was never satisfied with the final cut of “Goodbye, Eri,” the name of his second film, and continues to edit it. We find out that he ended up getting married and having a child, but they, along with Ito’s father, were killed in a car crash. Though this is a very brief note, it still hit me hard. Despite everything, Ito still loses everyone he loves. Ito decides he no longer has enough soul to endure any more deaths, which once again brings everything full circle. 
He travels back to the abandoned building where he watched movies with Eri to hang himself and is shocked to find the previous suicide video he recorded playing and Eri on the couch. Again, this was very unexpected but at the same time felt oh-so fitting. Eri states that films that end with a love interest’s death (like Ito’s second film) are a dime a dozen, and his film is missing a pinch of fantasy. Ito is shocked and doesn’t understand how or why Eri is there. 
Eri then says she is a vampire (again, like Ito's second film) and the proof is that she is there and looks the same as when she “died.” She claims she only died mentally, but as long as her heart is still intact, she'll never die. Though she is the same person, she has no memories of her last “self,” and all she had to remember who she was, was a letter from her past self and the movie that Ito had recorded for her. Here, everything starts to click, especially why Eri asked Ito to film her until her death. To me, this interaction is the best the book has to offer: the framing of the panels, the dialogue; it’s all so raw. No matter what happens in the future, Eri will always have this film to remember Ito and who she is, and I think that’s beautiful. 
The story ends with Ito leaving the building, never to see Eri again. The very last line, though, hints at the true nature of the piece. It’s Eri saying, “It’s missing a pinch of fantasy, don’t you think?” The very last panel is a double-page spread of the building going up in the flames, the result of an explosion. In my opinion, the perfect way to end the story.
But what exactly does this final line and explosion mean? The first time I read it, I didn’t quite understand, and I thought it was just a way to bring everything together. After seeing what others had to say about the story and reading it a second time, it makes a lot more sense.
The first point to address is how many films were part of the story: one, two, or three? For those who think there are two films, it’s just the two that Ito records: one of his mother and one of Eri. A pretty straightforward answer, but I think the ending hints at something more. For those saying there are three films, they think the section following Eri’s death is yet another film: the epilogue of Ito’s story. This would explain the explosion at the end and Eri’s presence. She’s not a vampire, but just an actor in the film and Ito is still young. 
I think this is a better answer than saying there are two films, but I believe the entire story is just one giant film. I read the story as though they are all actors in the same film, and the ending makes perfect sense to me this way. The pinch of fantasy follows throughout the entire story with Eri being a vampire and the explosion being at the very end. At times, it’s difficult to differentiate between reality and fiction, which feeds into the idea that the entirety of the story is just one long, beautiful film.
This is what I mean when I said that the phrase “pinch of fantasy” feeds so well into Fujimoto’s writing. There are so many layers to Fujimoto’s writing and it makes for such an engaging experience; it’s up to the reader to determine the meaning of the ending. This entire work was nothing short of art and has made me look forward to Fuijimoto’s future works.

jack fell down 
and broke his crown
and jill came tumbling after
jill came tumbling, tumbling
jill rolled down the hill like a little kid
at recess
her crown resting firmly on her head
jill feels as if things have stopped happening to her
now she happens to things
and she has pulled all of the books off of the shelves
and she has run the red light
and jill comes tumbling after
jill is one of those mythical mistake-makers
who is sometimes too quiet
but who more often than not
orders the opposite of what she was really hungry for
but none of it matters much to jill 
who just goes tumbling back down the hill
what jill really cares about is god
she met him in the basement of a frat house
he was tall and smelled like authority
he told jill to eat her vegetables 
and to do her homework
and to have pity on all the pretty, tortured men
who fall down hills 
and bring jill tumbling after

“Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?”
Nick Hornby, High Fidelity
The pop-dance-track rife with lyrical morbidity is possibly the most accurate reflection of the contemporary youth sensibility in popular art. My personal favorite examples of this genre include: Gone by Charli XCX, So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings by Caroline Polachek, Stay High by Tove Lo, and practically the entire early discography of Billie Eilish and certain cuts by Dua Lipa.
Sadness performed, sadness wallowed within, sadness made into more-than-sadness allows one's sadness to feel purposeful, greater-than, part of something larger. The realistic, kitchen-sink, and detailed sadness of a lo-fi or bandcamp-adjacent artist is too real, and an end within itself; the depression of the pop star propels the listener always towards the possibility of there being an end in sight.
Pop songs paradoxically both allow us to ridicule our sadness while imbuing them with artistic importance. We’re dancing, it’s silly, but it’s beautiful, and it’s so fake it’s real. Manipulated to epic proportions by the emotional intelligence of pop chord progression and production, one's emotions become an event with a beginning, middle, and end. One’s feelings are rendered important for their own merit, worthy of the largest synths and the hardest snare.
While this phenomenon of dark-dance-pop might be seen as something relatively new, emerging from the growing inventiveness of avant-garde pop and the dark sense of humor pervading internet discourse, I see it as existing with the tradition of ritual melodrama, stretching from the Greek Chorus to Opera to Screamo to today. Music’s function is to express emotions beyond the realm of language, to sing when talking is not enough to communicate an urgent need. What these melodramatic musical genres do is exaggerate this function, inflating the scale of our feelings to a fever pitch. Furthermore, it allows us to enjoy the saccharine treats of pop musical structure while still feeling like we are participating in a work of artistic merit — provided we so often equate a work’s artistic merit with the depths of suffering which it pummels.
Yet why do I still feel that sad pop, the sad pop banger, is a particularly important popular art?
Because the tragic pop banger is a product of the contemporary moment, and a representation of the sensibilities of my generation, a generation raised on the internet and steeped in irony. Unable to escape contradiction, excess, and paradox, we thrive in it. Subcultures no longer exist; we are a generation defined by a selection of untethered and somewhat unrelated passions. Music genre is obsolete. Absolutely nothing is sacred. In fact, subjects which ‘should’ be taken seriously (global conflicts, mental illness, trauma, etc.) are almost exclusively addressed through humor in online mediums. The constant misaligning of tone with event, of context with content, is characteristic of youth discourse. There is no form which suits this better, and feels more relatable, than a pop song of tragedy.
Additionally, there is the simple fact that pop music’s explosion of emotion (what a critic might call exaggeration or pastiche) breaks down the psychological barriers of sadness. The listener does not have to observe closely subtle lyrical wordplay, such as in a Julien Baker or Phoebe Bridgers (RIP) song, or struggle with the honesty and rawness found with indie musicians like Car Seat Headrest. Through pop, one can allow the ‘pastiche’ of sadness to replace real, devastating melancholy — a phenomenon which romanticizes it, minimizes it into a narrative, and makes it vanquishable.
I don’t necessarily believe that pop songs are inherently more suited for tragic subject matter than other genres. But I do believe it to be supremely well-suited for a modern youth sensibility. More specifically, I find it supremely well-suited for myself and those like me; those who question the legitimacy of their feelings, perhaps analyzing or pathologizing their problems (as our hyper-aware-of-mental-health generation often does), and feel as though authenticity of emotion is unrealistic through the thick fog of everything being a joke. For this listener, this hypothetical listener with whom I share a kinship, I dare to argue that the danceable pop song with devastating lyrical content is one of the most timely and personal artifacts of popular culture we have.

Sun. Cliffs. Desert. Cracked. Burning. Smoke. Glare. Down, down, down. Straight path leads to Something. Sun. Cliffs. Desert. Cracked. Burning. Smoke. Glare. Down, down, down. My feet keep busy but my mind bores, so I check what exists. Sun is above. Check. Cliffs to the left, desert to the right. Cracked grooves in the sandy floor and in my souls. Smoke in the air. Check. Glare from th- everything. Down, down, down, Jack and Jill tumble into the abyss to my left. And I, teeter on the Straight path to Something. 
Slipping is more constant than walking. The ground is my bully and it falls out from under. Each future Stepping-Place is littered with CAUTION signs that I ignore, and my ankles scrape, bruise, and grieve as I trail the cliff. Reason ghosts through me, advising retreat into the desert, but no. I am drawn to the edge. Sometimes, when Smoke turns my head and Glare tickles the ravine, I catch Something glittering at the bottom. Something I need. I shrug it off as a trick of blazing Sun. Been down there before; obsidian sands bewitch and the river seduces sweet- but it is bitter. Liquid razors carry me for miles while my body is battered by boulders bracketing the stream. Toe to heel, toe to heel, don’t look down there is Nothing there. 
I am a jacket potato. Sun burns my skin to a crisp, so cracked and bleeding that it’s started to slip off my scaffolding. Canvas paper grows flimsy on the frame, tattered by dust storms and stained by acid rains. I raise my forearm- it smokes. Finally my brain breaks a sweat and excretes thoughts that snake into the sky like curls from a cigarette, and I am jealous of their painless escape. I remain trapped under boiling Sun cliffs desert cracked burning smoke. Glare down down down. Toe to heel, Straight path leads to Something.
                    Straight path leads to Something.
                                    All signs point to Nothing.

Picture a sunset. Glowing in cosmic beauty, you transcend. Now, imagine while you look out at God’s cummerbund, a small goat trots up to you. “Hey, little guy, how ya doing?” you ask this four-legged friend that has minus signs for eyes. 
“I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth,” says the sacrificial animal. 
“What?” you ask. “I mean, ‘maa,’” the goat states.
J.K. Rowling is the goat. In 2020, this weaver of magical yarns got hers snipped when she said the above quote. While she has earned the ire of the general public, she still wields considerable influence over the writing and production of the “Fantastic Beast” films, as well as the management of Universal theme park “Harry Potter World.” With this influence, she has campaigned to turn the popular site into a place young LGBTQ+ teens can go to “magic away the gay.” Being the ice cream man that I am, I got the scoop.
The popular Florida destination has long found itself at the forefront of whimsy and entertainment and fun. Young witches and wizards can pick a wand from Ollivanders, ride an animatronic Hypogriff, and even chug a pint of butterbeer. “And all that will be the same,” says park owner and born-again Slytherin David Yensin, “but now you’ll just receive a pamphlet on the evils of homosexuality along with your Hogwarts History textbooks.” Yensin, and the 14-headed corpobeast that represents J.K. Rowling’s public relations team, were emphatic in letting me know that not much about the amusement park would be different. “All the rides will go at the same speed, but we’ve had our Imagineers figure out a way to beam sped-up Brigham Young speeches into the rider’s brains as they go around loops,” reassured the fourth head on the soulless P.R. chimera. 
“Wait a moment, don’t Imagineers work for Disney?” I asked, remembering the insipid portmanteau’s true meaning. 
“It’s cute you think Disney doesn’t want a piece of the conversion therapy pie,” condescended the 10th head. “And how delicious it is!” they squealed in unison.
One of the many advantages of working for a school paper is all the places I get into for free. So, like the lucky little paper boy that I am, I received two tickets to see the new renovations at the park. At first, I assumed that the extra was just for redundancy’s sake, but a note on the back told me that it was for “Zivan’s Hopefully-Convertible-Possible Boyfriend." When I commented on my heterosexuality out loud, the note, à la Tom Riddle’s Diary, morphed into “come on, just find someone unsuspecting. We need to know if it works.” Obviously, I could not, in good conscience, bring anyone but myself to conversion camp, so I shredded the second ticket and made my way to gator country.
I’m loathe to admit that, as evil as this place is, I had quite a good time. Wherever I turned, the production value was off the charts. One memorable performance was the Hogwarts Frog Choir’s rendition of “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” retitled “Witches Will Have Fun Together, But Not so Much that They’ll Do Hand Stuff.” Afterwards, I went inside a Transfiguration classroom where we pretended to turn whistles into watches, pots into pencils, and Pride flags to table cloths. Following that, Potions class had us whipping up all sorts of delicious concoctions, like a citrus Polyjuice potion and chocolate-y Amortentia. When I asked what this had to do with conversion therapy, I was told that all the ingredients were requisitioned from nearby gay bars. “But that’s not conversion, that’s just stealing,” I protested. 
“Sometimes the arm of God bends in ways we cannot anticipate,” said the little girl next to me, her eyes darkening as Hedwig's Theme played ambiently from the rafters.
I maintain that what they are doing to Harry Potter World is demonstrably evil and harmful. J.K. Rowling has already done enough damage, and this will only magnify the hurt she has caused. While it really is quite fun to spin around in enchanted teapots and eat Elder wand churros, I implore those that would visit to avoid attending altogether, lest you get enchanted by the magic of homophobia. Like always, the most hateful people have the most money, and the best special effects.

Good morning PILLBOX! I know every single time we say "this is an incredible issue of Pillbox," but we've been lying. This time though, we've got a real 100% bona fide masterpiece issue for you this week. Post Carnival, everyone's been winding down. Except for us of course. We're still out here grinding and pursuing that bag. 
This week's theme is "Endless Reflection," which gives a taste of the times that are behind us that we still look back on. From the archives of The Tartan to the throwbacks on this week's Tartan playlist (made specially for you by Pillbox Editor Zachary Gelman). 
The genius Hannibal Gerald has blessed us with more comics, straight from her published zine! There has been a great response to the previous comics of hers, so don't be a fool. You still have a chance to be among her first fans before she gets huge!
We also have great poetry, Ominous, Onymous, and Anonymous. I pity the brain of anybody that won't be able to appreciate at least one. This glut of poetry fills the Rupi Kaur-shaped hole in our issue and our hearts.
Our great Tartan Editor-in-Chief, who we aren't allowed to say no to, gave us a new article about a one-shot manga published by mandala Tatsuki Fujimoto last week. Regardless of your feelings on manga, the review covers how words and pictures can come together to make a beautiful film on paper.
Pillbox Editor Pria Dahiya (the more hard working and smooth talking editor) took time off of her busy schedule to write an all important article about tragic pop. It makes very interesting points on the nature of music and has a cool disco ball! 
And finally, Zivan has come back with one of the greatest articles he has ever written. His first hand account of a visit to a new Harry Potter experience will be sure to stun millennials. Sadly though, the readership of PILLBOX is restricted to CFA hyper-pop Zoomers and octogenarian professors, so they might not be able to share in the nostalgia.
Don't forget to send your love our way, because we really really need it.
Your Pillbox Editors, with love,
Pria Dahiya & Zachary Gelman

First-year Emily Szabo wasn’t sure what triggered the fire alarm in Mudge House on April 7, but when black water began seeping from the neighboring suite, she knew it couldn’t be anything good. By the end of the day, a third of her carpet would be soaked and — by the following week — all of it stripped. But it was nothing compared to the damage wrought in the adjacent suite, where water was gushing from the wall.
Szabo, who is studying electrical and computer engineering, said that the flooding started when the fire sprinkler, on which her neighbor had hung a pair of jeans, broke. CMUPD and the fire department arrived at the scene around 10 minutes after the alarm was triggered.
“There were one to three inches of standing water on the whole floor,” Szabo recalled in an interview with The Tartan. She did not know the specific measurements, but affirmed that the volume was “definitely over an inch.”
The residents of the suite directly affected by the flooding were permanently relocated. Because there was a wall dividing Szabo’s suite from the origin of the flooding, she figured she would return to her room in a few days and not have to relocate all of her belongings. During that time, she stayed with her sister, who is also a student at Carnegie Mellon. After a week, however, Szabo decided to move to the housing alternative offered by the university, where her roommate was already staying.
On April 13, the roommates were told that they could move back to their room in Mudge. With only a few weeks of school left, they preferred to stay in the Fairfax apartment to which they had been relocated. Unoccupied Fairfax apartments are also being used for overflow IQ Housing.
The university accepted the request made by Szabo and her roommate to stay in Fairfax for the rest of the academic year. “I’m really grateful to all the workers who were there to help on Thursday,” she said, referring to the day of the flooding. Amidst the business and excitement of Carnival activities, Szabo appreciated workers’ immediate response and clean up efforts following the flooding.

Names used to refer to service workers were changed to protect their identities.
According to their contract with Chartwells, service workers are not allowed to request vacation time during “blocked out weeks.” In previous years, that only referred to commencement week, employees told The Tartan. But last week, workers received news about sweeping changes to next year’s vacation time. In a calendar sent to employees, not a single day was marked “open for vacation” from August 14 to October 31. Over the 181 days that follow, only 42 percent are “open.”
“I’m over it,” said Taylor, an employee who has spent a decade with Carnegie Mellon Dining Services. The worker had a list of complaints against Chartwells, and it was growing by the week. There was the coworker who lost an expensive pair of earrings after studs were abruptly banned. There were the suggestions of a rule about tattoos, which the employee saw as “flat-out discrimination.” And there was the reduction in hours, from 40 to 37.5, that caused at least two employees to consider quitting. Chartwells did not provide responses to questions by The Tartan regarding these changes.
Most employees have maintained 40-hour work weeks during the years with the university. But because only 37.5 hours are required to be a full-time employee, Chartwells recently slashed employees’ schedules by half an hour each day. Less work means less pay, which can be difficult to afford. The starting wage for Chartwells counter workers is $16.98 per hour.
Chartwells also cut workers’ weekly hours to 37.5 at Northeastern University. On April 16, students rallied to support dining employees. In the days leading up to the event, the university power washed announcements made in sidewalk chalk.
At Carnegie Mellon, workers need approval from their manager to work more than the amount for which they are scheduled. If they clock out three minutes late, they risk receiving half a point. Seven points justify grounds for termination, according to Chartwells’ handbook. Employees are also docked points for sick days. One point for one sick day, two points for two, one point for three. Not only does this penalize workers for being ill, it also encourages them to take the third day off—otherwise they’ll receive an extra point, one employee explained to The Tartan.
All of these frustrations built in the weeks leading up to the vacation announcement, which was sent on April 8. This was a violation of the employees’ contract, which was reviewed by The Tartan. The window for service workers to request their vacation days was set to begin April 1, but more than a third of their decision time was cut. After the first letters arrived on April 11, word spread quickly among employees, some of whom didn’t receive their envelope until April 13. Request approvals are partially based on the order in which they are received, putting workers who got the letter late at a disadvantage.
Employees are granted two weeks of paid vacation days after a year with Carnegie Mellon Dining Services, three weeks after five years of service, and four weeks after 15. Vacation time does not roll over across years; if it is not used in a given year, it expires. But with fewer opportunities for vacation days, it is likely that coworkers will be competing for the same time off. Taylor said they wouldn’t be surprised if Chartwells denies workers their requests, leaving them with fewer vacation days by the end of the year.
The change is especially difficult for employees with children. Alex, whose kids’ birthdays fall during blocked-off months, was nonplussed by Chartwells’ decision. “They can say whatever they want. My sons come first.”
The tighter rules are a response to Chartwells’ low return rate. “If they’re losing money … that’s not your employees’ problem. That’s your problem,” Taylor told The Tartan. They explained that most employee suggestions about food changes have been shut down by upper-management. “There ain’t shit for yinz to eat. No wonder [Chartwells is] losing business....  They’re losing money, so now they’re gonna mess with our pockets like it’s our fault.”
Since Taylor began working at Carnegie Mellon, the jewelry rules made sense to them. But this spring, management began “making everybody go around and take their earrings out. … Poof, you lost an expensive set of earrings because they had them do that.” Taylor supports rules about bracelets, dangling earrings, and nail polish, which can fall into the food. “If I have my ears dangling over food then maybe I shouldn’t be a cook, you know what I mean?” They also understood limits on nose, lip, and eyebrow piercings. But saying no to studs? “It’s ridiculous, what they’re coming up with.”
Over spring break, workers were called in for a mandatory, four-hour training meeting. “Most of the stuff didn’t pertain to us,” Taylor recalled. “A lot of it was stuff … they teach nurses, like blood-borne pathogens, hepatitis … more about drawing blood or something.”
Some of the speakers shared information that was both helpful and relevant to workers, including breast cancer awareness and customer service training. Mostly, though, employees wondered why they were still at work. Taylor felt that the time could have been better spent asking employees what changes they’d like to see at their stations.
“We had three different meetings about the whole blood borne pathogens n’at,” Taylor said. “They had to pay us automatic four hours for being here, so they were just going on about anything to get their money’s worth. … That stuff, by the way, is supposed to be done at the beginning of the school year.” After information was repeated a third time around, Taylor was left thinking: “Yinz are really milking that crop.”
One of the aspects of the meeting Taylor was most dubious about was a raffle at the end. Chartwells halved employees’ vacation days this year (January 2020 - January 2021), because workers were furloughed during the pandemic. Since they only worked half the year, senior management in turn decided to halve their paid leave. At the meeting over spring break, Chartwells raffled off two vacation days. “I was like, ‘You gotta be kidding me. Oh, y’all’s trying to give back the vacation days y’all took.’”
When Chartwells came to Carnegie Mellon in 2019, many service workers were hopeful. The previous dining management company, CulinArt, doled out low wages and was slow to field employee feedback. Yet when it was replaced by Chartwells, Taylor was reminded to “watch what you wish for. … Boy do we have appreciation for CulinArt now.”
A service worker passing by overheard Taylor’s comment and called out, “I knew what was coming.” Every three years, Carnegie Mellon decides to either continue their dining partnership or choose a new company. Service workers are not consulted during this process.

“It is imperative that we avoid a situation where our inventory of dedicated [Isolation and Quarantine] housing beds is overwhelmed by demand,” an email from Student Affairs leadership explained to residential students on Wednesday. By then, however, the situation was impossible to avoid: Isolation and Quarantine (IQ) Housing was at 105.17 percent capacity, according to the COVID-19 dashboard.
COVID-positive students with no or mild symptoms are now expected to stay in their on-campus housing assignment and “isolate-in-place,” while “residential students at higher risk and/or with moderate-to-severe symptoms will continue to be temporarily relocated to our dedicated IQ housing,” according to the email.
The university does not plan to expand IQ Housing. However, students  living with a COVID-positive roommate who test negative for the virus have the option to relocate to a hotel by reaching out to their Housefellow. They can also temporarily stay with a friend or family member.
After the isolate-in-place measures were introduced, IQ Housing stabilized to 65 percent capacity on Friday. Daryl Weinert, the university’s COVID-19 coordinator, told The Tartan that the university plans to report the number of students isolating in place. The data is expected to be published on the COVID dashboard later this week. On April 13, the dashboard reported that 94 students were positive. The case count has not increased since then, suggesting a discrepancy in reporting, because IQ Housing has 61 more beds available than the number of positive students on campus (55), according to the dashboard.
In addition to Shirley Apartments and Margaret Morison 101, which comprise the 116 IQ beds, there are COVID-positive students living in Fairfax, Hamerschlag, Donner, Mudge, Morewood Gardens, and other residence halls. The university said they would not provide a list of dorms with students isolating in place because of the daily changes in case counts. Carnegie Mellon’s quarantine period is 10 days.
Many of the COVID-safety vending machines were completely depleted of their tests the day after they were restocked. Weinert told The Tartan that the machines, which are restocked on Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, have 250 test kits each. The uptick in use comes as many students are sick, but not just with COVID. The email to dorm residents acknowledged that most students’ current COVID symptoms “are actually milder than those associated with influenza that is also currently circulating in our community.”
The email nodded to residents’ concerns about living with COVID-positive roommates, but reasoned that “given the highly transmissible nature of the current variants, and the fact that most people who test positive were contagious two days before symptoms appeared, it is likely that roommates have already been exposed to the virus.”
First-year Mia Constantin, who tested positive on April 12 and also has the flu, is staying in Shirley Apartments IQ Housing. She is unsure if her symptoms — high fever, head congestion, persistent cough — are from COVID, the flu, or both. Her coursework has been manageable because most classes are being held virtually, if they are still being held at all. “So many people have COVID that [canceling or going online] has just become the easiest option,” she wrote in an email to The Tartan.
COVID-positive students who live off-campus are assigned a health liaison to support them during their isolation period. Abigail Macy, a senior studying violin performance and international relations, elected to have her liaison notify her professors that she was positive. She said the faculty member also directed her “towards food and prescriptions … [like] delivery options at Target and Whole Foods.”
Chelsea Tang, who lives off-campus with a roommate who tested positive on April 11, described the anxiety of ambiguity to The Tartan: “Not knowing is definitely not as bad as having COVID but it was heavy on my mind until I got tested.” Tang tested negative on Tuesday after her roommate tested positive on Monday.
The turnover rate for Tartan Testing was something Macy, who tested on April 12 and got results the next day, appreciated. After experiencing mild symptoms, she took two rapid tests, both of which came back negative. As she waited for her PCR, she kept her mask on while continuing to go to class. “It’s good that the Tartan Test came back so quickly, so that I could stop going to school,” Macy explained in an interview with The Tartan.
Weinert attributed the COVID outbreak to the Omicron subvariant BA.2, which is characterized by its high transmissibility and low symptom severity. The sudden spread of COVID, the flu, and the common cold come after a number of recent changes on campus. One was the mask mandate removal on March 28. During that week, The Tartan observed that the majority of students (about 58 percent) choose to continue wearing face coverings indoors. By Carnival weekend, however, most students opted out of masks. A week later, many prospective families visited and alumni returned to campus for Carnival. The three-day weekend also allowed students to spend more time together in higher-density groups.

The Undergraduate Student Senate opened their meeting on April 13 with a presentation from the Academic Affairs committee. Academic Affairs chair Emily DuBois gave the presentation on the Online Learning Resource and Art Supply Fund for the fall 2021 semester.
This fund was created in 2020 to address students’ needs for course materials. Online Learning Resources (OLR) are softwares required for a course that is not available through Computing Services. Examples include iClicker, iDecisionGames, and Sapling. The Art Supply includes paints, film, and clay.
The Senate began investigating OLR expenses in 2019; the original sample of students surveyed estimated that approximately half of undergraduates were taking a class that had online resources with costs not covered by financial aid. In response, the Senate created the OLR/Arts Fund to cover the cost for students. The fund was implemented in the 2020-21 Senate bylaws and created a $6,000 initial funding source. For the 2021-22 school year, the Senate increased the funding supply to $10,000.
There are some considerations taken into account when a student is applying, whether it is for an OLR or an art supply, the type of course (if it’s for a major/minor requirement, if it counts for a major/minor, or if it’s for an elective), and if the student has financial need. Students applying for funding had the opportunity to explain their needs. The request also has to include documentation of the resource’s requirement, like a course syllabus.
In the fall 2021 semester, the Senate received 135 requests from students to receive aid from the OLR/Arts supply fund. Of those requests, 23 percent were for OLR and 77 percent for art supplies. This compares to 32 percent for OLR and 68 percent for arts supply in 2020. A total of $10,405.77 was approved for distribution for 106 of the 135 requests. Juniors had the most approvals at 39 (totaling $2,912.40), sophomores had 25 approvals ($3,025.78), seniors had 21 ($2,607.57), fifth-years had 20 ($1,830.03), and one first-year received $29.99.
About a third of the approved requests were courses in the art department, with design and drama courses combined making up about 40 percent of requests. Some student experiences that were part of the request process included, “this costs more than my weekly grocery budget” and “I don’t want finances to interfere with my success in the course.”
The Academic Affairs committee noted that course expenses are not clear to students in advance of registration. Additionally, very specific or non-standardized material requirements force students to purchase options that do not suit their budget out of fear of receiving a worse grade on assignments if they use less expensive materials. It was also noted that students have expressed concern that course expenses create a “great deal of hardship for their daily lives and don’t have/know of support elsewhere.”
The Academic Affairs committee wants professors to include material and cost expectations with the course registration description and syllabus. They also want the standardized materials across several courses (where applicable) to cut down on extra expenditures.
After the presentation by DuBois, a short presentation from the Senate Executive committee regarding the streamlining of Senate’s communications and internal affairs followed. The premise of the recommendation was to consolidate the Communications committee and the Internal Development committee into a singular committee: the Senate Operations Committee. Both committees have historically struggled with low membership, and previous Executive committees had discussed consolidating them, but it had never been acted upon.
The committee was consolidated because several initiatives were sidelined due to understaffing. The hope of consolidating is that a moderate-sized membership that remains stable will lead to more effective work with other committees and better-maintained new initiatives. If this recommendation were to pass the Senate, the previously existing committees would dissolve at the end of the 2021-22 Senate session and the Operations committee would be established at the beginning of the 2022-23 Senate session.
One of the stated responsibilities of the new Operations committee would be to maintain a student-wide newsletter detailing current and upcoming Senate happenings, along with Senate representatives’ contact information. They would also be in charge of maintaining the Senate’s web space on Carnegie Mellon’s Student Government website, including membership, along with planning and scheduling content on the Senate’s social media pages. It was noted some of the social media responsibilities that the Communications or Internal Development committee currently hold would be better suited for other committees, like the creation of some social media content would be moved to the Operations committee.
As part of the recommendation outlined by the Executive committee, the Senate plans to expand the positions of Graphic Designer and Clerk. The Senate Graphic designer would serve as an ex officio member of the Operations committee, attend committee meetings, and take requests from committees. The Senate Clerk would also serve as an ex officio member on the committee since the position has responsibilities for some current Communications tasks, like maintaining meeting minutes, and some Internal Development tasks like keeping track of meeting attendance. The recommendation passed with a vote of 16-0-1.
The next presentation came from a teaching professor of computer science and the director of the computer science undergraduate program, Mark Stehlik, who serves as a co-chair of the Calendar Innovation committee. His presentation outlined the current proposed  calendar for academic year 2022-23.
The committee held an assessment at the end of the fall 2021 semester to gather feedback from students, advisors, and faculty to evaluate the switch to the 14-week calendar. It was noted that it would be difficult to separate the community’s experience with the 14-week calendar from the pandemic and the return to on-campus operations, along with recognizing the university’s rationale for a new calendar system.
The committee received feedback from students, faculty, and advisors who shared concern that decreasing instruction time would lower the quality of the Carnegie Mellon learning experience. Stehlik said that some of Carnegie Mellon’s peer institutions exemplify how a shorter calendar alone does not necessarily impact the value of an institution’s education. The proposed calendar includes the introduction of a fall break, creating symmetry between the fall and spring semesters. This came from the recognition from all the groups that a break not only offers the opportunity to rest and rejuvenate, but will also lessen burnout in the latter half of the semester.
Overall considerations from the committee resulted in the “1-2-3 Consensus” for the fall semester: provide a one-week fall break, two weeks of classes after Thanksgiving, and a three-week winter break. The new proposed calendar leads to four less instructional days per semester. In the fall semester, there will be 65 instructional days compared to the 69 without the fall break, and a 67-instructional day spring semester instead of 71. Stehlik noted one of the four lost instructional days can be made up in some classes if professors decide to consolidate an exam that is usually held during the last week and the final exam.
The meeting ended with general announcements. The Joint Funding Committee is holding their second-round appeals on Wednesday, April 20, during the Senate-Graduate Student Assembly ratification meeting. Tours of the Forbes-Beeler Apartments, which will be opening in Fall 2023, are being held on April 20 and April 21 for students. An additional announcement noted the rise of COVID-19 cases on campus. There was some discussion regarding whether another mask mandate will be needed on campus, and the meeting adjourned shortly after.

Carnegie Mellon is often regarded as a school with a rigorous admissions process; U.S. News considers it one of the most selective schools with an acceptance rate of approximately 17 percent. According to the Carnegie Mellon common data set from 2021-22, extracurricular activities are a “very important” part of an applicant’s submission. This means that students admitted to Carnegie Mellon participated in extracurriculars throughout high school. So why does it seem like so many organizations — including The Tartan — are struggling to find and maintain members?
The pandemic clearly plays a major role in this. There’s little doubt that motivation runs low among students stuck behind a computer screen to care about organizations they are in (or want to join). This led to membership drops in many orgs over the last two years. For many, they spent the year returning to pre-pandemic activities making sure that their club would just barely continue to exist.
This highlights a bigger problem: outside of passion, there’s very little incentive for students to join organizations at the college level. At the high school level, the motivation for many Carnegie Mellon-hopefuls was to have something to put on their college application. This isn’t to say that students weren’t joining organizations because it was something they were interested in doing, but that four-year involvement with an officer position was incentivized by its pretty title on a college resume.
At the collegiate level, many students don’t have the same motivation for engagement. Sure, a leadership position in a college org will look good on a job application, but so will having that 4.0 QPA. A lot is expected of Carnegie Mellon students. There’s an obvious grind-culture that consumes many students — work hard, work harder. To many students, joining orgs simply isn’t part of that.
At least for me, imposter syndrome plays a role in this. As most  Carnegie Mellon students can tell you, imposter syndrome has a large presence on campus. Though we all managed to get into a rigorous university like Carnegie Mellon, there’s always a feeling like we’re not good enough, like there’s someone outworking us. This continues to feed the grind cycle — if you’re not actively working, someone else is and will do better than you in classes and in life. This leads to students committing more of their time to working, studying, and burning out less than halfway through the semester.
This endless cycle of work, burnout, work, burnout is toxic and joining a club is one of the healthiest breaks from the endless grind culture. So why don’t more students do it? It’s because it’s not going to get them their internship at Meta or a six-figure job following graduation. This highlights a bigger picture at Carnegie Mellon: the average student is fairly one-track minded.
Grind culture is a manifestation of this. Students tend to have a fairly narrow outlook on their college experience. Get good grades, get internships, get a diploma, then get a job. As bare-bones as that sounds, that’s the image I have of the average student here. This was the track that I was on when I entered college last year. I was worried about finding an internship for my first-year summer. I knew that after college I wanted to go to graduate school, and after that, work in a national lab. I joined The Tartan briefly toward the beginning of semester, but stopped attending meetings and writing articles to focus on my school work after about a month. I was a victim of the grind culture.
It wasn’t until I realized that I was stuck in the grind culture during the following spring semester that things started to improve for me. I spent more time doing work for The Tartan (and other orgs), less time in my room (at home, thanks COVID), and more time focusing on what made me happy. I didn’t end up applying for a summer internship, and I honestly think that was one of the best decisions I made for myself. Though I may be more uncertain about what I want to do with the rest of my life than I was last year, I can certainly say that I’m much happier with my situation.
Grind culture can be toxic even when it is passed off as tenacity. For some, constantly working and studying may be how they cope. Somehow, I doubt this is the case for most. The pressure students put on themselves to constantly put out our best work is what pushes them, and when something goes wrong, they simply break. Even the slightest failures seem like we’re falling behind our peers; it’s hard for students to adjust their expectations of themselves.
Being closed-minded doesn’t just apply to the grind culture at Carnegie Mellon — I feel like the “this is the way we’ve always done it” mentality is commonplace. Breaking from this phrase means change, and that can throw off the perfect plans we have in our heads. For instance, the change to the 14-week semester that includes fall break next year. Personally, I’ve heard some resistance from students regarding this because we’ll be receiving less instructional days, or there’s fear of professors assigning work over break anyways. Students aren’t willing to take a chance on change, even if it means getting a break from work for a while.
While sticking to the status quo is safe, the closed-mindedness of Carnegie Mellon is detrimental. While it may feel secure to stick to a plan and constantly work, it doesn’t lead to happiness in the long run. But given the average Carnegie Mellon student, it’s going to be hard to break from the grind culture, since that’s all a lot of us know.

It was 80 degrees on Wednesday, April 13. I have opened and shut the window of my non-air conditioned dorm at least seven times since the weekend because if I had left it open on Sunday, I would have been exposed to 30 degree conditions.
Temperatures in March ranged between 13 and 75 degrees, with absolutely no indication of a general increase over time. April has not been much different.
As someone who has lived and breathed Pittsburgh’s fickle air since the moment I was born, I want to make something very clear: this is NOT normal. Maybe a month ago it might have been, but now, in mid-April, 40-degree temperature swings within weeks and even days is not something natives would consider regular.
As we know, though, weather patterns virtually everywhere have been abnormal in recent years, ranging from temperature shifts (like snow in Texas) to severe storms, fires, and tornadoes across the country. Most of the notable occurrences are taken as evidence of the ever-increasing effects of climate change. The overall global temperature is on the rise, meaning that almost every country is currently experiencing new kinds of weather. For example, while the production of wine in France has been hindered by increasing temperatures, climate changes have made it possible for wine-making grapes to be grown in England for the first time.
Here in Pittsburgh, though, there is nothing glamorous about the indecisive spring we’ve been having. Repeated bouts of snow interspersed by 60 — and even 70 — degrees is freezing blooming plants, making it easier to get sick (as seen in spiking COVID cases), and making it way, way harder to decide what to wear in the morning.
Truly, the weather fluctuations have had a very real effect on us as a campus, especially during this past week of preparation for and execution of Carnival. Student workers  for Carnival endured difficult conditions while preparing for activities like Booth, and Buggy finals were cancelled due to rain.
The easing of seasonal depression after what already seemed like a long winter has become an endless cycle of disappointment when a nice day is followed by bitter cold. By the time Punxatawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter, Pittsburgh had already seen 50-degree highs, and honestly, I was skeptical. Sure enough, we hit 60 the next week. The day after that, it was about 30 degrees.
My mom always told me that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb, and I even gave it until mid-April to achieve anything resembling lamb-like, but it’s seeming like the saying might not hold true anymore. March both came in and left like a drunken polar bear.
What can certainly be agreed on by all parties, though, is that this is the least of what we might see if serious changes are not made by governments and corporations very soon (see details about Divest CMU’s campaign to cut ties from the fossil fuel industry). For all beginning to use various expletive terms to refer to Pittsburgh, let the weather be a motivator for climate justice action, or at least for a new coat.

Carnival Weekend was full of many exciting activities. Thus, for this week’s issue, the Editorial Board decided to highlight the best and brightest of Carnival. Without further ado, here are the celebrities of this year’s Carnival:
Mud
You know her and you love her, Carnival’s hottest celebrity was the thicccccccccccccccccccccccccc mud that swept the Cut all three days. She was on your shoes, on your jacket, on her girlboss grind. Pittsburgh rain was a paid actor in her story. You want to wear those sneakers again? You can’t. She’s already on them. What would Carnival have been without her? She’s an icon, a legend, and she is the moment. The futile attempts to avoid the mud just made other areas worse.
Rain
Mud’s accomplice and the star of Pittsburgh, rain was all over the Carnival scene. Rain was the indecisive queen of the weekend, not knowing whether to pour and pour or start and stop. Soaking the scene and giving Carnival that Pittsburgh glow, what would this weekend be without rain? The legend, a staple of Pittsburgh spring, rain was on the sigma male grindset. Her fickle attitude really shined after the cancellation of buggy finals. 
Hard Hats
And who could forget about the fashion statement of the weekend? Hard hats were everywhere except for the Booths. They were on the heads of all the hottest students, showing everyone whose hearts were really in the work. Going hard, these hats lived it up for Carnival.
COVID
You best believe the OG was on the scene at this year’s Carnival. Our girlie COVID owned the weekend infecting anyone and everyone. You thought it was over? You thought you could hang up your mask? You’re a fool and COVID knows it. She and her accomplice Influenza just couldn't wait to meet you. Carnival's a time for everyone to return, and lady COVID is no exception.
Cash
Obviously Carnival was one high class event, demanding a serious investment. You thought your tuition was expensive? Have you met the cash-demanding Carnival weekend? The vendors didn't accept Dinex or meal blocks, so our wallets were left gutted and crying. Every little event wanted cash, cash, and more cash. Wish your bank account luck, Carnival came for it. 
Emergency Room Visits
Also known as the safest time of the year, Carnival is always full of cute little visits to the emergency room. Say hi to your favorite physicians while definitely totally in perfect health. These trips stole the weekend.
Long Lines
What fun would Carnival be if it was easy to go to the events? None. These lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng lines made sure your weekend was one to remember. Time flew by as you stood in them for hours having the time of your life. Forget the rides, lines were the real main attraction. As with all the best things in life, it wasn't about the destination, it was about the journey. 
The Smell of Funnel Cake
Last but certainly not least, Alpha Phi Omega’s funnel cake booth filled Carnival with a delicious scent. Truly a wonderful addition to the weekend, this fraternity’s Carnival presence stole the show. A sweet star, the aroma of funnel cake made Carnival a smell to remember.

I decided to peruse my YouTube recommendations one day and went down a rabbit hole revisiting shows I grew up with or that I watched with my younger sister. These included Disney Channel, Disney XD, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon. After re-watching way too many hours of those shows, I came to a general rhetorical question: What the heck has happened to family-oriented media?
Diclaimer: this is just me complaining about something yet again, but for once I know that I am not alone in this opinion because everyone I know actually agrees with me. Even the best studios for family-friendly and children’s media, like Pixar, are not as good as they used to be. Every Pixar movie prior to 2011 is incredibly renowned, even “Cars.” Pixar is well known for developed plots written by passionate storytellers who want their animated arcs to resonate with everyone. Pixar isn’t not that anymore, but more than half of the Pixar movies released since 2011 are inferior Disney-mandated sequels. The original animated films from the Disney corner don’t feel the same either. It seems like they’ve resorted to a middle-fantasy comfort zone with similar sorts of beats such as emotional moments guaranteed to make people cry, and very indistinct and flashy animation that looks good but is less touching than the older animation. Throw in a decent song from a famous and relevant musician, and that’s at least two guaranteed nominations for Disney in the animated category. There is nothing wrong with that and it’s not like a lot of those movies, like “Raya and the Last Dragon” or “Encanto,” are bad by any means. But if this is what the best is, you can’t imagine how bad the worst is now.
Because I can. I went down a second rabbit hole to catch up on modern children’s media. And good lord. If Jesus truly was resurrected after three days, he needs to die again for our sinfully terrible children’s media. Again, it’s not like a lot of the older stuff was high art. The “Suite Life” shows are both cringe. But they’re a fun cringe. The new shows aren’t trying, and I’ve identified the following seven deadly sins committed by children’s media:
1) Shows are way too zany and quirky without actually being zany and quirky
2) They’re too flashy and don’t touch on important subjects
3) If they do touch on important subjects, it’s not integrated into the story and feels super performative
4) The characters are not well defined or written, and the shows have a problem of making everyone a main character
5) The plots are bad; either they’re too slow and don’t go anywhere, are rushed and undeveloped, or they’re entirely nonsensical
6) Commodification (or how social media is ruining our media landscape)
7) The audience, particularly children, are treated like they’re too stupid to understand things
All the old shows I can think of range from really fun to genuinely incredible. “Courage the Cowardly Dog,” “Gravity Falls,” “That’s So Raven,” the first few seasons of “SpongeBob” (which is so insufferable now), “Good Luck Charlie,” freaking “Hannah Montana,” and so many more. I keep hearing people talk about how kids’ shows aren’t what they used to be. Each of these shows listed are really effective at eliciting strong emotional responses from the audience with fun writing and great characters. The old Disney Channel shows aren’t quality TV, but they’re effortlessly more entertaining than anything that is on now.
But there has been this trend of our media frying our brains driven by monopolization in the media landscape, extreme commodification, and social media. Be honest. Do any of you actually remember most of the TikToks you watch? How many of you just casually scroll through TikTok and suddenly three hours are gone? The equivalent of that is happening to the TV shows and movies being made because all of you dumb idiots want fast, brainless, flashy content that keeps your attention for minimal time and doesn’t have any depth to it. Now that’s exactly what the companies are delivering, especially for children’s media. Because adults already didn’t care about the edification of children in the first place. Now that these companies are so large and can mass produce and advertise toys all the time, the problem is even worse! Yay!
“But hold on, Sujay. A lot of the old shows have problematic elements and inappropriate themes, and we need to make sure our kids don’t learn that. We need to send them good messages and teach them the right things.”
Ok, sure. That’s fine. But inappropriate jokes are all over the place on the internet already. Kids see all kinds of disturbing stuff on the internet and end up screwed despite parents’ best efforts. Just look at me. Parents are so confused about how to prevent their kids from growing up too fast, but that’s not the problem. The problem is that parents are bad at their jobs and expect media to do it for them. Some parents want their kids to learn tolerance and acceptance. Some parents want their kids to be upstanding members of society who care about their family. Some parents don’t care at all about their kids and feed them brain rot instead of developing their minds with something challenging.
Are kids getting any actual value out of “Dog With A Blog,” a show about a dog who has a blog? I’m not kidding. That show is real. And it doesn’t even do anything with that premise! It’s just the same old “Oh wow I’m a talking animal and have to hide my identity haha hijinks ensue.” Stop it. Get some good writers and directors and make another “Wizards of Waverly Place,” where there’s an actual world and actual characters and actual conflicts. None of these current shows or movies have conflict or stakes, because god forbid we sully the feeble minds of children with imperfect characters who learn from mistakes. Like, what even happens in the “Despicable Me” movies? Can you tell me? I certainly don’t remember. There’s something about stealing a moon? Who cares? It’s a kids movie! Parents just need to keep the little turds distracted for a few hours while they work at their soul-sucking corporate job and then yell at the kid later when they inevitably mess up and make them afraid of making mistakes.
But okay, some of the shows are trying to have good messages. They want to teach kids acceptance. Fine. But why does it have to be the case that all these family-oriented movies always write minority characters as a cis-white straight character who just happens to be [insert underrepresented demographic] here? In most cases, they’re either not the main character, or they’re the main character who happens to be the least interesting person in the movie because either their identity is their only personality trait or they have no personality at all. The stories are just performative and don’t do much to increase representation on screen. It just gives Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder more cannon fodder to continue releasing their garbage videos complaining about wokeness, even though the problem is the opposite of what those right-wing lunatics are saying.
Then there’s the craft of the media itself. It’s way too flashy with no substance, incredibly cheap sets, and have bad art direction with overreliance on CGI. That, or they look blandly professional and too pristine without any of the comfortable lighting that gives older shows a softer feel. Kids animation is suffering, especially since all the good animators are doing adult animation now. The jokes aren’t clever. They hinder the pacing and go on way too long, and it feels like they are trying so hard to be appealing and quirky. There is either no depth to any of the side characters, or the side characters take over the whole show, and there’s no in-between. Don’t even get me started on how none of the logic in the shows make sense. The later seasons of “Lab Rats” go so far off the deep end that it was embarrassing to sit through them. The spin-off shows were even worse, which is another plague that has hit the children’s media landscape like it has hit everything else.
I haven’t even gotten into my complaints with books yet, but the issues with books are the same with the issues in our visual medium. They also have to compete with the endless deluge of brainless content that doesn’t take any effort to consume. Because that’s all it is now. It’s consumption. We gave sugar and high-fructose corn syrup-heavy products to children to make them more lethargic and unhealthy, and the media they consume is the same. It is a shame, because there is so much potential to write material that can resonate with everyone. But that’s not what our entertainment companies are doing. This is the new sugar, we’re all hooked, and our brains are deteriorating for it.
