The equipment with which athletes play sports at every level would likely be virtually unrecognizable to those who played the same sport one hundred years ago. Specialized materials and aerodynamic shapes are essential to achieve peak performance with sports equipment. 
But one change, sometimes overlooked when thinking about innovation in sports equipment over the past decades is safety upgrades made to protect the people playing the sport. This was the main focus of the second annual "Rethink the Rink" Make-a-thon, held by the Pittsburgh Penguins, Carnegie Mellon School of Engineering, and Covestro, a materials manufacturing company. 
Safety in ice hockey became a more prominent issue after the tragic death of three 'enforcers' during the summer of 2011. The NHL settled a suit brought against them by hundreds of former players for $18.9 million in late 2018. 
In a press release by the Penguins, President and CEO David Morehouse cited changes in the players themselves that prompted the need for academic innovation around safety on the rink, saying, "players are bigger, faster, and stronger than ever before, and so our challenge is to find new ways to keep them safer and reduce injuries."
The first "Rethink the Rink" Make-a-thon was held last year, and focused on how students could come up with ways to improve the boards and the glass that surround the ice hockey rink, which often take a massive impact from careening players. Students were encouraged to reimagine the materials and designs for these boards, with the safety of the hockey players in mind. Isabel Roscoe, a masters student at Tepper, told the Boston Globe last year that her goal as a Make-a-thon participant was not to dramatically change the sport she loves: "As a lifelong hockey fan, I don’t want the experience to change. I don’t want puck play to change. So it was about getting our team around those issues."
Two students, Alex Duncan, an alumnus who graduated this past year with a master's degree in mechanical engineering, and Ian Suzuki, a junior in mechanical and biomedical engineering, worked this past summer at Covestro to continue to develop the ideas brought up in last year's Make-a-thon. A press release from the Penguins said that the prototypes they developed were manufactured, and then tested at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Lemieux Sports Complex in Cranberry.
This year, students were meant to focus on the safety gear that players wear, designing prototypes in early March before presenting the efforts of their week of work and receiving awards on March 15.  The awards ceremony took place at the same rink where the boards developed at Covestro by Duncan and Suzuki were to be tested.
Most teams focused on redesigning helmets to protect players by reducing the likelihood of brain injury.  The team, which included Suzuki, that won the prize for best overall design worked on a prototype which redesigned the helmets that goalies wear, with a focus on making them more absorbent and adaptable to various impacts. 
While Carnegie Mellon may not be seen as a traditionally sporty school, though it should be noted that we do have a co-ed ice hockey club, the "Rethink the Rink" partnership with the Penguins has allowed members of the university community to exert a real influence on how hockey might be played in the future.

The final game is set! Texas Tech will play the University of Virginia for the championship. Let’s take a look at what happened this week to get us here.
The Elite Eight finished while The Tartan was in office adding the finishing touches to our previous issue. Auburn managed to beat the University of Kentucky in overtime. Auburn rode off the backs of Bryce Brown and Jared Harper, who together scored 50 points. On the other side, Coach Calipari and the Kentucky team relied on PJ Washington, who played valiantly with a sprained foot injury resulting in 28 points and 13 rebounds. The upset gave Auburn their first Final Four bid in the history of their school. 
Duke and Michigan State played for the last Final Four spot. Michigan State pulled off the ‘impossible,’ though many other schools perhaps could have deservedly done so earlier, and ended Duke’s run in the tournament. Following the precedent set by the rest of the tournament, the game was a thriller. The score was constantly neck and neck, but going into the last 1:20, it seemed like Duke’s lead of three would perhaps get them the win again, just as their slim leads did in the prior few games. Michigan State managed to put in a layup, which cut the lead to just one. Duke now had possession of the ball, except they couldn’t convert the possession into points, as both RJ Barrett and Zion Williamson were unable to get anything to go down when the game entered the clutch and they needed it the most. On the other hand, Michigan State took advantage of their chances and drained a three-pointer. It was likely the biggest shot of Kenny Goins’ career, a brilliant story from being a walk-on to hitting the dagger in the Elite 8 round that took down the Goliath Duke. 
The score now being 68-66 in favor of Michigan State, Barrett missed a three-pointer that bounced out-of-bounds to a scramble, but it was Duke ball. When Barrett received the pass in from Tre Jones, he attempted some failed hero ball by driving towards the basket. He was stopped by a wall of Michigan State defenders but drew a foul. In perhaps the most amusing part of the game, Barrett missed his first foul shot when he intended to make it, and made the second when he wanted to miss so that his team could grab the rebound and try to tie the game. Thus, Michigan State got the ball, were promptly fouled, made the inbound pass, and ran the clock out.
In the Final Four, Texas Tech defeated Michigan State handedly. Although there were moments where Michigan State got within five or six points, Texas Tech jumped out to the early lead and kept it, finishing by a margin of 10. The final score was 61-51.
Although Texas Tech had the rare easy win, the game played before was everything but easy. In perhaps the most controversial and crazy game, Virginia managed to score nine points in eight seconds to win by one against Auburn. Auburn managed to score 11 straight points to take away a decent Virginia lead. The scoreline read 61-57 in favor of Auburn after they drained a corner three, and it looked like the game was over with 10 seconds left. Virginia’s Kyle Guy managed to also sink a corner three to make the score 61-60. Virginia fouled Auburn, who converted on only one of the free throws. With Auburn ahead only by two, the controversy of the game began. Auburn had fouls to give, so they fouled Virginia’s Ty Jerome twice, which didn’t result in free throws for Virginia. On the second time Ty Jerome was fouled, he double dribbled right before the foul call after he tried to do a behind-the-back crossover that bounced off his foot. While the immediate reaction in the game ended up focusing on the subsequent three-point foul on Guy when he attempted a corner three buzzer beater, social media blew up about the missed double dribble. Incensing to those angry about the double dribble call, Guy managed to put in all three free throws to give Virginia a win that many thought they didn’t deserve.
The discussion around the double dribble is misplaced for several reasons. Right before Jerome attempts the behind-the-back crossover, the Auburn defender grabbed Jerome’s jersey, which is a foul. However, the referees missed it despite the fact that Auburn was trying to foul. If anything, the missed double dribble call let Auburn tick off a few more seconds from the clock that they wouldn’t have gotten if the referees called the jersey pull in the first place. Regardless, if the Auburn player had just made the second free throw, the game would have at least gone into overtime, or if Auburn didn’t try to foul the second time, Auburn would have likely won with only three seconds left on the clock. Lastly, the referees were bad for both sides. When Virginia had a 10 point lead, the referees made a handful of dubious calls that put Auburn back in the game. While everyone probably agrees that referees need to see some reform, this game was not “stolen” by any means.
Many will be looking towards the championship game with an air of disdain for what they see as Virginia’s illegitimate opportunity to contend for the trophy. Nevertheless, The Tartan and other basketball fans will be looking forward to a good game.

When first-year business administration major Angela Wu arrived at Carnegie Mellon University last fall, she knew she wanted to join the badminton team. After spending her four years of high school on the badminton team, and her senior year as co-captain, Wu wanted to continue that experience in college.
Carnegie Mellon has a long roster of club sport options, from fencing to frisbee to figure skating. The Badminton Club is one of these options, which competes in both fall and spring semesters and travels around the East Coast for tournaments.
The team, which currently has 21 members, practices for six hours a week in Skibo Gymnasium, in addition to optional conditioning workouts some members organize outside of regular practice. But as a club sport, the team doesn’t have an official coach. Instead, two members with the most badminton training put on workouts and organized drills, led by a graduate student, who is substituted with a motivated first-year player when necessary.
“We're a very self-run student organization,” Wu said in an interview with The Tartan. “We take it really upon ourselves to make sure we’re taken care of.”
Wu is Treasurer of the club, and is heavily involved with making sure rental cars and hotels are booked for weekend tournaments outside Pittsburgh. 
Previously, the club was both a competition team and a recreational club, with many more members. Recently, they restructured the organization, and the club sport of badminton is now a competition team (there are other opportunities for those who wish to play recreationally).
The club holds tryouts at the beginning of each semester. They participate in two main tournaments, one each semester, of the YONEX Eastern Collegiate Team Badminton Championships. This past weekend, they traveled to New Jersey to compete in the spring event.
Beyond these main events, the club organizes tournaments with other universities they meet, such as Case Western Reserve University, and plan to travel to other universities or host them at Carnegie Mellon. The third type of competition is with private badminton clubs that hold tournaments. The team was recently invited by a club in Ohio, and are planning the necessary travel itinerary for the trip.
For Wu, the Badminton Club has become an important part of her college experience so far. “My badminton friends are my closest friends on campus. They’re more my friends first than badminton people. I’m so happy I found that community on campus. Last weekend, we did karaoke…We’ll just go out to eat after tournaments together, go grab some Fuku Tea.”
While most of the members on the team have some form of official badminton training, Wu did not before joining the club (in high school, she only practiced with the team there). Almost half of the members are graduate students, but many of the leaders are undergraduates, including quite a few first-years. The club is made up of people who are committed to badminton, and first and foremost, simply want to play.
“Commitment is really important, but I wouldn’t want anyone to be discouraged from trying out,” Wu said. “We’re a team and we obviously want people to take the sport seriously...but I would encourage everyone to try out. You have to be committed, but just try it out, and we’d love to have [everyone].”

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Ahh Gronk. The man famous for deflating the deflategate conflict with a "deez nutz" joke, which I think should be indicative of his level of superior intelligence. If you looked up the term "stereotypical frat bro" in the dictionary, you would find a giant picture of his face right next to it.  
But the man is now retiring to save his remaining six brain cells before the NFL consumes whatever is left of his brain. 
For reference, it’s been found recently that the number of NFL players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) could be much higher than anticipated. It’s a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized with memory loss, dementia, and other brain problems. A study showed that out of 111 brains that NFL players donated, 110 of them had CTE. 
Of course the NFL probably doesn’t care about CTE. They barely put effort into their halftime shows. Why would they care about their players despite them being the bread and butter of their entire business model? Aren’t football players just clumps of cells meant to be exploited for financial gain? What even is a brain for the NFL? It’s not like any of the NFL executives have one, so of course they would assume the players they exploit don’t have one either. 
The NFL has been mired with these scandals and lawsuits for years, so for them, they’ll look at the eventual CTE lawsuits and just say “bring it on”. It’s horrible, but I see no other reason for the NFL to suddenly change their stance. They hid the negative effects of all the concussions from the public and then didn’t even pay the families of ex-players affected by this their proper settlements after years of court cases. Like who does that? That would be like divorcing your significant other, leaving them with the kids, and then sending a postcard saying “i luv u” instead of paying child support. It’s frustrating to watch the business equivalent of Dolores Umbridge get away with all this. 
So you know what Gronk? You’re my hero. You’re 29 and you could have done what Brady did and played until your ego was satisfied, but you stopped at your prime. May you be blessed with a life without significant long term injury. If you do have it, you can expect the NFL to do absolutely nothing about it.

Just five years ago, corporations across the country began to roll out the best invention of the Internet age: in-stadium food delivery. Now, instead of walking around the stadium to find that $10 light beer to get you through that blowout loss, the food will come to you (for a delivery fee, of course). Forget traveling vendors with their cotton candy or pretzels or bottles of water; technology can get you anything you want like that ungodly milkshake at Yankee Stadium with popcorn, cotton candy, churros, and chocolate syrup drizzled on top.
But even in this digital heaven of efficient food systems, the Pittsburgh Pirates still ran out of hot dog buns.
It was Dollar Dog Night last Wednesday — the crowning achievement of baseball culture — and hot dogs were plentiful. Their buns were not. An attendee of the game, senior Emma Flickinger, said of her experience, “every two minutes somebody was heading past our seat carrying like eight, nine, 10 hot dogs.” There are things that are surprising, and then there’s that. 
This season has been a bit of a rocky start for the Pirates off the field, with this hot dog bun incident and record lows in attendance, but at least the scene at the game was comical. Flickinger described people as “carrying boxes, like shoeboxes, of hot dogs because they couldn’t physically hold them all.” Imagine piles of hot dogs, all without buns, drenched in ketchup and relish. People love their mystery meat dressed in sugary condiments, especially when they’re cheap and purchasable in absurd quantities.
Maybe not ordering the properly absurd amount of hot dog buns was to be expected with a Pirates organization that doesn’t like to spend money. However it was most likely an issue of bureaucratic miscommunication at the organization or their food service provider.
Aramark, the food service provider for PNC Park and the Pirates organization, has yet to make a statement on the incident. However, the Pirates organization has laid the blame squarely on the back of the Pirate Parrot. They tweeted, “After an extensive internal investigation, we have determined we need to keep a closer eye on the bird.” The attached video on the tweet shows the Parrot feeding hot dog buns to ducks on the river, and the Pirates texting the Parrot to ask where the buns have gone.
Aramark is also the food service provider for organizations like the Chicago Public School System, the University of Virginia, and the Ohio Department of Corrections. They have had multiple issues where food is often ill-prepared or frankly, not even food at all. Yet, Pittsburgh has the biggest scandal yet on its hands: is a hot dog a sandwich, even without its bun?
Frankly, ordering that much food for one night takes a lot of planning to work properly, and a lot can go wrong. Everything from a car accident to a missed zero can make the team run out of buns, so there’s probably not some conspiracy about a stingy Pirates organization. The two truths — cheap Pirates owners and a lack of buns — may be mutually exclusive, but that doesn’t mean their overlap doesn’t contain some truth.

It’s no secret that Pittsburgh has less-than-stellar air quality. Even though the region has improved dramatically since the 1940s, when coal and steel production left the city under a perpetual haze, Pittsburgh still ranks as the 10th worst metropolitan region in the US for particulate pollution. 
How can a city that has improved so much still be one of the worst in the nation? Well, according to Matthew Mehalik from the Energy Innovation Center’s Breathe Project in the Hill District, it’s because the benchmark is made in comparison to other modern-day metropolitan regions. In a country racing to improve emission standards, Pittsburgh just isn’t catching up fast enough. 
In fact, at a meeting with the PIttsburgh City Council this past Tuesday, local health officials and scientists discussed the impact that pollution was having on the community. Carnegie Mellon Chemical Engineering professor Neil Donahue spoke at the meeting and highlighted the number of deaths per year caused by pollution, stating that the number of deaths were “about equivalent to the opioid epidemic.”
For years, organizations and activists have been working to make a dent in the pollution issue. Here at Carnegie Mellon, the Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment (CREATE) Lab, led by director Illah Nourbakhsh, has pioneered programs to combat pollution. One, Breathe Cam, is a network of cameras that monitor the visible pollution levels in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas. 
The other program is a free application, available for Android and iOS, named Smell PGH. Using human noses as “sensors,” Mr. Nourbakhsh has effectively crowdsourced pollution reporting to build real-time awareness of Pittsburgh’s air quality. By sending reports directly to the Allegheny County Health Department, users can help build high-quality air pollution data, just by rating the quality of the air around them.
Since the app’s release in 2016, it has grown successful enough that the CREATE Lab has partnered with the eco-conscious company Seventh Generation to take Smell PGH to the national scale as a new app: Smell MyCity. It will first roll out in Louisville, Kentucky and then Portland, Oregon, but the goal is to bring Smell MyCity to communities across the U.S.
So, if you’ve ever noticed a foul smell in the air, consider downloading Smell MyCity and help contribute to the fight against pollution. The more users that contribute to the database, the faster health officials can pinpoint the source of the pollutant.

The red planet might not be so red after all, at least on the inside. A new study from the University of Southern California Arid Climate and Water Research Center (AWARE) suggests that there could still be active deep groundwater wells on Mars, potentially resulting in surface streams in equatorial regions of the planet. The research follows a discovery by the Italian Space Agency in mid-2018 of a deep-water lake under Mars’ southern polar ice caps.
The study, published in Nature Geoscience, confirms that there is likely an active deepwater circulation system on Mars that extends far beyond just its polar ice caps. Groundwater as deep as 750 meters could be exposed to the surface through ground fractures, creating springs and surface streams in some craters that could be the basis for habitability on the red planet. Scientists previously thought that any water found on the surface was limited to just a few meters of subsurface water flow. “We suggest that this may not be true,” said Essam Heggy, a research assistant at the University of Southern California and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. “We propose an alternative hypothesis that they originate from a deep pressurized groundwater source which comes to the surface moving upward along ground cracks.”
The researchers propose that fractures within Mars’ craters enable springs to rise to the surface due to tremendous pressure within the planet, as evidenced by seasonal dark streaks called recurring slope lineae that appear on Mars during warm parts of the year. “The system shuts down during winter seasons, when the ascending near-surface water freezes within fault pathways, and resumes during summer seasons when brine temperatures rise above the freezing point,” the paper explains.
In order to explore how Mars’ groundwater arrives on the planet’s surface, the researchers used high-resolution optical imagery and computer modeling to investigate the walls of large impact craters, attempting to correlate the presence of fractures with the sources of dark streaks and flowing surface water streams. This is different from previous work, which has focused on interpreting electromagnetic echoes returned from radar-probing instruments aboard the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. However, the existing methodology was not sufficient to determine that there is groundwater in a broad geographical range outside of Mars' south pole.
According to Heggy and University of Southern California postdoctoral researcher Abotalib Z. Abotalib, their experience studying a similar phenomenon in the Sahara Desert on Earth helped them achieve their goals. “The experience we gained from our research in desert hydrology was the cornerstone in reaching this conclusion. We have seen the same mechanisms in the North African Sahara and in the Arabian Peninsula, and it helped us explore the same mechanism on Mars,” said Abotalib. Heggy added, “Groundwater is strong evidence for the past similarity between Mars and Earth — it suggests they have a similar evolution, to some extent.”
Heggy is excited about the intrigue his study has created within the scientific community. While some disagree on this paper’s explanation for recurring slope lineae on Mars, the debate furthers extraterrestrial water science and water science education in arid areas and could fuel development of more advanced probing systems.
“Understanding how groundwater has formed on Mars, where it is today, and how it is moving helps us constrain ambiguities on the evolution of climatic conditions on Mars for the last three billion years and how these conditions formed this groundwater system. It helps us to understand the similarities to our own planet and if we are going through the same climate evolution and the same path that Mars is going,” Heggy explained. “Understanding Mars' evolution is crucial for understanding our own Earth's long-term evolution and groundwater is a key element in this process.”

When you’re a college student, sometimes cooking gets boiled down to what’s cheap or what’s easy, and most of the time, both. That’s how I usually end up planning my meals when I'm at the grocery store, but that doesn’t mean the cheap and quick food you make has to taste bad, or even average. It should taste good!
For this week’s menu, I present a twist on one of my classic go-to recipes. I always resort to roasted chicken and veggies when I'm tired and busy. It's not only a great meal but also something you can make in bulk for meal-prepping. It’s a win-win! This week, Brussels sprouts were on sale at the store, so I thought I’d go for them instead of my usual broccoli or carrots. I absolutely adore Brussels sprouts, though they usually end up on most hated vegetable lists. I think people are just cooking them the wrong way. For this recipe, I also added potatoes for the much-needed starch component of a balanced meal.
Ingredients
- 2 cups of Brussels sprouts
- 2 lbs of chicken (I used thighs, but any kind works)
- 4 potatoes, chopped
- 4 tbsp of vegetable oil
- Salt, pepper, preferred spices
- 1 tbsp hoisin sauce
Directions
1) Preheat the oven to 425 °F.
2) Toss the Brussels sprouts in a mixing bowl with 2 tbsp of the oil and a dash of salt, pepper, and whatever spices you prefer (I love to add garlic powder or paprika).
3) Repeat Step 2 for the chicken and potatoes in separate bowls.
4) Place the Brussels sprouts in a parchment paper-lined pan. Place the chicken and potatoes together in a separate pan. Put both pans in the heated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until browned.
5) About five minutes before you finish baking, take out the pan of Brussel sprouts. Pour the hoisin sauce over the Brussels sprouts in the pan, and lightly mix, so that the sauce covers all of them. Put the pan back in the oven, and bake for the rest of the time.
6) After baking, let the chicken and veggies rest for five minutes before serving.

“What if you were only allowed 140 words for an entire day? What could you still say?” How do you say love?
Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons, written by Sam Steiner, is a story about two lovers’ life before and after the passage of a preposterous law that set a 140-word cap on how many words each person can speak a day. This love story has a unique opening. Bernadette, a young, ambitious lawyer, meets Oliver, a hot-blooded musician, at a cat’s funeral in a pet cemetery. A few more dates in the pet cemetery quickly progresses into living with each other. However, the more they reveal to each other, the more conflicts arise. The imperfections in their personalities — Bernadette’s inferiority complex and Oliver’s insensitive nature — bury an entire minefield between them. After the word-limit law is put into the public eye, Oliver fights against it fanatically, while Bernadette thinks that it would never pass and regards Oliver’s protests as childish. During an important protest Oliver organized, he reunites with his ex-girlfriend, Julie, who was as passionate as him. On that day, Oliver cheats on Bernadette. 
This secret becomes a time bomb that Bernadette vaguely senses but is terrified to address, thus the daunting silence continues to haunt their lives after the passing of the word-limit law. How can they move past it if they only have 22 words for each other at the end of the day? How could they move past it if they’d failed to do so in the past when they had the freedom to say whatever they want?
The narrative is interspersed with flashbacks. One scene would be their date in the pet cemetery, and the next one would start with Bernadette and Oliver reporting to each other their remaining word counts. In one scene they passionately argue or humorously entertain each other. In the next, they painfully communicate through fragmented sentences and abbreviations — “Talk?” “Lovu” “Lovu”. At the beginning, the quick shifts not only add complexity to the story, inviting the audience to solve the puzzle, but also display the contrasting dynamic of Oliver and Bernadette’s relationship before and after their words were limited. 
Ava Yaghmaie as Bernadette and Arthur Langlie as Oliver performed for one hour and a half in perfect synchronization and brought the play to life. They guided the audience into their own rhythm: their romantic pauses, their anxious waiting in silence for the voting result of the word-limit law, and their changes in physical distance in coordination with the fluctuation of their relationship.
“19,” says Bernadette.
“2,” says Oliver.
“Choose carefully,” says Bernadette.
“I apologize.”
“For what, Oliver? For what?” Bernadette throws her hands in the air and leans into the already muted Oliver in frustration.
In the program pamphlet, there were a few lines commenting on the magic of words: “We use our words to explain our quirks, our inadequacies, our failures. We use them to explain our joys, our triumphs, and our happiness. We use words to be our true selves.” Words give depth and intricacy to life, allowing communications and connections transcending time and space. 
This coffee shop smells like the one in my hometown, right around the corner near my middle school.
The spring wind feels as good as the French dessert Mont-Blanc.
You are a day in May.
...
Words that make you laugh until your stomach hurts, words that make you cry with immense joy, words that pierce your heart, words that solidify into permanent wounds. Words, magical creatures in different languages and different forms, weaved into each other to map out the multifaceted and perplexing reality of our humanity. “We use words to be our true selves.”
In the play, the government limits words so that people can focus on essential things, but Bernadette and Oliver come up with a system of abbreviation — “tricks and stuffs” — to combat the law. They save their words for each other. So the system that attempts to force people to focus on work and productivity only prove to Bernadette and Oliver that love is the truly essential thing. Slowly, they become acquainted with each other’s silence and talk through their eyes. Occasionally, they use all their 140 words to sing a song together, jump around the room and laugh like they used to.
At the end of the play, Oliver confesses his betrayal. 
“I think I know,” Bernadette says through sobs.
“I think...I knew… you knew,” Oliver replies.
In the absence of words, they find themselves in each other’s arms. Then the lights dim, two bodies merge into one dark mixture, and the audience enjoys a final moment of silence.
I called all the people I cared about that night. “I just want to talk to you,” I said.

Blood red gowns, gauzy drape tunics, and patched letterman jackets were just three of the many different pieces gracing the runway at the SPIRIT Fashion Show on Saturday evening. Some lines played with color, others with fabric combinations, and some with choreographed presentations, but all represented this year’s theme, Apollo, named for the god of light and knowledge from Greek mythology, who has come to symbolize the phrase “know thyself.”
Hosted by SPIRIT, a multicultural organization at Carnegie Mellon University that aims to celebrate black awareness, the show featured 17 different lines by unique designers, worn by models of all different races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. The event was held in the Wiegand Gymnasium and welcomed a large audience.
As the last light of the day faded from the gym’s windows, the first line kicked off the show, Keegan Barone’s Headswing. Under the blue and orange lights, Barone’s line featured pieces inspired by athletic equipment and exploring the degradation of self in athletics and entertainment, with heeled shoes made from cleats and garments with metal football shoulder pads. With masks, headpieces, and splashes of red, the line had an intense atmosphere that lent itself well to the warrior-like designs.
Tragic Twenties, by Sharrell Rushin, who describes herself as “an introvert,” used deconstructed pieces of quilted, cotton, and plastic textiles, creating a thematic connection from one piece to the next. With a multitude of colors, materials, and shapes, the line had a stream of consciousness quality to it.
Next was Faster than Light by Arthur Brown, who calls the line an exploration of “education and faith.” Featuring the phrase “Borrowed Time” on shirts, bags, and pants, the pieces were quirky and unique, with graphic tees and white lab coats. The models, like they did throughout the night, felt free to pose and move around the runway, to large applause. All the pieces from Faster than Light reminded me of high-fashion streetwear I wouldn’t be surprised to see on the streets in Brooklyn.
Performances bracketed every two or three lines, breathing energy into the audience. The first was singer Emily Wu, with a bluesy performance. Sabrina Clarke performed a modern jazz/contemporary dance that moved from one end of the runway to the other. SPIRIT Dance also lit up the stage with 13 dancers in synchronized choreography. And later, Malcolm Udeozor went under the lights for a rap and singing performance, and was later joined by three other singers, who just had a great time on stage singing and dancing together, ending by jumping into the audience.
Bria Petite Miles’ Super Nova explored the competition between ego and self. In a sea of shiny pinks and sleek metallics, the collection had a young, metropolitan feel. From a structured shirt and pant combination to ruffles and fringe to matching prints, the designs were an eclectic mix.
It was all tulle in Patricia Yu’s Bubba. The collection popped on the stage with white and tan hues and circular shapes, the four models looking like delicate clouds in the different designs as they floated across the stage in one of the most memorable lines of the night.
In contrast, Brownmill (“Crafted and Engineered since 2009”) by Kwaku Agyemang and Justis Pit Goodson used slick colors and prints in effortlessly cool jackets of all kinds — letterman, bomber, and plaid — paired with on-trend fanny packs. From denim to sweatshirts and quarter-zips and pantsuits, this collection all had the slanted “Brownhill” logo that gave it a hip and modern vibe that I could easily see all over campus.
Jobert Sauray’s Preval collection had a similar aura, with contemporary sweatshirts and long-sleeve shirts and sweatshirt dresses in tan, red, blue, and green. With graphics and a loose fit on the models, Preval oozed comfort, color, and cool.
The last collection before the intermission, Fine Tragic Sorrow by Daryl Deon, was definitely the most choreographed of all the lines in the show, with models staying on stage in large, hooded black coats painted with images of a heart, dripping blood, lips, and the sun. Two of the models shed their coats to reveal matching red bodycon dresses, strutted around the runway and interacted with the other models. By the end, all the models took off their coats to reveal colorful designs of neon yellow, pink, orange, and blue, from solid shirts to jumpers and jackets.
Coming out of the intermission, Love Strong got the crowd going in applause with beautiful dresses in shiny and bright colors. Created by Rashida Thomas, the collection is simply described as “The Strong Sexy Woman,” and more than delivers, as all the models walked down with utmost confidence in pantsuits with open bellowing skirts and elevated styles of black and white and high-low skirts. One was a mermaid-style dress with sparkling silver fabric as the bottom skirt.
La Fuerza Clothing by Elisa Delgado was a burst of joy, featuring bright aqua, pink, and gold. The dresses, with ruffles and lace-up bodices, evoked a classic feel which was juxtaposed with the backs of the pieces. Delgado repurposed fabric from different experiences in her life and painted images on the backs to tell a story. From hands coming together and a fiery phoenix rising, this collection represented power, unity, and peace.
The first designs of 21% Opacity by Evangeline Mensah-Agyekum were in light colors, white, minimalist, and slick, accessorized with cool sunglasses and squeaky-clean sneakers. But the next pair of models evolved with a layered organza dress and sheer black tights, and an orange two-piece with shining sleeves and loose pants. From minimalist to complex, Mensah-Agyekum, in her words, shows “how I was, how I am, and how I hope to become.”
Sarika Bajaj’s Itihaas aimed to tell the stories of iconic Indian heroines through the collection. The models entered the runway in all-black garments with black coats on top, and the audience didn’t see the focus of the line until the models turned around. On the back of the coats were painted images of the Indian heroines, in bright colors against the black.
Partially inspired by artist Mary Corse, Mad Recital by Richard Ramirez and Sean E. Matzus was an ethereal collection of gauzy white fabrics put together to form uniquely complex designs. With cotton, tulle, lace, and chiffon, the white colors (with splashes of yellow and black) reminded me of Ancient Greece, with the gods in their draped and flowing togas.
In Fashion Not Fear, Kristie Glenn emphasizes the colors red and pink, with dresses in recognizable silhouettes in solid and floral print fabrics. At the start, the models wore red bedazzled masks that covered their whole face; this changed to half-face masks, mouth masks, and then headpieces, with the face uncovered. As the later pieces moved to more contemporary colors and streamlined designed, more personality shined through.
Obed Appiah-Agyeman describes KORDES: “A Dream” as “a dream I had about humanity.” All the models wore headdresses around their foreheads that had hanging pearl drops that fell near their eyes. With handbags and structured shirts and stiff scarves and fanny packs, the collection did conjure a dream-like quality with pastel colors and interesting combinations, all brought together by the shining headdresses.
Torn, by Catherine Mondoa, was understandably split into two sections. The first was the two designs of flowing chiffon, over the models’ heads like veils, as if showing a half-blind, unknowing and idealistic perspective on the world. The following two dresses were bold. Under a bright, sunshine yellow cape adorned with matching feathers was a black floor-length dress. The other dress, modeled by Mondoa herself, was royal blue, with a sweetheart neckline and the velvet corset divided by a sheer lace panel. The first two angel-like designs moved places throughout the presentation, acting almost like gatekeepers for the second two designs.
The final collection of the evening was Yaramo Dione’s Töranè Hôreh Mön Kadi. With the models barefoot, the designs had flowing sleeves, low necklines, high hems, and wide cutouts that showed openness and quiet simplicity. From a white shift dress to a pink floral dress to a maroon gown to dark blue satin pants, this line had a dream-like quality to it that was matched by the stoicism of the models.
With the theme Apollo, SPIRIT asked its designers of the 17 different lines to look within and consider themselves and express themselves through their work, through their art. In this way, the lines were deeply personal, moving towards the goal to say, “I know who I am.” In bringing people together to take part as a cast or audience member, the SPIRIT Fashion Show helped all who attended understand one another across backgrounds, cultures, and experiences.

Bands playing on a Tuesday night love to remind you that it's a Tuesday night. But I know it's a Tuesday night; I took a late day on my 15-150 homework to be here!
"Here" being the Mr. Roboto Project in Bloomfield, where Guerilla Toss, Rave Ami, and 1980 Special Twin were playing on, you guessed it, a Tuesday night. 
I had seen the flyer for the show around the neighborhood, and was excited to see the show for a band whose ear-splitting songs I thought would be pretty fun live. Guerilla Toss is currently based out of Brooklyn, so I had meant to go see them, like, ten times when I was home this summer, but I did not because I was pretty lazy back then. 
1980 Special Twin was the first opener. I thought I might miss him because I arrived nice and late, which I was bummed out about because I had googled him and was excited to see what a live violin show from Joey Molinaro, Pittsburgh Techno Guy, might look like. Luckily, he waited for me to start. His set was just him, with, as promised, a live violin, a Toca seed shaker strapped to his leg, and a nice board that was all mic'ed up to pick up his stomps. The board was truly very nice, and I wondered where he got it, and where I might acquire a similarly nice board. A hardware store? A music store? Construction Junction?
He sang, periodically through a headset reminiscent of one used by telemarketers or fast food workers that have to listen to the drive-through speakers. 
The next band, Rave Ami, which Molinaro introduced facetiously as a techno act, called themselves the 'boring' act on the ticket. One band member told the audience to get ready for some "dumb rock songs," and another member piped up in response, "they're really dumb." Self-effacement aside, they were pretty good, and it was nice to see that they weren't taking themselves too seriously, especially in a genre that can quite often be kind of dumb. 
Finally, Guerilla Toss made their way onto the stage, which became cramped with their drummer, bassist, guitarist, vocalist/violinist, lights guy, as well as lots and lots of gear. Though their newest album, Twisted Crystal, came out fairly recently towards the end of 2018, they played a mix of their more recent crowd-pleasers. This ended up being a little confusing, as in the song "Realistic Rabbit" off the 2015 EP, Flood Dosed, vocalist Kassie Carlson asks the audience: "Calculator! What does it equal?", while "Multibeast TV" from the 2016 album, Eraser Stargazer, explicitly tells us: "Do not calculate, plus OR minus." Either way, I was pretty glad I didn't do my 15-150 homework because I bet they would not have approved.
For a group I had thought of as more of an experimental noise/disco group, the influence of the Grateful Dead is stronger than one might expect. The only adornment on the keyboard player's stand was a Grateful Dead "stealie" sticker. The lights guy had a baggy, tie-dye, Jerry Garcia Band shirt on. And when they jammed in between songs mid-set, the spacey freedom of jams like live 1972 "Dark Star" were channeled (Grateful Dead takes powered by my fellow concert-goer).
There was one moment when Carlson picked up her violin, which had, in previous instances of their set, been drowned out in the mix as she messed with the various knobs and pedals that made the violin sound like an otherworldly replacement for her voice. But this time, the sound ripped from the speakers in an accidental distorted roar that was building before it was cut off by another frantic button smash. While that abrupt cut off was much appreciated by my young and tender growing ears, my friend, as we were waiting for our ride back, noted the same thing that I had thought when I first felt the screechy build of the accidentally distorted violin: that it probably would have sounded cool and on purpose had they let it come to its ragged, likely ear-splitting finish. 
They closed with a shout out to how nice playing shows in Pittsburgh is, which might be something they say everywhere, but I am choosing to believe is true because it was a really nice show and I hope they come back.

Singer-songwriter Christian French was an accidental find for me. While shuffling through Spotify's recommendations for my monthly favorite playlists, his song "love ride" was suggested. Immediately, I was hooked by the poppy synths, feel-good vibes, and French's smooth voice. It wasn't until I found out that he was opening for Quinn XCII and I heard him live when I fell in love with his music. Out of sheer curiosity, I sent him an Instagram private message asking if he was willing to do an interview. Not even a day later, he replied.
French started off on SoundCloud "doing piano/singing covers...that I had learned to play from YouTube" back in high school. Although his original SoundCloud account appears to have been terminated, his music career has not. He used the skills he crafted from covers to write original music. Since then, he has "stuck with it" and now has amassed 1.9 million monthly listeners on Spotify.
Until recently, French had been juggling school and music. Music had mainly been a side thing that skyrocketed on Spotify, but he had previously dedicated two years on premed at Indiana University. However, when singer-songwriter Chelsea Cutler asked French to tour with her in 2018, French took the leap to drop out to pursue music. "I can always go back & finish school, but I can't always go on tour & pursue my music career. I would do it again a million times." 
Currently, he is on tour with Quinn XCII and even got to kick off his birthday with his first crowd surf. Although "being on the road for so long takes a toll" on him, the joy he gets out of meeting fans he connected with through social media and pursuing a career that might have appeared to be a pipe dream even a year ago makes it more than worth it to him. I can't speak for his other performances, but he was fantastic in Nashville. The crowd didn't know all the lyrics to his songs, but the crowd was still rallied up. Even for "heavy snow," which had not been released at the time of the performance, the synergy continued.
Although French's music may sound generic based on a mere description (how many pop singers and synth tracks are there?), there's a unique element infused in it that I can't quite put my finger on. Music is a way for him to connect with people and express himself, which makes him and his music come off as relatable. He makes performing and singing appear to be so effortless and natural. His beats are energizing and bound to lift anyone's spirits, and this is only amplified live. In his Nashville performance, he casually wore a flannel shirt and could probably have blended in with the concert crowd if he weren't on stage. When he talked, it didn't matter what he said. It could've been about how happy he was to be in the music city or how his life turned when he dropped out to pursue music. Even if we didn't necessarily go through his story ourselves, he brought it to us and related to us. He didn't feel like some remote idol who just says that he gets his crowd; he really does.
Although most of his tracks are much more uplifting, the kinds of songs you'd play on a road trip with friends, his most recent release is a bit more somber. "heavy snow" describes his long-term struggle with anxiety and a time period in which it was hard for him to even turn to music. "It's the worst thing in the world," he recalls about his overall struggles. In a tweet, he described his experience as "a fog between reality and what was going on inside my head." Although "heavy snow" was cathartic for him, he wanted the song to be "another outlet to show people that they aren't alone." Like the artist he opened for, Quinn XCII, French also wants to use his art to help expand the talk of mental health and encourage people to "be more conscious of their states of mind and be able to better control how they are feeling."
For those getting into his music, my top five picks would have to be "By Myself," "heavy snow," "love ride," "Fall for You," and "someone new." Although he hasn't come to Pittsburgh yet, he liked my message where I requested him to stop by, so I hope that's a sign he'll keep us in consideration.

So I wanted to write about Cardi B but I also really wanted to write about the new Joker trailer and Jussie Smollett. So instead of doing these as separate articles, I figured I’d throw them into one single pop culture roundup. 
Cardi B and her controversy
There was an interesting tweet from a fan who told Cardi B that she was a role model for young girls out there. Cardi B replied back that she has hasn’t been herself the past two years because of this and that she will go back to her authentic self since people like to throw her past back in her face. This comes soon after an old video of her saying she used to drug and rob men resurfaced. My immediate reaction was, “Who even thinks that Cardi B is a role model?” But I digress. 
On the subject of Cardi B’s alleged crimes, I think that at the end of the day, she should face the backlash of her actions and she should have done a better job of owning it. It’s a bit much to compare her to R. Kelly or Bill Cosby since those were men in power abusing said power, whereas Cardi B was a desperate woman trying to get by. But at the end of the day, an admission to a crime like that shouldn’t be defended. As for whether her career should end, there isn’t much merit to that argument. She has built herself up since then whether you like her music or not (I certainly don’t) and it should be up to the public whether they want to accept or reject her following these revelations about her past, which they haven't seem to have rejected her overall. 
I also think it’s interesting that celebrities are held up as role models when they absolutely shouldn’t be. They should behave like good members of society like everyone else and be expected to not take advantage of their status. But the notion that we should hold them to a higher standard for the sake of our children is pure nonsense and bad parenting too. Idolatry does not equate to role modeling, and we seem to live in a world where the two are now closely associated. These celebrities are not making the important decisions for our society. They’re entertainers and shouldn’t be expected to have to watch their words just because our kids’ feeble minds will be at risk. It’s on parents to help their kids distinguish right from wrong, not Cardi B’s. If anything, her attitude in her music should inherently disqualify her from even being a role model. 
The new Joker
DC surprised everyone with a trailer for a new grounded and gritty origin story of Batman’s most iconic villain, who is now being played by Joaquin Phoenix. There is a lot to unpack from this new footage, but the first thing everyone noticed about it is how good it looks, both visually and in terms of quality. The film is being made by the same guy who made the Hangover movies and if the film is as good as this trailer, then he really has found his calling making dark, gritty movies. 
The film doesn’t look like a comic-book movie at all. It looks like a psychological character drama/thriller with elements of horror. The film’s plot synopsis on IMDb is “a failed stand-up comedian is driven insane and becomes a psychopathic murderer,” which shows just how different the film is going to be in comparison to the usual superhero genre fare. The trailer was just as unsettling as the plot synopsis, with some very memorable shots of Phoenix’s Joker in full makeup. 
The most interesting angle the trailer showed was how society can create a villain like the Joker. This Joker is a man with a name: Arthur Fleck. He is shown to have mental illness and cast aside by society. This is shown in a chilling shot where he is writing jokes in his notebook, and one of the jokes says “the worst part about having mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t.” He is gaunt. He is constantly beaten down, both figuratively and literally. The film prompts you to ask how a man like that wouldn’t snap one day. It’s an interesting take, and after watching this trailer several times, I’m on board to watch this film the day it comes out in October. 
Jussie Smollett Protests
The curious case of Jussie Smollett continues with the prosecutor Kim Foxx having to defend dropping all hoax charges against Smollett. Smollett was charged with staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in order to further his career. Protests outside Foxx's office continued for the week as well as counter-protests from her supporters. It is unlikely the controversy surrounding the case will go away anytime soon as the Smollett case has now turned into a sort of proxy battle between the police union and the prosecutor’s department. Smollett will also likely be sued by the city since he failed to pay a fine of over $130,000. 
First, I will address Smollett himself. I think that the case is complicated but in the end, I don’t think it’s really fair to pass judgment on him because nothing is clear anymore. His career has likely taken a huge hit, but he’ll find some work later and push his way past this controversy within a few years. Any press is good press, and the entertainment industry loves a good comeback story for someone with a controversial past (see Mel Gibson). The only thing we can do is see if anything else develops from the story. Smollett got the attention he wanted at the end of it all, so in the long run, he’ll be the real winner from all of this. 
The decision to drop charges is difficult to understand and no one really knows why it happened. The prosecutors said they could prove the hoax charges against him too, despite Smollett maintaining that he didn’t lie. It’s likely nothing sinister, but the entire case is just odd. At this point, the Chicago Police should spend their time on something better than waging a war against the prosecutor’s department over a bizarre case that no one understands. Smollett’s case will be a footnote eventually and in the future, it’s likely many people won’t care too much about what he has allegedly done.

This week, McConomy will be screening two films during carnival: Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse and Mary Poppins Returns. Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse was reviewed in a previous issue. 
Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse is one of the best animated films in recent memory, the best film associated with Spider-Man, and one of the very best films of last year. It’s funny, creative, action-packed, filled with humor and heart, and has a killer score and soundtrack apart from two odd musical choices. The animation is unique and fresh, with every frame looking like an insane comic book. The voice acting is superb from everyone. There is almost nothing wrong with this film. It’s a work of art, and it completely deserved the Oscar win it got. It’s a movie made for everyone, and I can’t think of a single demographic who wouldn’t enjoy this movie because it’s packed with so much detail and love. See it as many times as you can.
Mary Poppins Returns continues the story of the Banks children. George Banks is now a widower, and his sister Jane helps him tend to his three children. Due to George’s grieving and lack of financial skills, he finds himself in a position of potentially losing his childhood home: the one in which Mary Poppins had visited him and his sister when they were younger. Mary Poppins finds herself in a perfect opportunity to be the nanny of the Banks children, or rather, a new generation of Banks children. Through imaginative tales, music, and storybook adventures, the film is enjoyable to both those who have and have not grown up watching Mary Poppins. Come not only for a cinematic treat, but also to support a Carnegie Mellon alum, Rob Marshall (College of Fine Arts, Class of 1982).

Last week, next year’s student government was decided by the Carnegie Mellon student body. Voting began at 8 p.m. on Friday, March 29, and closed last Monday at 6 p.m., using an online single transferable voting system, sometimes known as a ranked-choice voting system. It was the second year of the use of this system, which student government chief technical officer Marat Valiev, a third year Ph.D. student in societal computing, stated would avoid “wasting your vote” when deciding between candidates, channeling the systems “successful in the Netherlands.” Valiev shared the elections results with The Tartan, which are to be published in full shortly on the student government website. Below is a report of those who won and the platforms by which they were elected.
Student Body President and Vice President
Evan Feder, a sophomore in information systems and statistics and machine learning, has been elected Student Body President. His running mate, Wenyi Zhu, a sophomore in business administration, has been elected Vice President. Between them they have three years of experience in student government, which they have said is essential to managing the influence of these positions. Feder served for the past year as Student Body Vice President for Finance, and before that as the Vice Chair of the Joint Funding Committee.
Before student body elections, Feder told The Tartan that the unique responsibility of the SBP is the ability to “choose your priorities.” One of Feder and Zhu’s primary goals is to improve communication between students and the student government. Zhu has said that while student government is meant to be “bridge between the student body and administration,” students often don’t know where to go to bring problems. Feder explained that when students are unable to find channels to express their issues, problems that student government may be able to address persist, and just become “memes in the meme group.”
Feder and Zhu’s platform also includes a range of quality of life issues. Feder and Zhu plan to partner with food vendors around campus to accept DineX, increase access to study spaces, and improve toilet paper on campus.
Their third major goal is to increase interdisciplinary communication. They have said that though Carnegie Mellon emphasizes interdisciplinary learning, it can be hard for students to explore topics or access resources in other colleges, including helping graduate students navigate working in different colleges and undergraduate students access restricted spaces.
Feder and Zhu received a total of 385 “first choice” votes. Runner-ups Asher Silverglade and Qianyi Chen, who began their campaign with a promise to “shut down all the other colleges except Tepper and undecided” before announcing an earnest candidacy centered on combatting a harmful sleep culture and reducing “favoritism” in the treatment of different colleges, at the start of the debate, trailed Feder and Zhu by just 41 “first choice” votes.
Student Body Vice President of Organizations
Elizabeth Guo, a first-year economics major, has been elected Student Body Vice President of Organizations (SBVPO). The role of the SBVPO is to oversee, advocate for, and advise student organizations. The SBVPO also serves as the chair on the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO), which is responsible for overseeing the recognition process for student organizations on campus.
Guo’s primary goal is to ensure that students don’t shy away from developing their ideas for organizations due to the time and effort required, or lack of resources. As someone who is “extremely passionate about participating in multiple activities, [she] would love to assist others in actualizing their ideas through the SBVPO position.”
Guo is also seeking to provide new perspectives within CoSO, expedite the process of recognizing student organizations, and increase the lines of communication between student organizations and CoSO.
As SBVPO, she wants to fulfill her responsibility to the campus by remaining open and available as much as she can be, and to “fully devote her time and best ability to offer advice to others.”
Student Body Vice President for Finance
Frank Fan, a junior majoring in computer science, has been elected Student Body Vice President for Finance. Though he ran unopposed, Fan has some significant plans for reform. Most notably, Fan has proposed paying returning members of the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) in order to incentivize those who have experience in allocating money to continue to work with organizations year after year. This would dedicate a yet untold sum of activities fee funding towards funding of the JFC itself as an internal payment. The JFC is in charge of allocating the more than $1.5 million collected by the student activities fee.
Fan has raised that past SBVPFs have attempted to “reinvent the wheel” once they take office, and created “no continuity” or incentive to return to the job. Though continuity might not be seen as a traditionally inspiring campaign promise, most candidates highlighted the difficulties navigating the vast, multi-chambered bureaucracy of student government.
Fan has also proposed establishing principles for different categories of organizations to treat them more fairly and consistently. This plan entails more in-depth auditing of how organizations spend this money. Fan cited the Activities Board specifically as a body that could use more scrutiny, since AB groups get up to 30 percent of activities fee funding. Fan is the Finance Chair of AB Tech, which is an AB organization that receives a lot of the funding.
Fan also wants to apply more quantitative measures to the duties of the SBVPF, aiming to meet a quota for meetings with student organizations held each semester instead of just holding open office hours.
Undergraduate Senators
The College of Engineering has 12 seats on the undergraduate senate, but following the election, two vacancies still remain. The winning 10 candidates for College of Engineering senate seats are Ethan Rich, sophomore in electrical and computer engineering; Aditi Raghavan, first-year in material sciences and engineering; David Cohen, first-year in mechanical engineering and engineering & public policy; Alexandra Poltorak, first-year in mechanical engineering; Likhitha Chintareddy, first-year in electrical and computer engineering; Ruben Sriskanda, first-year in chemical engineering and engineering & public policy; Adrian Kager, first-year in electrical and computer engineering; Manav Trivedi, sophomore in electrical and computer engineering; Shraiy Gupta, sophomore in chemical engineering and biomedical engineering; and Andrew Osborn, first-year in mechanical engineering.
In Dietrich College, the new representatives are Jeffrey Ko, sophomore in the Institute for Politics and Strategy and modern languages; Colby Yu, sophomore; Abigail Glaser, first-year; Priya Agarwal, first-year; Dennis Lo, first-year in Dietrich interdisciplinary studies; and Kayla Griffin, sophomore in the Institute for Politics and Strategy and philosophy. Three vacancies still exist.
All six Mellon College of Science senate seats have been filled by Juliette Wong, sophomore in mathematical sciences; Manushka Bonhomme, sophomore in biological sciences; Kendra Adegbesan, sophomore in biological sciences and English; Naren Karur, first-year in mathematical sciences; Sandra Ho, first-year in biological sciences; and Joseph Glanzberg, sophomore in biological sciences.
The School of Computer Science’s five seats are filled by Gabriel Philip Rasskin, first-year in School of Computer Science; Oliver Pennington, first-year in School of Computer Science; Emmanuel Eppinger, sophomore in computer science; Neha Sridhar, sophomore in computer science; and Arnav Mahajan, sophomore in computer science.
The two BXA seats are held now by Liam Edward O’Connell, first-year in humanities and arts studies, and Theodore C. Warner, a sophomore in the Science and Humanities Scholars program.
One open seat remains for Tepper School of Business senate representation, but the three who won last week are Navid Mamoon, first-year in business administration; Shiwani Pathak, sophomore in business administration; and Uma Kommineni, first-year in business administration.
The College of Fine Arts too remains unfilled, with two vacant seats, but the four who won are Ye Lim Kim, first-year in art; Lucy Altus, first-year in music; Christopher Calder, senior in drama; and Emma Reichard, senior in drama.
Chief technology officer Valiev raised a curious example of the power of writing in candidates: Juliette Wong, now senator representing the Mellon College of Science, as well as Christopher Calder and Emma Reichard, both representing the College of Fine Arts, won with just one single write-in vote.
The vacancies that still exist in the undergraduate senate can be filled “by completing a petition with at least 25 signatures from Activities Fee paying undergraduate members of your college” to create a special runoff election, according to an undergraduate senate form. The Tartan will continue to report on the filling of undergraduate senate seats and actions taken by the student government in upcoming issues.
Likhitha Chintareddy also holds the position of Online Editor at The Tartan.

This past Saturday, the 32nd annual SPIRIT Fashion Show filled Wiegand Gymnasium with a multimedia showcase of fashion, dance, music, and visual art. The show was held in Wiegand for the first time, allowing for a larger crowd than past SPIRIT Fashion Show events. Even with the bigger venue, the event sold out of general admission tickets days before the show.
More than an hour before showtime, lines formed from the gymnasium doors to the fences by the University Center parking lot. When the doors opened at 7:15 p.m., the well-lit Wiegand floor was slowly filled in by attendees: friends chatting and greeting each other in the sold-out general admissions sections and family members and friends filling in the front VIP rows holding flowers.
The theme of the show this year was “Apollo,” which show posters said would “take you on a journey of introspection — the internal journey of discovering our own inner light and rectifying our flaws to approach a liberating sense of self-realization.” As the show began, a voice went over the loudspeaker: “Apollo, guide me to the light.”
On the U-shaped stage, looks varied as much as the acts themselves: in addition to traditional fashion lines, dance acts, and musicians, combinations of all these mediums shared the stage.
In the first line, Keegan Barone’s Headswing, athletic motifs were prevalent, such as Nike cleats being fashioned into heels. Arthur Brown’s Faster than Light showed the creative allowances designers were granted: behind the models, video projections accompanied a futuristic line where lab coats and scientific themes met modern streetwear.
Later in the show, Kwaku Agyemang and Justis Pitt Goodson’s Brownmill showcased a collection of ready-to-wear clothing that channeled thrifted East-coast prep wear. The closing line, Torn, showcased sheer and ethereal looks by Catherine Mondoa, who both designed the line and modeled for it.
Each line was met with applause and support, as the show was no quiet affair.
The creative freedom of designers was observable in both the use of designer-specific projections and in the difference in presentations: some lines incorporated choreography, while some just walked outright. As creative lead and model Matthew Henderson told The Tartan, “SPIRIT, in comparison to [Lunar Gala], is a little more open-ended.”
Henderson, who did web design for this year’s show in addition to ticketing and modeling, expressed excitement in the shift to being hosted in Wiegand Gymnasium, saying that “more people would be able to go to the show” this year. That said, he mentioned that “the logistics of getting access to the space [were] a lot harder.”
Between lines, various artistic acts took the stage. Emily Wu performed an original song after the first three lines. Sabrina Clarke danced solo later in the show, and Spirit Dance filled the entire U-shaped stage with a large group dance. Malcolm Odeozor and friends provided a two-track selection of smiley hip-hop, which was met enthusiastically by the crowd.
At intermission, Andrew Conlon, a sophomore in computer science, noted that the show this year was “pretty well choreographed.” He added that, “they did it in Rangos Ballroom last year, and the stage was different, it definitely seems like an upgrade [this year], probably a budget boost.” Leroy Gary, a fifth year studying electrical and computer engineering, added that this year, “they were definitely well publicized.”
SPIRIT Fashion show is funded by Apprio, Inc., University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Carnegie Mellon Student Affairs, Hughie’s Event Production Services, PNC Bank, and various Carnegie Mellon colleges, in addition to ticket sales.
After the show concluded at 10:30 p.m., Executive Director Mecca Parker addressed the crowd, saying, “there were times where it was so disparaging… but we made it, we did.” Thanking Tiara Wicks, Logistics Director, who introduced him, Parker added thanks to donors, designers, production crew, and to SPIRIT as a whole, saying, “it takes so many people to get to where we are right now.”
Parker continued that SPIRIT Fashion Show is meant to be an outlet for “multicultural people to share their designs, their art, their emotions, their personalities, their stories.” This year, as he was presented several bottles of “very expensive” champagne by executive board members, Parker said the turnout and work was “inspiring.” “I love all of you guys,” he concluded in his address.

Over the past six decades, the Carnegie Mellon-based Simon Initiative has been researching student learning outcomes, working to improve online learning tools and optimize education systems and processes. After over $100 million worth of research, the Simon Initiative is picking up press coverage on their “learning-engineering” ecosystem.
With multiple grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a National Science Foundation grant partnership between Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and MIT, and a separate project with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, it seems that the Simon Initiative isn’t alone in its belief that it can revolutionize learning.
Norman Bier, the Carnegie Mellon Open Learning Initiative (OLI) director and executive director of the Simon Initiative, discussed the progress, process, implications, and exigence of the Simon Initiative’s online learning tools with The Tartan.
“We’re talking about a learning-engineering approach, the idea of understanding and exploring learning. We need to accept that this is something happening inside of the brain; we need to build models of what we think is happening inside the brain and connect our models with what we can observe in optimizing teaching,” Bier explained.
Innovations of the Simon Initiative toolkit include, but are not limited to, online cognitive tutors, modules, project-based learning tools, virtual labs, and familiar OLI platform creations like C@CM and Autolab.
And while the Simon Initiative is based at Carnegie Mellon, its greater purpose is to revolutionize and optimize all educational institutions, with the goal of extending its online infrastructure to K-12 schools. Although the project has only recently started to gain acknowledgment for its post-secondary initiatives, Bier noted that the Simon Initiative can now significantly expand and extend thanks to contributions from several partners, donors, and researchers over the past decades.
So where exactly did the Simon Initiative start? Bier noted that the initiative’s namesake, Herbert Simon, was the founding father of several Carnegie Mellon research domains spanning Tepper, SCS, and Dietrich.
In 1967, Simon coined the phrase “learning-engineering,” introducing the Simon Initiative approach that embeds a research-based and design-based thinking approach, improving organizational and research structures as well as educational work.
“We need to think of this research as the Simon Initiative,” Bier emphasized. Bier also spoke about a “hodgepodge of work” among Carnegie Mellon faculty and all of the project’s partners: “The Simon Initiative wants to think about effectiveness and crosses interdisciplinary boundaries and invites lots of faculty to do things like teach modern languages, use technology to better teach statistics, and reach out to the engineering college behind OLI courses.”
Unique to Carnegie Mellon and the Simon Initiative is its goal to “democratize the science of learning.” “Combined with our technical infrastructure, we have social-technical support not seen in other institutions, but we hope that this approach gets replicated in a much larger community,” Bier noted.
He continued, “lesson application tends to be the province of researchers and not always educators. The Simon Initiative is trying to encourage all faculty to treat their classrooms like a learning laboratory, and this will become the work of every educator out there. We need to provide a larger population of educators and practitioners with the right kinds of tools and approaches and content so that research can be applied and engaged with.”
Behind the scenes, the Simon Initiative is also tackling a massive issue: the prospective collapse of education institutions. Bier claimed, “we’re at a really special and challenging moment in the post-WWII post-secondary educational system in the United States.”
According to Bier, states have been losing interest in post-secondary education, and the federal government has not picked up the lost funding. Changing tuition structures and increasing student debt, as well as the broader, more diverse populations of students seeking post-secondary degrees, has put different strains on an educational system that was not designed for this much participation.
“Four-year degrees or any amount of set education might not be enough to keep up with economic pressures and changing technologies and skillsets we’re seeing in the workforce. We need to think seriously about the role post-secondary education plays in the United States,” Bier said.
Despite its continued progress, Bier believes that outsiders tend to look at the Simon Initiative as a simple open-sourcing project. He also emphasized, “too often, we see big stories purporting that there are silver bullets that will transform education. Our toolkit intends to spur a larger cycle of innovation, investigation, and improvement, and no one step is going to represent a silver bullet that is transformation.”
Next to be released by the Simon Initiative is the LearnSphere tool, a product of their National Science Foundation partnership that optimizes data analysis by encapsulating educational workflows such that any LearnSphere user can apply shared learning methods. Within the next 12 months, Carnegie Mellon will begin to distribute a huge portion of these Simon Initiative learning tools.

This is an urgent call to all undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon University! The Student Senate needs your help! We have been working diligently this past year to help the student body enjoy their time here on campus. And now, we need your input. We will be distributing a survey to see how students feel about their experiences on campus with regards to academics, campus experiences, housing, and much more. Here is just a small overview of what some of the committees hope to learn from your input:  
The Campus Life Committee’s major initiative is investigating the upperclassman experience. We all remember Orientation Week and how amazing that was, but what about juniors and seniors? Are they enjoying their time here at Carnegie Mellon? Or is more we could be doing to help them?  
The Academic Affairs Committee wants your feedback on how you feel about the resources offered to you when navigating through your degree(s) here at Carnegie Mellon. Are you meeting with your advisors, and are those meetings productive? Do you use Stellic, Handshake, or the CPDC to help with your career and degree planning?
There is so much here on campus that is changing, and we need your input. This survey is a real opportunity to make an impact on the issue that the Senate tackles next. We are looking for your input, as our constituents, to alert us to issues on campus that are hindering your experience here at Carnegie Mellon. Go to our Facebook and fill out the survey. Who knows, you may also be the lucky winners of a brand new Fitbit, an incentive for participation.

The United Nations projects that by 2050, 68 percent of the world will live in urban areas. These future cities will face challenges that we are only beginning to see today, from climate change disasters to the strain of higher populations. 
To face these challenges, most major cities are adapting “smart cities” technology, which is designed to collect data on how to make public spaces more liveable and accessible, outsourcing some of the hard work of managing human flow to make more efficient use of public resources. 
Pittsburgh has often been at the center of these discussions. Pittsburgh applied for the 2015-2016 Smart City Challenge set by the Department of Transportation. Though the $40 million dollar grant ultimately went to Columbus, Ohio, Pittsburgh was selected to be part of the Smart Cities Collective, a group of 22 midsize cities looking to improve implementation of technology in city infrastructure while avoiding what director of the collective, Russell Brooks, called in WESA “the shiny object syndrome” where cities look to scoop up new technologies and brand partnerships without thinking about the repercussions or other potential areas for investment. 
Carnegie Mellon has been at the center of Pittsburgh’s discussions around how to develop and implement this tech. The Metro21 initiative was elevated last May to become the Metro21 Smart Cities Institute. Metro21 has worked with air sensors, traffic lights, and cameras, even collaborating with a lab in the Pittsburgh International Airport to develop projects, often in partnership with the city or county.
The institute has successfully implemented many projects throughout the city. The Tartan has written about Metro21’s grant to document light pollution in Pittsburgh. 
Pittsburgh’s vision narrative for the Smart City Challenge cited the existence of Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh as a reason that the city accelerated the implementation of smart city technology. The proposal stated: “Carnegie Mellon has led the charge internationally in applying forward-thinking technologies to real-world urban environments, including the much-praised Traffic21, Remaking Cities Institute, and Metro21, which served as the inspiration for the White House's new, national MetroLab Network.”
Though there have been many successes, and improving city infrastructure and habitability is a noble goal, there are essential considerations that those working to develop smart city technology should consider. For instance, privacy concerns over the introduction of Internet of Things devices into the home do not disappear when these devices inhabit public space. 
Take, for example, the Smart Neighborhood Project, developed by Sidewalk Labs. It gained press attention after its director of privacy, Ann Cavoukian, resigned due to concerns that the data collected would not be deidentified. 
Furthermore, it is important to ensure that smart cities make the city better for all inhabitants. This will not be true if developments that truly improve the lives of residents are centered in wealthier areas, or neglect residents whose disabilities might render public spaces harder to access. An article in the MIT Technology Review pointed out that the replacement of workers like “cashiers and receptionists” makes it harder for those who have trouble using a touch screen to complete necessary everyday tasks such as riding the subway or getting directions. 
For instance, New York City has recently implemented LinkNYC kiosks, that offer WiFi and charging stations at various locations around the city. The move garnered criticism from some, as the stations became places to hang out and surf the internet for the homeless or for those who may not otherwise have other locations to charge their phones. This led to the banning of accessing adult content over LinkNYC WiFi and discussion about removing charging ports from the kiosks. 
This immediate backlash against use of the kiosks by homeless people is indicative of the broader problem: who are smart city developments meant to serve? What is wrong with people using the resources available to the public, when they might be the ones who are in dire need of them? Why are people comfortable with public charging ports and WiFi when the users are young urban professionals who just don’t want to be guilted into buying a drink at the nearest Starbucks, but not comfortable when those who want to surf the internet at the shiny kiosks are homeless?
Smart cities initiatives also often include modernization of policing, which has manifested in the use of artificial intelligence to create predictive algorithms informing where policing should occur. This ‘predictive policing’ has been criticized as perpetuating past police biases; as the algorithms are trained on past policing and past arrests, any previous bias in policing is thus reinforced when an artificial intelligence algorithm tells police which neighborhoods or blocks to hang out at. 
Last year, The Tartan reported a Metro21 smart cities initiative that was cited as justification for implementing predictive policing in Pittsburgh. The work cited by Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto was a fire prediction algorithm created by Michael Madaio, a Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, which was remarkably accurate predicting where fires would occur and which buildings and locations held the most risk of fire. 
Mayor Peduto was so impressed with the algorithm’s success that it inspired a meeting with Carnegie Mellon researchers to discuss using similar algorithms to aid in policing, which led to the implementation of predictive policing in Pittsburgh. 
But Madaio, whose work inspired this police modernization effort, told The Tartan that he had “serious misgivings about the ethical risks of using predictive policing algorithms.” The algorithm currently used by Pittsburgh police is shrouded in secrecy; it prevents third-party analysis and accountability, whereas the fire-prevention tool is completely open-source.
Though both efforts were initiatives to modernize cities, and both came from the same research department at Carnegie Mellon, tools like the fire-prevention algorithm and the neural-network being used by the Pittsburgh police create completely different outcomes and are clearly disparate in their openness and accountability. 
Smart cities initiatives run the risk of being akin to the bright murals painted in a city’s least fortunate neighborhood: an attempt at betterment without addressing the fundamental and systematic causes of injustice in today’s cities. Without proper ethical considerations, they could even be destructive.

While many officials in the Trump administration are mired in controversies or legal battles, there are few as publicly disliked as the sitting U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. She has been credited with such infamously bad ideas as proposing to cut federal funding for the Special Olympics and, acting at the behest of the Trump administration, suggesting potential cuts to after school programs, literacy education, and community schools, which would reverse hard-won progress and improvements.
Now, DeVos is coming under fire for her approach to an issue of utmost importance and sensitivity: campus sexual assault. DeVos’s highly controversial plan to overhaul Title IX regulations, which has already gained over 105,000 public comments, not only makes it more difficult to hold schools liable in incidences of sexual assault, but bolsters the rights of the accused, such as allowing the legal representative of the accused to cross-examine the victim in school disciplinary hearings.
Victims’ rights advocates and Democrats alike have lambasted the proposed changes, claiming that it would be a regression from the equity that previous policies have been working towards for decades, making it easier for accusers to shirk responsibility for their actions, and further perpetuating the stigma surrounding the reporting of sexual violence. As if the current norm of silence is not bad enough.
DeVos has justified her proposed regulations by claiming that no student should have their education derailed, even the accused, and that there should be a greater sense of balance between the parties in a process that deals with such serious offenses. Superficially, her intentions are somewhat understandable; the current system for handling sexual assault on campuses does tend to lean in favor of the victim, and it is true that false accusations do occur. That being said, false reports are rare and at most only a fraction of the total number of reports—falling somewhere between two and ten percent. While favoritism rather than dispassionate analysis is wrong in cases of sexual assault, it should be kept in mind that the system often sides with the victim because it takes incredible courage and resolve to come forward and file a report in the first place.
DeVos’s policies, considered in a vacuum, are the wrong approach towards fixing the problem of sexual assault. While it may seem as an attempt to balance the system, the regulations will only worsen the problem; empowering the accused, when there are already so many systemic obstacles for victims of sexual assault to get justice, would only dilute the heinousness of such offenses and sends the dangerous message that coming forward and testifying is not worth it.
From a big-picture perspective, however, DeVos’s proposal is slightly justified. It is undeniable that false reports are a problem on campus, and they must be resolved because even a few bad cases can, as we see in people’s misguided views, lead to the inflation of the problem of false accusations. There must be greater discrimination between those who abuse the system for their own personal gain and those who have a genuine case so that resources are properly devoted.
But this raises the question: how do we stop false accusations and maintain the integrity of the system without upsetting the balance between the accuser and the accused?
One important step is the normalization of reporting cases of sexual assault. Victims on their own, following the trauma of sexual assault, often do not come forward because our society is one that implicitly promotes silence, a norm that extends onto our campuses and institutions of higher education. Rather than providing a quick fix for the issue at a surface level, efforts should be channeled towards resolving the root of the issue by creating initiatives that further encourage victims to come forward, which will lead to investigations and due diligence. Once school-lead investigations into reported cases of sexual assault become a common occurrence rather than the occasional exercise, the system itself will naturally strengthen with use, becoming more adept at delivering the justice that victims deserve without giving the impression of depriving the accused of their rights.
Only when this is accomplished should we consider empowering the accused in the way that DeVos proposes, but not before. To do so would be taking a major step back and further entrenching damaging social norms. Hopefully, the public outcry over this proposal will ultimately prevent such changes from coming to pass, helping us continue to move forward towards greater equity and accountability.

Two events in the past year have highlighted the extent to which Carnegie Mellon has become a corporate entity, not a place for higher education. The first is the push by University of Pittsburgh graduate employees to have their union recognized by the state, and the second is Emma Flickinger’s op-ed last semester on the sorry state of undergraduate humanities education at Carnegie Mellon. 
On April 15, the Pitt Graduate Student Union is holding a vote of graduate employees to find out if they will be fully recognized by the state. Pitt isn’t the first university where graduate employees seek to unionize, but grad unions are a relatively recent development, starting sometime in the early ’90s. It was around then that universities started moving toward increased profitability. Professors started teaching less, their salaries stagnant, while graduate students started teaching more, their wages staying low. Adjunct professors now make up the largest proportion of the teaching population, and their wages are often only between $20,000 and $25,000 a year.
The obvious goals of the graduate employee union are to boost grad student wages as teachers and to create a better functioning university system. As undergraduates, our education is denied its full potential because professors that don’t have a terminal degree are teaching classes. Not to mention, the professors may not be doing active research in the field they’re teaching. Graduate students may be doing research on a very specific thesis on the relationship between a species of frog in Costa Rica and its local ecosystem, while teaching an intro to biology class that spends only part of the semester on macrobiology.
This is less of an obvious issue at Carnegie Mellon because of the “liberal arts” modifier, that suggests we pay our adjuncts more while keeping a smaller number in our faculty. But this is a systemic issue that lowers the quality of higher education across the board. 
The other event was Flickinger’s op-ed last semester in The Tartan. In it, she writes, “Only when history, English, and modern languages are associated with statistics, psychology, engineering, [and] computer science are they good enough. It goes without saying that the reverse is totally unimaginable.” When Forbes listed the lowest average starting salaries by degree, English, history, and psychology occupied the bottom of the list. But if psychology, one of “the most science-y of all,” is towards the bottom, then surely the university doesn’t solely care about monetization of its product, right? Well, yes and no.
As Flickinger notes, the one thing psychology has that the other fields don’t is a connection to science, leading to empirical, or even just logical, information that can be disseminated more easily than an abstract concept.
Again, this is less of an issue at Carnegie Mellon because of the liberal arts modifier, as many disciplines teach the theory of the study, but it is systemic and affects every student’s education. For example, an undergraduate course of study in English often stops at the hip theories of the day. Right now, it may be narrative theory or critical race theory, but then the education takes on traits of popular culture when education is designed to question the popular. So what is popular right now?
Recently, Dietrich (and Carnegie Mellon) has fallen in love with “interdisciplinarity.” Interdisciplinarity is ultimately a meaningless buzzword that suggests a meaningful difference between someone who specialized in literature and someone who specialized in mathematics. Specialization promotes professionalization, which in turn promotes higher wages and more stable working hours. If you specialize in something, you create value in your work, but it requires practice and hard work. And by working “interdisciplinary,” you become an enterprising young person that appears as a critical thinker across fields. But in reality, you are sacrificing a chance at the professionalization of your craft to become the next hit thing in casual labor. Interdisciplinarity means you can teach Intro to Biology while researching a species of frog in the Costa Rican rainforest, to the wonderful tune of $20,000 a year.
An interdisciplinary workforce leads to a flat workforce, offering opportunities only for the already rich and powerful to maintain their wealth. In the end, investmentments in fields like psychology solely because of their objective and empirical basis, and not for immediate alumni monetization, becomes another way for Carnegie Mellon, Inc., to make more money. Students will keep paying them, they’ll continue to get their federal loan money, and the combined power of the workforce will continue to lose its collective knowledge and power in favor of the gig economy.

On March 6, Time shared a video of author Irshad Manji arguing that we must do better to raise a less offended generation. "While more and more schools are teaching young people how not to be offensive, they also need to be teaching a new generation how not to be offended.”
Based on the title, I was half-expecting some Sinclair Broadcast Group production of a grouchy baby boomer yelling, "Listen up, liberal college snowflake!" However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually Manji proposing three things: giving offense is the price of diversity, we grow by engaging those with whom we disagree, and it's a life skill. She supports this by using her experiences as a Muslim, and engaging with Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
Of course, Time's choice of title, "Schools Need to Teach Young People How to Not Be Offended," caught me off-guard, as it was probably designed to. Although seemingly all online media appears to be clickbait-driven, I still fell for Time's headline and was immediately intrigued. However, Manji's usage of the term "offense" kind of brought me back. Her arguments about teaching people to listen to various perspectives and be willing to listen to diverse voices seemed to say that "offense," in this context, means more of a conflict with one's personal beliefs than being hurt by someone else's beliefs. She even gives a disclaimer at the end that "we shouldn't clam up whenever we encounter intolerance or outright hate. Of course, we should stand up to it." Although it can seem easy to differentiate views that merely contrast from ours from those that conflict with our morals, the line can get muddied quickly. Responding appropriately in the face of such offense can be even more difficult.
To break down the three pillars of Manji's proposal, the first is that giving offense is the price of diversity. Too often, we see cheap "diversity”, where a corporation, school, organization, or any group of people can tout diversity merely by ticking off some demographic checkboxes. These efforts have noble intentions, and they aren't necessarily illogical: by incorporating people of diverse backgrounds, we can expect to see diverse perspectives.
However, this categorical approach to diversity reduces individuals to their demographics and heralds them almost as if they are "mascots of this or that." There's no denying that characteristics such as race, socioeconomic background, and gender can all play pivotal roles in one's life experiences and shaping one's viewpoints, but people are much more complex than that. Especially in a university where we love to talk about our gender and racial diversity, I challenge you to look beyond those more superficial characteristics and take a deeper look into how an individual adopts whatever demographic they fit in, and how it weaves into a part of them, not their identity. 
The second pillar — "we grow by engaging those with whom we disagree" — is perhaps the trickiest of the three, especially in today's polarized climate. It isn't that recognizing and understanding the existence of people whose beliefs differ from ours is hard, but that actively seeking out these conversations is hard. On campus, our Humanist League strives to engage the student body in events and discussions that provide a platform to present and exchange thoughts and beliefs. However, we have seen over the years the kinds of censorship or even hostility that can arise from outspoken political speakers regardless of where they stand on the political spectrum. The riots in UC Berkeley in response to conservative speakers easily come to mind for some of us, but so too should incidents like the death threats that pushed Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to cancel future appearances after she criticized President Donald Trump in a commencement speech at Hampshire College. Regardless of one's stance on free trade or healthcare, these beliefs are usually held because one believes that it is the most effective or ethical method. We need to learn to understand that, although morality can play a role in ideology, the two are not interchangeable.
Finally, "it's a life skill." Our arguments in life aren't limited to "is a hot dog a sandwich?" or "does pineapple go on pizza?" (to which I would have to answer "yes" and "no," respectively). Again, it's tough, and too often are we told to shy away from these kinds of conversations. They can get touchy and derail, so avoiding them altogether is safer. However, safer is not always better. Understanding the complexity of individuals can help us get to know others and even appreciate others even more.
This three-minute clip was a pleasant surprise, although I am disappointed in myself that I fell for a title that was more inflammatory than was needed. Learning to not be defensive in the presence of conflict is essentially fighting a well-ingrained instinct, but it is a vital skill, and something that I hope that can be instilled in future generations. It's easier than ever to be stuck inside an echo chamber exacerbated by online algorithms and falsities in the news, but, on the flipside, it is so much easier to branch out. Information is more readily available online. Factors like distance are not nearly as burdensome when it comes to engaging and maintaining contact with others. It may be easier to stick with just scrolling through whatever Facebook spits out for us, but we can all take steps to challenge our beliefs and become more intellectually well-rounded.
