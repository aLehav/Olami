The Tartans looked dominant on the turf at Gesling Stadium again, clobbering the DePauw University Tigers on Saturday by a score of 51–28. The 51-point offensive outburst helped the Tartans reach a total record of 4–0 for the season.
Junior full back Zachary Erra-Hernandez led the way for the Tartans, rushing for 116 yards and three touchdowns on 14 carries. As a whole, the team rushed for an incredible 220 yards, averaging an astounding 5.4 yards per carry.
The Tigers’ inability to stop the Tartans’ rushing game opened up the passing game, as junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein completed 13 of his 15 passes for 314 yards and three touchdowns. Kalkstein hit DePauw early, completing an 83-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Timothy Swanson on the first play of the game after the opening kickoff.
“We had great protection for Robbie [Kalkstein] and his receivers ran excellent patterns,” said head coach Rick Lackner. “Robbie made great in-game choices, all a part of good preparation by offensive coordinator Rich Erdelyi and his staff.”
Swanson was Kalkstein’s favorite target for the game, but only marginally. Swanson had four receptions for 153 yards and two touchdowns, while junior wide receiver Tim Kikta had three receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown.
While the DePauw defense had no trouble racking up yardage, Carnegie Mellon’s ability to force turnovers kept the Tigers’ offense off the field. DePauw’s interim head coach Scott Srnka relied too much on first-year quarterback Justin Murray, who threw two interceptions in the game. Murray threw 40 times, only completing 20 passes, although he found the end zone four times.
The Tartan defense also forced three fumbles, recovering two. Senior linebackers Nick Karabin and Chris Blomstedt led the team with 11 tackles each, and Karabin forced and recovered one of the aforementioned fumbles. Sophomore outside linebacker Alex D’Angelo was the receiver for both of Murray’s interceptions.
This Saturday, the Tartans travel to Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Ind., to play the Little Giants. Kickoff is at 2 p.m.

The No. 7-ranked men’s soccer team put on a goal-scoring showcase on the back of junior forward Max Tassano’s three goals and one assist, beating the Bethany College Bison 6–2. After the victory, the Tartans’ record sits at 7–1, having won five games straight. The Bison’s record, meanwhile, fell to 1–6.
By keeping up the attack throughout the entire game, the Tartans were able to bury the Bison, scoring three goals in both halves. Carnegie Mellon more than tripled the number of shots on goal the Bison had, winning that statistic 27–8.
Those shots put pressure on the Bison defense all game long and kept the ball away from their offense. But Tassano’s pinpoint shooting kept the Tartans efficient: He scored three times on just three shots. Junior midfielders Chris Wysocki and Matt Sarett led the Tartans with five shots on goal each.
“[Tassano] was a consistent threat the entire game and capitalized on the opportunities he was given,” senior forward Alex Abedian said. “Doing these things are both traits of a high-quality forward.”
Sarrett also scored a goal, along with senior defender Ben Bryant and junior defender Cole Christensen.
Excellent passing helped the Tartans create these scoring opportunities; of the six goals, four were assisted and Tassano, Bryant, Wysocki, and sophomore midfielder Brandon Peck all assisted on goals in the game. 
The Bison offense was kept away from the action for most of the game, so junior goalkeeper Christopher Madden was not challenged too much in goal in this bout. 
Carnegie Mellon has a history of dominating the Bison, beating Bethany College five consecutive times dating back to the 2008 season.
The Tartans are back on the field at home on Sunday against the Washington University Bears in St. Louis. The game is scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team staved off the College of Wooster Fighting Scots last Saturday with a 3–1 victory, remaining undefeated this season and bringing its overall record to 6–0–2.
The game was a defensive struggle with only seven total shots on goal registered between the two teams. After initially starting off aggressive and keeping the ball in the Fighting Scots’ half of the field, the Tartans fell victim to a quick free kick goal in the 13th minute against junior keeper Anna Albi.
Riled up, senior forward Brianna Magill quickly responded by scoring her second goal of the season 19 seconds later. First-year forward Louisa Pendergast set up the shot with her first of two assists for the day.
After missed opportunities on corner kicks for both sides, the score remained 1–1 going into halftime. 
After battling back a period-opening surge by Wooster, the Tartans finally took the lead with a goal by sophomore midfielder Lucy Havens in the 59th minute. Pendergast recorded her second assist of the game as Havens made her second goal of the season.
Both teams then struggled to control the ball and get any offense going until sophomore forward Courtney Brant put the game out of reach with her second goal of the season in the 82nd minute.
At one point, the game had a 50-minute delay due to lightning in the area, but the Tartans came back just as strong to secure their sixth victory of the young season.
“It was a great team win for us. We came together and fought hard after being down 1–0 early on. It was a game that was good preparation as we head into conference play,” said senior midfielder Stephanie Hare.
Carnegie Mellon will play an away game against Grove City College on Wednesday before beginning University Athletic Association conference play against Washington University in St. Louis Bears on Sunday at home. 
Last season, Carnegie Mellon came up short against Washington University in St. Louis. The Bears beat the Tartans 3–0, as they were ranked No. 12 in NCAA D-III women’s soccer.
The Tartans look poised to redeem last season’s loss after remaining undefeated in eight games thus far and the Bears falling out of the top 25.
Sunday’s game begins at 11 a.m.

This past weekend, the Tartan volleyball team traveled to Huntingdon, Pa., to compete in the Juniata Tournament.
The team’s first match was against Salisbury University, where the Tartans suffered a 3–0 (25–20, 25–20, 25–18) loss. Junior outside hitter Senna Parsa picked up eight digs and eight kills in the match. Junior middle blocker Olivia Mora tallied four block assists. The Tartans displayed strong defense against Salisbury, with the team finishing the game with 33 digs overall.
“Salisbury was a great team, and we played with them for most of the games, but just couldn’t get the ball back during crucial points in the match,” said junior libero Ali Nichols. “For the next game, we really decided to focus on communication and playing as a team.”
At the end the first day of the weekend-long tournament, the Tartans played Franklin and Marshall College. The team gained a 3–0 (25–23, 25–17, 25–20) victory. Parsa had 15 kills, while Nichols ended the match with nine digs. Junior setter Emily Wright had 17 assists.
On the second day of the tournament, the team matched up against Fairleigh Dickinson University at Florham. The Tartans had a 3–0 (25–8, 25–20, 25–16) victory. Parsa excelled in this match, picking up 10 kills, 10 digs, and four service aces. Nichols also had a great performance with 15 digs.
The Tartans played Juniata College in the last match of the tournament. Although they lost 3–1 (25–21, 25–18, 25–13, 27–25), the Tartans had a strong offensive match. Mora had 10 kills, Parsa and sophomore Alexandra Celentano each had eight kills, and first-year middle blocker Rebecca Wolfinger had six kills. 
“Throughout the weekend, they played really well. The [Franklin and Marshall College] match was a really good win,” head coach Kim Kelly said. “They played together and our defense really came together.”
In Tartan victories, the players put together solid performances both offensively and defensively.
The next volleyball game is at home, where the Tartans will host Waynesburg University this Wednesday at 7 p.m.

For the second time in eight seasons, National Hockey League (NHL) owners have locked out their players. This is now the fourth time the league has locked out its players in its history. With all of the September preseason games canceled and with the players and owners refusing to negotiate, the possibility of a quick resolution seems bleak. What the NHL owners fail to realize, however, is that whatever money they gain through the negotiations will be lost to massive public backlash.
Unlike the other major American sports leagues, the NHL has significant overseas competition. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) out of Eurasia is the NHL’s largest competitor for top talent. As more elite hockey talent is developed in Eastern Europe, the decision to move to the U.S. and embrace a new culture is not as easy as it was when Washington Capitals left winger Alexander Ovechkin came over in 2005.
While the NHL may have been set up for a talent war with the KHL in the coming years, it certainly isn’t doing itself any favors with the lockout. Many players, including Ovechkin, have already signed contracts with teams in the KHL to play for the upcoming season. This exodus both strengthens the NHL’s competition and eliminates the owners’ strongest bargaining chip.
The recent lockouts in the NBA and NFL met somewhat timely conclusions because players were pining for their pay checks and didn’t have anywhere else to turn. Football is played at a high level only in the U.S. and, while basketball has expanded its global presence, the rest of the world pales in comparison to the NBA.
The NHL is on thin ice in terms of fan support. After the 2004–05 lockout, the league faced an uphill battle in trying to regain public support. While it has since rebuilt its fan base in the traditional hockey regions, the NHL has lost the battle to expand the sport into nontraditional regions in the Sun Belt.
Most of the problems that caused this lockout are a result of the failing Sun Belt franchises. These franchises failed to attract the fair-weather fans, and any foothold gained by the teams was wiped out by the previous lockout.
The NHL is losing its battle against other major league sports. This has created a downward spiral: Teams cannot fill arenas, and therefore cannot create enough revenue to afford a competitive roster. These losing teams drive away fans, leaving arenas barren. 
In order for the NHL to regain its status as one of America’s top sports organizations, it may be necessary to contract the league back to its roots in Canada and the northern U.S.
Hockey also suffers from high start-up costs in order for youth to play. Ice hockey is just as hard, since it requires ice — which is not widely available in most of the U.S. — and skates, which are expensive. Compare this to a game of basketball, which only requires a ball and a hoop.
This current lockout is just another example of how out of touch the league’s owners are from both current and future fans. The 2004–05 lockout nearly killed the league and yet, eight years later, we are in the same situation. Hockey players are already paid the least compared to players in other big sports leagues, yet owners are still unhappy enough about money to disrupt their revenue stream.
Unless the league sees the light and begins to understand its current place on the edge of American sports, the NHL may not be able to exist much longer in its current state. If this lockout eliminates a full season like it did eight years ago, I’m not confident the league will be able to come back.

New to the Carnegie Mellon baseball team is first-year pitcher Darren Kerfoot, hailing from San Dimas, Calif.
“I’ve been playing baseball for 14 years, since I was four years old,” he said. He had hoped to continue to pursue his love for baseball during his college career.
Kerfoot has already jumped to the top of the Tartan’s rotaton. His fastball clocks in at over 85 miles per hour, with his curveball 20 miles per hour slower than his fast ball. He also has a slider and a changeup in his arsenal. He is 2–0 on the season, with 24 strikeouts and an earned run average (ERA) of 1.28.
Although Kerfoot is currently a math major, he plans to graduate with a mechanical engineering degree before pursuing a full-time career. Despite only just entering college, he is already planning to complete a master’s degree at Stanford University and play on their baseball team.
But for now, Kerfoot is adjusting to the Carnegie Mellon baseball team well. “I really enjoy baseball. The thing I enjoy most is that everyone is there to have a good time, and also that I get to actually play with really smart people. It’s awesome,” he said.
He added, “I am really proud each time I step on the field because it’s just a great atmosphere to play in.”
“Darren has been a great addition to the team,” said senior second baseman Joe Barbish. “He has been able to keep hitters off balance with his powerful fastball and hard-breaking, off-speed pitches.”
Even though it is his first season as a Tartan athlete, Kerfoot has made a checklist of goals he wants to complete before his time on the baseball team ends. “For myself, I’d like to get my ERA under 1.00 and hit at least .400. I also really hope to get CMU baseball to become an NCAA sport before I graduate,” Kerfoot said.
However, for Kerfoot, representing Carnegie Mellon is the most important part of being on the baseball team. “I think the most rewarding thing is being able to play a sport, get away from the academics for a little bit, have some fun with some great guys, and keep playing a sport I love while studying my ass off,” he said.

Last Friday, Carnegie Mellon unveiled its first official preview of the university’s newest addition: the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation.
The campus-wide event — titled “From Technology to Policy: Energy Research at Carnegie Mellon” — had speakers to present and discuss Carnegie Mellon’s current role in the energy innovation of and plans for the Scott Institute. Speakers included President Jared Cohon; Granger Morgan and Andrew Gellman, the new Scott Institute’s director and associate director, respectively; and various Carnegie Mellon researchers who are already tackling the energy problem.
Morgan described how the new energy institute — housed in the Carnegie Institute of Technology but still a university-wide collaboration — will make Carnegie Mellon a “go-to” place in energy-related research and education, use resources to coordinate and promote synergy between colleges, and increase the university’s visibility.
The vision for the Scott Institute is to create a partnership of disciplines that act toward a better energy environment for the common good.
“Energy decisions unfold in critical, regulatory, environmental, and behavioral context, and we need economic, organizational, and policy solutions as much as we need new technology,” Cohon said. “This is an interdisciplinary challenge of the first order, and Carnegie Mellon simply does this cross-collaboration better than any other institution that I know.”
However, the speakers made clear that there are certain things the institute will not do.
Namely, Morgan said that the institute will not divert corporate membership from existing centers, take on research that others on campus are already doing, or dictate what others do and where external support goes on campus. It will be a collaborative center for researchers and an open place for outsiders and non-experts to learn about energy research.
Speaking at the energy symposium were 11 faculty members, many of whom are from or involved with Carnegie Mellon’s engineering and public policy department, ready to discuss their research and findings in the energy innovation front.
Topics ranged from, “Can low-cost batteries help us to use more renewables and build fewer transmission lines?” to “How will human behavior affect energy futures?” and “Are federal policies targeting the right plug-in vehicle?” Other topics represented national questions, like the validity of clean coal, and local issues, such as the advancement of local transportation.
Students will see the many graduate programs coming out of the Scott Institute and the new courses available to undergraduate students as direct impacts. The facility will also house research labs, including a state-of-the-art nanotechnology fabrication lab, and it will also serve as the home of the biomedical engineering department.
“We’re in position to make an impact on such a greatly important problem as this,” Cohon said. “It’s an opportunity that goes beyond just that — I view it as an obligation for Carnegie Mellon.”
The institute will be located in the soon-to-be-constructed Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall, a 100,000-square-foot building located among Hamerschlag, Wean, and Roberts Halls. This new building is named after Mr. and Mrs. Scott, two alumni whose donations helped fund the institute.
The Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall is slated to open in 2015.

The discovery of a potential tumor can be a challenging experience for patients and physicians. While the patient needs to understand what’s going on, the physician has to decide if the tumor needs to be removed immediately. This process is not as clear-cut as it seems. There are relatively few tools available to help a physician determine what exact course of action should be followed, but researchers at Carnegie Mellon are about to help them out.
Robert Murphy, head of the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology, and Gustavo Rohde, an associate professor with Carnegie Mellon’s department of biomedical engineering, recently received a $1 million grant from the Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) program to develop more specific cancer-detection computer programs. The project is also supported by a $500,000 grant from the Omnyx Corporation.
Murphy will be the lead director of the project; he and Rohde will be assisted by pathologists from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).
Rohde and Murphy plan for the project to be able to analyze the tissues of thousands of patients — which, considering the rate at which scientists currently analyze tissue, is a huge innovation.
When a potential tumor is spotted, a patient undergoes a biopsy — the removal of a piece of tissue. As of now, to determine cancer verdicts, pathologists observe the cells in the biopsies in labs. These specialists use medical equipment, patient history, and broad knowledge to diagnose a tissue sample. Despite the pathologists’ expertise, the cancer diagnosis process can be relatively slow, and still relies on human judgment without much assistance.
In Rohde’s and Murphy’s project, images of the tissue would be entered into a computer program that would segment the image of tissue into smaller images of thousands of individual cells. Next, these cellular portraits would be compared to images of other cells — both cancerous and healthy — in the program’s data bank.
The program would then be able to use an algorithm to match the image of the cell with other similar or nearly identical images. Using stored information on the matching cell images, the program would determine the probability of whether the cell in question is dangerous.
Specifically, Rohde and Murphy’s research will focus on certain types of prostate and liver cancers.
Rohde has already created programs for such computer systems, usually using a data set of 10–15 people. This project will allow his lab to test the system on a much larger scale with thousands of people. And since it’s such an advanced undertaking, the program needs an incredibly large amount of data. Murphy and Rohde are collaborating with pathologists at UPMC to help gather the necessary information.
While Rohde’s primary focus is using data to match the images of cells, Murphy’s research focuses on the individual proteins of the cells. Each cell has thousands of proteins, too many to be feasibly observed by any human. Murphy’s lab, however, is aimed at looking at subcellular compartments referred to as organelles, and trying to decipher localized proteins that may be specific to certain liver or pqwancreatic cancers. The data would, like Rohde’s program, be able to tell the pathologist the nature of the proteins.
Rohde claims the project has the potential to make a large impact in the area of cancer research and identification. It’s important to note, however, that the program is just another tool to make cancer detection more efficient and effective. Rohde explained that it allows pathologists to perform tasks that humans can’t, like quantifying huge amounts of data.
Rohde is excited by the potential magnitude of the project. “When opportunity comes to transition this to the real world [it is] always exciting,” he said. “I think everyone appreciates the opportunity that, if this is to work well, [it] could be meaningful and good for a lot of people, for us professionally, but also for the greater good.”
The end goal of the entire project is to create a product that could be sold and used in a healthcare setting, rather than be a conversation piece for an academic’s office.

The successful landing of NASA’s Curiosity rover on Mars has rekindled America’s desire to explore the red planet. President Barack Obama has said that he would like to see the success of a manned space exploration to Mars by 2030. But before NASA can successfully conduct a mission to this unexplored realm, it must first be able to ensure the health of its astronauts during the eight-month journey.
A team of biomedical researchers at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Louisville have joined this effort. They are developing a dome-shaped containment unit, called an Aqueous Immersion Surgical System (AISS), that makes performing surgeries in the zero-gravity conditions of outer space a reality.
The project stems from an idea proposed by James Burgess, a neurosurgeon at Allegheny General Hospital who wanted to develop a tool that would prevent blood from filling a surgical cavity and blocking a surgeon’s view. Carnegie Mellon biomedical engineering professor James Antaki, with the help of Ph.D. student Jennifer Hayden, refined a system to surround the surgical wound with a watertight dome and utilize water pressure to control bleeding.
The surgical dome is sealed to the skin around the injury to prevent contamination. Multiple holes are on the dome’s surface: One allows entry of pressure-controlled water into the surgical area, while another holds a suction to prevent waste from filling the cavity. The dome’s transparency and its access port for surgical tools allow surgeons to operate more easily.
“On top of the excitement that their prototype could be utilized in space exploration, it is very rewarding knowing their tool could immensely benefit trauma patients during surgery on the ground,” Hayden said.
The next step for the team is to test the device in conditions similar to those in outer space. Another member of the project’s team, University of Louisville surgery and biomedical engineering professor George Pantalos, collaborated with NASA to conduct tests in NASA’s C-9 aircraft, which travels in parabolic arcs to simulate zero-gravity conditions.
While in flight, the chamber will allow the team to test two different functions of the device: “The watertight chamber will contain hollow tubes filled with a blood substitute that simulate the network of blood vessels,” Hayden explained. “After cutting the tubes similar to how blood vessels would be cut during surgery, the suction system should replace the liquid with a clear substitute to increase visibility.”
In addition to removing the blood from the chamber, the tool also controls pressure to force the vessels to collapse and stop the bleeding all together. “Using a pig heart filled with an artificial fluid, [they] will monitor the pressure at which the bleeding is stopped,” Hayden said.
Gravity plays an important role in surgery, keeping body parts and blood in place during the procedure. This can present a real complication in outer space.
“We had to design an evaluation station to surround the AISS that would physically attach to the plane, catching any leaks just in case, because it is very hard to clean up a blood substitute while flying sideways,” Hayden said.
Hollywood has devised its own take on a solution to the gravity problem with this summer’s blockbuster Prometheus, which features a large automated surgical chamber. The AISS prototype is one of the first steps in astro-biomedical engineering to take this big-screen idea and make it a reality, which could help ensure the health of astronauts on their long journey.

Rethink Robotics creates human-like robot
Rethink Robotics, a start-up company in Boston, has taken artificial intelligence to the next step with the development of the two-armed robot, Baxter. The robot displays human-like characteristics, such as facial expressions and the ability to adjust to unexpected situations. Baxter was designed to be integrated into the workforce with humans and perform simple, repetitive tasks involved with manufacturing and assembly.
Unlike past robot models, Baxter has mechanisms to ensure that it is not a safety threat. For example, it can sense a human nearby and adjust itself accordingly. Rethink Robotics hopes to sell such robots for an inexpensive price in order to make the use of robots widespread.

Scientists believe to have spotted oldest galaxy
A team of astronomers at Johns Hopkins University discovered a galaxy believed to be the oldest and most distant galaxy ever observed. It was detected using NASA’s Hubble and Spitzer Space telescopes and a technique known as cosmic magnification.
The observed galaxy is believed to be 13.2 billion years old, just a half billion years younger than the estimated age of the universe. Galaxies of this age are believed to have contributed to the “re-ionization period,” when the universe began to transition from a total darkness to the galaxy we see today. Because of its age, the galaxy will be a useful tool in studying the early history of our universe, such as the rise of the first stars and galaxies.

People with PTSD may find help in ecstasy use
A research team, led by David Nutt of Imperial College London in the U.K., conducted a study to determine the effects of the drug ecstasy on the brain, and whether it can serve as a therapeutic drug for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
In the study, participants took ecstasy pills, had their brains scanned, and were told to report back a week later and describe their most positive and most negative memories, rating them by their vividness. The team found that negative memories were less vivid to the participants. The study suggests that ecstasy could help reduce the shock individuals feel when accessing traumatic memories, and therefore help them better cope with PTSD.

Climate change could bring back ancient plants
In a conference in Toronto, Alexandre Guertin-Pasquier, of the University of Montreal’s department of geography, presented findings showing that fossilized forests in Northern Canada could return due to the warming of the Arctic. He studied a 2.6- to 3-million-year-old Bylot Island fossilized forest, which had been preserved over time by peat and permafrost.
Guertin-Pasquier and his team discovered pollen that would normally be found in regions where the average climate was 32°F, while the current average temperature of Bylot Island is 5°F. However, his data models show that over time, the climate of Bylot Island will once again be able to support this type of growth, sprouting trees such as willow, pine, and spruce.

Ecologist wonders: Are we running out of plants?
Steven Running, a forest ecologist at the University of Montana, claims that we may be reaching the limit of the world’s plant growth. He and his team have studied NASA satellite observations since 1982 to infer how plant growth has changed over time. The observations showed that plant growth has remained mostly unchanged, meaning that human efforts to increase plant growth will perhaps be ineffective.
Running claims that plant growth is a planetary boundary, which is an underlying idea that there are certain environmental conditions that must be met to avoid irreversible damage. He suggests that we may be approaching Earth’s limit of plant growth and suggests monitoring it closely.

Behavioral characteristics of autism explained
Researchers from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel conducted a study that could explain the causes of behavioral traits in autistic individuals. 
The researchers scanned the brains of 28 participants, half autistic and half not. They then studied the participants’ reactions to a series of dots projected at a fixed point on a computer screen and a series of beeps. While non-autistic individuals showed constant responses, autistic individuals had widely varied reactions. 
The study concluded that, for autistic individuals, repetitive behaviors may be a coping mechanism for these “erratic brain responses.”

Ideas, like good beer, take time to perfect. Key components to both are the right ingredients, environment, and timing.
So what do you get when you combine two fraternity brothers with a passion for craft beer, Carnegie Mellon’s entrepreneurship program, and a city full of beer lovers? The Brew Gentlemen.
Created in 2010, The Brew Gentlemen is a Braddock-based craft brewery that began as the brainchild of Carnegie Mellon 2012 alumni Asa Foster and Matt Katase. Foster and Katase are “The Brew Gentlemen.”
“We both lived in Morewood freshman year,” Foster said. “And then we both joined [Sigma Alpha Epsilon].” The bonds of brotherhood, as well as a feeling of disenchantment with their majors, brought the two together. Foster was an art student, while Katase was studying operations research.
“We were both interested in craft beer and we often joked around with the idea that we would create a brewery someday,” Foster said. “Then, the Thanksgiving of our junior year, Matt came to Boston for the break and we were sitting on the couch just watching football and decided to just drop everything in life and do it.”
With the craft brewery scene quickly gaining popularity, the pair petitioned and received permission to change their areas of study to a student-defined major. “Our majors were in the way of what we really wanted to pursue,” Katase said. In their new majors, Foster and Katase were allowed to take the entrepreneurship and marketing classes they needed to make The Brew Gentlemen a reality.
“We got a lot of help from entrepreneurship professors,” Katase said. “[Barbara] Carryer and [Robert] Culbertson, in particular, really helped us form the backbone of our company. They told us our business plan was sh*t, that this has to be more than just a dream, and they really got us to think about the specifics. And they’re still helping us to this day — which is awesome.”
Carryer, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship in the Tepper School of Business, continues to coach and encourage the pair to focus on the business end of the endeavor. “I really pushed them to go out and talk to distributors, to restaurants and bars to see who would carry the beer, to make them figure out how a new beer gets to market,” Carryer said.
Culbertson — an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship and CEO of GetABBY, a consumer communication platform — also lent some hard-hitting advice to the young businessmen. “I got pissed off at them in one class,” Culbertson said. “To the point of saying, ‘Would you just get off the pot already and do it?’ I told them they were making some stupid decisions, and oftentimes I kind of embarrassed them in front of the class. But that really made them get off the pot and start doing something.”
“[Robert] is a tough-love kind of guy,” Katase said. “But we got past that.” As part of an apprentice project Culbertson conducts in one of his classes, Foster and Katase started throwing dinner and beer-tasting parties for friends, peers, and individuals involved in Pittsburgh’s craft beer scene.
“For our first event,” Foster said, “we put on a four-course beer dinner cooked entirely by us and featured our White Sky alongside three other beers.”
“We’re both foodies; we love cooking and mixing ideas and ingredients,” Foster said. “So making nontraditional beers like our White Sky is what we want to be doing.” The White Sky is The Brew Gentlemen’s flagship beer, and it has received positive feedback in the brew community. It’s a wheat beer brewed with chai spices like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper.
The beer’s spicy taste, combined with the lightness of the wheat, makes it a “year-round seasonal,” as The Brew Gentlemen call it. White Sky is a good winter beer because of its warmth and spiciness, but it also works as a summer beer because of its light and refreshing taste.
“I actually hired them to provide the beer for a party that I gave in the middle of August,” Carryer said. “It was really great beer, and all my friends — about 50 people — really liked the beer, too. Super enthusiastic response.”
The duo has also created a beer called Business Casual, a caramel-colored session red ale, and revived General Braddock’s IPA, a bittersweet East Coast India pale ale.
“Part of our agreement with [Barbara] is that we have to come in and talk to her students once we’re successful,” Katase said. “... and bring beer.”
Carryer wasn’t alone in her praise of The Brew Gentlemen’s products. “It’s good beer,” Culbertson said. “If they had it in a restaurant, I would absolutely order it. I think they could sell their stuff tomorrow.”
Culbertson advised the duo to take advantage of the growing interest in craft beer and to get their product on the market as soon as possible. “Right now the window for craft beers is huge,” Culbertson said. “Everybody wants a craft beer and they don’t care so much if they have to pay six bucks a bottle for it, and I don’t want them to miss that window.”
The Brew Gentlemen already have some prospective restaurants and bars wanting to buy their beer, but the pair is waiting to perfect and test its recipes before officially opening for business.
“I think there’s another hurdle to get over, which is how they will handle demand,” Culbertson said. “We are all fearful of failure — there’s no question about that — but we’re also fearful of success.”
“Every entrepreneur wonders, ‘Gee, what happens if I suddenly get orders for 1,000 kegs, what do I do?’ ” Culbertson said. “The new entrepreneur always reacts, ‘Oh my god, I’m done, I’m doomed.’ I sit here and say, ‘Hey, time to throw a party! Wow, people want 1,000 kegs of your beer? Holy crap! That’s a great problem!’ But when you’re living it, all you can see is the logistics: How are we gonna deliver it, how are we gonna brew that much by that time, et cetera. It goes back to the dating analogy, ‘She invited me to the prom. Oh my god. Oh my god, I’ve gotta rent a tux.’ ”
Although The Brew Gentlemen undoubtedly have some hurdles in their future, things are looking good from their Braddock facility. “Braddock is the perfect backdrop for a brewery,” Foster said. “It’s quiet and we’re right in the backyard of the steel mill.”
Their establishment, which is about 3,000 square feet and currently houses their production facility and pilot brewing system, is owned by the Heritage Community Initiatives. “The mayor [of Braddock] and the Heritage Community Initiatives — a nonprofit that’s trying to revitalize Braddock — really helped us find our space,” Katase said.
Foster and Katase are surprised by the amount of support they have received from the Braddock and brewing communities. “The cooperation and willingness of other breweries to lend a hand has been overwhelming,” Katase said. “From just giving us feedback on our beer to letting us borrow equipment to just teaching us anything and everything we want to learn.”
“Everyone is extremely willing to pour you a beer,” Katase added. “Because, really, the competitors are the big three: Bud, Miller, and Coors. The craft guys are all in this together, and they wanna see each other do well because, what is that saying, ‘Rising tides float all boats?’ ”
Since their first dinner party in April, The Brew Gentlemen have been invited to and have attended a number of other beer dinners and tastings, the biggest of which will be held on Oct. 6 in Braddock. The event, “Tapped: Braddock,” will feature a pop-up beer garden provided by The Brew Gentlemen, cocktails from Bar Marco, local food trucks, and live local music.
“We’ll be pouring the White Sky and the General Braddock’s,” Foster said. “And there’ll be a pig roast by Kevin Sousa [owner of Salt of the Earth], who’s opening a restaurant above our brewery. He’s a resident badass, so that’s gonna be awesome.”
The Brew Gentlemen plan to open their facility to the public early next year, where they will have beers on tap.

The line to pick up will-call tickets at the venue was out the door and around the corner, and the line of people hoping to buy last-minute tickets was even longer — even with 10 minutes left before the concert was going to start.
When the show began, people were still rushing to their seats as the audience members stood and sang along to the music. This may sound typical for a rock concert, but it was somewhat unexpected for this musical group: It was the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) at Heinz Hall last Saturday.
The high attendance was in part thanks to the Carnegie Mellon University Night that the orchestra was hosting: Students, faculty, and staff received discounts on tickets.
The concert began with “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and once everyone was settled back into their seats, William Caballero, the PSO’s principal horn and an associate teaching professor in the School of Music, strode onto the stage with the conductor, PSO music director Manfred Honeck.
This is Caballero’s 24th year as principal horn in the PSO, and his experience was apparent in his rendition of Richard Strauss’ Concerto No. 1 in E-flat major for Horn and Orchestra. The French horn is usually known for its bold, brassy sound, but Caballero showed off the horn’s sweet, expressive side. At some points in the concerto, the horn almost sounded like the woodwind instruments that accompanied it.
His performance also highlighted his technical ability. Near the end of the concerto, Caballero picked up the tempo, his fingers flying over the instrument’s valves as he expertly made his way through a quick sequence of notes, finishing to a standing ovation.
Caballero wasn’t the only featured soloist of the evening, however. After a short break, Thomas Hampson — an American lyric baritone — took the stage to perform four of Strauss’ songs for baritone and orchestra.
Hampson is in high demand as an opera singer, and his performance showed why: He had engaging stage presence, with animated movements and facial expressions that made the emotions in the songs easy to understand, even though all the lyrics were in German.
While all of his songs were excellent, the highlight by far was “Nächtlicher Gang,” a dramatic song about a lover looking for his beloved beyond the grave. The lyrics, taken from a poem of the same name by Friedrich Rückert, begin, “The flags flap / In the midnight storm, / The slates rattle / On the church tower.”
The PSO made for a dramatic accompaniment to Hampson’s singing. The orchestra built up to a thunderous climax, then abruptly stopped, keeping the audience members at the edge of their seats before gently easing into the conclusion. The performance made such an impact that many in the audience were excitedly murmuring after the piece finished, even though Hampson still had one more song to perform.
After intermission, the orchestra took the spotlight with its rendition of Antonín Dvorák’s Symphony No. 9 in E minor, more famously known as his “New World Symphony.” The symphony has been recorded hundreds of times and performed by everyone from world-class philharmonics to youth orchestras, to the point that, as an NPR article about the symphony warned, “it runs the risk of sounding hackneyed.”
Luckily, Dvorák’s symphony is lush and emotionally varied enough to overcome any worries of it becoming stale, and the PSO’s rendition brought out the best in the composition. The orchestra, under Honeck’s direction, teased out all the different colors and tones in each movement, resulting in a warm, moving performance that earned thunderous applause.
As part of Carnegie Mellon University Night, members of the university were invited to a reception after the concert in the basement of Heinz Hall. A crowd of students, faculty, and staff members gathered to eat cake and talk about the performance. Once most of the people in the crowd had started to dig into their desserts, a stream of Carnegie Mellon and PSO affiliates took to the microphone to thank everyone for coming.
The chairman of the PSO Board of Trustees, Dick Simmons, particularly expressed his delight at the presence of so many students. “We always love to see the average age [of audience members] go down,” he joked. Honeck agreed, and added that having a younger crowd adds more energy to the hall. “We feel when you are in the audience,” he said. Given the incredible concert that the PSO put on, it wouldn’t be surprising if more Carnegie Mellon students become a regular part of the audience for future performances.

The last we saw Paul Thomas Anderson, writer and director of The Master, it was in Daniel Plainview’s bowling alley. It’s been five years since There Will Be Blood, and not much has changed. He still writes stories about surrogate families, incest, and the American West. But The Master shows us a new era of cinema on its own terms.
Whatever you think this film might be, you’re wrong. If you’re expecting a Scientology exposé, you’re wrong. If you’re expecting a climactic payoff, you’re wrong. If you’re expecting perfection, you’re wrong. But if you surrender and follow The Master, it will show you how to see it. It is cinematic panache of the highest order: a dazzling, searing, potent, personal American epic. Only time will tell, but I predict that 20 years from now, everyone will bow to The Master.
The story follows Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a Navy veteran of World War II, as he struggles to find stability after the war. His greatest talent is creating potent beverages out of paint thinners, Lysol, and photographic chemicals and using them to seduce women. He eventually stows away on a mysterious yacht commanded by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a group of pseudo-scientific mystics called The Cause. While this is based on the career of L. Ron Hubbard, creator of Scientology, that will be the last thing on your mind when the film is over. Quell becomes Dodd’s most obedient apostle and soldier, and the two develop a chillingly intimate bond that is both deeply human and deeply animal.
Human versus animal is the easiest way to summarize this expansive, defiant story. The Cause suggests that humans are not members of the animal kingdom, yet Quell is prone to vicious fits of rage, sexual aggression, and fart jokes. It builds the Freudian conflict of id versus ego into a spectacularly repressed, homoerotic love story. This setting is assisted by composer Jonny Greenwood’s twitchy, celestial score. The moaning, galactic strings of his work for There Will Be Blood have transformed into humming winds that, like the film, have no desire to reach a conclusion. There will be many attempts to explain The Master, but it is best understood as a love song — a story about the basic need to be cared for, to be mastered.
Shot in the archaic format of 70mm film — twice the width of a typical strip, usually reserved for sprawling war epics — The Master is a cinephile’s dream come true. The ridges and angles of Phoenix’s face are set in direct contrast to Hoffman’s plump, round shape. Their countenance fills the screen to every edge. In one scene destined for immortality, Dodd submits Quell to “informal processing,” a strange procedure drawn from Scientology’s therapeutic philosophies.
The camera lingers on Phoenix for minutes at a time as he releases one crushing catharsis after another. His performance is like watching a voodoo priest boil every ache and pain that you’ve ever felt into a cup of tea. He spends most of the movie ready to explode with desire and urge.
Hoffman, too, channels Orson Welles in a gripping, charismatic portrait of a man trying his best to lead. Amy Adams, who plays Dodd’s wife Peggy, hardly ever leaves the screen. While she’s usually tucked away in an out-of-focus corner, she is always hovering over the men, mastering them.
Anderson’s script is far from a religious commentary. Instead, it shows incredible pathos for the ability to have faith, ultimately reasoning that religion is something none of us can escape. We all live with a master, whether it is another human being or our basic weaknesses. If there is a villain in The Master, it’s loneliness.
Anderson understands that our feeble minds can only go so far and discover so much. Having faith in our smallness is a virtue.

With a spark and a bang, senior art major Jessica Aguero’s A Year of Wondering opened on Friday at The Frame, a student-run gallery space. The exhibit explores the emotions Aguero faced after the death of a friend. Rather than tip-toeing around the sensitive topics explored in the exhibit, however, Aguero’s work stomps right through, powerfully and playfully dealing with the onslaught of emotions that accompanies the death of a loved one.
“The exhibit is a response to the death of a very close friend ... you just have all of these questions and no answers. You just have to embrace that there are things that you’ll never understand,” Aguero said.
Packing a colorful punch, the exhibit surprisingly evokes a sense of liveliness rather than somberness. Balloons float across the room, party confetti is artfully clumped on the floor, and there’s enough candy to overwhelm Willy Wonka.
“We’re so excited about her use of materials, and she has a great sense of color,” said Jamie Walters, junior art major and co-director of The Frame. “It’s exciting, unusual, and elaborate. I thought it would be a good exhibition to start the year off like that and draw people in with something exciting.”
There’s an incredible amount of whimsical yet profound energy packed into the relatively small gallery space. The collection of works is so eclectic and emotional, it’s impossible not to be drawn in and captivated, first by the dazzling array of colors and then by the depth of the expression.
The bubbly vibe that the colors and childish wonders give off is tempered by subtle reminders of what the exhibition is really examining: thoughts and questions about life after death.
“She uses interesting and unusual materials and less traditional processes,” Walters said.
Highlights of the exhibition include razors that have been contorted and fused together into a spherical shape, a giant foam tear drop covered in sprinkles, a wall mural that invites viewers to contribute with a pile of Crayola markers, and a stop-motion video of a girl jumping and flipping backwards.
“The video was 40 frames made out of candy and frosting. Each frame took a half an hour, and the video is only two seconds long,” Aguero said, laughing. “It just represents a brief, happy moment.”
The most striking piece by far is a heart-wrenching journal that Aguero kept in the months following her friend’s death. The drawings and letters in the journal are deeply personal and bittersweet, truly allowing viewers to get a glimpse into the personal struggle that she went through.
The exhibit is honest and pure, and the personal touches complete the vision. For example, cupcakes were provided at Friday’s opening simply because “they were [her friend’s] favorite food,” Aguero said.
Attention to detail, personal touches, and the interesting juxtaposition of a somber theme with bold colors and pieces makes this exhibition a thought-provoking and joyful success.
The Frame is located at the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street.

The Cambridge Footlights, a sketch comedy group from Cambridge University in England, performed its show “Perfect Strangers” in McConomy Auditorium last Friday. The Footlights, founded in 1883, is known for having launched the careers of some well-known names in comedy, including John Cleese, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, and Sacha Baron Cohen.
“Perfect Strangers,” sponsored and hosted by Scotch’n’Soda, featured five members of the troupe — Emma Powell, Pierre Novellie, George Pots, Phil Wang, and Jason Forbes — performing in a series of increasingly interrelated skits. And there was nothing dry in this flavor of British humor; skits dealt with subjects ranging from the personal lives of Ken and Barbie to a film adaptation of the board game Monopoly.
“Perfect Strangers” had a broad theme of being interconnected. Between quick transitory fadeouts to a darkened stage, recurring characters and plots would emerge in new skits, slowly completing a series of absurd, interwoven comical narratives. A wide range of comedic styles was represented in these acts, including physical comedy, dark humor, and parody.
The performers had spot-on delivery and put on an energetic and consistently hilarious act. The most memorable skits involved characters who made appearances in multiple skits, and skits that were more absurd. One skit, for example, involved a man who stumbled into Utopia, a seemingly perfect world that hid a dark secret.
Another notable skit included an alien hunter who used a stick to hit men’s nether regions in an attempt to find the extraterrestrials that killed his wife.
Many skits included the use of the “time phone,” a magical phone that could call people from the past and future. Carolyn Supinka, a senior Bachelors of Humanities and Arts student, said, “[My friends and I] loved the telephone skit. We’ve seen the show since we were freshmen, so we knew it was going to be good.”
Reactions from the crowd seemed exceedingly positive. Throughout the show, audience members were howling with laughter and cheers. Nadia Sheen, a senior in biology, said, “It was great. It was witty, it was clever, and it was fun to watch.”
Overall, the show was a resounding success. It is easy to see the incredible amount of comedic talent that resides within the Footlights.

A screening and release party of the DVD and book Strange Attractors: Investigations in Non-Humanoid Extraterrestrial Sexualities — a project dedicated to exploring extraterrestrial sexual desires — took place on Friday night at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Melwood Screening Room.
Seventy different artists collaborated on the project, all of them contributing through various mediums, including visual art, creative writing, and video. Those involved in the project made an effort to do away with conventional sexual boundaries, moving far beyond binary thinking and attempting to conceptualize all the dirty details of extraterrestrial pleasure.
Suzie Silver, an associate professor of art at Carnegie Mellon who spearheaded this project, claims that Strange Attractors has a “huge CMU presence.” She estimates that nearly half of the project is made up of Carnegie Mellon affiliates, and that about two-thirds of the video contributors were her students at one point.
In 2009, Silver founded the Institute of Extraterrestrial Sexuality, inspired by a combination of her love of sci-fi, her longstanding interest in gender expression and sexuality, and the launching of the Kepler Space Telescope in March of that year. Her efforts, united with those of Encyclopedia Destructica — a community-based artist book publisher that started as a student project at Carnegie Mellon — and those of the eclectic group of artistic contributors, all acted together to provide this unique insight into sexual imagination.
At the screening last Friday, the audience congregated in the lobby before the show. Waiters in outrageous alien costumes that blinked and sparkled carried trays of strangely phosphorescent jello shots. Audience members sported striking styles: half-shaven heads, bold facial piercings, ample facial hair, black leather pants, and sophisticated silk vests.
The screening itself was composed of selected videos from the DVD, as well as readings from the book. Silver, sporting what looked like an alien space helmet, read passages from her work. As the screening continued, the audience was shocked, confused, and intrigued. But throughout it all, there was a deeper underlying message. “Imagine and empathize with others who are really, really different from you,” Silver explained. “If you can do that, then maybe you can empathize and tolerate people that might be just a little bit different from you.”
The success of this project should be encouraging to any student at Carnegie Mellon who desires to embark on a journey that may be a little out-of-the-box. “No idea is too weird,” said Scott Andrew, a Carnegie Mellon art graduate student and video contributor to the project, on the amount of resources available to students. The group behind Strange Attractors was able to raise about $24,000 for the project from various sources, such as the Heinz Foundation and Kickstarter. 
The creativity of these artists and their determination to see their project through to the end, no matter how odd or eccentric it may appear, is truly inspirational. As Silver put it: “Are we just gonna let whatever happens happen? Or are we going to try to imagine, and actively participate in, creating a world of our dreams?”

Last week saw the return of many beloved TV dramas, such as Bones, and comedies like Parks and Recreation and The Office. This week continues the plethora of season premieres with the return of favorites such as Castle, How I Met Your Mother, Grey’s Anatomy, and The Big Bang Theory.
Castle
Castle’s fourth season finale was a crowd-pleaser, with the romantic relationship between main characters NYPD detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) and mystery novelist Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) finally setting off. The mystery of the murder of Beckett’s mother, however, remains unsolved. This season promises to be action-packed, as Castle and Beckett try to keep their relationship a secret while continually investigating the Cole Maddox case, which is carried over from last season. Look out for the new season, which premieres tonight at 10 p.m. on ABC.
How I Met Your Mother
Today also marks the start of the comedy How I Met Your Mother on CBS. In a flurry of flashbacks and glimpses into the future, the upcoming premiere will address some unresolved questions from the previous season. The seventh season finale ended with Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) at his wedding to Quinn Garvey (guest-star Becki Newton); Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alison Hannigan) having their baby; and Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) running off with his ex-girlfriend Victoria (guest-star Ashley Williams).
The series has won seven Emmy awards since it began in 2009, and has been nominated for many more. With rumors floating that this season is probably the last and with its previous season receiving the highest ratings of all, viewers anxiously wait to see how the Barney-Quinn wedding turns out and how Ted finally meets his future wife. Don’t miss the beginning of this promising season at 8 p.m.
Grey’s Anatomy
Everyone’s favorite medical drama Grey’s Anatomy begins its ninth season Thursday. Last season ended with a severe shock: A plane crash left many members of the cast stranded in a forest, and Lexie “Little” Grey (Chyler Leigh) met her end, which effectively boosted ratings for the show. Loyal viewers can’t wait to see how the others end up back in Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. As of last season, the series is the top-rated drama on television among its target demographic of ages 18–49. Although this season sees the unfortunate departure of Mark “McSteamy” Sloan (Eric Dane), it promises to bring even more drama for the rest of team. Grey’s Anatomy will premiere at 9 p.m. on ABC.
The Big Bang Theory
The previous season of the popular sitcom The Big Bang Theory ended with Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) finally making a romantic move on Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), as the group watched friend and aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) shoot off into space. Fans will be happy to see more of Sheldon’s sweet side this season. The romance continues as Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) start the season off continuing their relationship after Hofstadter’s awkward marriage proposal last season. The comedy comes back this Thursday at 8 p.m. on CBS.

Dear Patrick,
I had a couple of interviews with this company. I thought we were really hitting it off, but then they stopped returning my calls. Did I do something wrong? I’ve sent the company a couple of emails, but no response. Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks,
Jilted Obnoxiously By Some Teasing Recruiter Using Career Knowledge
Dear JOBSTRUCK,
Hey man, you’re just going to have to face it: The company turned you down. I know, I know; things may have seemed to be going well, but there was trouble in paradise. The company just couldn’t keep its eyes from wandering. You may feel betrayed, but that’s just how the game is played. You guys never DTR’ed (Defined The Relationship); that’s the key step. Don’t expect anything ’til you sign that contract.
Now you just need to get back on that horse. Sure, it would have been better if the company had called you and let you know that you two were over, but it’s just easier if they stop returning your calls. Now it’s time for you to play the field and send out some résumés. There’s a company out there for you; just keep looking. Find some place with good chemistry and nice health benefits.
But at the end of the night, don’t be afraid to settle,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’ve spent the last day in bed. I can’t think of a good reason to get up. I don’t have class today, I have my laptop with me, and there’s some food within reach. Give me a reason to not be such a lazy slob.
Thanks,
Comfortable, Overstuffed Mattress Attracts Today, Only Sleeping Eternally
Dear COMATOSE,
I’m confused; why would you want to get out of bed? I mean, that sounds pretty good to me. The only thing you really need to worry about is bed sores. But as long as you’re not in there for a week straight, I think you’ll be fine. The one argument I can give you is that you should go and experience the outdoors. For the next month or so, Pittsburgh will have the best weather it’ll have had all year. It’ll be cool enough that you won’t break into a sweat when you step outside, but warm enough that you won’t need five layers of sweaters.
Pittsburgh in the fall is beautiful. I know the outdoors can be scary, but it’s worth it. In another two months, it’ll be too cold and snowy to go out and do anything. That’s when you stay in bed all day with some hot chocolate.
Or just say you’re practicing corpse pose,
Patrick Hoskins

The Amazing Spider-Man
7 10 1
It’s only been a few years since the conclusion of director and producer Sam Raimi’s take on the Spiderman franchise, but why would that stop Hollywood from rebooting a guaranteed cash cow? The Amazing Spider-Man, led by director Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) and Emma Stone (Easy A), turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Garfield gives a solid performance and, as usual, Stone is incredibly charming. Coming from a Hollywood of remakes and headaches, the movie mostly avoids redundancy and has some moments of inventive variation on the tiring superhero template.
Chronicle
8 10 12
Using the “found footage” aesthetic made popular by movies like The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, Chronicle tells the story of a few high school students who develop telekinetic powers. The movie pulls from a variety of genres and styles, congealing into a superhero, sci-fi, pseudo-docudrama. Chronicle works to satisfy fans from many different backgrounds and tastes — and it mostly succeeds. The film is Josh Trank’s directing debut and features new acting talent in Dane DeHaan and Alex Russel.
Super
6 8 10
Super, starring Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page, plays on the recent popularity of powerless superheroes. The film carries some acute observations on the nature of loneliness and the psychosis that it can inspire. Wilson plays a man-child who has lived a dull life until his drug-addicted wife leaves him for a strip club owner. He is then divinely inspired to pursue superheroism and teams up with Page to fight petty crime throughout the city, becoming a media sensation. Like Kick-Ass, a movie made concurrently, Super uses extreme violence and melodrama to draw a portrait of the geek psyche.

The campus noise policy has been revised to limit the amount of noise coming from student organization activities on the Cut. The revisions were announced to leaders of Greek and student organizations in an email from Director of Student Activities Elizabeth Vaughan and Associate Director of Student Life for Upperclass and Greek Houses Lucas Christain. The new policy is also available online in Carnegie Mellon’s Student Handbook, The Word.
The main change is the clarification that the noise policy applies to both indoor and outdoor activities. In particular, the new policy is meant to target activities on the Cut.
“We received a lot of feedback from faculty, staff, and students saying that we need to preserve some periods for studying and being in class,” Christain said. “People were saying how they had to close windows in class because there was music coming from the Cut or from another part of campus.”
According to Christain, in the majority of the complaints, the noise was coming from student organizations, which is why he and Vaughan made a special announcement to student organization leaders. “It was important that student organizations were aware of this policy because a lot of their activities include tabling, hooking up speakers, or doing something on campus outside,” Christain said.
Both the current noise policy and the previous version, released in 1998, begin by specifying hours when certain types of noise are permissible, and both versions then go on to say that “excessive noise that results in a reasonable complaint from residents within or beyond the campus” is never permitted.
However, when specifying the hours, the 1998 version defines the type of noise restricted as “indoor activity that can be heard outside a university building.” The current revision expands this definition to include both indoor and outdoor noises, such as those from activities happening on the Cut. Specifically, the 2012 revision uses the umbrella phrase, “Activity occurring on Carnegie Mellon-owned or managed property that disrupts the normal course of business or is otherwise disruptive to the university or surrounding communities.”
Although one could argue that the 1998 version would still classify loud activity on the Cut as “excessive noise that results in a reasonable complaint,” the definition is vague and doesn’t acknowledge how outside activity, like the indoor activity referenced, can be “excessive” during certain times of the day while permissible at other times.
In short, the 2012 version clarifies what type of noise is allowed at what time. “The main difference was that there was more ambiguity in the previous version,” said Student Body President Will Weiner, a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major who helped draft the new policy. “These revisions are helpful insomuch as they let student leaders know what policies are actually in place.”
There are also changes to the hours when “disruptive noise” is permitted during both weekends and weekdays. On Monday through Thursday, such noise is only allowed between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., whereas in the 1998 version of the policy, noise was permitted from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. On Fridays, the hours are between 4:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., versus 4:30 p.m. to midnight in the 1998 version.
“We want to acknowledge that the university should have regular operating hours where the focus should primarily be studying and being in class,” Christain explained. “There’s a policy that undergraduate class[es] aren’t held, or shouldn’t be held, between 4:30 and 6:30, so it’s a free period of time that we can set aside for student activities.”
The 2012 policy also acknowledges that “a vibrant campus culture ... will necessarily involve some noise associated with campus activities.”
“We don’t want to squelch student life,” Christain said.
The new revisions also expand the permissible noise hours during the weekend. In the 1998 version of the noise policy, the hours were between 4:30 p.m. and midnight, while the current revision expands this period from 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
Although the 2012 revisions might restrict certain student organization activities, Weiner doesn’t think the policy will have much of an impact on campus. “Students are still allowed to play music and make noise on the Cut, but they should do so at a reasonable volume. At the end of the day, I don’t think the core culture of our university will change because people tabling have to turn down their speakers,” Weiner said.
Senior business administration major Alex Price, the general manager of WRCT, said he doesn’t anticipate the radio station being affected. “WRCT has always done its best to not disrupt classes and this new policy will not change any [of] our activities on the Cut,” he said in an email. “We want people to enjoy our music, not get an ear full of noise. Regardless of any ‘noise policy,’ WRCT always plays its music at an appropriate level while out on the Cut.”
According to Price, WRCT has known about the policy change since August. 
“My adviser for WRCT told me about it,” Price said. “He said that if we’re playing music where we normally do, and somebody’s walking by the UC, they shouldn’t need to raise their voices to hear themselves in that conversation. Then I saw the email and thought, ‘It’s really not a big deal.’ ”

Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is now expanding into Bakery Square in East Liberty. The university spin-off research center has recently leased 38,000 square feet of space from a now LEED-certified old Nabisco Bakery in Bakery Square.
Google, the University of Pittsburgh Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology, the UPMC Technology Development Center, and the VA Human Engineering Research Laboratories also reside in office complexes in the Bakery Square center. The SEI’s expansion will be housed on the first floor.
The lease was made by Walnut Capital Partners, and was officially announced to the public Sept. 12.
Paul Nielsen, director and CEO of the SEI, said in an email, “We’re over capacity in our Oakland offices and need more space due to growth in staffing. Bakery Square offered the best value and is still relatively close to campus compared to other office space available in the Pittsburgh area.”
Nielsen went on to emphasize that the SEI was “not ‘moving’ to Bakery Square, but expanding to there.” He said, “We will still remain in our existing Oakland sites — 4500 Fifth Ave., the CIC building, Sterling Plaza and the RAND building.”
As recorded in the SEI’s official press release, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said, “I am thrilled to welcome SEI to Bakery Square — a development that has been essential to the recent transformation of Pittsburgh’s East End. The announcement that Bakery Square is now 100 percent leased is an exciting and significant milestone for the project’s many dedicated stakeholders, especially Walnut Capital and RCG Longview Fund. The anticipation now rises for Bakery Square 2.0, which will provide even more office space, create more jobs, and grow our thriving high-tech innovation economy.”
The SEI describes itself on its website as a “a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the Department of Defense,” and works “closely with defense and government organizations, industry, and academia to continually improve software-intensive systems. Its core purpose is to help organizations to improve their software engineering capabilities and to develop or acquire the right software, defect free, within budget and on time, every time.”
The SEI’s website also explains that the institute was founded in 1984 at Carnegie Mellon by the Department of Defense, and currently has over 500 employees, with offices in Los Angeles; Arlington, Va.;  and Frankfurt, Germany.
The SEI’s government contract was recently extended through June 2015 for $584 million, according to a previous SEI press release.
“Expansions space was necessary because the staff we had in current facilities were getting overcrowded,” said Richard Lynch, the public relations manager for the SEI.
Lynch said that Bakery Square was chosen as a location “for a combination of reasons: We needed more space immediately, and that space is somewhat convenient to CMU and other SEI locations.”
According to Lynch, finance and business support services were the main departments being moved to Bakery Square. Lynch said that the move “frees up a certain amount of space in the main SEI building to facilitate more research staff.”

Faculty members, students, and alumni of the English department came together to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the university’s literary and cultural studies program last Thursday and Friday. According to English professor Kathy Newman, who organized the celebration, the program has produced over 300 alumni with master’s degrees or doctorates in literary and cultural studies since its inception in 1986.
The events kicked off Thursday with a short film titled “Tributaries: 25 Years of Literary and Cultural Studies at Carnegie Mellon University.” Created by doctoral candidates David Haeselin and Sheila Liming, the documentary focused on the history of literary and cultural studies, both as a broader academic field and, more specifically, at Carnegie Mellon in the past 25 years. The film also looked at the prospective future of the literary and cultural studies program. “The film tries to offer a conversation about where we have come from and where we are going,” Liming said.
“It’s a great way to learn something about [literary and cultural studies],” Bridget Powers, a first-year graduate student in the program, said of the film. “It’s definitely an umbrella term, where a lot of people think they know what it means, but they don’t.”
The advent of cultural studies came in the mid-20th century, when the term was coined at the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Culture Studies, Newman said. She described it as “studying literature and other forms of culture in the historical context in which that culture is produced ... [and] how and why people make culture.”
Many students and professors who viewed the film said that Carnegie Mellon’s program is unique in its highly interdisciplinary nature, and particularly in its emphasis on literature. “It’s really important at Carnegie Mellon that we remember the title of the department as ‘literary and cultural studies’.... This film is part of work to preserve the ‘and,’ ” Haeselin said.
Haeselin and Liming also emphasized the wide-ranging uses of a degree in literary and cultural studies; Liming called the program a “springboard for thinking about other cultural forms.”
After the film, the celebration moved to Danforth Lounge in the University Center, where seven of the program’s alumni — Carl Davenport, Rachel Delphia, Michael Scotto, Regina Anderson, David Pass, Matt Freeman, and Luke Niebler — talked about their experiences applying literary and cultural studies outside of the academic world.
The panelists have used their degrees in diverse ways. Delphia, for example, is the assistant curator of decorative arts at the Carnegie Museum of Art, while Scotto has just released a version of his book Be a Buddy, Not a Bully for the iPad.
The celebration concluded Friday evening with a keynote address by Larry Grossberg, professor of communication at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

Melding the realms of archaeology and poetry, Clayton Eshleman — American poet, translator, and editor — spoke about his experiences discovering ancient cave art in Southern France to an audience in Porter Hall last Thursday.
The lecture drew on Eshleman’s recent book of poetry, Juniper Fuse: Upper Paleolithic Imagination & the Construction of the Underworld. Eshleman cited the wicks made from juniper branches that he found during his cave excursions as the source of the book’s title. The symbolic title serves as a snippet of his book’s content, which draws heavily on Eshleman’s findings of Cro-Magnon rock art and its metaphorical interpretation.
An excerpt from Juniper Fuse reads, “The way a cave might leak perfume.... In the Cro-Magnons went, along its wet, hide walls as if a flower, way in, drew their leggy, tense traumatic bodies, spidering over bottomless hunches, groping toward Persephone’s fate.”
Throughout his presentation, Eshleman recreated his encounters with the cave art that inspired the poetry in his book. He projected slides of images from the art that influenced his writing in order to talk in detail about each piece and its symbolic or metaphorical significance.
Many images showed an advanced degree of intellectual development within the Cro-Magnons. One image of a horse head aligned with the outline of a vulva, Eshleman said, served as a metaphorical connection between “head power and vulva power.”
Some pieces of art that Eshleman displayed were painted with manganese or okra, in such detail that he compared to the work of artist Pablo Picasso.
Hybrid figures such as bison-humans or reindeer-bison reoccurred in many cave paintings; Eshleman said that the hybrid animal was “the engine of anima display.”
According to Eshleman, these imaginative figures influenced his detail-heavy prose-poetry in Juniper Fuse.
Some students who enjoyed Eshleman’s presentation nevertheless felt unsatisfied with its emphasis on the discovery of cave art, rather than on the poetic process.
Sophie Zucker, a first-year science and humanities scholar, said, “I didn’t feel like Eshleman was necessarily an expert on archaeology, and I wish I saw more of the writing aspect of his work rather than the facts that he had gathered.”
Eshleman delivered his lecture as part of the Victor M. Bearg Speaker Series sponsored by the Science and Humanities Scholars program, which is headed by William Alba.
Alba said, “What [Eshleman] is doing is a nice counterpoint to what we often do at CMU. We’re so involved in innovation and that requires us to be at the edge of today and tomorrow, whereas what he’s doing is looking at humanity and stretching it back to the distant past.”
In his opening remarks, Alba said, “With the sensitivity and insensibility of a poet, [Eshleman] translates his experiences so that we might better understand what he encountered there.”
Eshleman is a Professor Emeritus at Eastern Michigan University and author of over 40 books, including books of poetry and translations.

A local hostage situation ended peacefully on Friday when 22-year-old Klein Thaxton surrendered to police.
At approximately 8 a.m. on Friday morning, Thaxton entered the 16th floor of 3 Gateway Center in Downtown and took Charles Breitsman of CW Breitsman Associates, which organizes pension and benefit plans for other companies, hostage at knifepoint. Throughout the ensuing six-hour stand-off, Thaxton regularly updated his Facebook.
Thaxton, who pled guilty in January to robbery, receiving stolen property, simple assault, and reckless endangerment, wrote, “i cant take it no more im done bro,” and “this life im livn rite now i dnt want anymore ive lost everything and i aint gettn it back,” on his Facebook account, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Police shut down Thaxton’s Facebook account because it was distracting him from their attempts to negotiate.
As one of his demands, Thaxton asked to speak to his former girlfriend. Police granted the request. Negotiations were eventually successful. Thaxton surrendered to police at about 2 p.m.
Police have not yet revealed a motive for Thaxton’s actions. CNN reported that Pittsburgh Police Chief Nathan Harper said that police believe Thaxton targeted Breitsman specifically, but according to The New York Times, Harper said that Thaxton did not know Breitsman.
Breitsman was unharmed. According to The New York Times and CNN, Thaxton has been charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping, and terrorist threats.

CMU presents month-long Latin American film festival
Carnegie Mellon’s department of modern languages has partnered with the Latin American Cultural Union to present the Latinos In/On Film Festival 2012, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. The festival will show five films over the course of four weeks. It started last week and will end Oct. 12. The aim of the festival is to showcase the accomplishments of Latino  writers and filmmakers and the contributions of the Latino population to American culture.
“Showing this particular group of films during Hispanic Heritage Month is not just to acknowledge recent Spanish-speaking immigrants to the U.S., but primarily to acknowledge the historical presence of Latinos here, since Spanish colonial days and on into the 19th and early- to mid-20th century and beyond,” Hispanic studies associate professor Kenya Dworkin said in a university press release. “The Latino presence here is as much U.S. history as it is about more recent immigrants and exiles. These five films are a modest attempt at offering a glimpse of that vast experience as written and portrayed by U.S. Latinos.”
The first film, ...y no se lo tragó la tierra, was shown last Thursday. The remaining four films are El Súper, which will be shown this Wednesday; La guagua aérea, which will be shown Oct. 3; Nueba Yol, which will be shown Oct. 6; and A Day Without a Mexican, which will be shown Oct. 12. A discussion will follow each film.
Researchers launch shale literature review website
A team of Carnegie Mellon researchers, led by economics and public policy professor Robert Strauss and social and decision science professor Afeworki Paulos, has launched a comprehensive online compilation of literature on natural gas extraction in the Marcellus and Utica shales.
“Not surprisingly, there has been scant investigation of impacts of natural gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing in areas such as population change, transportation infrastructure, housing patterns, income or poverty and social services usage. There is very little knowledge about how this important economic driver is affecting so many aspects of our communities. The majority of the literature on this activity deals with economic, environmental, or public health impacts. And even these impacts are still under investigation,” Strauss said in a university press release.
The aim of the project is to allow policymakers to understand the body of research on natural gas extraction. The project catalogues over 1,200 academic articles, reports from think tanks, government documents, maps, and research guides. It can be searched by keyword or browsed by category.
The team compiled the literature with a grant from the Chrostwaite Institute, the nonprofit arm of the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs.

Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook recently took the stage in San Francisco, Calif., to announce the tech giant’s latest and greatest in handheld technology. Standing before a crowded room of tech enthusiasts, Cook discussed the release of a variety of new Apple products, including a redesigned iPod Touch, iPod Nano, and a device the world has been anticipating since 2010: the iPhone 5.
Although Cook followed tradition by unveiling the company’s latest smartphone at an annual press conference, he failed to meet the audience’s expectations for a device that stands to change the game of the smartphone world. Despite a variety of improvements over Apple’s earlier iPhone models, the iPhone 5 fails to impress on the same level as previous devices — yes, even the iPhone 4S.
I must admit the iPhone 5’s improvements over the 4S are vast: 4G LTE data speeds, a 4-inch screen, a thinner design, an improved charging port, revamped headphones, and a faster processor, to name a few.
But where is the “wow” factor that usually accompanies an iPhone unveiling? Where’s the new feature that sets the iPhone apart from its competitors and older siblings?
The original iPhone revolutionized the smartphone industry. The iPhone 3G made faster speeds mainstream and established the concept of an App Store. The 3GS even introduced an improved camera and beefier processor which, at the time, was enough to impress. The iPhone 4 welcomed FaceTime, a high resolution retina display, and a new hardware design. The 4S came equipped with sassy voice-assistant Siri.
No other phone had these features at the time of its release, effectively setting these iPhone models apart from the competition.
Now the tables have turned. Apple is no longer the leader in innovation, as evidenced from the iPhone 5’s announcement. None of the major features introduced by Apple at the conference are unique to the iPhone 5, and many of the features have already been integrated by other tech companies.
What about 4G LTE speeds? They’ve been around so long — since 2010 — that they have become standard among smartphones.
What about the bigger 4-inch screen? Been there, done that. With phones like the Samsung Galaxy S III, which boasts a 4.8-inch screen, the iPhone 5’s screen doesn’t seem so big.
But what about the new design? Take a look at the iPhone 4 and then ask yourself again how new the design is.
The release of the iPhone 5 is even more disappointing when one considers what could have been included beneath the shiny metal covering. 
With all the talk regarding near field communication (NFC), a technology that allows data transferring such as ticket or credit card payments through a smartphone, Apple had the chance to make an established but underdeveloped technology an industry standard. 
Not only would the inclusion of an easy-to-use version of NFC have set the iPhone 5 apart from other smartphones, it would have changed the way society handles store purchases.
Let’s face it: Apple is playing catch-up. In a world where it was once the leader, Apple has fallen behind the pack — or at least into the middle of a class of high-end smartphones. The latest iteration of the iPhone serves the sole purpose of adding necessary upgrades to a device that will sell record numbers because of its loyal fanbase and reputation, not because of innovative features.
That said, my preordered iPhone is set to ship soon and you can bet I’m counting down the seconds until it arrives.

Since this summer, there have been many significant changes to campus that affect the student body. We’ve seen parking meters erected on Margaret Morrison Street, the recently altered noise policy for student organizations, and new campus eateries added — to name just a few. 
Regardless of whether or not these developments directly benefit students, there is one complaint that connects all of them: Many students feel that they were not adequately informed of decisions that would affect them, if they were informed at all. 
This complaint should be addressed by the university administration as soon as possible.
The administration most likely has its own methods in place for deciding what information to disseminate to the student body, and these methods for deciding are probably well thought out.
However, judging by many students’ negative responses to their finding out about these changes after they’ve already occurred, the current methods of dissemination simply aren’t working.
The student body regularly receives emails about university press releases, usually regarding the retiring of faculty members or the achievements of alumni. 
While it’s admittedly important to acknowledge esteemed members of our community, these are pieces of news that might be best kept to the website meant for university press releases, in order to save these emails for changes in the Carnegie Mellon community that directly affect students. This would probably be a better option than emailing about every update, as students are rather inundated with campus-related emails already.
Another method of getting important information to interested parties might be to post everything on the university press releases website, then have members of Student Senate get out the information that’s pertinent to the student body’s livelihood through the use of social media like Facebook, Twitter, and website updates.
Regardless of how this problem is addressed, it should be done before students are surprised by yet another, perhaps unwelcome, change.

This month, another royal scandal hit the papers. This time, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, caught the media’s eye while she and her husband, Prince William, were vacationing in France. A photograph of the former Ms. Middleton sunbathing topless appeared in the French version of the magazine Closer, taken while the couple were staying in a private villa.
The royal family sued the French magazine and won; the magazine is no longer allowed to publish the photographs, under threat of heavy fines.
Of course, once this scandal became news, everyone had an opinion to offer. They ranged from Donald Trump’s totally unsympathetic statement via Twitter, “Kate Middleton is great — but she shouldn’t be sunbathing in the nude — only herself to blame,” to the unrealistic statement by Rosa Monckton, a friend of William’s late mother, who pleaded “leave Kate alone” via Twitter.
The Duchess and Duke have a right to their privacy, but that doesn’t mean they’ll get it. If the Duchess of Cambridge wants to take her shirt off while sunbathing with her husband, that’s her choice, but her decision will have consequences. The amount of effort people put into knowing every single detail about her life, and the lives of celebrities in general, is ridiculous. Unfortunately, it’s the level of obsession that comes with being a public figure.
Before Middleton’s marriage, the situation might have been different, but she married into one of the only royal families still prominent and active in the social world. She was the girl next door who married a prince. That’s the stuff from which Disney has made millions of dollars, so the story has a certain appeal. No one ever mentions the crazed paparazzi lurking at the end of your driveway after the nuptials are over, but hey, Disney’s only got two hours to work with.
The problem with living in such a media-dependent world is that nothing ever goes away. The Duchess learned that lesson the hard way this month; her brother-in-law Prince Harry learned it too, at a party in Las Vegas in August. What happens in Vegas definitely does not stay in Vegas, a private French villa is never completely private, and once something gets on the internet, it will never disappear. This is a lesson that applies to more than just the royal families of the world: college students would do well to remember it too. In a world where everyone and his mother has a smartphone, every minute has the potential to be caught on film.
Once those pictures hit the internet, there’s no going back. Right now, it may seem like a brilliant idea to post pictures of yourself drunk, smoking weed, or making out with your significant other. But what about when a company you want an internship with checks your Facebook? Or a potential employer investigates your Twitter? The internet is a public place, and people are going to be watching, regardless of your royal status.

This year, Dining Services has made a real effort to expand and improve on-campus dining locations, with the addition of at least four new eateries (Nakama Express, El Gallo de Oro, the Creperie, and Stackers). We appreciate the steps that have been made to improve students’ dining experience; for the most part, the changes have been successful.
Nakama Express, which replaced Sushi Too, has a larger variety of sushi blocks to choose from than did its predecessor, with a tasty and entirely vegetarian option available. The eatery also has a Chef’s Special Creation menu item, adding a little variety to students’ often routine dining experiences.
Stackers is another new restaurant in Resnik. Its sandwich-building station, similar to Subway or Quiznos, is a welcome addition on campus. The Creperie, located on the second floor of the University Center, is also doing quite well, with frequent long lines of students waiting for sweet or savory crepes.
The one new addition to campus dining that doesn’t sit quite well with the Carnegie Mellon community is El Gallo de Oro. 
As good as the eatery’s quesadillas might be, it will always and forever be compared to more popular Mexican cuisine, like Chipotle or other burrito chains. Students have these tasty options readily available off campus, so if El Gallo de Oro wants to win over students, it needs to step up its game.
And while many of the new dining locations have impressed us, some of the older ones have as well. Skibo, for instance, has really improved the quality of its food since last year. Many students have a love-hate relationship with the eatery because of its history of subpar food and spotty service. But where else can a hungry, stressed-out student get a bite to eat late at night?
Skibo seems to have improved its service. The staff seems to be keeping more food in stock so late-night eaters have an actual menu to order from, there are more side items to choose from, and they’re putting some extra care into food preparation. The eatery hasn’t changed much on their menu, so when the quality of the food improves, it’s especially noticeable.
If you’ve been disillusioned with campus eateries in the past, give them another chance. We would encourage students to try out all the new dining locations and give Dining Services the feedback it needs.

With the upcoming election, we as citizens and potential voters are subjected to a veritable storm of political advertisements.
One campaign advertisement supporting President Barack Obama called Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney a “corporate raider,” saying that he sent thousands of jobs overseas at Bain Capital while showing pictures of him smiling. It clearly casts his past business career in a malicious light, making it seem like Romney enjoyed outsourcing American jobs. On the other hand, various Romney campaign advertisements criticize Obamacare and suggest that Obama has it out for old people. Pictures of depressed and lonely-looking senior citizens flash by, while the advertisements talk about raising the costs of services for the elderly.
While the accuracy of either of these claims is debatable, our candidates are clearly attempting to manipulate voters’ emotions. Such strategies have always been in American politics; politicians will always manipulate their opponents’ images and mudsling. It is far easier to convince the average voter by playing to his or her fears and desires rather than by using concrete facts.
I find these advertisements distasteful, regardless of the side they are aimed at. However, these personal attacks are not the politicking technique that makes me the most furious. Politicians toss around statistics, often using the same one or two numbers in order to make a point. These statistics are usually simple and therefore easy to use as a talking point and a buzzword. The trouble with these sound bite-style statistics is that they are often misleading, out of context, or just plain wrong.
To illustrate, on Sept. 8, Obama claimed at an appearance in Seminole, Fla., that, “We’ve doubled our use of renewable energy.” However, there is more to this catch-all statistic that meets the eye. When one digs a little deeper, it is clear that this accomplishment is far less important than it seems. The use of all types of renewable energy has actually only increased by 55 percent, according to PoltiFact.com. Solar and wind power match up to Obama’s statistic, but they make up only a fraction of renewable energy sources. After including the less impressive growth in sources like hydroelectric and geothermal power, Obama’s claim becomes completely false.
The president is by no means the only one doing this: Romney spouts similar misleading statistics. In a recently released video of a private Romney fundraising event, he said that 47 percent of households don’t pay taxes. It appears to be a shocking failure in the American tax code.
But there’s a catch. First, that fact is no longer accurate, as it’s based off data taken from 2009. In addition, the statistic only refers to federal income taxes. Many families make so little that they don’t pay federal income taxes, but they still pay state and local taxes as well as investment and payroll taxes. 
In both cases, the statistic is technically true, but only by a caveat that is either made or disregarded by the candidate. It’s clear that politicians can use statistics to control and manipulate us. The real question is, why are we as a society allowing that to happen?
The reason politicians get to depend on statistics is because people are ignorant of their true nature. We need a populace that gains skepticism of all simple sound bite statistics by understanding them at a basic level. This means we need to reprioritize our mathematical education system. We need a bigger emphasis on statistics and statistical analysis at an earlier age.
By helping the population see through the haze and fog of twisted statistics, we can have a voting populace that is far more capable of seeing beyond politicking and mudslinging. Another aspect of democracy is its goal to represent the common man’s opinion and serve the people. If the people can see clearly what is happening in their country by interpreting data, they can more easily cast their vote in accordance with their beliefs and opinions.

With Nov. 6 quickly approaching, voters will once again make important decisions that will shape the future of the nation. However, with recent changes to the voting process — including the institution of the Voter ID Law — voting may become more difficult. In addition to this law, college students in particular may find voting in this coming election especially troublesome because of issues with absentee voting and the potential lack of proper identification.
With these impending difficulties, we deeply appreciate the measures taken by student government, College Democrats, PennPIRG, and other partnered organizations to make voter registration easier and more accessible to students.
If you have crossed the Cut since the semester started, then you have no doubt seen the tables set up to register students to vote or to provide additional help for students who are currently registered in other states. Volunteers are also scattered across campus, approaching students in attempts to ensure that they will be able to vote on Election Day.
At times, being approached every day by volunteers with clipboards asking you if you’re registered can be annoying. However, this is preferable to not having any readily available resources.
With the hectic schedules and immense workloads most students face, making sure you are properly registered to vote before the appropriate deadlines may not be so easy. Providing options and information to the student body on campus helps alleviate some issues with the convoluted registration system.
The student government executives have outlined further plans to increase awareness for the coming election and to ensure that students have the resources available to properly register. These measures include making absentee voting methods available and summarizing the positions of local candidates for students, according to the student government executives’ platform and a recent letter to The Tartan on student government initiatives and progress.
We commend student government’s coordination efforts with College Democrats and PennPIRG to register student voters, and we hope such efforts are further expanded upon throughout the semester as we approach Election Day.
Providing these resources to students is an excellent way to counteract the apathy that often plagues Carnegie Mellon’s campus and to ensure that our voices are heard in the coming election.

Would you be willing to kill for your beliefs? A portion of us may be able to profess our willingness to die for what we hold most dear, but taking the life of another doesn’t often factor into our thought processes. Yet there are those who seem to be on the offensive in being offended, taking even the smallest slight against their ideas as a declaration of war.
Recently Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, under the assumed name of Sam Bacile, released a film titled Innocence of Muslims. The film depicts the Muslim prophet Muhammad as a child abuser, womanizer, and homosexual. Needless to say, such a portrayal of the figure — who, in the Islamic faith, is not meant to be depicted at all — stirred up quite the controversy.
In the days after the film’s translation into Arabic, there were mass riots outside various Western embassies. Flags were burned, threats were issued, and many were injured; some even died. 
Unfortunately, such a turn of events should come as no surprise considering the 2005 controversy of a Danish cartoon’s depiction of Muhammad, as well as various other examples that have made headlines in the past decade.
Nakoula was well aware of the response his film would elicit, and probably counted on it. He deceived those he worked with in the production of the film — he pretended to be a Jewish Israeli, when in fact he is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. More importantly, an actor from the film, Miles Crawley, revealed to the Los Angeles Times that Nakoula duped the film’s actors into thinking they were in a Biblical-era reenactment and proceeded to overdub a portion of their lines with references to Muhammad and the Quran.
There is no question that the actions taken by Nakoula were wrong, and they should in no way be excused.
The film itself is extremely offensive not just to Muslims, but also to the sensibilities of most people. That being said, it speaks of a more dire problem that approximately 14 minutes of a YouTube video can spark global violence.
South Park, Family Guy, and other such programs have made far more offensive material directed at Christians in the past, and even the most Bible-thumping of the evangelicals have done little more than express their typical canned response involving their being “oppressed.”
How is it that, in this day and age, there are still ideas that are unassailable? It is depressing if one cannot express criticism without the fear of death. Such an extremist, fundamentalist, and distorted view of the ideology attempts to destroy any and all opposition to it, instead of discussing the problems raised in a levelheaded and rational matter.
There may not be a solution to this problem, other than perhaps waiting several more generations for the most fervent adherents to disappear.
But such a solution is not an adequate response to what appears to be one of the most grave matters of our time. Coupled with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and our continued misuse of natural resources, I shudder to think what future we will be left to inherit, if any at all.
One can only hope that there can be an awakening of skepticism and free thinking on a level far greater than the recent reactionary measures taken throughout the world. I wrote last week that maybe creationism was finally in its death throes, but it would appear that fundamentalism of a different flavor will put up a much greater fight.
I will question everything, and never become so steadfast or confident in my worldview so as to inflict harm upon those who dissent. 
I encourage you to do the same, but I won’t threaten violence if you don’t.

Dear Carnegie Mellon,
Up until now, I didn’t think I’d changed at all since high school. I still believe in the same things, make the same lame jokes, forget people’s names, and all that stuff. But actually, Carnegie Mellon, you’ve made me forget what the word “hard” means.
I realized this when some students in Concepts class complained that the homework was too hard because they had to get help on it. My first reaction was to laugh because, duh, you weren’t supposed to know how to do it without help. But not all of them know that. I didn’t when I first came to college.
If I could flash back to freshman year, you would see someone constantly wrestling with feelings of inadequacy. 
Every time I couldn’t solve a problem on the problem set, I blamed the professor for making things too hard or blamed my own intelligence. It sucked. I felt small every day.
But somewhere along the way, I realized that you were supposed to need help. If the homework was easy enough that you could just coast by, then you were actually wasting your time, because it’s when things are challenging and you need help or you’re going to die that you end up learning and getting more out of stuff.
As a result, I literally don’t see anything as “hard” anymore. If anything, it’s “doable,” and the idea that every problem you could ever come across is doable is a comforting idea. I have to thank you, Carnegie Mellon, for constantly making me do things that I don’t immediately understand because I no longer see uncertainty as a measure of my intelligence, but rather of my initiative.
TL;DR: By making me feel stupid, I don’t feel stupid anymore.

You’ll chill out this week once you realize the Ares you were thinking of doesn’t have an “i.” You’ll settle for rooting for St. Louis, even though being worshiped in Sparta would’ve been nice.
Living up to your name, you’ll be doing a lot of bullsh*tting this week.
That Parent Trap-type scheme you and your sibling were preparing has already been anticipated. It’s best to move on to Plan B and disguise yourselves as Schwarzenegger and DeVito, à la Twins.
After the zip-tie incident, you’ll be really glad you’re a giant crab and not a malignant neoplasm.
You’ll soon find that your status as King of the Jungle will be called into question when the elephants demand to see your long-form birth certificate.
Drop the act. We all know that you’re not a Virgin — Virgin Mobile user, that is. Your iPhone is always on full display. Try being more discreet about it this week.
Unfortunately for you, the scales are decidedly not in your favor this week. Maybe getting involved with some social justice issues will tip them back into balance.
Try not to poison as many people with your tail in the future, or you may well end up in one of those weird novelty lollipops you’ve heard so much about.
Despite current economic conditions, job opportunities are on the rise for you. Dressage is getting big these days, and if that doesn’t work out, you’d be perfect for the NYPD’s Mounted Unit (provided you don’t snicker at the name).
Your swimming lessons shouldn’t be too baaaaaad, but the cans you plan on eating later may get soggy.
The only “dawning of the age” you’ll be experiencing this week is when it dawns on you how old you have to be to get this reference — or you’re in CFA. Either way, you will feel slightly bereft of energy at the thought.
Something’s fishy about your future prospects. Stick to the rivers and streams that you’re used to.
