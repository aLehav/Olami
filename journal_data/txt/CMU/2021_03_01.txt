Match 1 - Leipzig vs Liverpool
The game between Leipzig and Liverpool got off to an intense start. Both teams registered shots on target in the first 15 minutes, but neither was able to capitalize before halftime. Going into the second half, Leipzig seemed to get an opportunity when Christopher Nkunku made a run behind the Liverpool defense, but a good save by Alisson Becker denied Leipzig the lead. A stumble from Lukas Klostermann in the 53rd minute resulted in an interception by Mohamed Salah, who quickly converted to put Liverpool in front. Just minutes later, a slip by Nordi Mukiele gifted a golden chance to Sadio Mané, who extended Liverpool’s lead. Despite Leipzig’s best efforts, the scoreline remained 2-0 at the final whistle. The German side will need to win by two goals or more at Anfield next week if they want to advance to the next round.
Match 2 - Barcelona vs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)
In a game that felt an awful lot like when these two teams last met in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16, Barcelona’s defense looked disorganized, and PSG attackers often found themselves unmarked. An early penalty converted by Lionel Messi gave Barça the lead, but a well-controlled effort by Kylian Mbappé equalized for the visitors just five minutes later. At halftime, the score was locked at 1-1. Barça’s defense continued to be spotty in the second half, conceding another goal by Mbappé and a goal by Moise Kean in the 65th and 70th minutes, respectively. Mbappé then completed his hat-trick with yet another goal in the 85th minute, securing a 4-1 win for PSG. It’s not over for Barcelona, who found themselves in a similar situation back in 2017 against this very same team and managed to overcome it, but they will need to win by at least four goals away at the Parc des Princes.
Match 3 - Sevilla vs Borussia Dortmund
It was a rocky start for Dortmund when a deflected shot from Suso opened the scoring for Sevilla in the seventh minute, but a fantastic long-range effort by Mahmoud Dahoud in the 19th minute equalized for the visitors. A brace by Erling Haaland then made the scoreline 3-1 in favor of Dortmund going into halftime. Substitute Luuk de Jong pulled a goal back for the hosts in the 84th minute, but it was too little, too late. Still, the two away goals could prove valuable, as Sevilla can advance by winning by a single goal next week to progress to the next round.
Match 4 - Porto vs Juventus
A mistake by the Juventus backline inside their own box practically gifted the ball to Mehdi Taremi, who put the hosts in front after just over a minute played. Although Juventus proceeded to dominate possession, they found themselves unable to break through Porto’s defense, and the score remained 1-0 going into halftime. Perhaps feeling like they hadn’t made enough of an impression, Porto then proceeded to score another quick goal, with Moussa Marega extending the hosts’ lead to 2-0 barely 20 seconds after the starting whistle of the second half. Despite being two goals down, Juventus continued to look sluggish. A goal by Federico Chiesa in the 82nd minute provided little consolation for the Italian side, who will have to play much better to win against Porto at home next week.
Match 5 - Atlético Madrid vs Chelsea
Despite statistics suggesting that Chelsea dominated against Atléti, this game was rather tight. The Spanish side made several good attacks and looked solid in their build-up, but the Chelsea defense proved watertight, denying Atléti even a single shot on target. In contrast, Chelsea monopolized both the possession and the number of shots, but the majority of their efforts were firmly stopped by Jan Oblak. The deadlock was unbroken by halftime, and it seemed like it would take an exceptional effort for either side to score. This sort of effort came for Chelsea in the form of Olivier Giroud, who performed a spectacular bicycle kick to put the visitors ahead. The game finished 1-0 to the English side, and Atléti will need to win at Stamford Bridge in two weeks if they want to stay in the competition.
Match 6 - Lazio vs Bayern Munich
Facing the defending champions, underdogs Lazio needed to play a perfect game. Unfortunately, mistakes marred the Italian side’s chances. The first came in the form of a weak back-pass by Mateo Musacchio in the ninth minute, which was quickly intercepted and converted by Robert Lewandowski for the visitors. 17-year-old Jamal Musiala then scored a second for the German side from the edge of the box, becoming the second-youngest goalscorer in Champions League knockout stage history. Lazio upped their aggressiveness, but in doing so, also created more mistakes, with a slip by Patric giving Leroy Sané the opportunity to extend Bayern’s lead to 3-0 going into halftime. The second half started even worse for Lazio, with an own goal by Francesco Acerbi giving the defending champions a 4-0 lead. A solid run by Joaquin Correa finally pulled a goal back for the hosts, with the game ending 4-1 in favor of the visitors. This means that Bayern Munich is now on the longest unbeaten away streak in Champions League history. With Lazio needing to win by four goals against a formidable Bayern side away from home in two weeks, the odds are certainly stacked against I Biancocelesti.
Match 7 - Atalanta vs Real Madrid
The game between Atalanta and Real Madrid got off to a turbulent start after a foul just outside the Atalanta box resulted in a controversial red card for Remo Freuler in the 17th minute. Down to 10 men, Atalanta played the rest of the match defensively. A seemingly mediocre Real Madrid had trouble capitalizing on their chances and found themselves unable to convert the shots they had. It wasn’t until the 86th minute of the game that a powerful shot from outside the box by Ferland Mendy gave the visitors the lead they had desperately hoped for. With the game finishing 1-0 to Real Madrid, Atalanta will need to win away in two weeks to progress to the quarterfinals.
Match 8 - Borussia Mönchengladbach vs Manchester City
Mönchengladbach put in a good performance, but couldn’t hold out against a much stronger City side. The first goal came from a well-placed header by Bernardo Silva in the 29th minute, with the scoreline at 1-0 in favor of the visitors going into halftime. A second goal by Gabriel Jesus in the 65th minute secured a 2-0 win for Manchester City, giving the English side a comfortable lead heading into the second leg. For Gladbach, it will be an uphill battle — when they meet City again in two weeks, they will need to win by two goals or more to keep their Champions League hopes alive.

For every 100 of those infected with the coronavirus (which has now reached a global total surpassing 113 million confirmed cases), about 30 individuals are asymptomatic. Not only do they not present symptoms within the first two weeks of receiving the virus, but they go on to never display any signs of the virus. This makes them perfect carriers for the coronavirus.
This finding was presented in Thorax, a monthly peer-reviewed journal specializing in respiratory medicine, along with the observation that those asymptomatic carriers were 75 percent as likely to transmit the virus as symptomatic carriers. In other words, people who showed no symptoms were 75 percent as likely to transmit the coronavirus to others when compared to those who displayed symptoms. 
So what’s the underlying factor responsible for whether one shows symptoms of the coronavirus when infected — is it lifestyle, age, gender, weight, heredity, or geographical location? The answer, surprisingly, might lie within two specific sections of Neanderthal DNA.
Neanderthals are one of the many ancestors of modern humans. They roamed the Earth for a long time before homo sapiens, the scientific name for humans, became the dominant species of the genus homo. The extinction of Neanderthals 40,000 years ago was attributed to various factors such as climate change or an unknown disease. However, much of their DNA remains prominent in the human genetic code. According to the Smithsonian, there is a 1 to 4 percent overlap between Neanderthals and modern humans today. 
Interested in investigating this similarity between Neanderthal and human DNA, the researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden collaborated with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany to find a major genetic risk factor located on chromosome 3 of the human genome. This risk factor is directly linked to a dramatic increase in the risk of respiratory failure, and has also been linked to a higher risk of coronavirus mortality. A single copy of a particular version of chromosome 3 has been known to lead to cells being unable to rally immune defenses when faced with the virus. 
This itself is not a new finding; there has been much prior research stating that chromosome 3 also plays an important role when a person is infected with a flu virus. Yet, scientists Hugo Zeberg (Karolinska Institute) and Svante Pää (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) found that the version of chromosome 3 that increases a person’s risk for showing symptoms of the coronavirus is almost identical to the chromosome present in Neanderthals. Thus, the researchers suspected that inherited Neanderthal DNA was directly responsible for a person’s likelihood to be asymptomatic when infected with COVID-19.
Still, this is only half of the story. Almost two weeks ago, these same researchers also discovered another genetic factor present on chromosome 12. Unlike the genetic factor on chromosome 3, this newest one actually reduces the risk of needing intensive care upon infection with the coronavirus. This is due to oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) genes, which counters viral attacks that take place in the body. 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthase (OAS1) is one such gene located on chromosome 12, and its main purpose is to regulate the activity of an enzyme that breaks down the virus’ genes. 
Out of the variants of OAS1, the version directly inherited from Neanderthals was found to be the most effective at breaking down invading viruses’ genes. 
To test the direct effects of OAS1, researchers at McGill University in Ontario, Canada conducted a two-sample randomization study among 504 individuals, all of whom were infected with the virus. The results of this study showed a high level of OAS1 was associated with a lower likelihood of contracting the virus, as well as reduced severity of coronavirus symptoms. The researchers currently have plans to use this finding to create pharmacological treatments to increase OAS1 levels in patients to improve immunity.
In addition to the fields of infectious medicine, this new finding relating Neanderthal genes with COVID-19 immunity is a great revelation for the fields of evolutionary biology, especially when it comes to solving the mystery behind the extinction of Neanderthals. Many scientists speculate that Neanderthals might have faced extinction due to a pandemic similar to the one that humanity is facing right now. Since the end of the Ice Age 11,500 years ago, the two genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA, especially the protective variant on chromosome 12, have greatly increased in frequency thanks to human migration. This could imply that humans have a greater, natural immunity to the coronavirus than their ancestors did. However, there is still much more left to understand about genetic interactions, as well as Neanderthal physiology, before anything can be concluded.

Improved microneedle arrays for vaccine delivery
No one likes getting shots, but vaccines and herd immunity are important components of both public and personal health and wellbeing. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus has mainly been on developing novel vaccines to combat the virus, but equally important to having an effective vaccine is having a system that can reliably and efficiently deliver it into the human body. Focusing on this problem, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Engineering and the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine are working together to develop better dissolvable microneedle arrays that can deliver live virus vaccines. The work is led by Burak Ozdoganlar, professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon and associate director of the Engineering Research Accelerator, and Paul Duprex, director of Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research.

Soft starfish robots
We are all used to thinking of robots as rigid, metallic contraptions filled to the brim with circuitry and motors, but soft robots are literally more flexible and applicable to different scenarios, especially in hazardous terrains where traditional robots may crash or malfunction. Inspired by the brittle star starfish, Zach Patterson, a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering, has created a soft robot with rubber limbs capable of crawling underwater, untethered. Utilizing the concept of alloy deformations, the robot, named PATRICK, moves by contractions of its limbs caused by an applied electric current and comes replete with a fully fleshed-out computational infrastructure. Designing an untethered soft robot with on-board electronics is a major step forward for soft robotics, and Patterson sees PATRICK as a catalyst for further research into soft machines.

If you do anything even remotely related to computer science, you probably know about GitHub. GitHub is a fantastic platform where you can contribute to open-source code, as well as host any personal or collaborative programming projects. This guide is mainly for people who haven't heard a lot about GitHub, but are interested in getting started with it.
GitHub is kind of like an online file storage system where you can upload your code and share it with others, except with many more perks. For one, it uses Git, a version control system that tracks the changes in your code made every time you "commit" your files (which is basically like uploading your files to GitHub).
Git allows you to work on multiple versions of the same code at the same time. For instance, if you and your teammate are working on the same code file, Git is able to merge your code with theirs, ensuring that both your and your teammate’s changes are preserved. Git also allows you to keep different versions of your code project in the form of branches. For example, if you have an already-working version of your program that is being used, you can put that in a "production" branch, and your new version of the program with new features (and probably new bugs) can go into a "development" branch so that any new bugs don't affect the already-working versions. For these reasons, many professional developers use Git, so GitHub can be a great way to learn a technology that many companies use (and that can get you hired in interviews!).
There are other platforms similar to GitHub that use Git as well, like BitBucket, but while BitBucket is better for professional teams, GitHub is better for individuals who want to contribute to open-source projects every so often but have other work outside of their GitHub projects.
Open-source projects are projects in which all the code is made freely available. While a lot of open-source projects are small side hustles made for fun by various developers, there are many large projects that are open source as well. For example, projects like Microsoft Visual Studio Code, dogecoin, and Facebook React.js can all be found on GitHub, and anyone with a GitHub account can contribute and propose changes to improve them. Some of the ways you can contribute are to submit an issue that you've found in the code, or, if you think you can fix an issue, you can submit a pull request with the code that you have fixed.
In addition, GitHub has features that are good for personal portfolios that you can use in professional interviews and applications. For one, all the repositories (where all the code and branches of your project is stored) show up automatically on your user profile, as well as a diagram of the number of commits you've made over the past year, both of which are very useful for potential employers.
GitHub also comes with a free website hosting service called GitHub Pages. If you know your way around HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies, you can easily convert a GitHub repository into a working website. If not, GitHub Pages is also integrated with Jekyll, software that generates pre-built websites in a GitHub repository that you can easily modify to your liking.
Many recommend dipping your toe into GitHub earlier rather than later, as it is pretty easy to get started, but can help you immensely for the future. Not only can you build personal portfolios, but you can also contribute to other open-source projects and show that you are ready for a professional career in computer science.

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the Top 5 most-liked memes on the Facebook group, Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, posted in the past month.
1 “[INSERT: Shapely pun]” by Simon Lee (10/10) 
(INSERT: PENDING)
[INSERT: caption] The caption is simple: “pain.”
2 “Wishful Thinking” by Sihan Wu (9/10)
In her post’s caption, Wu asks if having Carnival next spring “is... wishful thinking,” and for good reason. Carnival is such an integral part of the Carnegie Mellon experience, and I can’t imagine going through college without it. Hopefully next year, we can do more than visit each others’ islands on Animal Crossing (if kids still even play that). Also, props to the Comic Sans text and the stock photo watermark.
3 “Best We Can Do” by Mansour Elsharawy (8/10)
I’m a bit unsure as to what the rationale of having a Tuesday off was. It feels a bit like it was chosen by throwing a dart at the spring 2021 calendar and choosing the closest date to where the dart landed. Unfortunately, I’m also unsure as to how effective this day off was for most students. I’m sure someone was able to get a bit extra rest, but the amount of work that many of us were stuck with to complete on our “day off” made this day off feel… not like one.
4 “Donner Depression” by Joe Horowitz (9/10)
The inspirational background matches the motivational message written on the meme. My deepest condolences to all those who have experienced living in Donner in one way or another, especially for those who are living there now.
5 “Fat (Responsibilities) Tuesday” by Zachary Leventhal (8/10)
Gonna have to dock a couple of points for the choice in font. Impact should be left in the early 2010’s (unless it’s used ironically). However, the meme hits too close to home and is top quality content-wise. I’m sure one person was able to take a break on the random Tuesday off Zoom University, but it appears that the day off was hardly that for too many students.

WandaVision seems, at first, like it's just comfort food. More Avengers! Cameos and references! More of that Marvel humor! And, of course, a premise that leaves casual fans wondering if they need to watch the movies!
On viewing, WandaVision has all of that. It's a Marvel show that is very comfortable with itself. In many ways, though, it's more comfortable to watch and less stilted than many other Marvel productions. For one thing, there's only been a handful of scenes where Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Wanda, did an eastern European accent and wore the corset she hates from the movies. Paul Bettany occasionally gets to appear without the two-hour makeup that is Vision (still, I shudder to think of how many hours were spent doing his makeup during filming). Most of all, WandaVision gets to emulate its favorite sitcoms and create an element of mystery and thrill underneath.
This helps WandaVision become mostly enjoyable, sometimes gripping, and pretty entertaining. Wanda and Vision make a great pair, and their misadventures within the sitcom they somehow got stuck in are hilarious. The homages to classic sitcoms are endless, but the show also jumps from the '60s, '70s, and '80s sitcoms to modern shows even I can recognize like Malcolm in the Middle and Modern Family. WandaVision doesn't get stuck doing just one thing, and that pays dividends when one episode falls flat.
Of course, the show evolves into the traditional Marvel affair with futuristic government agencies, "science" and "hacking," and one scene where a group of soldiers readily aids in what I am pretty sure is insubordination with multimillion-dollar equipment to boot. The characters and plot on the outside of Wanda and Vision's sitcom somehow make even less sense than what is happening inside of it. The carefree fun of the sitcom part of WandaVision is a little too much of a relief compared to the rest of it. The outside world is really just more of the same Marvel formula. There are interesting characters the show does not give enough time to like Monica Rambeau (played by Teyonah Paris) and Jimmy Woo (Randall Park), but there are also ones that do not make sense but play big roles, like Director Hayward (Josh Stamberg).
While Marvel circles outside Wanda and Vision's fantasy, their adventures inside get more convoluted as they try to hide (or uncover) reality. Despite, or maybe because of, the stale Marvel elements happening outside Wanda and Vision's reality, WandaVision takes off as a gripping story of superheroes struggling when their wishes don't come true. As the season has gone on, the awkward split-screen between the Marvel movie happening on the outside and the sitcom on the inside have merged to become somewhat of a thriller. So far, it doesn't look like the standard superhero shenanigans can solve Wanda's problems, and I'm here for it.  
The push-and-pull of Wanda and Vision's sitcom and the reality waiting for them outside help make this show into more than just comfort food. Even though I have to wait a week for each new episode, this is one show I'm willing to mark my calendar for.

Sia’s newest movie, Music, was released on Feb. 10. Since its announcement through the trailer, this film has sparked controversy and outrage among the autistic community and its many allies. 
Written by Sia and Dallas Clayton, the film follows a young autistic girl named Music, her sister Kazu, and the family they create together. It stars Kate Hudson as Kazu and Maddie Ziegler as Music. Ziegler’s acceptance of the role of Music and Sia’s hiring of Ziegler, a neurotypical actress, is what makes the movie so controversial. In addition to this, the film deals with a number of intense subject matters such as "restraint," which appears to be portrayed in an ignorant and unqualified manner by Sia despite her claim of having advisors present during the construction. Further complicating the matter, as quoted by BBC News, the movie has been nominated for several Golden Globe Awards, which only bolsters the fictitious and inaccurate representation of autism. 
News platforms such as The Guardian, The New York Times, and New York Post were among others in covering the movie’s content through opinion pieces. The Guardian's Simran Haus claimed that Ziegler’s acting was “a problem, especially given the cartoonishness of her portrayal, which sees her gurning, grimacing, and mumbling through her scenes.” The New York Times’ Teo Bugbee wrote that “Ziegler’s dancing is as expressive as ever, but she has been directed to pantomime an exaggerated apery of disability. [...] the choreography leads her through a cruel approximation of twitches and whoops.” New York Post’s Johnny Oleksinski wrote that Ziegler’s facial expressions and character portrayal are “an uncomfortably heightened imitation that never rings true and verges on mockery.” 
A group called NeuroClastic, run by members of the autistic community, constructed a guide for viewing the movie. It outlines specific themes and topics and discusses them from the perspective of autistic people. It also provides resources for those who are interested in reading more on the topics that the movie covers or just interested in learning more about autism. 
One article covers the destructive nature of Autism Speaks, an organization that Sia consulted while assembling her film. The dominant issue with Autism Speaks as an organization is their affirmation that autism can be “conquered” as a disease. “The problem? Autism is not a disease to be battled and conquered. It is considered a developmental disability. It is a neurological difference in brain wiring. Cancer is a disease. Autism is not.” The article goes on to outline that “Autism Speaks created a culture, identity, and their own version of 'the autism community.’” 
Cheyenne Thornton wrote an article on NeuroClastic describing individual experiences and also covering the research and subsequent execution of the film in relation to prior research. “From the moment I heard Sia describe her project as a such, I knew there would be problems. Don’t get me wrong, many of us would be happy to see themselves represented on screen at all — but we have hit a threshold of not being able to tolerate ‘at least they tried’ anymore.” She continues in the article to explore the reasoning behind why many people back autism organizations, yet don’t understand that the information being promoted is “demeaning, archaic information taught about autism when the solution to having an autistic kid was institutionalization.”
After being advised from both news sources and credible sites such as NeuroClastic, it is evident that this movie was vastly underprepared and under-researched. The movie is currently playing in theaters and runs for 1 hour and 47 minutes. Not surprisingly, it received a 9 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, a critics website which deemed the movie as “Offensive in its depiction of autism — and painfully misguided in essentially every respect.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic still raging and vaccines not widely available for college students, on-campus events at Carnegie Mellon have been missing from common spaces. For the events that have continued, the responsibilities of both students and staff in managing these events have escalated.
One of the simplest parts of Carnegie Mellon's strategy has been to advise against gathering on campus. In a notice effective Feb. 27, Carnegie Mellon "strongly discouraged" in-person gatherings among students. "Under no circumstances should students host or attend in-person gatherings where physical distancing cannot be maintained at all times," it read. Students and staff also have new responsibilities meant to keep the few approved on-campus buildings safer.
Marcia Gerwig, director of the Cohon University Center (CUC), detailed some of these new duties in an interview. Staff are required to wipe down equipment between classes held at the CUC, in addition to cleaning the facility overnight. CUC staff must also ensure that there are face coverings and hand sanitizer at entrances and the information desk. Visitors are also expected to abide by campus-wide rules, like wearing a mask, but the building is only accessible with a Carnegie Mellon ID, and it is closed from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. for cleaning. Tartan Testing also distributes test kits out of the CUC, and parts of the CUC, like Wiegand Gymnasium and the weight and exercise rooms, have their own occupancy limits.
When asked what was different about her job since the pandemic started, Gerwig responded, "The biggest change, really, is there are much fewer people in the building." She added, "It's like the summer population, like very few students." While there have been fewer students at the CUC, the building still hosts some club activities, like dance groups. Still, she said, "A lot of times even the in-person classes where we have room reserved for classes to be held are held remote and students don't come to the building."
Some classes are offering in-person instruction, but students can only attend a maximum of 30 to 40 percent of their hybrid classes in person. Student organizations are required to hold their meetings remotely, and, for indoor activities that clubs want to hold, there are minimum square footage requirements. Student organizations also must designate Student Pandemic Safety Ambassadors (SPSAs) whose responsibilities include enforcing "expectations and requirements" and attending any in-person activities held by their organizations. For clubs to hold in-person events, their SPSAs must apply and have their proposed event reviewed.
For Gerwig, the lack of people and the new rules have meant "the few students we do interact with is to explain COVID requirements and COVID policy." She added, "The groups that are in here require more scrutiny just to make sure that they're following procedure."
Gerwig acknowledged, "What we're about is people coming here to just hang out in the Cohon Center, and we can't do that anymore." Still, she emphasized that the CUC staff is still available to support students.

The Student Senate's fourth general body meeting on Feb. 25 addressed an override of fiscal policy to allow a club to purchase personal t-shirts, a proposal to give Carnegie Mellon students unlimited digital access to The New York Times, as well as the vision of the new President's Cabinet.
The Triple Helix at Carnegie Mellon, a STEM policy club publishing annual journals created last year during the pandemic, asked the Joint Funding Committee for funds to purchase merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and masks for the club. This request went against Article IV Section C4 of the Student Senate Fiscal Policy, which prohibits the use of funds to purchase personal equipment. However, representatives for The Triple Helix expressed that they could use the clothing to promote their club, as they had not had the same marketing opportunities that clubs created before the pandemic had, such as booths at fairs. The Senate voted 17 to 2 to override the fiscal bylaw, but also voted 12 to 3 with one abstain to require the club to only give clothing to club executives and members who had been with the club for one year.
The Senate also deliberated on a proposal to use media fee funds to purchase unlimited digital access to The New York Times. The school already has paper access to 24-hour academic passes for The New York Times through the Collegiate Readership Program, but some students requested digital passes as well. After The New York Times reached out to the student government to discuss digital passes for all Carnegie Mellon students, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries offered to pay one-third of the $13,400 fee, while the student government proposed using media fee funds, paid for by the student body, to pay for the rest of the fee. The proposal passed 18 to 0 with one abstain.
In addition to the earlier votes, the Student Body President's Cabinet presented their goals for the school year. They mentioned working with the Career and Professional Development Center to improve Carnegie Mellon's rankings among students and employers, working with housing to implement more sustainable practices while also cutting down on costs, and finding better ways to evaluate the wellness of the student body. They suggested creating a wellness survey or including wellness as a question on the Daily Self-Assessment.

I heard one expert on NBC say about the current disaster in Texas that no one could have seen it coming. Of course, anyone with any functional understanding of climate change and economics would have said otherwise, but the sentiment is understandable. The U.S. has had an uncomfortable degree of misunderstanding when it comes to public policy, as evidenced by the overwhelming emphasis on privatization and deregulation. However, the winter storm and subsequent utility outages in Texas will be a case study on the disastrous consequences of privatizing public goods and services for years to come.
To understand the problem, let’s first understand the history of electricity in Texas. Up until 1970, Texas had another utilities network called the Texas Interconnected System, which avoided federal regulations by not partaking in interstate electricity sales. The Texas Interconnected System was then replaced by the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in 1970, which attempted to provide some more regulation in the state while also maintaining independence from the federal government.
In 2002, the Texas state legislature began the process to deregulate and privatize the state’s electricity sector over the span of several years. ERCOT would oversee the power grid and help facilitate a market where private electricity providers compete with each other. The idea was for consumers to shop between different retail providers and choose the most optimal one, which would help dictate market price. To prevent monopolies from forming, there was originally a price floor implemented. This way, established electricity providers wouldn’t be able to use predatory pricing methods to uphold monopolies and prevent new firms from entering the market. However, the price floor was in effect only until 2007.
This went exactly as well as one would think. Studies have shown that in the time Texas had been deregulated, households in the state were paying significantly more on average for their utilities than in regulated markets in other states, despite the deregulation originally being intended to decrease electricity costs for Texans. Though there are hundreds of plans from which Texans can choose, private firms have less incentive to actually minimize costs for the same reason FedEx doesn’t deliver to certain rural areas — it would not be profitable for them to do so despite mail being a necessary service. It’s also overwhelming to punt the responsibility of choosing a proper electricity provider onto consumers.
Privately providing utilities also makes no real economic sense. Everyone needs electricity, and it has really high spillover effects and external benefits because power grids are able to provide for so many people at once. Texas itself is a beneficiary of spillover effects on some occasions: in 2011, ERCOT had to import power from Mexico as a result of blackouts from a storm that year that the Texas grid was incapable of handling. So, despite having a deregulated, independent market to elude federal regulation, Texas still has connections with two national power grids.
In the face of the new power crisis, the deregulated, private market has shown its true colors. 70 people have died from extreme weather conditions, millions lost power for several days and had to boil their water, and electricity bills in Texas skyrocketed upwards of $10,000 as real-time wholesale prices on the grid soared. ERCOT had to remove one provider, Griddy, for price gouging, and placed a market cap on electricity prices to reflect the scarcity of supply. Regardless, the high costs persisted. Texas Governor Greg Abbott was quick to blame wind turbines freezing as well as ERCOT for, ironically enough, misleading the public. However, Abbott himself had appointed the members of the Public Utility Commission meant to oversee ERCOT, and the vast majority of electricity in Texas comes from oil and natural gas, the state’s prized commodities.
Abbott’s attempt to blame wind turbines was also a way to distract the public from another major problem that had led to the current crisis. In the aforementioned 2011 storm, regulators had made it clear that the entirety of Texas’ electricity supply would not be able to handle another winter storm and that providers needed to ensure that the equipment was capable of withstanding extreme weather conditions. Of course, regulation was not mandatory, and despite knowing the vulnerabilities of the electricity system for years, Texas regulators and providers still did nothing. If there were ever to be a textbook on the extractive nature of unregulated capitalism, the deregulation of the Texas electricity supply should have its own dedicated chapter.
Now that public pressure and anger is mounting, Texas is being forced to reconsider its stance on regulations. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), who fled to Cancún in an impromptu trip with his family and subsequently blamed it on his 10- and 12-year-old daughters, has called for state regulation of its power supply despite being an active proponent of deregulation in the past. Now, the damage of the storm is in the billions, Texans are struggling to pay their bills, and many rural communities are ineligible for much needed federal disaster aid.
But amidst the despair, there has been some positive news as citizens across the country have come together to help Texans. Donations to mutual aid funds have been essential for providing aid to Texans. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) helped raise $5 million for disaster aid, and former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) has been organizing phonebanks for Texans in need. However, there is something ironic about political leaders having to provide disaster aid through their own private efforts.
Mutual aid groups can’t be the solution to public policy crises every time. At some point, reform needs to happen. Public goods should not be privately provided, especially essential services like electricity. For all of the jokes that people in the northern states make about Texas and vice versa, we are ultimately all in this together. We all know someone in Texas who has been affected by this. They deserve better. Everyone deserves better. Politicians, particularly Republicans, and corporations won’t let us have better, and it can’t keep taking these crises for us to realize that they’re working against us. Texans have every right to feel betrayed by the politicians they trusted for years because that’s what this was.
However, change will indeed take time. We currently still rely on mutual aid groups, so in the meantime, please donate to mutual aid organizations in Texas if you have the means to do so. Below is a list of some essential organizations:
Austin Mutual Aid
Mutual Aid Houston
Feed the People Dallas Mutual Aid
Para Mi Gente
Austin Disaster Relief Network
Lucha Dallas
Trinity Mutual Aid
Casa Marianella
DFW Mutual Aid
North Texas Rural Resilience

Discourse on race usually seems to be black and white in more ways than one. This country was rattled with endless stories of police brutality this past summer, scratching the thinly-veiled facade of racism being a thing of the past. Efforts to end white supremacy are long overdue, and addressing it is a step in the right direction (even if it’s the bare minimum). However, this approach alone is insufficient in addressing America’s complex and ongoing relationship with racism.
The FBI warned the nation of a potential surge in anti-Asian hate crimes around this time last year. The novel coronavirus was finally classified as a pandemic, and the number of Asians who were victims of hate crimes was creeping up. And although we may no longer have a President who dubs the virus as the “kung flu,” the damage has already been done.
Recent headlines show that the association between East Asians and the pandemic has already been established and validated. An 84-year-old Asian man in San Francisco was killed in broad daylight, and the family believes that the crime was racially motivated. The FBI has yet to release exact statistics, but it’s jarring to see these cases rise as the pandemic progresses. Between March 19, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2020, over 2,800 cases of anti-Asian hate crimes were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative created by the Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council (A3PCON), the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University, and Chinese Affirmative Action (CAA). 
It makes sense that some solidarity within the Asian American community arose from this trauma, particularly among East Asians. However, this frightening crime trend is also highlighting how racial minorities are not immune to being perpetrators of racism.
The murderer of the elderly San Francisco man was a 19-year-old Black man. Many Asian Americans understood that this heinous crime was a reflection of the man who committed the crime and not his race. However, far too many allowed this incident to reinforce their anti-Black racism. The rhetoric flooded into online communities such as subtle asian traits, with some individuals feeling justified in blaming Black communities and Black movements such as Black Lives Matter.
This is not the first time that anti-Black racism has reared its ugly head in Asian-American communities. Most notably, the 1992 riots that followed the Rodney King trials heightened tensions between the Black community and the Korean American community in Los Angeles. Saigu, which translates as “429” in memory of the date of the riots, caused havoc on over 2,200 Korean-owned businesses and caused approximately $400,000 in damages. This incident left many Asian Americans feeling hurt and sparked bitterness against the Black community in some.
However, it takes more than one incident to spark a longstanding and widespread problem. Asian Americans have been heralded as the "model minority" in recent years. East Asians seemed to rise to success despite discriminatory policies and racism. Many climbed their way to prestigious jobs and schools to the extent that there’s debate over whether Asians should be considered white or people of color (POC). This title of "model minority” may be considered a flattering compliment to Asians and Asian Americans, but its implications are harmful, including to the demographic to which the name applies.
The model minority paradigm reinforces the notion of the American Dream: anyone can achieve success and wealth with enough hard work. This is a reality for some, myself included. I was taught from a young age that my grit and determination would earn me a place in an elite university and great success from my family, friends, and school community alike. However, individual testimonies are not evidence. My success — and that of many other individuals with similar experiences — does not erase the systemic racism that puts others at a disadvantage and robs them of these same possibilities. While I was able to afford SAT books and AP exams, a disproportionate fraction of other POC were barely scraping by. I’ve never been profiled for walking down the street while listening to music, yet Elijah McClain was choked to death for doing just that. I’ve never had a check payment’s authenticity questioned, yet the same could not be said for George Floyd. The list goes on.
Asians becoming the model minority isn’t a testimony of a disadvantaged demographic’s resilience. The narrative is simply an evolution of systemic racism. It provides a false pretense of extinguishing racism and tells others who have not achieved the same success that they, too, can rise to the top with their own merit. The model minority myth gives some a sense of entitlement to dismiss racism and a reason to pat themselves on the back while excusing their racism against others.
Today, racial minorities need to recognize that we are capable of being both negatively affected by white supremacy and also contributors to white supremacy. It can feel easy to ignore the problem or even find a scapegoat. However, we are not immune to perpetuating racism. Many of us have witnessed firsthand the negative consequences of racism, as we’re seeing our community attacked at alarming rates. It’s time we reflect on how we may also be part of the problem as well.

We’ve seen it all on the big screens. HAL from A Space Odyssey. Skynet from The Terminator. Ultron from Avengers: Age of Ultron. With the intense fear of artificial intelligence (AI) taking over the world and initiating the apocalypse, you would think that we would take more precautions and considerations of the ethics of AI in industry today. 
Yet researcher Margaret Mitchell was fired from Google Brain, Google's AI lab, where she previously co-led a group focusing on ethical approaches to artificial intelligence. In a statement, a Google spokesperson said Mitchell had shared “confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees” outside the company.
Just the December before that, the former co-leader of that group, Timnit Gebru, was also fired. Gebru states that she was fired for refusing to remove her name from a research paper that cautioned against the use of artificial intelligence which processes text, including technology that is used in the Google search engine. As stated in a Wired article, a source familiar with Mitchell’s suspension said she had been using a script to search her email for material related to Gebru’s time at the company.
Gebru, Mitchell, and their ethical AI team were vital contributors in researching and mitigating the potential downsides of AI. They contributed to decisions that limit some of Google’s AI products, such as retiring a feature of an image recognition program that identified the gender of people in photos. Although Google’s AI research boss, Jeff Dean, stated that the cause of Gebru’s departure was due to her research paper being of poor quality, researchers inside and outside of Google have disputed this. 
The firings of these head ethicists set a poor precedent. It is a warning sign that the safeguards against unethical artificial intelligence are wavering. 
If you look at every other avenue of research and practice, ethical regulations exist. Doctors must protect patient privacy by HIPAA and are regulated by medical boards. Attorneys are bound by a code of conduct and attorney-client privilege, with the risk of losing their license. Pharmaceutical trials involving human subjects must be approved by the Federal Drug Administration and are scrutinized heavily. Yet, artificial intelligence research — which often bleeds into the fabric of society — relies solely on internal, self-regulated ethical considerations, making the recent turn of events especially concerning. 
The responsibility, in effect, falls on these tech giants. Yet, it gets worse. Internal reviewers at Google had even demanded that at least three papers on AI be modified to refrain from casting Google technology in a negative light, Reuters reported. According to the email reviewed by Reuters, edits included “negative-to-neutral” swaps such as changing the word “concerns” to “considerations,” and “dangers” to “risks.” 
Prioritizing brand image over the safety of consumers is not viable morally or economically. When creating a product that has the potential to greatly affect someone’s life, it is the responsibility of the creator to also address biases and flaws. Just like a manufacturer is morally obligated to recall damaged and harmful products, the same should apply to creators of artificially intelligent services. 
By commercializing AI research, this problem of bias in machine learning and artificial intelligence is allowed to snowball and become worse as the technology spreads to other critical areas like medicine and law, and as more people without a deep technical understanding utilize it. 
Given the influence and broad reach of Google, it especially has no excuse to not be considerate about the ethics of AI. Have we forgotten what happens when we allow bias in AI to remain? A 2020 study reviewed voice recognition systems from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, and found that they have higher error rates when transcribing Black people's voices than white people's. In 2018, Amazon had to retire an artificial intelligence recruiting tool that had a bias against women. When biases are left unchecked, they wreak havoc on the world around us, which is why stripping down the few efforts to keep bias in check is chaos in the making. 
With great power comes great responsibility. Google, along with every other major tech company, must be vigilant in its use of artificial intelligence that is capable of shaping our everyday lives. Firing the people who are literally hired to prevent the apocalypse for the sake of maintaining brand reputation is not worth the risk. Industries must be comfortable with finding problems and discovering bias in today’s AI. That is why even our academic institution has understood the importance of teaching ethics. Here at Carnegie Mellon, ethics is discussed even from the introductory Concepts of Artificial Intelligence course, and an ethics course is required for all AI majors. What is the point of teaching ethics to future scientists and researchers if our employers will fire us for doing our job?

Charles Bukowski said, “I remember one fellow who wrote an entire book in which he proved that the moon was not there and he did it so well that afterward, you thought, ‘he's absolutely right, the moon is not there.’ How the hell is a young man going to deign to work an eight-hour day when the moon isn't even there?” This realization that the moon is not there is what Slavoj Žižek called “taking off the glasses of ideology.” In the Marxist sense, an ideology is a series of discourses that create a consciousness of how the world works. So, to realize that the moon is not there is to realize that your consciousness, or understanding of the world, is false. This alone is not a bad thing; it is healthy to question the ideology of the state, such as liberalism, the ruling ideology of most western capitalist countries. However, what matters the most when people question an ideology is the conclusion that they draw once they realize that the moon is not there. As seen during the summer of 2020, groups of people can come to wildly different conclusions as to why the moon is not there. Some can be rooted in reality, such as how Black Lives Matter (BLM) questioned structures that perpetuate racism such as the prison system that disproportionately incarcerates people of color. However, others can be wildly off base, such as the debunked QAnon conclusion that senators are harvesting energy from children. Once an ideology is questioned, an explanation is required to fill the hole that the ideology left. Like Bukowski said, “How the hell can people go to work the next day when the moon is not even there?” This hole is where conspiracy theories are born.
QAnon type conspiracy theories are not a new phenomenon. For as long as humans have existed, they have been creating their own narratives to understand how the world works. This has been particularly true in crisis situations. For example, Prooijen and Douglas documented the history of conspiracy theories in times of crisis and found that one of the earliest conspiracy theories was created in 64 AD during fires in ancient Rome. Emperor Nero was not in the city when the fires were started, and the residents theorized that he started them in order to gain political power.
The common denominator of many modern conspiracy theories is antisemitism. The idea of blood libel, which is the 16th-century belief that Jews used the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes, is present in QAnon, as well as other overarching conspiracies.
No matter the source of the theory, conspiracies arise from the feelings of fear, loss of control, and uncertainty that political, economic, and natural disasters bring. “Conspiracy theories provide people with simplified answers, specifically to questions of how a certain crisis situation emerged, and which societal actors can and cannot be trusted,” say Prooijen and Douglas. This occurs because ideologies are so ingrained in the human consciousness that humans resort to cognitive dissonance rather than accept the flaw in the ideology itself. This dissonance causes people to create fictional narratives which are further propelled by confirmation bias, which confirms these narratives.
Despite conspiracy theories existing throughout history, there is no doubt that social media has influenced their rise and traction. A study in the Misinformation Review found that URLs reinforcing conspiracy theories went more viral than URLs that were neutral or debunking conspiracy theories.
For example, social media was the reason for the rapid spread of the Wayfair scandal that went viral in June 2020. A well-known activist tweeted about the high price of storage cabinets being sold by Wayfair. The user had noticed that the expensive cabinets were being listed with girls' names. Other users corroborated this, adding that the names of the cabinets corresponded to the names of missing girls on national registries. Due to confirmation bias, users came to the conclusion that the cabinets held the missing children inside of them as part of a child trafficking ring. This story was eventually debunked by Wayfair and many prominent news outlets such as USA Today.
What is interesting about the Wayfair scandal is how many people fell for it. According to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool, the term Wayfair generated 4.4 million engagements on Instagram in June 2020 alone. Laypeople and conspiracy theorists alike spread the story without even knowing its origin. This story was driven by an emotional aspect as the people who shared the story truly believed that Wayfair was trafficking children. It is unknown why people fell for this theory. However, the crisis caused by the COVID pandemic likely is to blame for an increase in conspiratorial thinking.
In 2016, Pizzagate had similar traction. Pizzagate originated from the WikiLeaks leak of Hillary Clinton's emails in 2016. One email between Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and Washington D.C. pizzeria Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis discussed a possible fundraiser for the campaign. Conspiracies theorists claimed that this pizzeria was the site of a child trafficking ring. According to a poll, 50 percent of Trump supporters believed that Pizzagate was true or could be true. It is important to note that while this poll only reached Trump supporters, anyone can fall for conspiracy theories no matter their political party.
Since social media is only making it easier to spread conspiracy theories, how can we reduce their impact? To answer this, we must first understand the nature of modern conspiracy theories. This requires a firm understanding of QAnon, the most prominent modern conspiracy.
Nancy L. Rosenblum, a professor of ethics in politics and government from Harvard University, said in The Economist that conspiracy theories today are different from theories of the past. They are “conspiracy without the theory.” In other words, there is no evidence to back modern conspiracy theories. Even worse, the believers of these theories do not look for facts to prove or disprove them. These theories are fueled by emotions rather than logic. Because of this, the spread of conspiracy theories cannot be stopped by simply debunking the theory. This is especially true in the era of “fake news,” as believers are not prone to believe mainstream media sources who debunk these theories. Valid critiques of mainstream media sources can be made, but the problem is that the critiques conspiracy theories make lie in conspiracies not on real issues, such as corporate financing of media.
QAnon has gained traction as the most popular modern conspiracy theory because of its nature as an umbrella theory that ties all other modern conspiracies together in order to allege that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles. QAnon has been called a “cult” by Rolling Stone magazine because of its strong psychological draw. Its followers are awaiting the “storm” where, similar to the evangelical rapture, all politicians who are not loyal to “Q” will be arrested and tortured by members of the military led by Donald Trump.
Donald Trump is lauded by many members of QAnon as the political figure who will carry out the storm. The Capitol insurrection was strongly influenced by QAnon as members believed the “elite cabal” rigged the election against Trump. However, even with the loss of Trump as president, it is likely that QAnon will continue. Similar to the date of the rapture, the date of the storm continues to be pushed further into the future once the original predicted date has passed.
Psychologist Karen Douglas explains that one of the motives for belief in conspiracy theories is a person's desire to feel good about themselves or the groups to which they belong.
This desire for people to feel good about themselves and their groups is what makes the structure of QAnon so powerful. Game designers have compared QAnon to Alternate Reality Games (ARGs). An ARG is an interactive networked narrative that uses the real world as a platform and employs transmedia storytelling to deliver a story that may be altered by players' ideas or actions. QAnon is similar to this because it uses the real world as a platform to tell a story which is the conspiracy. The QAnon conspiracy theory is centered around an online forum where a person who identifies as “Q” drops clues that followers must disseminate in order to “solve” the conspiracy. This creates a social dynamic because all members are working together to find the “truth.” Furthermore, this is addicting because each drop gives followers a rise in serotonin as they rush to be the first person to break the code. This creates a thrill of discovery.
The clues that Q offers are driven by apophenia, or the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between seemingly unrelated things. One article described QAnon as “guided apophenia.” The creator, or Q, is using clues to directly lead their followers to the desired conclusion. For example, one “Q drop,” as members of QAnon call them, pointed followers towards the coincidence that many politicians own owl necklaces. They concluded through the help of Q that the fact that these politicians own these necklaces is not a coincidence. Rather, the symbol of an owl meant that these politicians were all members of the elite cabal who were harvesting children.
Because of the addicting cult-like nature of QAnon, the solution to stop the spread of this theory must address the psychological draw it has on its members. Certain characteristics have been identified that are more likely to fall for a conspiracy theory. These include: being less educated, a desire to feel special, feelings of powerlessness, and a need for certainty. A popular Reddit thread called r/QAnonCasualties has been created to provide resources in order to deter those who are likely to entertain conspiracy theories. This thread is a support group for people who have lost their family or friends to the QAnon cult. It provides resources such as how to talk friends or family members out of cults. It also provides links to basic media literacy, expert advice, and therapy for cult members.
The last feature of QAnon that is important to understand is that nobody knows who Q is. A recent Vice documentary has alleged that QAnon is similar to a psyop, or a psychological operation. If this is true, whoever started Q did so to spread division and distrust in American political institutions. Although this is unconfirmed, it is important to note that the structure of QAnon is deliberate. QAnon has a distinct leader (Q) to whom people look for answers. This makes QAnon different from decentralized conspiracies of the past.
There is no panacea to quell modern conspiracies. Rather, it is helpful to understand how people are drawn to joining conspiracy groups, and to be open to multiple different options on how to deter them such as media literacy, fact-checking, and therapy for those who are already indoctrinated.
With strong economic pressures due to the COVID recession, it is likely that the spread of conspiracy theories, especially reactionary right-wing conspiracy theories, will continue. The ideology of liberalism is being threatened by these economic pressures as people are realizing the limits of capitalism in solving worldwide crises. Instead of reckoning with this, people will continue to try to find outlandish reasons to explain it. To combat conspiracy theories such as QAnon, there must be an increase in both government-funded mental health services and media literacy education. Further, there needs to be a government investigation to find the founders of QAnon and understand their motivations. Lastly, this investigation must identify how to deter conspiracy theories without limiting freedom of speech. Without this, it is likely that domestic terrorist events such as the Capitol insurrection will continue.

It doesn’t take much to realize that challenging and involved projects are the epitome of applied, collaborative work. By requiring understanding of the holistic principles behind the final product and the mechanics behind the implementation, project-based learning most easily guarantees long-term retention and understanding, not to mention substantial personal and professional development.
From the outset, an environment that promotes extensive collaboration and deep exploration would be helpful in cultivating a more nuanced, well-conceived perspective. After all, it is impossible to develop a viable and economical project without thoroughly understanding the technical constraints and available resources. Like authentic academic researchers, students must also be able to build off of prior knowledge and synthesize existing technologies and capabilities.
This most matches the work expected of professionals in the real world. We are proposing that professors create an insightful, unique, and optimized testing method to introduce or update a complex grading system instead of measuring a student’s ability to simply regurgitate formulae and facts in a grandiose “plug-and-chug” testing environment.
With project-based benchmarks and evaluations, the focus on student ideation and productivity also emphasizes a self-motivated and student-driven approach, as opposed to a faculty-led learning process. When the burden (or privilege, as we prefer to consider it) of exploration is placed on the student, resources available to students become more valuable, from throwing ideas around in office hours to browsing papers. Projects also encourage superior time management and communication with teammates and other relevant parties.
The project itself would require a novel approach and implementation, whether it be a literary analysis or a never-before-seen web application. This fosters innovation and creativity, simultaneously pushing students while minimizing concerns regarding academic integrity — yes, students could still cheat, but it would be obvious at some point from project submission to the presentation and live question-and-answer session.
So, the question remains: why are so many classes reliant on inferior methods of evaluation and teaching? Classes often feature heavy exams requiring ridiculous levels of manpower to proctor and grade, which fail still to ensure true understanding or ability to apply the knowledge covered. These exams have often been decried for simply being a source of stress with no learning for students, presenting a net decrease in the quality of student life and mental acuity.
It falls to the instructor to establish a functioning class structure and promote student learning. And thus, we implore instructors to reevaluate their courses. Please consider the practicality and minimum usefulness of your assignments and exams — guarantee that every student will walk out of the classroom having been improved and with a fuller and more wrinkled brain. In particular, we hope you replace your current testing systems, which have been problematic due to the shift to a virtual learning environment, to be more applied and project-based.
