To become the Division III Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) National Singles Champion, sophomore Abhishek Alla had to defeat six opponents — two of them from his own team — in the ITA Southeast regional tournament, and three other regional champions.
His immediate reaction upon becoming singles-champion: “Just a smile I guess.”
The even-keeled Alla cruised to victory, not dropping a set in the national tournament. His dominance is nothing new; in the regional tournament, he dropped only one set, which came against teammate junior William Duncan in the quarterfinals.
Alla entered the tournament with tempered expectations — “Let’s just take it match by match,” he said — and took the first match to find his groove.
Against No. 4 seed Paxton Deuel of Trinity University last Thursday, Alla found himself trailing the first set 5–4. After holding serve to tie the set at 5–5, Alla broke Deuel’s serve and held his serve again to win the set.
Deuel fought back, winning the first three games of the second set. But Alla regrouped and won the next six games to take the match.
“I wouldn’t say [I was] nervous, but the other guy was consistent. He was just getting the balls back, so I was like — I should do the same.... It was a long first match,” he said.
Alla crushed his next two opponents. He beat Sam Geier from Kenyon College 6–2, 6–0 in the semifinals.
In the final match on Saturday, he defeated Skylar Butts of the Claremont Colleges 6–4, 6–1 to take home the championship title.
Alla said his recent play is the best since coming to Carnegie Mellon but not his best overall.
“I’ve probably played better before I came to CMU.”
That Alla has even more room to develop should be terrifying to opponents and good news to the men’s tennis team as they try to make the NCAA Division III tournament next May.
Despite proving his skills on the court, Alla admits his serve could always use more work: “I’m trying. If it gets better, it gets better, or else it’s just going to stay the same,” he said. His serve may not be the most powerful, but now, it is the serve of a champion.

Before clouds covered the Pittsburgh sky, the sun shined long enough on Saturday morning for the men’s and women’s cross country teams’ Carnegie Mellon Invitational.
The men’s cross country team, led by senior Josh Newby’s second-place finish (25:47.8), took home first in the eight-kilometer race.
The women finished third in their five-kilometer race. Junior Erin Kiekhaefer finished first (19:03.5) for the Tartans and eighth overall, while sophomore Rekha Schnepf (19:32.9) finished second.
The top five finishes for each team determine the team’s final score.
The race started at the Schenley Oval in Schenley Park. The course included the Upper Panther Hollow and the Bridle Trails.
“I thought the women did very well in grouping themselves together. I know that their grouping was good, and my one-to-five split was very good, so I’m pleased with that,” said head coach Dario Donatelli.
Sophomore Priya Patel and senior Catherine Paquette finished together with times of 19:53.2 and 19:53.9, respectively.
First-year Rachel McCoy rounded out the women’s top five with her 32nd-place finish.
For the men’s team, both current and former athletes showed impressive times. The Carnegie Mellon Alumni team finished third and had three runners finish in the top 10.
The current squad blew away the entire field. Its top five finishes were within the first 13.
Newby, who finished third overall last year, continued his success in the invitational.
“I felt really good. This is our home course — it’s a confusing and strange course — but our team knows the course really well so we knew when to go,” Newby said.
“He looked like he got into a nice group. When I saw him on the trail, at two miles and four miles, he was just gliding along,” Donatelli said.
Senior Ken Murphy was the next Tartan to finish, coming in at eighth overall.
Junior George Degen and sophomores Marc-Daniel Julien and Brian Bollens took places 11, 12, and 13 respectively.
The strong finish for the Tartans comes at a good time, as the teams prepare for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships on Nov. 12, which will be held on the same course.
“The fact that there’s a 200-person field in this race makes it a lot more like UAA, and I feel like our team is really prepared to just crush conferences,” Newby said.

For the first time since their re-emergence as Stanley Cup contenders, the Pittsburgh Penguins seem to be overshadowed by the other Pittsburgh professional teams. The combination of the Pirates’ first playoff berth in over 20 years and the Steelers’ abysmal 1–4 start has stolen most of the focus away from Pittsburgh’s hockey franchise. 
The surprisingly early start to the season, compared to last year’s lock-out-delayed January start, has most Pittsburghers unaware that the Penguins are already five games into their season.
For better or worse, the Penguins are returning a squad very similar to the one that was embarassingly swept by the Boston Bruins in last year’s Eastern Conference Finals.
The main losses are the veterans the Penguins acquired last season in trades to push themselves over the edge: Forwards Jarome Iginla and Brenden Morrow, and defenseman Douglas Murray all left via free agency.
Left wing Jussi Jokinen was the one player to stick around after the Pens acquired him. Twenty-one-year-old forward Beau Bennett looks to be the future top-line winger. As alternate captain Evgeni Malkin and captain Sidney Crosby get older, the Penguins hope Bennett can develop and make up for the two’s decreased production. But as of now, he is too inexperienced to play the physical style demanded by the line of Malkin and left wing James Neal. 
Expect to see Jokinen start the season, with Bennett jumping up in the depth chart as he gets more comfortable on the ice.
On defense, the Penguins return the same mediocre group of players. In fact, they are even worse off, with top-scoring defenseman Kris Letang out with a lower body injury. With their third-leading point scorer from last season out indefinitely, the Pens could be without some of the offensive firepower that has kept them competitive the last few years in spite of their porous defense and inconsistent goaltending.
Speaking of goaltending, the Penguins still have the same question marks that they have had the past few seasons. Goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury has been one of the top regular season goalies the past two seasons, but during the playoffs of those two seasons, his play has been atrocious. Since goaltending is such a mentally challenging position, it will be interesting to see how Fleury bounces back from being benched in last year’s playoffs. It’s even more critical that Fleury be on his game since Tomas Vokoun, the goalie who took over for Fleury, is out for the next 3–6 months with blood clots, leaving Fleury without a veteran backup.
The biggest change to the Penguins comes in the form of the NHL conference realignment. With the 2011 move of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg and being renamed the Jets, the NHL needed to shuffle up its divisions and conferences. There are still two conferences, the 14-team Western Conference and the 16-team Eastern Conference, but now instead of six five-team divisions, there are only four total divisions, with two in each conference. 
This realignment has fixed many years of illogical geographic divisions due to the mass movement of teams from smaller northeastern United States and Canadian cities, down to the Sun Belt ranging from Florida to Texas and Arizona. It is also only a trial run due to unbalanced conferences and divisions, and the threat of relocation by the Phoenix Coyotes and several other southern teams.
This change in divisional format has also affected the playoff system. Each division will have three automatic playoff qualifiers, with two more wild card teams coming from the top two remaining teams in the conference. The second and third seeds from each division will play each other in the first round of the playoffs, and the top seed in each division will play one of the wild card teams, with the overall top seed playing the weaker wild card. 
The winners of those two series within each division will play each other for the divisional championship, and the winners of the divisional championships will play each other for the conference championship. The two conference winners will then play for the Stanley Cup.
One of the major criticisms of this system is the impact of division strength in playoff berths and ease. If one division is significantly weaker than another, it will give top teams in that division a much easier road to the conference finals, allowing them to rest their players and have a leg up on the competition.
The Penguins are in the newly formed Metropolitan Division within the Eastern Conference. They are still with all of their old Atlantic Division foes — the New Jersey Devils, both New York teams, and their cross-state rivals the Philadelphia Flyers — but are also adding the Washington Capitals, the Carolina Hurricanes, and the Columbus Blue Jackets, who are moving from the Western Conference.
Even with all the changes in the NHL, the Penguins’ biggest challenges come from within. Since they won the Stanley Cup in 2009, the team has only grown and improved. But their biggest foes have been injuries and inconsistent play. 
If Crosby and Malkin can stay on the ice, and Fleury can get his head straight and play in the postseason like he has during the regular season, look for another deep playoff run. Otherwise, look for another postseason full of disappointment.

Car-related accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Over 30,000 people died from car-related accidents in 2011, and thousands more are involved in accidents that cause injury, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania and the Department of Transportation (DOT), are taking strides to reduce these staggering numbers. Last week, DOT renewed the grant for Carnegie Mellon’s Technologies for Safe and Efficient Transportation (T-SET) program for the next two years, awarding close to $5.7 million.
The DOT’s University Transportation Centers program picks five universities around the nation to lead and set the standards in strategic areas including safety, economic, environmental, and maintenance concerns with transportation.
Two years ago, T-SET partnered with the University of Pennsylvania and was recognized as a University Transportation Center with an emphasis on safety; it has been awarded $2.85 million in grant money each year since.
Ragunathan Rajkumar, the director of T-SET, said, “With Carnegie Mellon on the west and the University of Pennsylvania on the east, we think we can improve safety in the state very well. However, this being a national center, we solve national issues. We think we can have a big impact on the regional aspect, but we have an emphasis on the national scale of our projects.”
Rajkumar said that over the last three years, Carnegie Mellon has implemented numerous technologies in the local Pittsburgh area in order to increase efficiency and safety in the region.
The website parkpgh.org  is one such example. On the website, users can see the capacity of all of the parking garages in Pittsburgh in order to cut out the arduous process of roaming around the city looking for parking. A similar program called Tiramisu informs transit-users about the capacity of buses around the city so that they are not left waiting for a bus that ends up being full.
In addition, advanced traffic lights are being installed in East Liberty; the lights monitor traffic coming from all directions and make decisions about what the lights’ colors should be every two seconds. 
With this technology, drivers are no longer stopped by red lights at empty intersections and are more likely to hit consecutive green lights instead of constantly stopping and going.
With this new round of funding, T-SET is looking to invest in new types of accident prevention methods.
For instance, T-SET is expanding research that will allow sensors to gauge the conditions on the road and determine if an accident is likely to occur. While this technology was previously directed towards vehicle infrastructure, new initiatives are being made to implement it for bicycles and pedestrians.
“We are looking to add technologies into bicycles and pedestrians because many of the accidents occur between a car and a pedestrian or biker,” Rajkumar said. “The technology would go into the smartphones of the pedestrians and onto little devices to be placed on the bicycles.” Additional initiatives in these forms of intelligent transportation systems include vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.
Rajkumar said that T-SET is working on technologies that would allow traffic lights to directly inform cars of the status of the light and respond to different situations. For instance, if the driver is not paying attention and is approaching a red light, the technology will slow the car down to a stop and prevent a potential accident from occurring.
Additionally, vehicle-to-vehicle communications offer great leaps in safety. One branch of research is developing communication and sensing devices that can detect the relative distance between cars. If cars are positioned too closely or are on a projectile pathway to collide, the device will actuate a response, such as a stop or redirection, in order to prevent the accident.
Each year, thousands of accidents occur when drivers run red lights or bump into each other. 
“More than 90 percent of automotive accidents are caused by human error,” Rajkumar said.
On roads fitted with intelligent transportation systems, human error could be largely mitigated. Rajkumar envisions that, within the next 10 years, the technologies developed at Carnegie Mellon will find their way into many roads, traffic lights, and cellphones around the country.

Robert Griffiths is passionate about his position as a physicist. He’s willing to explain his complicated research on quantum cryptography, which seems to always be on his mind, to anyone willing to listen. As he sat in his cluttered office, he even joked about what would happen if Edward Snowden were to be within a quantum cryptographic scheme.
Griffiths, the Otto Stern University Professor of Physics, established the Quantum Theory Group at Carnegie Mellon in 1984. Griffiths still heads the group with two members: Vikesh Siddhu and Dan Stahlke, both Ph.D. candidates in physics. The group’s research focuses on the foundations of quantum theory, as well as its potential applications, including quantum computing and information.
Quantum computing vs. classical computing
As the name suggests, quantum computing is the development of computer technology based on the principles of quantum physics. Although primarily theoretical at present, quantum computing is a compelling field because its utilization of “quantum bits” (qubits) rather than classical bits allows for the development of quantum computers, which in certain areas far surpass the limitations of today’s computers.
The bits that today’s computers use to transmit and store information can only hold one of two values — often explained with the numerals 0 and 1 — and exist in one distinct physical state. Qubits, on the other hand, are represented by the spins of elementary particles, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. 
This property, known as superposition, allows a quantum computer with n qubits to perform 2n calculations at the same time, while a classical computer with the same amount of bits can perform only n. A second property of qubits, known as entanglement, allows them to be very strongly correlated at extremely large distances.
More specifically, qubits take on distinct “spins.” Two entangled qubits have opposite spins to one another and can remain in unison even if they are at opposite ends of the universe. Entanglement allows for faster transportation of information using qubits rather than classical bits.
If a quantum computer were developed based on these properties, however, it would not bring much improvement to ordinary computer tasks involving simple calculations. So, where exactly does the magic of quantum computers lie? It begins where the scope of today’s computers ends. The potential of quantum computing was realized with the development of Shor’s algorithm for the prime factorization of long numbers.
Though today’s computer cannot perform such factorization, quantum computers could implement Shor’s algorithm and solve problems which would otherwise take today’s most powerful supercomputers hundreds of millions of years to solve. The Quantum Theory Group contributed a major simplification in the final step of the algorithm in a proposal by Griffiths and Ph.D. student Chi-Sheng Niu in 1996.
Current limitations in quantum computing
Thus far, researchers have some understanding of how quantum particles behave, and how they could lead to more efficient technology. This has not yet translated, however, to a full understanding of how quantum particles may come together to create a system of information.
“Classical information in general we know everything about. The question is, what is the corresponding quantum counterpart? You would think it would be something measured in qubits, but nobody really knows,” Griffiths explained.
The group’s research expands on the understanding of what ‘quantum information’ really is and how it would function, and investigates the scope of the computational methods that can be developed by harnessing the properties of quantum particles.
Griffiths’s take on the difference between quantum and classical information is analogous to “the world of classical information being a world of black and white, and that of quantum information being a world of colors.”
The group has been working toward understanding the flow of information through quantum circuits, and studying some of the limits to copying quantum information.
A second obstacle to developing physical quantum computers is that there are not yet methods to harness the different manipulations of quantum particles — such as superposition and entanglement — long enough to create viable technology utilizing them.
“At the moment we don’t have an appropriate physical system that can perform quantum computing on the large scale. There are lot of physical systems that provide a testbed for these quantum computing ideas, but we have not found a way to manage large bits of information on them,” Siddhu said.
The difficulty stems from a property known as decoherence. If one tries to directly measure the value of a qubit, it will cease to exist in superposition, and assume one value just like a classical bit. This would render a system of qubits no better than a classical one. A potential solution is to use the strong correlation between entangled qubits to gather information about pairs of qubits, but entanglement is also difficult to maintain as the number of qubits increases.
The group has been researching how entanglement can lead to nearly instant transmission of information in order to better understand decoherence in information-theoretic terms and strengthen the potential applications of quantum computing.
Quantum computing and cryptography
So, amongst all the potential applications that arise from the properties of quantum particles, has there been any headway in making quantum computing practical? According to Griffiths, quantum cryptography — or data security schemes based on quantum computing — is the aspect of quantum computing closest to commercialization or practical use.
“All the cryptographic systems that are employed to send simple things like e-mails or to authorize complex things like transfer of money through banks depend on the fact that classical computers cannot factorize primes efficiently,” Siddhu said. “A quantum computer would essentially be able to break these codes … So what to do if quantum computers can break the major classical cryptographic scheme? The idea is to come up with systems that are quantum secure, which is where quantum cryptography comes in.”
Rather than depending on the difficulty of factorizing primes, quantum cryptography depends on the unusual behavior of quantum particles. The sender sends a randomly generated sequence of qubits to the receiver across a quantum channel. After going through the process of recording the sent and received results, the two compare notes via conventional methods to ensure that the receiver received the correct information. An eavesdropper trying to intercept the quantum channel and extract information would be detected because their attempt would cause an unusual amount of discrepancy between the original and received messages, which would serve as a warning signal to the sender and receiver.
In this regard, quantum cryptography is more secure. Today’s cryptographic methods could be intercepted by an eavesdropper with neither sender nor receiver noticing.
The group has been working to further the security of quantum cryptographic schemes, and has made headway into efficiently detecting eavesdropping within a scheme. But amidst all the emerging developments, There is a question that arose:  What is the true driving force behind developing this new system of computation?
“As with most theoretical physics, the driving force is a quest for understanding” Stahlke explained. “We have a fundamentally new type of information: quantum information. In the coming decades we may be able to exploit this new tool to build a quantum computer, but for now we study this to learn about the nature of quantum mechanics and about the nature of information. And since the universe we live in is quantum mechanical, it makes sense that we should try and gain an understanding of the quantum version of information.”

ExpressionBlast, a new search engine developed by scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and Bar-Ilan University, helps scientists compare gene expression data with millions of other studies in order to find experiments with similar profiles.
Ziv Bar-Joseph, associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s computational biology department, led the research team that published its work in the October issue of Nature Methods; Guy Zinman, Shoshana Naiman, Yariv Kanfi, and Haim Cohen co-authored the journal report. Multiple Carnegie Mellon employees and students also contributed toward developing the search engine.
Bar-Joseph’s research focused on creating a concise, systematic way to compare gene expression data.
“Everyone knows about DNA, the genetic material. We have exactly the same DNA in every cell of our body; however, all our cells are completely different in terms of what they do and look like [e.g., muscle cells vs. blood cells].... The reason that these cells are different is that different genes are being expressed,” said Zinman, now a research scientist in Carnegie Mellon’s Lane Center for Computational Biology.
Zinman explained that the idea for ExpressionBlast originated from a paper that explored longevity in mice. In this research, expression of a certain gene allowed male mice to live 15 percent longer than control male mice; this phenomenon only occurred in male mice. In order to make sense of the data, the researchers began to look for other experiments with similar results.
Currently, one of the main places to look for this information is Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the largest public database for expression data. GEO contains more than a million experiments, but does not provide an easy way for users to compare these experiments with their own results.
“As a research community, we had all this data, and it wasn’t being used as much as we would have liked. There was no way for you to compare your own results to the one million experiments that were out there,” Zinman said. “This is because every experiment uses a different machine, a different platform, a different animal, and is testing different conditions.”
ExpressionBlast automatically organizes data from genetic expression experiments on a weekly basis, so that they can be easily compared. “Everyone can now take their own experiment, put it on the web interface we developed, and find other experiments that have similar profiles,” Zinman said.
ExpressionBlast has many applications in and out of the realm of science. Drug companies, for example, could use ExpressionBlast to determine whether a potential chemical compound is affecting gene expression in a way shown to have the desired outcome in a previous experiment conducted by others, saving them time and money.
Zinman said that his work with ExpressionBlast was funded and greatly influenced by a program known as Innovation Corps (I-Corps), a program run by the National Science Foundation that focuses on giving entrepreneurial training to students and professors in order to foster commercialization of ideas that arise throughout research.
“It is a manner of thinking that is completely different from academia,” he explained. “I used this business thinking later on with my research, when looking for collaborators and research partners, and targeting my work towards more practical applications that the biological or medical communities are currently lacking.”
“The idea is to translate research to the marketplace,” Zinman continued. “There’s so much research being done at universities that can be applied to real world problems in a very short time, and many times the researchers don’t have the skill set to go outside of the comfort zone of their labs and look for customers and commercialization options.”
Aside from the possible long-term potential of ExpressionBlast, Zinman said that positive feedback for the tool is already surfacing. “I get about one to two emails per day. I’ve seen tweets from Cuba, I’ve gotten questions from people in India, and even thank you emails from researchers,” Zinman said. “If it wasn’t for the publication, it was for these emails. Just for them, it was worth it.”
Despite the success of ExpressionBlast, Zinman admits that there is still work to be done. “We still have many ideas that we would like to see implemented,” he said.
ExpressionBlast has made previously available gene expression data more useful, and has already begun to influence research worldwide. In the future, ExpressionBlast will undoubtedly affect the way in which gene expression data is analyzed and contribute to many aspects of the academic and commercial world.

The Swedish Nobel committee announced the winners of the Nobel Prize last week. The winners of each category share an approximately $1.2 million prize.
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
The 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James E. Rothman of Yale University; Randy W. Schekman of the University of California, Berkeley; and Thomas C. Südhof of Stanford University. According to the committee, the award was granted based on their “discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a major transport system in our cells.”
Vesicles are necessary for the transportation of molecules within our cells; think of a vesicle as a bus or cart, carrying precious passengers like insulin through the cell. How vesicles were able to pick up and drop off this cargo at the correct time, however, largely remained a mystery. Schekman’s research focused mainly on the genes necessary for vesicle transport. Rothman provided insight into the necessary proteins needed for vesicle docking and fusion, and Südhof looked at the chemical signals that told the vesicles when to release their cargo. 
Nobel Prize in Physics
The 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics was shared by François Englert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles — located in Brussels, Belgium — and Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh, U.K. They received the award due to their theoretical proposal of “a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles,” which was proven in 2012. This is often referred to as the Higgs boson.
In the ’60s, Englert and Higgs both independently proposed a theory of how particles gain mass. This theory was an integral part of the standard model of particle physics, which states that everything in the universe is made up of matter particles. The Higgs boson is the particle associated with an invisible field that takes up all space. This invisible field is necessary for existence, as particles acquire mass only by interacting with this field. In 2012, scientists were able to detect the existence of the Higgs particle.
Nobel Prize in Chemistry
The 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Martin Karplus of the Université de Strasbourg, France and Harvard University; Michael Levitt of Stanford University; and Arieh Warshel of University of Southern California. Their work was recognized by the Nobel committee “for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems.”
This trio of scientists is being praised for its work on computer programs — which started in the ’70s — that can help predict and record chemical processes. Because chemical reactions can happen at a fraction of a second, creating a program that would be able to map them out in real time was a daunting challenge. The immense importance of these programs is especially visible in drug development. In the past, researchers had to test reactions on model organisms such as mice; now they can simply see what happens on a computer screen.

New virus-killing process discovered
Researchers led by microbiology professor Shou-Wei Ding, who heads a lab in the University of California, Riverside’s Institute for Integrative Genome Biology, have discovered that mammals use the RNA interference (RNAi) process to destroy viruses within their own cells like plants and invertebrate animals.
The team’s earlier research into plants, nematodes, and fruit flies helped them find the key: Viruses outwit the innate protection in cells by using proteins to suppress the virus-killing mechanism. Ding’s research discovered that removing the suppressor protein from the virus causes the subject’s body to quickly eliminate the virus using the RNAi process, which sends out small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to kill the disease.

Compost may hold fatal bacteria
Compost may harbor Legionella spp., the bacteria responsible for Legionnaire’s disease, a potentially deadly form of pneumonia. A recent study by researchers in the United Kingdom found the bacteria in 15 out of 24 commercially available composts. Previous research identified the bacteria in compost from Australia, Japan, and Switzerland, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC warns that Legionella infection risk is greater for older individuals, former smokers, chronic lung disease patients and those with weakened immune systems.

Gas giants may rain diamonds
Studies suggest that on Jupiter and Saturn, it may rain diamonds. Theoretically, carbon soot particles, freed from methane particles in the planets’ upper atmosphere, would fall through heavy layers of hydrogen and helium toward the cores. On the way down, this carbon soot would be greatly condensed by high pressure and temperatures, thus leading to the formation of diamonds. 
By the time the diamonds neared the cores of each gas giant, they would likely have melted under such extreme heat and morphed into a liquid state, creating diamond rain.

Deadly amoeba found in U.S.
State officials have confirmed that the amoeba Naegleria fowleri has been found in a northern Louisiana parish’s water. The amoeba proves deadly if water is ingested through the nose, and has recently been identified in Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas. 
In response to the number of incidents in Louisiana, state health officials announced they will implement new standards to kill the amoeba in water systems by increasing the amount of chlorine and ammonia they use to disinfect the water. The standards will exceed federal standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unclear if other states will follow suit.

After the sounds of footsteps upon a wood stage, notes escaping from tweaking instruments, and muddled conversations among the audience, there is silence, then a wave of music. This is the magic of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO).
This weekend, the PSO continued its 2013-14 season with a string of performances. Hardly a month after its return from a European tour, the PSO is already off to a strong start, opening with a gala in late September featuring Yo-Yo Ma. Although Saturday night’s performance did not feature musicians quite as high profile as Ma, it was nonetheless an enjoyable evening of wonderful music.
Once again, conductor Manfred Honeck was at the reins. The Austrian-born music director, who has been with the orchestra since its 2008-09 season, is very expressive and bold in his conducting, and Saturday night’s performance was no exception.
The first piece of the night was Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings. A somber song full of pathos, Adagio functions as one organic, drawn-out breath. There is a very subtle tension and catharsis throughout the piece that the string section captured very well. While Adagio, as a well known piece, was arguably the main attraction of the night, the austere and reflective piece was simply blown out of the water by its successors.
Immediately after Adagio was the dynamic Symphonic Suite from Jenufa, as arranged by Honeck and Czech composer Tomas Ille. Jenufa is a Czech opera composed by Leoš Janácek that tells a twisted tale spun from two real-life incidents that occurred in the former state of Czechoslovakia in the 1880s.
Set in a remote Czech village, Jenufa is the story of a young woman, the titular Jenufa, who is loved by two half-brothers but only returns the affections of one of them, Steva. In a jealous rage, the other brother, Laca, disfigures Jenufa with a knife, but is immediately remorseful. Months later, Steva leaves Jenufa because of her disfigurement, despite the fact that Jenufa has just given birth to a child. At this point, Laca still wishes to marry Jenufa, but worries that he would also have to take care of Steva’s child. Upon hearing this, Jenufa’s stepmother lies to Laca and tells him that the baby has died, and then later drowns the infant herself.
The music does an excellent job of capturing the drama and emotion of the opera; it could tell the story very well without any singers, actors, or dancers. A xylophone motif weaves in and out between each of the different medleys, almost like an alarm bell that wakes you up from one dream and into another. The music is highly temperamental, moving from a soft, sweet coo to a dark, stormy roar. There are moments of ubiquitous unease, moments where drums and brass come together in a solemn death march, and moments of a sincere and profound rebirth, much like the coming of spring after a long winter. The arrangement brings out the pure human emotion within the opera.
Mozart’s Concerto No. 21 in C major for Piano and Orchestra, the next piece of the night, featured Yulianna Avdeeva as the piano soloist. Avdeeva, who won first place in the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition in 2010, is known for her formidable technique and intense intellectual rigor. Concerto No. 21 may not be the immediate thing that springs to mind when one thinks of “intense intellectual rigor,” but nonetheless Avdeeva did a wonderful job capturing the tone of the piece, giving an elegant performance. As is typical of Mozart, the piece combines the stateliness and politesse of baroque music, a hint of the budding Romanticism, and Mozart’s own ingenious, playful flair.
The first movement of Concert No. 21 brings to mind images of an evening ball, with guests dancing and gossiping, prominently featuring the enchanting chime of the piano. It then moves on to its famous Adante movement, a romantic and sensual kind of music that is easy to become lost in before the final movement, an energetic Rondo.
The final piece of the night, Antonín Dvorák’s Symphony No. 8 in G major was a strong finish to the night. Dvorák, another Czech composer, was a great lover of the countryside, a fierce passion that greatly carries over to his music. Symphony No.  8 feels like a breath of fresh air on a bright summer day as you travel down a country road, gazing at the wide open plains in the distance. Plenty of recurring motifs and melodies swirl around in the wind, but the piece is at its best when at its most forceful and bombastic. The ending — the last few notes of the night — was strong, vibrant, and defiant.
Though arrangement-wise, the combination of the slow, solemn Adagio felt at odds with the other more vibrant, forceful pieces, the PSO delivered the kind of wonderful performance that has come to be expected of the orchestra.

Counterpoint, Carnegie Mellon’s all-female a cappella group, hosted its annual A CaPittsburgh event in Rangos Hall last Saturday night, showcasing the talents of all the different a cappella groups on campus. This year’s theme was “Music is everyone’s possession,” and the proceeds from the event went to Landfill Harmonic, a group that salvages garbage and reworks it into musical instruments for worldwide distribution.
The event was a great opportunity to see the diversity and excellence of the a cappella community and witness part of the musicians’ world. It was incredibly engaging because the members of each group appeared to be having fun, looking tight-knit and as they bounced to the beat of the songs. 
Counterpoint opened and closed the night, setting a precedent for the lighthearted feel of the evening and each group’s excitement to perform. They were incredibly energetic from the very beginning, with their mashup “Stereo Hearts of Fame,” to the very end with a spirited version of “Wannabe” by the Spice Girls. They also performed “Home” with two soulful and hilarious soloists — senior communication design and human-computer interaction double major Maggie Bignell and first-year mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Leo Zubillaga — and a beautiful rendition of “Trouble Is a Friend” by sophomore voice major Samantha Kronenfeld.
After Counterpoint’s opening number, the Treblemakers took the stage with inflatable instruments, immediately indicative of the character of the group. This spirit was certainly showcased in their first song, “Love Shack.” The rendition featured beautiful harmonies by first-year undeclared CIT student Sage Yort and first-year undeclared MCS student Kate Borst and a strong, entertaining performance by junior materials science and engineering major Jonathan Touchette. The group continued with a lovely version of The Hush Sound’s “Tidal Wave” and ended strong with a clear, beautiful performance of Adele’s “Skyfall.” Soloist and junior vocal performance major Bridget McCoy was incredible, and the arrangement of the backup vocals fit together perfectly.
Deewane, Carnegie Mellon’s all-male South Asian a cappella group, brought some international flavor with songs that fused Eastern and Western music very successfully. Their performances were light and gentle on the whole, with the exception of their last song, “Treasure,” which featured a lot of body and personality from soloists Haris Usmani, a master’s student in music, and senior psychology major Shawn Gupta.
Christian a cappella group Joyful Noise performed their first two songs, Imagine Dragon’s “Demons” and Poison’s “Something to Believe In,” in a clear and sweet manner. With their last song, they continued Deewane’s international theme with “Baba Yutu,” the Swahili translation of the Lord’s Prayer. This group truly performed as a unit, and its members seemed have a lot of confidence in each other.
The Soundbytes were a unit in a different way — like one organism breathing, moving, and singing as one. Their arrangements were layered to perfection, allowing solos to break out when advantageous and folding them into the other vocals at other times. Their performance featured a good set list arranged in unique, well-thought-out ways. They began with a bashful but deeply beautiful performance of “Used to Love You” by first-year architecture major Quinton Laurencio and continued with the heart-wrenchingly clear voice of soloist and senior computer science major Tyler Hedrick. Their set ended with the high-energy performance of “Candy Man” with three vocalists — undeclared CIT first-year Alexis De La Rosa, junior Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts student Divya Mouli, and junior psychology major Jaclyn Ross — blended to perfection, with Ross offering mind-boggling notes à la Christina Aguilera.
All-male group The Originals was another ensemble that worked as one. The background vocals took a front seat in their performances, being intricate, interesting, and incredibly attuned to each other. This musicality was accented by their uniform movement as they sang. Their soloists were incredibly talented, and sophomore vocal performance major Albert Stanley gave a strong performance with a lot of personality that had the audience laughing. Their “I Wish/Wild Wild West” mashup was arranged especially skillfully.
Also featured on the program was the University of Pittsburgh’s PalPITTations, a guest group of Pitt graduate students. This group was more closed off to the audience, but the soloists opened up in very emotional ways. Most notably, during the group’s performance of “Creep,” soloist Lindsay Johnson sang with a lot of feeling, and every note was punctuated by strong body language.
Throughout the night, the groups had the audience dancing in their seats, clapping along, and even crying at times. As each group brought its own flavor to the stage, audience members were able to see the common musicality and excitement of the night shine through, although each group took a different approach. The evening was an entertaining and enjoyable event that showcased remarkable talent while giving back to the musical community.

Inspired by the hit reality TV show Dancing with the Stars, “stars” from Greek life and various clubs on campus took to the ballroom dance floor with members of the Ballroom Dance Club. These competed for the mirror ball trophy and money for their philanthropies in the first annual Dancing with the Stars: CMU Edition, hosted by junior voice major Taylor Rawley. Junior business administration and statistics double major Nancy Yue, the Ballroom Dance Club events coordinator, organized the competition.
The stars were paired up with their partners just two weeks ago, making for a quick, hectic turnaround from complete strangers to performing couples. On Saturday night, Rangos Hall was full of friends and fans eager to see these stars show off their newfound dancing skills. The event began with a quick video montage of each couple introducing themselves and their dance before the first couples took the stage.
Dancers wowed the audience with fierce tangos, quick jives, romantic waltzes, and saucy sambos, dancing to impress with tricky lifts, captivating spins, and lightning-quick footwork.
On the other side of the competition, the judges were an entertaining and dynamic panel. The panel was composed of former professional ballroom dance competitor and teacher Christine Zona, former ballroom dancer Geoffrey Morgan, junior civil and environmental engineering major Michelle Couste, and computer science professor David Kosbie.
Though surprisingly insightful about the dances, the judges were also full of bad jokes, charm, and sincere compliments that kept the mood light throughout the evening. Following each dance, they gave their feedback — holistic if often humorous commentaries on lines, posture, energy, storytelling, and footwork. The audience was impressed by each dance and showed enthusiasm with loud cheering, but the judges went deeper.
Opening the show, junior computer science major Eric Lee and sophomore decision science major Tiffany Tse displayed strong technique with their cha-cha, but the dancers were critiqued for hesitating in their movements and for energy that “wasn’t entirely there.” Junior decision science major Hannah Wirt and first-year computer science major Marcus Todd amped up the energy with an impressive swing number that got both the crowd and the judges excited, though both Morgan and Zona made comments on the lack of real swing dancing in the piece. Junior mechanical engineering major Katie Sharkey and junior biology major Yimeng Xu changed the mood with an elegant Viennese waltz of romantic and simple grace, before senior English major Hannah Polack and senior electrical and computer engineering major Victor Wang switched things up again with a samba that was provocative and exciting, although the judges noted it lacked some technique.
In many cases, judges commented on the relationship between the dancers on stage, with either praise for seeming genuine or criticism for feeling forced and awkward. More than simply whether feet were pointed or not, the judges also discussed artistic elements such as the dancers’ ability to communicate a story and interpret the movements in a personal way.
Although light hearted, the judges’ feedback treated the dancers as if they were professionals. Keeping in mind that the dancers had just learned the dances within the couple of weeks, Kosbie commented, “I wish I could see this dance in a few weeks, but I think I’m going to be saying that a lot.”
As the evening progressed, the number of quirky tangents increased, with references to bad Pittsburgh drivers, the speed of burning salsa, and two of whether Carnegie Mellon can cure dementia purely through ballroom dancing.
Toward the end of the event, Zona made sure to compliment the entire group: “I think that in the two weeks everybody did a wonderful job — students and the Ballroom Dance Club that put together the routines.”
The winner was determined in part by a panel of judges and in part by the fans, who helped their favorite dancers win by liking photos on the Facebook page, buying tickets in dancers names and voting with their phones right after the show.
After all the dancers had performed, Rawley invited the audience to vote for their favorite dancers within the next five minutes online, and people quickly whipped out their smartphones to participate. 
The grand prize went to junior communication design major Sam Ahmed — representing Delta Tau Delta — and his partner, senior psychology major Helen Chao, for their fast, furious, and seamlessly timed jive.
After the excitement of the results died down, the Ballroom Dance Club finished off the night with one last dance. In addition to presenting a stress-relieving, fun event, the night also raised over $800, half of which will be going to Delta Tau Delta’s philanthropy, the Children’s Institute. Certainly a tradition to continue in the future, Dancing with the Starts: CMU Edition was able to combine dance, service, community, and humor into an engaging evening.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the first episode of American Horror Story: Coven, as well as spoilers for the first two seasons.
The third season of American Horror Story premiered Wednesday amid a whirlwind of high expectations. Its second season was nominated for 17 Emmys, and for the most part, the first episode — titled “Bitchcraft” — lived up to expectations.
This season, called American Horror Story: Coven, revolves around a coven of witches living in New Orleans at Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies. Here, four young women are taught to hone their powers by headmistress Cordelia Foxx, played by returning cast member Sarah Paulson.
The show’s various settings promise to lend themselves to an interesting season. The story jumps between 19th-century and present-day New Orleans, and it is already apparent that boiling tensions from events in the 1800s will resonate in the present as the season progresses. The academy is stunning with its whitewash hardwood flooring and ornate marble staircase, and the mansion is brimming with tension. The four student witches have already shown cracks in their solidarity, with Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) injuring Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts) with an act of voodoo halfway through the episode.
As per usual, the show presents a strong cast of characters who are sure to cause a stir.
“Darling, you have outdone yourself. How ever did you think this up?” asks a man — presumably Madame Delphine LaLaurie’s husband — during the episode’s opening sequence, set in 1834 New Orleans, as a young slave of hers places the head of a bull upon another slave. LaLaurie, played by Kathy Bates, is based on the historical figure of the same name who is now infamous for torturing her slaves.
Bates is a new addition to the repertoire of talented actresses who grace the show, and her appearance shows promise. Bates’s character is the most exciting in the episode, with the rift she has created between herself and Angela Bassett’s voodoo practitioner Marie Laveau, her reappearance in present-day New Orleans, and her truly disturbing rituals like nightly blood facials to tighten her flabby skin.
Returning to the cast after their absences from season two are Taissa Farmiga and Jamie Brewer, who played Violet Harmon and Adelaide Langdon respectively in season one. Their returns are welcome — especially that of Brewer, who plays a witch student, Nan, gifted with clairvoyance. Nan provides a sense of tension through her all-knowing and mysterious personality. Meanwhile, Farmiga’s character, Zoe Benson, promises to be a strong character who seeks justice in any way she can.
The show’s opening titles are impressive. As in past seasons, the titles are accompanied by creepy imagery consistent with the season’s themes, as well as the show’s disturbing theme music. Gone are the worn baby pictures and disturbed asylum inmates of the last seasons, replaced by voodoo dolls and figures draped in black stalking the woods.
While the first episode holds much promise for the season to come, certain aspects of the show disappoint.
The show seems to have returned to a slower, more relaxed pace than the previous season. The asylum in season two is a place with little refuge, but this season, there seems to be room for safety within the almost inviting witches’ school and the streets of New Orleans. The witches go to a fraternity party — admittedly, where tragic events unfold — and they prod at each other over the kitchen table. The relentlessness of the second season is gone, replaced by dark humor, which is similarly scattered throughout the first season.
However, there promises to be increasing tension as the show progresses. The potential for a bitter season has already been set up with the conflicts between Supreme Witch Fiona (Jessica Lange) and Cordelia, LaLaurie and Laveau, and Madison and the remaining fraternity boys.
While the character relations add unique tensions, the premise of the story echoes those that have been done before. Harry Potter has already claimed the idea of a boarding school for witches and wizards, and Disney has touched upon the premise with the Halloweentown movie series. There are even references to other witchcraft-centric stories in the episode: Fiona likens the mansion to Hogwarts, and she threatens to drop a house on her daughter à la The Wizard of Oz. One can only hope that the show’s creators do not linger upon the wonder of the boarding school, but focus instead on the tension between the witches, LaLaurie, and Laveau. Laveau will hopefully make a breakthrough appearance in present-day New Orleans soon.
Most disappointing is Jessica Lange’s character, Fiona. Lange’s acting is, of course, stellar: She fills the role of a witch desperate for youth and full of arrogance. However, the character does not seem as strong as expected. In fact, she seems weak. She almost begs a man at the beginning of the episode to provide her with a youth serum, and she gives in to her disappointment by killing him when the serum does not work. From that point on, she seems to be making up for the youth she does not have by berating the young witches at the boarding school. Her title as a Supreme Witch implies that she has power and personality unlike any other witch, but her current portrayal doesn’t live up to that name. Hopefully, her character will evolve into the headstrong, unrelenting witch that the title implies, rather than one who fights with the witches her daughter teaches.
While the first episode may not have the compelling pace or unique atmosphere of the second season, this third installment in the American Horror Story anthology is shaping up to be a free-for-all among a cast of strong female characters.

Emma Approved, the latest collaboration between Bernie Su and Hank Green of Pemberley Digital, premiered online last Monday. The duo formed the production company Pemberley Digital after their success with web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, which captured the hearts of viewers and went on to win two Streamy Awards and an Emmy for Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media.
Emma Approved was announced at VidCon 2013, a conference for online video creators, as an adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma, a novel about a matchmaking young woman who doesn’t exactly have her own life together.
Pemberley Digital’s Emma (Joanna Sotomura) is a 20-something member of the Highbury Lifestyle Group, Matchmaking and Lifestyle Division: In short, she’s an online matchmaker. She’s an opinionated, fast-talking perfectionist who doesn’t have time for “business development, book-keeping, boring stuff” — that’s the division of her business partner and future love interest Alex Knightley (Brent Bailey).
The series is a compilation of the vlog-style videos Emma makes in preparation for the inevitable documentary celebrating her future achievements. Su described this Emma as “Oprah for the YouTube Age” to thevideoink.com, a characterization upheld by Emma herself. She says she will one day “be like Oprah … but better!” — giving everyone a better love life just as Oprah gives out cars.
The first episode is a true pilot, introducing viewers to Emma and her world. She begins by reading a short snippet of an article written about her, lauding her success as a professional matchmaker. In this first episode, she’s on the verge of perfect success number 20: the marriage between cupcake mogul Ryan Weston (Gabriel Voss) and power homemaker Annie Taylor (Alexis Boozer). When Alex comes in to discuss business, viewers are able to see the playful relationship between the pair, which will eventually develop into a romance.
In the second episode, Alex’s role is a little more fleshed out: He’s there to make Emma think about the serious stuff, like what will happen if her perfect success rate is broken. It becomes obvious to the viewer that Emma doesn’t like to think about the negatives and only confronts the possibility of failure when forced to do so.
With an already-rabid fan base (which raised over 700 percent of the Kickstarter goal to fund The Lizzie Bennet Diaries DVD set), Internet success doesn’t seem like much of a problem for Emma Approved. However, it’s the small things, like Emma’s over-the-top winks to the camera, that could sink the project. The team should be wary of making Emma too self-confident.
Before beginning to write Emma, Jane Austen wrote, “I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.” Austen’s Emma meddled in other people’s lives, but she did so with only the best intentions. When she was wrong, she tried to make it right. Although the character has remained a classic, updating her story to the 21st century could prove disastrous. With so much technology at her disposal, Emma could lose sight of the good intentions at the heart of her meddling.
Even the idea of matchmaking for money seems a little out of character: Is she in it for the cash, or does she truly want to see people happy? Pemberley Digital needs to make sure that their Emma is still likeable and relatable, or else the audience will lose interest.
Installments of Emma Approved are released at 1 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays, with additional content released throughout the week.

Fantasy and reality collided once again on Thursday with the premiere of Once Upon a Time in Wonderland on ABC. The show is a spinoff of Once Upon a Time, now in its third season.
The show takes place within the Once Upon a Time universe, but follows Alice (Sophie Lowe) of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland as she searches for her lost love Cyrus (Peter Gadiot) in Wonderland, with the help of the White Rabbit (voiced by John Lithgow) and the Knave of Hearts (Michael Socha).
As in Once Upon a Time, familiar aspects of the story are contrasted by deviations from the Lewis Carroll classic, especially in character. In this first episode, Alice knows full well that the mushroom will change her size, and uses it accordingly to flee from the Queen’s soldiers by shrinking herself and hiding in the bottle lying beside the pathway. Alice discovers that her convenient hiding spot is actually a genie bottle inhabited by Cyrus, who is willing to open his bottle to her, even after she threatens to eat the other mushroom half and shatter the bottle with her sudden growth spurt. Instead of the meek, curious little girl we all know, this Alice is a strong character who is not afraid to face danger to get what she wants.
Alice and Cyrus become fast friends, and eventually fall in love, but in the exact moment that everything seems to fall into place for the lovers, the Red Queen (Emma Rigby) shows up. During the fight that ensues, Cyrus is pushed off a ledge into the boiling sea that lies below.
Flashbacks to Alice’s time in Wonderland are intercut with inquiries into her mental health, taking place at Bedlam Hospital in Victorian England. Wonderland is filled with vibrant colors and familiar scenes, such as Alice stealing a bit of magical mushroom and fleeing from the Queen of Hearts who screams “Off with her head!” Meanwhile, the colors of Bedlam are muted and dark; gloom pervades the place.
Alice escapes from Bedlam and goes back to Wonderland under the impression that Cyrus is alive. It is revealed to the viewer that the Rabbit has lured her back by order of the Queen, who’s working with Aladdin villain Jafar (Naveen Andrews). He’s after the wishes that Cyrus gave Alice, but the Queen’s motives remain secret for now.
Meanwhile, the Knave is reluctant to stay in Wonderland, unwilling to risk being discovered and punished for the things he did after Alice left. Although their initial search for Cyrus fails, Alice finds Cyrus’s amulet, a token that glows when she is near, and gains renewed hope that he is alive. She convinces the Knave to stay by promising to pay him in wishes.
In the final scenes, a flashback to Cyrus’s supposed death reveals that he was caught by Jafar on a flying carpet and is the Queen’s captive, imprisoned in a cage.
The first episode benefits from the set-up established by Once Upon a Time and the familiar story of Alice, so the show can jump right into the narrative. The weaknesses of the show will come not from the story, but from the production details. Since the show will presumably be set in Wonderland most of the time, viewers may get distracted by the low-quality graphics that make up the background and characters like the Rabbit or the Cheshire Cat.
Although Alice and Cyrus are the star-crossed lovers here, it is the chemistry between Alice and the Knave that compels viewers most. It becomes obvious that the Knave really cares about Alice — in a platonic way — and is staying not just for the payment, but also to make sure she stays safe.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland airs Thursdays at 
8 p.m. on ABC.

Over 2,000 people were gathered at Stage AE last Monday at around 9:30 p.m., anxiously awaiting the moment when the house lights would turn down and the dull music filling the silence would be cut off. Some of these people looked like they had just come from work, while others looked like they’d never worked a day in their life. Some were dressed head to toe in neon and glitter, while others wore nearly nothing at all.
An outsider looking in might ask, what could possibly bring together all these people, from seemingly all different sects of society? The answer: Bassnectar.
Lorin Ashton — also known as Bassnectar — is one of the biggest names in the American electronic dance music movement. Producing a signature brand of dubstep that samples everything from hip-hop to heavy metal, Ashton has been releasing music under the name Bassnectar since 2001. In addition, he has been touring consistently since 2005, and throughout his career he has gradually gained a reputation as one of the most skilled artists of the electronic genre in terms of live performance. Unlike many other electronic artists who employ a “push play” method of live performance that involves very little effort on their part, Ashton instead mixes tracks on the spot. This approach ensures that Bassnectar shows are both extremely energetic and very distinct from each other.
It’s not just his technical skill that makes the Bassnectar experience a memorable one, however. The sound system he employs is loud enough to make your entire body shake involuntarily, and the massive screen that towers behind him flashes incessantly with everything from abstract visuals to a series of clips from Disney’s Alice in Wonderland. A Bassnectar concert is a microcosm of what it’s like to live in the modern era: a constant and unrelenting sensory overload.
While sticking primarily to his impressive wealth of original material, Ashton also gave some other artists’ tunes — such as Kid Cudi’s modern classic “Day ‘n’ Nite” and Azealia Banks’s hit “212” — the Bassnectar treatment. It was pretty disorienting to hear the voice of Bruno Mars singing “Locked Out Of Heaven” over the heavy womps and hard-hitting drums, but everyone’s allowed a few mistakes.
Any kind of human gathering this large and spirited is a pretty beautiful thing. Ages ranged from the teens to the 30s, but that was no matter: Everyone was simply there to dance away and enjoy the music, without worrying about tomorrow. Approximately 20 minutes into his over-two-hour set, the music suddenly cut out and Ashton started walking off the stage. The puzzled crowd began to shout, bringing the long-haired virtuoso back toward the microphone. “It’s Monday night; don’t you guys have work and s*** tomorrow?”
A sold-out Stage AE uniformly responded in the negative, and the assault on the senses resumed.

Revolution: It’s a term that comes to mind when thinking about the world today. Regimes are overthrown in the Middle East, and forces like the Tea Party and the Occupy movement call for dramatic changes to our own government. Even from a non-political perspective, we live in a time of great change, with smartphones, Twitter, and a whole array of social technologies that change how we get and share information.
This idea of revolution is the thematic core of Without Their Permission, a memoir by Alexis Ohanian, the 30-year-old co-founder of popular viral-content website reddit. Throughout the book, Ohanian discusses the origins of the companies and websites he helped create, gives advice for those also interested in entrepreneurship, and emphasizes the importance of the open environment that helped facilitate such growth in the tech sector.
Ohanian starts off with childhood stories about his family, where his entrepreneurial spirit takes root. The anecdotes are often humorous: Ohanian describes pitching software to uninterested customers at CompUSA as a 14-year-old and recalls fellow reddit co-founder Steve Huffman’s disappointment that the Alexis across the hall in his first-year dorm was, in fact, not a girl.
Throughout the book, Ohanian imbues his stories with a sarcastic humor that helps portray him as a fully fleshed-out individual. When reprinting an email he once sent to Huffman, he apologizes that the keyboard he used to type it must have had a broken button that inserted “bro” throughout the email. It’s self-deprecating, and it’s good to see such a successful entrepreneur make fun of himself.
Ohanian focuses heavily on the concept of gatekeepers: how media for art, products, and creativity once had to go through a middleman before reaching public exposure. Musicians had record labels, filmmakers had studios, and software developers needed distributors. But now, in an age when musicians like Macklemore and Ryan Lewis can release an album independently and have it go platinum, there is no gatekeeper. Distribution is as easy as posting something online, and public exposure depends on whether the masses deem it worthy of their time.
He emphasizes how this environment of an open Internet was crucial to the founding and continued success of reddit and nearly every other web giant out there. On this note, he heavily discusses the threat to this Internet openness that reared its ugly head last year through deliberations over the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA).
It would have been interesting if Ohanian had tackled the issues that SOPA and PIPA created from a technical or entrepreneurial perspective. The truly compelling point to his discussion, however, is how non-technical people have taken advantage of an open Internet to change the world for the better. One example is that of Debby Guardino, a special education teacher from Virginia who utilized crowdfunding website DonorsChoose.org to raise over $800,000 for schools in Joplin, Mo., after it was hit with an EF5 tornado in May 2011. Ohanian emphasizes that without an open Internet, one of the only job sectors that saw growth throughout the Great Recession — technology — would be crucially hindered, and an entire medium for global humanitarianism would be rendered inoperable.
Without Their Permission is a good read, whether you are a budding tech entrepreneur or just have a passing interest in the Internet (which in this day and age should include everyone). Though at times Ohanian may come off as cocky — as evidenced by the title of the book and his unnecessarily repeated emphasis that you don’t have to ask for permission to change the world — Ohanian’s stories are earnest and inspiring. Whether it’s his advice on how to get your startup company going, or how one act of kindness can have such a ripple effect on the Web, the reader walks away understanding what the Internet ultimately is: a revolution.

Dear Matt,
I don’t really understand most of your jokes. I mean, I do, but it usually takes me a while and you just sit there with this blank look on your face like, “Holy crow, I just made the best joke of my life and you’re not laughing in support of it.” To be fair, I don’t laugh that hard at jokes anyway, but I feel there is a distinct disconnect between your punchlines and my comprehending them (maybe I’m not always sure when you’re joking). I do get your jokes in the end, and that’s what counts, right?
Sincerely,
Really Yucks Afterwards, Nonvoluntarily
Dear RYAN,
It’s not you; it’s me. Wait, are we breaking up? You always seem to have seen all the goofy stuff that I’m exposed to. I thought we shared so much knowledge of Internet and television pop culture that at any joke or reference I make, you will catch the line and rib on it further. If I can’t show you funny Internet cats, maybe I can make you laugh about what happens when a room temperature superconductor walks into a bar. The bartender tells him to leave, and he does so, without putting up any resistance. No? Okay. I’ll go for slapstick next time.
Everybody laughs at people slipping on banana peels, right?
Matt
Dear Ryan,
I can never seem to get you to laugh at my jokes. I don’t know what’s wrong; do they just go over your head? I suppose we need to do some impedance matching because I am an ECE major and you are a physics major, but I thought we were both sufficiently nerdy that the relationship would work. Do you not value all the time we’ve spent together?
Sincerely, 
Meaning Absent, Truly Tried
Dear MATT,
That right there is a loaded question. Of course I value the time we’ve spent, but … maybe … maybe it’s not you. Maybe it’s me. You know? Because you … you’re a really funny guy. Like, seriously. You tell really good jokes. 
But, I don’t know … maybe I’m just not attuned to your sense of humor. Or maybe … maybe I just don’t like your sense of humor. I know that’s hard to hear (or rather, read), but it could be true. Regardless, I’ve been trying hard to understand your jokes, and I think I’ve been getting better at getting them sooner, so … bear with me.
I still don’t entirely understand the hydrogen joke,
Ryan

Semester Online, which debuted at Carnegie Mellon this semester, offers students an opportunity to gain credit from online courses at other universities.
Semester Online describes itself as a “first-of-its-kind program offering rigorous, for-credit online courses from prestigious colleges and universities to top undergraduate students worldwide.” The program began with over 100 students in 10 courses across the consortium, and has expanded to 19 courses for the coming spring semester.
Semester Online courses are provided to Carnegie Mellon students by consortium partner schools, such as Boston College, Brandeis University, Emory University, Northwestern University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Notre Dame, Wake Forest University, and Washington University in St. Louis, all of which were ranked in the top 35 of U.S. News & World Report’s annual Best Colleges list for 2014.
Courses consist of weekly live classes via webcam and online chats, capped at 20 students, with traditional class structure — including discussions, slides, and quizzes. These courses are designed to be equivalent to on-campus classes and are taught by the same professors.
“Despite calling in from all different places across the country, it has been really easy to interact and connect with the professors and other students,” said Northwestern journalism major Netta-Lee Lax, according to Semester Online. “The class I’m in only has three other students, which has made the learning process more fulfilling for me personally.”
All courses from Semester Online are worth three credits, which are accepted by Carnegie Mellon. The university offering the course will issue the credit, provided that the student has completed the course with a passing grade, and the student will receive an official transcript from that university.
“The expansion of Semester Online’s course offerings demonstrates the speed at which the program is growing, as we provide more students the opportunity to participate in this unique academic experience,” said Andrew Hermalyn, executive vice president and general manager of Semester Online.
Courses for the spring 2014 semester include How to Rule the World from Boston College, Baseball and American Culture from Emory University, Electronics Out of the Box from Northwestern University, and Critical Earth Issues from Washington University in St. Louis.
Semester Online gives students the opportunity to take courses that they otherwise would not be able to, if the desired course is not taught at their university, or if they can’t be on campus due to a full-time job or internship.
“Students will no longer grapple with the dilemma of sacrificing an internship or volunteer opportunity to take a required course,” wrote Northwestern senior William McLaughlin in The Daily Northwestern.
Many students find the weekly classes easier to fit into a busy schedule, and since students can attend class anywhere with Internet access, they can take courses while studying abroad or at home over the summer.
According to USA Today, Emory University senior and Semester Online student Nenad Tadic said, “In our increasingly ‘busy’ lives, we want to pursue as many opportunities as we can without having their qualities devalued and online courses allow us to do that.”
“The fact is, everyone is very bright and really wants to be there. And the flexibility is awesome. It’s definitely something I’d recommend to other students,” Tadic said.
“Semester Online is a convenient option because it’s easy to fit into your schedule, especially for busy students like athletes,” said Gary DiLisio, academic advisor for the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. “But I think for the average Carnegie Mellon student it’s not enough; students here care about learning and want more interaction than online classes can provide.”
To apply for a course in the spring 2014 semester, students must be enrolled in a regionally accredited institution, in good academic standing, and apply by Dec. 23. Admission is limited, and students are selected based on their academic achievement and strength of transcript, although those who apply to Semester Online by Nov. 22 are preferred.

Multicolored dribbles of paint up the steps and down the hallway of Doherty Hall have caused the reinforcement of rules regarding the Fence.
Last Thursday, the student government Executive Committee sent out an email to the campus community outlining existing rules about the use of paint in the areas surrounding the Fence.
The rules for the Fence, according to university guidelines, include using only paintbrushes, keeping paint and paint materials only within the gravel area surrounding the Fence, removing paint supplies after finishing painting, utilizing the sink in the janitor’s closet in Doherty Hall instead of the first floor bathroom sinks to clean paintbrushes, and not dripping paint on the steps outside or inside Doherty Hall.
The paint smudges, which have been a recurring issue since last spring, are technically considered campus vandalism. Additionally, such vandalism, especially paint on the steps and inside of Doherty Hall, may be a costly fix. 
Sophomore mechanical engineering major Anna Mirabella, who took the Fence with the Kappa Alpha Theta pledge class, said that she witnessed paint dribbles in Doherty, specifically in the first floor bathroom. “It was definitely a problem before, but I think that this is a very simple change that people can make that will help keep our school cleaner. Paint isn’t always to easy to clean up, so it also wasn’t fair to make other people clean up after the students’ mess.”
Student government has rarely found reason in the past to enforce the rules for the Fence, according to student body president Lindsay MacGillivray.
“In the past we had not set any specific guidelines because we felt it was something that as a campus, we shared and held together, but at the same time, if students are damaging campus property, something needs to be done,” she said.
The rules regarding the Fence were purposely written vaguely because of the sense that the Fence is not owned by the university, but by the student body as a whole.
“The responsibility and the privileges of the Fence are shared by all students on campus and so when people felt like they needed to complain about it was student government, but really we don’t have any set jurisdiction over it,” MacGillivray said.
“We wanted to have a more clear definition of what the rules meant. We took what already existed, and put it in more specific terms,” MacGillivray continued.
Complaints from various faculty members brought student government’s attention to the vandalism, and student government is in the process of implementing action.
In order to enforce better care of campus property and the Fence, student government has issued signs, which are currently posted in Doherty and on the tables near the Fence, reminding students to be careful about dripping paint.
The student government Executive Committee is also putting out plastic bags by the Fence to alleviate the problem of dripping paint inside Doherty as students are carrying their paintbrushes to the sink for washing. The last component of the enforcement of these rules includes a fine, which will be charged against the organizations that are found to have dripped paint and vandalized campus property.
According to MacGillivray, student government will be flexible in charging organizations for the fines, however, she hopes that the action taken to prevent such vandalism will eliminate the issue.
Sophomore information systems major Nathan Oh said that even though he is involved with Asian Students Association and Sigma Alpha Epsilon — and has painted the Fence multiple times — he was unaware of the Fence painting rules. “I didn’t know that dripping paint outside of the Fence area was considered vandalism, so I think it was a good first step that student government sent out that email, because now I and others know, and will be more careful.”

Three Carnegie Mellon graduates recently created MeWants, recently created MeWants, an app that allows students to post requests for services they would like completed. Carnegie Mellon students, many without cars, often run into trouble when needing to obtain certain materials, furniture, groceries or supplies.
Former Carnegie Mellon graduate students Mohit Bijlani (HNZ ’07) and Mikhil Innani (HNZ ’11), along with SUNY Buffalo alumna Chaitanya Mehta (HNZ ’11), created MeWants in order to alleviate some of these burdens. The idea for the startup was conceived while the three were at Carnegie Mellon and it won the Keith Block Entrepreneurship Challenge offered by the university.
“MeWants is an outsourcing site that allows people to outsource their tasks to the community. Someone logs in, posts a task, and can make it visible for something like a 5–10 mile radius for the specific period. It’s like a Craigslist, but students have an inherent trust with others in the student community,” Bijlani said.
According its website, “MeWants lets you post tasks you’d like completed, as well as the price you’re willing to pay for the service, to a willing audience in your area.”
A person who wants to get their groceries picked up, receive help with moving or getting to an airport would log into the app and pay another user to help them. While currently focusing on Carnegie Mellon’s student body, MeWants hopes to expand to the University of Pittsburgh and beyond in the future.
Bijlani feels the app is appealing for students because it does not charge extra for its services. “The app itself is free, but we offer cash and Paypal options for payment,” he said. 
“We had students who have had similar issues, and we would willingly help people move out for a quick buck. The idea started there.... We didn’t really think about the monetary value, and we don’t want the app to have annoying ads. So we’re mostly using Paypal [to earn money],” he continued.
For those hoping to create a startup, Bijlani offered some advice. He particularly stressed the importance of networking. “I always wanted to create a startup, and I worked on my first startup with a friend from India.”
Innani originally approached Bijlani for advice, but after demonstrating passion for the project, “things took off from there. You should have an idea that you want to put 10 years of your life into, and having financial stability helps. You can also work for a startup,” Bijlani said.
Bijlani feels the entrepreneurial atmosphere at Carnegie Mellon, while imperfect, is constantly improving. “The focus is very much on getting jobs, but I know there has been a concerted effort by the university to build a connection between Tepper and the [computer science] community. There needs to be that push from the university to have students understand it’s okay to fail and have times when these things don’t work.”
Students are interested in the emergence of these campus-focused startup companies. 
Sarabeth Perry, sophomore global studies major, thinks that the idea behind MeWants is appealing. “It’s probably a better thing than CraigsList because you know the people [in the community]. It sounds like it could be messy, but it could also work,” she said.
In the past, students have often turned to Facebook for secondhand goods. Facebook pages for students of different years in the university have been used to advertise and sell goods ranging from tickets, phones, Megabus credits, and textbooks. This past year, another page, “For Sale @ CMU” was created to more directly offer students a chance to buy goods for lower prices from peers who are looking to unload their unwanted items. 
As of Sunday, Oct. 13 there were 823 members listed in the group, with things like food containers, longboards, books and hair dryers being bought and sold. MeWants hopes to cater to this audience.
Mehta and Innani are currently working on the app among other projects, while Bijlani is working on it full time and talking to investors.

“Win or lose, you represent the best that staff has to offer, and your contributions are an example for staff members who serve day in and day out to improve our campus community,” said John Lanyon, chair of staff council, at the 19th annual Andy Awards. 
The ceremony, which was held in McConomy Auditorium, honors Carnegie Mellon faculty and staff for their contributions to the university.
President Subra Suresh began the ceremony by talking about the importance of outstanding faculty and staff to the university experience. 
“[Students] get recognition — they get a degree, they get awards. But, with respect to staff, there isn’t recognition for the powerful work they do behind the scenes, as perhaps there should be. And this is why we acknowledge, and recognize, and celebrate people who do so much behind the scenes,” Suresh said.
The awards, held last Thursday, were given in a variety of categories. The first awards were given by Lanyon for staff service; 28 faculty and staff members were honored for 30 years of service, and 10 were recognized for 35 years. Two faculty and staff members — Marian Kovalchik, assistant department head for finance for electrical and computer engineering, and Alan Guisewite, operations assistant at the Robotics Institute — were recognized for 40 years of service to Carnegie Mellon.
University provost and H. John Heinz III professor of economics and public policy Mark Kamlet spoke next. Kamlet credited Carnegie Mellon’s progress as an institution over the last few decades to its dedicated staff and faculty. 
“I’ve often said that I can’t think of another institution of higher education in the U.S. that’s come as far, as fast as CMU has. And, indeed, we have evolved from a highly regional institution to one with such a national and international stature,” Kamlet said.
Next, Kamlet announced the recipient of the Andy Award for Outstanding Dedication. According to the Andy Awards website, this award is meant for a faculty or staff member who “takes great pride in their work” and has an “unyielding commitment to quality performance.”
The Outstanding Dedication award was given to Anne Witchner Levin (DC ’73), assistant dean of student affairs and and director of orientation and first-year programs.
“I was honored to be nominated and very moved to win the Andy Award, especially because the category had something close to 20 nominations,” Witchner said via email. 
“At CMU, I have had innumerable unique opportunities to work with students on some of the best programs and experiences.... I also had the opportunity to help create new programs with exceptional students and colleagues.”
The next Andy Award was for Outstanding Commitment to Students. 
This award honors a staff or faculty member who is,“dedicated to providing guidance and assistance to the students of the university.”
This award was given to Helen Wang (DC ’99), director of student life for first-year houses and Morewood E-tower housefellow. 
“I’m deeply humbled, quite in shock and feeling so fortunate to be a part of this generous community.   I am so touched by the time and generosity of spirit that was put into this nomination by people that I care so deeply about,” Wang said in an email. 
The Andy Award for Outstanding Innovation was given to the Tepper School of Business (TSB) Marketing and Communications Team, which includes Stephanie Armbruster (A ’06), Karen Boucher, Mark Burd, Barbara Donehue, Deb Lantz (HSS ’06), Susan Limoncelli, Joey Mancuso, and Martha Sproul.
The Marketing and Communications Team, according to its website, helps those in the Tepper School of Business and others across the university with brand projection and public relations. 
The Outstanding Innovation Andy Award “recognizes those who have developed new approaches, methods and systems to improve organizational effectiveness,” according to the Andy Awards website.
The next Andy Award was for Outstanding Culture. This award was given to Samuel Boyer, senior director of organizational management within the College of Engineering. 
James H. Garrett, Jr., Thomas Lord professor of engineering and dean of the College of Engineering, nominated Boyer because he is, “passionate about providing staff with opportunities to grow their skills in an effort to retain and recruit high-performing staff members.”
The Andy Award for Outstanding University Citizenship was awarded to Romayne Botti, associate dean of finance and operations for the College of Engineering.

The tattoo, seen as exotic, painful, and rebellious, is a part of everyday expression: 23 percent of Americans have at least one tattoo, and 38 percent of 18-29 year olds have some sort of inking, according to a Pew Research poll conducted in 2010. David Beckham, once England’s golden soccer boy, has sleeves filled with ink. Angelina Jolie also has skin modifications over much of her body, all of which drew the press’s speculation as to what they mean.
A spokesman for the U.S. Army officially stated that the army “is a uniformed service where the public judges a soldier’s discipline in part by the manner in which he or she wears the uniform, as well as by the individual’s personal appearance,” according to The Wall Street Journal. Newly proposed regulations under final review by the army will not allow soldiers to have tattoos below the knee or elbow. This new restriction has led to a spike in parlor visits from servicemen and women. Until now, tattoos were allowed everywhere except the face and neck. The army administration is not only trying to combat this rising trend, but is also unnecessarily opposing its subculture of tattooed soldiers.
In our current society, where people share personal information through Facebook posts and tweets, the popularity of tattoos makes sense. Walking around with a quotation on the arm, a bald eagle on the shoulder, or a kanji symbol on the ankle all serves to tell random bystanders who a person is and what they stand for. Tattoos are projections of things people like on Facebook, the tweets they retweet, and everything in their life they hold dear, blended together and permanently etched into their skin.
Let’s be honest: Tattoos add a sense of rebellion, danger, and excitement to men and women. A poll conducted by Harris Interactive in 2012 showed that 30 percent of tattooed people feel more sexy with their tattoos, while 25 percent say they make them feel more rebellious. 21 percent of tattooed people say that tattoos make them feel sexy or strong.
Where does this image of tattoos come from? For one, the hippie culture in the 1960s created much of the association of counterculture with tattoos, according to the National Post. That’s where the rebellious nature of tattoos comes in. PBS says that during World War II — the golden age of tattoos — U.S. soldiers and U.S. Navy sailors often felt lost in the large number of uniforms, and were the first large subculture to have some sort of inking. Sailors would often have engravings of scantily clad women on their arms, furthering the rebellious and risqué subculture of tattoos in the Armed Forces. Now, the army’s administration, countering the popular stereotype, wants the Armed Forces to be presented as clean cut, according to The Wall Street Journal.
These new restrictions sever soldiers’ rights to express themselves. “Every tattoo I have on my body says something about who I am, where I’m from, or the things I’ve been through,” said First Sergeant Aki Paylor in an article published by the official website of the United States Army, specifically mentioning his “warrior ethos” tattoo. Military personnel go through intensive training, get thrown under remarkable pressure, and are often lost in a mass of shaved heads and uniformity. It seems normal for them to have a need to illustrate their identity among the sea of camouflage uniforms. Not only could tattoos help others recognize who someone is behind the uniform and haircut, it could help soldiers themselves to realize who they were, are, and want to be. 
Being in the military — not even on the front lines — can be an immensely stressful experience, and a solid surface for military personnel to hold onto could be incredibly comforting. That solid surface is their body inking.

You would be forgiven for tuning into Fox News in the near future and thinking that the entire newsroom is en route to Mars. The cable news channel has rebuilt its newsroom into what it calls a News Deck. The News Deck has been equipped with a dizzying array of technology designed to help the station provide updates to the new non-linear viewer. Non-linear viewers don’t sit down and watch TV regularly, but rather “tune in on [their] time,” according to Fox News anchor Shepard Smith.
Combating the threat of the uninformed non-linear viewer requires employees to use “Big Area Touchscreens”, 55-inch screens that can be used to  trawl social media for posts containing trending buzzwords. There is also now a 30-foot-long screen on which anchors can move photos around with a Wii Remote-like wand. The people operating the pointlessly large screens will be the journalists who would normally be at desks working on stories, who can now have their work stations broadcast to millions of viewers at a moment’s notice.
Why? Because there are tweets, Facebook posts, and a host of unvetted information out there to share with viewers. Because the viewer doesn’t tune into the news for accurate information. You tune in to hear what the Internet thinks, and the best way to do that is by putting the people who do the most important work in the organization on the bridge of the Enterprise so they can get sensory overload.
Sarcasm aside, Fox News is not alone in the “news as entertainment” movement on television. However, the station is taking this movement to new and ridiculous heights while eroding what bits of journalistic integrity it had left. 
The station is aiming to provide even more coverage of frequently unreliable social media posts, despite recent embarrassments suffered by many major television news sources. It is selling these posts to viewers with flashing lights and unnecessary moving images.
No part of this revamped News Deck contributes to good reporting; None of it actually helps the viewer. News sources need to provide facts and, in the case of Fox News, right-leaning opinions. Trying to give viewers a seizure with more screens than you are likely to find on the bridge of a modern aircraft carrier is not the way to do it. This newsroom is perhaps the most visible example imaginable of favoring flash over substance, since Fox News stated that its intent is to do even less original coverage and, instead, let the Internet provide it with content.
In the video tour of the deck, Smith mentions that modern viewers have changed their preferences for learning about a story; they now follow the news on phones and computers. Instead of trying to provide something unique — offering a better or more effective in-depth story — the station is trying to offer more of the same. Fox News seems sure that others will imitate their News Deck, but with luck they will strike an asteroid instead.

“We’ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It’s disgusting,” said a national park service ranger who was disturbed by instructions received from a boss, according to The Atlantic Wire. The United States has strictly enforced the closure of its national park services due to the government shutdown and has gone as far as putting more effort into restricting citizens from entering parks than it has simply allowing them to remain open.
Because Congress has been unable to agree on a budget, it makes sense that national parks have been unable to operate; financial funding is required to operate anything. However, what does not make sense is that, while the government has suspended their national park services, they have continued to keep a number of service members on the payroll, simply to restrict American citizens from accessing the parks.
Perhaps one of the most disturbing cases of this restriction is the World War II Memorial. As an open-air monument, it is available to citizens 24 hours a day. The monument was constructed almost entirely on private funding with $197 million in donations. There are little to no resources required to operate this monument, besides perhaps a guard or two. However, it has been physically barricaded from the public, and several workers have been put on guard to ensure that citizens cannot access it, according to Time magazine.
According to Fox News, Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) stated on the House floor last Tuesday that the Federal government is currently putting forth more resources to pay Federal workers to barricade the American people out of some national monuments than it does to actually operate them. These initiatives are nothing but a political game.
The idea that the closure of the World War II Memorial and others is a political game is only strengthened when one considers that the Republican National Committee offered to pay $150,000 a month to keep the monument open to the public during the course of the shutdown, according to The Daily Caller. They obviously wanted to make the Democrats look like the bad guys. In turn, the fact that the Obama Administration informed the Republicans that they cannot legally accept this offer shows that they do not want to make the Republican Party look like the good guys.
The Obama Administration and the Democratic Party clearly want to make the impact of the shutdown as widespread as possible, in order to cause the Republican Party’s approval ratings to plummet. If this is their objective, they have been successful so far. 
According to MSNBC, only 5 percent of Americans currently approve of Congress. Moreover, an Associated Press-GfK Group survey found that 62 percent of Americans placed the blame on Republicans for the government shutdown.
Sadly, this shutdown simply reflects the entire problem with Washington. It is currently a duopoly where the primary objective of each party is to defeat the other. 
This mindset is why this shutdown has lasted this long. Both parties want to look like the hero, and neither is willing to budge to the other.

An article published in last week’s issue of The Tartan titled “Address global warming to sidestep dire effects” stated that people of first world nations must aid those whom they have affected, seeing as first world nations have contributed most of the pollution that is perpetuating global warming.
But who is to blame for this climate change? Most would point fingers at these so-called first world nations and with due cause. According to CNN, 20 percent of the world’s wealthiest nations are responsible for 80 percent of global emissions. Meanwhile, the one billion poorest people in the world are responsible for a mere 3 percent of global emissions. 
Evidently, wealthy nations contribute most to environmental degradation while developing countries are doomed to experience the worst effects of climate change. In fact, University of California, Berkeley professor Richard Norgaard said on CNN that the environmental debt the world’s wealthiest nations owe to the poorest exceeds the estimated third world debt by over $4 billion.
However, when discussing environmental degradation, individuals must be considered above nations. Carbon footprint levels do not travel with national identity, but they might very well come paired with a person’s income.
Developing nations such as China, India, and Brazil are producing millionaires at increasingly higher rates. The rise of these new rich, coupled with the expansion of middle classes in developing countries, has dangerous implications for the environment. Increases in standard of living — modeled after Western consumer culture — must be tied inexorably to high levels of consumption. In addition, the two most prominent developing countries — India and China — are home to over 35 percent of the world’s population, according to the International Business Times. There is real immediate danger in these nations aiming to live like Americans; population blog Per Square Mile says that if everyone did, we would need about four planet Earths.
Ultimately, many environmental problems are beyond the scope of a single nation. Policing the world’s greatest common resource — the ocean — is impossible without collaboration, and who can say where one nation’s air stops and another’s begins? Most other limited resources only fall under the jurisdiction of a nation through the luck of geography. All efforts to save the environment must therefore be collaborative, with countries working together to salvage the only planet they will ever have.
Still, many developed nations have a habit of standing apart from the pack in negative ways. The United States is notorious for bowing out of international environmental treaties, most memorably the 1997 Kyoto Treaty for reducing carbon emissions. America was one of few industrialized nations not to ratify, and the treaty suffered a serious blow to its clout without the backing of such an internationally crucial player.
Clearly, developed nations must tackle their own lacking environmental policies before citing any kind of moral obligation to help developing countries rise to their level. This idea of a moral obligation suggests that the United States and similar nations intrinsically know much better than the leaders, scientists, and activists of a nation what is best for their nation’s development, which is hypocrisy on an extreme scale.
America remains the nation with the largest carbon footprint per capita by carbon dioxide emissions — a position it has held without shame for decades, according to Postconsumers.com. Although China takes first place for carbon emissions overall, China is distinguishing itself as impressively progressive in dealing with the environmental consequences of rapid industrialization. No other evidence can better disprove the insulting idea that developed nations somehow owe developing countries their expertise on matters of environmentally sustainable progress.
Perhaps placing blame is pointless. It certainly wastes time that could be better spent by taking a hard look at how our own actions are impacting the environment. After all, if individuals can hold great responsibility for degrading the environment, they also have the power to enact lasting positive change.

In a recent interview with WHP-TV in Harrisburg, Governor Tom Corbett (R-Pa.) recently compared the idea of legalizing gay marriage to the idea of legalizing incest. According to the Los Angeles Times, on Oct. 4 he apologized for his recent court filing that initially compared the marriage of gay couples to child marriage on the basis that both are illegal in Pennsylvania.
Corbett acknowledged unsarcastically, “It was an inappropriate analogy, you know. I think a much better analogy would have been brother and sister, don’t you?” While he later apologized for this comparison, after outrage from the gay community, this is indicative of the uninformed and out-of-touch mindset of legislators who oppose gay marriage.
Corbett is far from the first national politician to exhibit such insensitivity toward the issue of gay rights, let alone the first Pennsylvania politician. Most notably, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum is notorious for his opposition to gay rights. According to The Huffington Post, he has stated his belief that legalizing gay marriage would discourage future heterosexual marriages. He has also stated that legalizing gay marriage would lead to the legalization of bigamy, incest, and polygamy, according to CNN..
The conservative evangelical policy makers that hold these views not only find themselves out of touch with their constituents, but in some cases, also with their own religions. While not completely in line with increasingly popular views on gay rights, the Church of Latter-day Saints has made strides for openness and acceptance toward homosexual individuals. According to Time magazine, Mormon leaders have backed the Boy Scouts of America’s move to allow openly gay scouts, and church leaders no longer advise gay members to marry only people of the opposite sex. The Catholic Church has similarly seen some progress. According to CNN, Pope Francis stated in July, “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?” 
While religious institutions may still oppose gay marriage, they express greater degrees of acceptance than Corbett.
It is time for politicians to do their research, become more conscious of the scope of gay rights, and better reflect the views of their constituents and their religious beliefs. 
If Corbett fails to adopt a more accepting stance similar to other conservative figures and institutions, he may lose the support of his constituents.

Carnegie Mellon currently has 72 two-way emergency phones, according to the university’s 2013 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. To many students, these phones are known as blue lights. 
The phones are well-distributed throughout the main parts of campus, around academic buildings, and near the Cut, the Mall, and Gesling Stadium.
As Carnegie Mellon expands in accordance with its 10-year Master Plan, The Tartan hopes that the university expands its blue light system, both into newly obtained and currently owned properties.
While the blue light system may not seem to some students an effective way to protect themselves against crime, it contributes to a safer campus atmosphere. More importantly, this option for safety, if not available, could be costly to students’ well-being.
According to the 2013 Annual Security and Safety Report, there is only one blue light located on Craig Street near the University Police Department. 
There are no blue lights within the vicinity of Fairfax Apartments or on Fifth Avenue between WQED and the Residence on Fifth. Furthermore, there are no blue lights near both Shirley Apartments and Webster Hall. Fifth Avenue is a high-traffic area for students living in these residences, especially since many students use the pathway between WQED and the Morewood parking lot to get to campus. Forbes Avenue presents a similar situation, as there are few easily accessible blue lights along the avenue, most notably near the Panther Hollow Inn. These areas are presumably more dangerous than areas that rest within the main part of campus, such as near Hunt Library or other academic buildings, where blue lights are already installed.
The university should attempt to fix these patches in its blue light system. The lack of blue lights in these areas may be logistical, and would depend upon whether or not the university owns property where it might place the lights. If this is the case, the university should work to place blue lights within the boundaries of its buildings’ properties, or work with the owners of properties that house Carnegie Mellon students, but are not owned by the university, to establish blue lights.
As the university expands over the next 10 years, Carnegie Mellon must place blue lights not only near new facilities that arise, but also near facilities that currently lack blue lights nearby.

October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, but unfortunately, many people are unaware of it.
Started in 1987 by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), this awareness campaign is highly under-recognized, but extremely important.
Many people are uncomfortable with the topic of domestic violence and often consider it taboo when discussing societal issues. Most cases of domestic violence are not reported to the police. 
Only one in four people report physical assaults by partners, and one in five report rapes, says the NCADV. One in four women will be a victim of domestic abuse in her lifetime, according to the NCADV. 
Our society needs to become more open about discussing this sensitive topic.
The effects of domestic violence extend beyond the scope of the immediate victim. 
The NCADV reports that witnessing violence between parents is the strongest risk factor for carrying violent behavior into the next generation. This correlation is often seen in boys who witness domestic violence; they are twice as likely to abuse their own partners when they become adults.
Carnegie Mellon’s student life website has listed some community resources available for victims of domestic abuse including the Alle-Kiski Area Hope Center, Womansplace, Inc., the Women’s Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, and Center for Victims of Violent Crime (CVVC).
The philanthropic efforts of Alpha Chi Omega also serve to break this barrier on campus. Each October, the sorority organizes an event titled Walk A Mile in Her Shoes, in which men are sponsored to wear women’s shoes. Proceeds go to the Pittsburgh Women’s Shelter and the national chapter of Alpha Chi Omega. The campus chapter also sponsors other events throughout the year to combat domestic violence.
These efforts are admirable, and The Tartan hopes that similar efforts are enacted on larger scales worldwide to break down the barriers preventing discussion of this issue. Domestic violence must become less taboo if we are to make any strides in preventing it.

Drama seems to follow you everywhere. The more you fight it, the more dramatic you will end up being.
Don't try too hard to get even — things will even out on their own.
Don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild once in a while.
You have too much to think about and not enough to do. The quicker you change this, the better off you'll be.
Just because everyone claims it's the best doesn't make it the best. Decide what's best for you.
You strive to know it all, but sometimes it's best to just relax and think about what you already know.
By focusing on one failure, you are ignoring all the successes in your life.
Don't let your guard down — people who seem to be telling the truth are often the biggest liars.
You think you're out of luck, but you're just out of willpower, which can be easily replenished.
If you expect to find obstacles, then you will. But perhaps they are not obstacles at all.
Slow down and try to make sense of all the dizzying events in your life.
A great weight is about to be lifted from your shoulders.
