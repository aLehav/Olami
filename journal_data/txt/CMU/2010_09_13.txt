The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team is off to a flying start as it begins the season with a solid 5–0 record. The Tartans are now No. 4 in the nation according to the NSCAA/[ITAL]HendrickCars.com[ITAL] Division III rankings, the highest in the school’s history.
The Tartans began their season at home against the Washington and Jefferson College Presidents with a comfortable 3–0 win. However, it was not until the second half that the Tartans got rolling, with the first goal coming in the 62nd minute from junior forward Kyle Young. Shortly afterward, they were able to gain a comfortable margin, with goals coming from the first-year duo of Scott Gerfen and Max Tassano. Sophomore keeper Zach Stahl recorded his first shutout of the season, but also incurred a minor injury that forced him to miss the next game.
The Tartans’ next test was the Radisson Invitational, a two-day, four-team annual tournament hosted by Carnegie Mellon. On the first day, the Tartans played against Mount Union in what turned out to be a back-and-forth battle that was decided on senior Max Betzig’s penalty kick late in the second half. The next day, Carnegie Mellon went on to an easy 5–0 shutout against St. Vincent College, with first-year winger Joey Paladino tallying his first two goals of the season.
After another comfortable 3–0 win against the Gators of Allegheny College, the Tartans faced the resilient Westminster University. The Tartans were down a goal at halftime faced the resilient Westminster University. The Tartans were down a goal at halftime, but, thanks to another penalty kick goal by Betzig, they were able to level early in the second half. 
Ninety minutes wasn’t enough time to settle the match, so the game headed into overtime. The Tartans were fortunate for a second time that game when Westminster allowed a goal off a Carnegie Mellon corner kick in the 94th minute. The Tartans went on to win the match 2–1, recording their first away-game win of the year.
Carnegie Mellon now faces a five-away-game streak before the team returns to home play, including a two-game tournament hosted by head coach Arron Lujan’s alma mater, Colorado College.
“It’s a nice opportunity for us to have, challenging ourselves against teams from out West that we usually don’t get to play. We also don’t usually travel that far, so the boys are all looking forward to this experience,” said junior midfielder and starter Carmen Minella.
Junior forward Brad Edelman and first-year Joey Paladino currently lead the team with three goals, and Stahl has already recorded two shutouts this season. The Tartans’ next game is this Friday at Colorado College.

With the start of the fall sports season, the women’s soccer team is primed and ready for competition. With a 2–2–0 record, the Tartans hope to improve with a new head coach, a strong group of returning players, and fresh talent.
The Tartans opened their season with a loss against the Allegheny College Gators on Sept. 1 in a tight 1–0 game, the first of a tough three-game road stretch. The Gators and Tartans struggled to score in the first half, making only a combined three shots on goal throughout the entire period. Late in the period, the Gators scored. Although the Tartans tried to rebound, they were unable to come up with the goals to win the game. Senior keeper Anya Rosen made five saves and junior Elsa Wu had three shots.
In their next game, the Tartans faced No. 25 Denison University on the road and lost 2–0. Wu had two early shots, and the Big Red scored halfway through the first period. The Big Red also managed to score in the second half to preserve the lead.
In their latest road game, the Tartans took on the Kenyon College Lords in an overtime contest. The first half was scoreless. In the second, sophomore Katie Davis scored on a header that came from sophomore Mitra Ebrahimi’s free kick. The score was tied off a penalty kick made by the Lords’ Kelly Schorling, sending the game into overtime. The Tartans didn’t waste time, as junior Nicole Bayley scored 21 seconds into overtime to win the game.
“Scoring within 21 seconds overtime against Kenyon was a testament of their mentality as a team,” head coach Yon Struble said. “They did not want to settle for a tie, and it was a team effort — a win as 11 players.”
On Saturday, the Tartans played their first home game against the Earlham College Quakers in the Radisson Invitational, where they won in a 1–0 shutout. First-year forward Alex Venegas scored in the 14th minute of the first half off a corner kick, which proved to be the game winner. Venegas finished with seven shots on goal. Eight other Tartans had shots on goal, as the Tartans cruised to their second straight victory.
Venegas is optimistic about the season. “We are on an upward trend: We went from losing our first couple games to winning, and now we have a shutout and now we just want to score more goals. We are coming together very well, meshing well," she said. "Our team chemistry is great; we love each other and we really care about each other so much. I’m just really excited for the rest of the season because it’s still early and we’re doing so well already, so I’m excited to see what else is in store with us.”
The Tartans finished up the invitational with a win against No. 22 Wittenburg 1–0 yesterday, and will play again on Saturday, when they travel to Oberlin College to take on the Yeomen at 1 p.m.

It’s only two weeks into football season, and the Carnegie Mellon football team already has two games under its belt. On the first Saturday of September, the Tartans fought to a 28–21 win over Grove City College, but dropped a 34–27 decision to Allegheny College last weekend. Currently, the Cardinal and Gray stand at 1–1.
The Tartans nabbed their first win away at Grove City College. The Wolverines tried to move the ball down, but several errors put the ball back into Carnegie Mellon’s possession. With only 6:12 left on the clock, sophomore Jake Nardone completed a 54-yard play to give the Tartans a 7–0 lead. The Wolverines responded shortly after, with a 32-yard rush to even the score at 7–7.
An interception by sophomore Owen Parker gave sophomore Patrick Blanks the opportunity to score a 5-yard touchdown, giving the Tartans the lead again with only 20 seconds on the timer.
Carnegie Mellon entered the second quarter with a 14–7 lead, and a strong defense kept the Wolverines at bay until 7:54 in the third quarter, when Grove City’s Clayton Hall managed a 39-yard touchdown past Tartan defenses. With a new furor, the Tartans answered back just a minute later, when Rob Kalkstein passed to Chris Garcia, who scored a 29-yard touchdown to give the Tartans a 20–14 advantage. Elli Carnevale completed a field goal for the extra point.
To add to the team’s momentum, Nick Karabin forced a Wolverine fumble seconds after kickoff, which was recovered by Dan Miller at the 30-yard line. With the ball back in Carnegie Mellon’s possession, Justin Pratt sealed a 1-yard rush to widen the gap to 28–14. The Wolverines managed just one more touchdown before the Tartans received their first victory of the season.
The Tartans did not have the same luck against Allegheny and suffered a 34–27 defeat.The Tartans started off strong, with Carnevale making a field goal to set the score at 3–0 just minutes into the game. But two scoreless possessions and smart passing by the Gators led to a 28-yard touchdown for Allegheny with nine seconds left on the clock. With the Tartans trailing 7–3, Pratt once again took matters into his hands and completed a 4-yard touchdown in the beginning of the second quarter. Yet the Tartans were not able to hold off the Gators’ relentless offense and found themselves trailing once again at the start of the second half, 10–7.
A field goal by Carnevale put the score at 13–13, and a sack by Kalkstein moved the ball up the field to the 47-yard line. With 2:14 left in the third quarter, Kalkstein completed a pass to Garcia, who rushed a 3-yard touchdown. Yet their small victory was short-lived; the Gators completed a 46-yard pass, and a 3-yard touchdown by the Gators’ David Strawser set the score at 20–20.
Gator offense soon shot past Tartan defenses, and the Tartans found themselves down 34–20. A 12-yard pass to Tim Kikta closed the gap for the Tartans to 34–27, but they could not equalize before time ran out.
The Tartans gear up this Saturday for the first home game of the season in Gesling Stadium, with the kickoff set for noon.

On Jan. 14, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt received a letter from the commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. In it, Landis asked the president's opinion on the continuation of Major League Baseball games in light of America’s entry into World War II. The following day, Roosevelt replied in what has become known as the Green Light Letter.
“I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going,” Roosevelt said in the letter. “There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before. Baseball provides a recreation which does not last over two hours or two hours and a half, and which can be got for very little cost.”
“Here is another way of looking at it,” Roosevelt concluded. “If 300 teams use 5,000 or 6,000 players, these players are a definite recreational asset to at least 20,000,000 of the fellow citizens — and that in my judgment is thoroughly worthwhile.”
President Roosevelt could not have spoken truer words, and almost 60 years later, Americans once again agreed that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going.
On Sept. 11, 2001, I was sitting in my eighth-grade humanities class on 107th Street and Columbus Avenue. Out of the blue, one of my classmates’ parents came to pick him up. Nobody thought anything of it, but five more of my classmates were picked up shortly after, and murmurs began to float around as we walked to Latin class wondering was going on. Our teacher didn’t waste time informing us that earlier that, morning, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center. At first, I couldn't comprehend what the big deal was. A little plane had crashed into the Empire State Building a few years prior and had hardly caused any damage. It wasn’t until I got home (after not being picked up from school early) and saw the footage of the Twin Towers collapsing into rubble that I understood the magnitude of the attack on our city. I was thankful that I hadn’t lost any family or friends in the attacks that day; my father lost two co-workers, and a few friends of mine had lost parents or other relatives.
Time seemed to stand still as New Yorkers woke up sad, worried, and, more than anything, confused on Sept. 12. School and work were, for the most part, canceled, but even as students reveled in our day off, there was still an air of “Are we supposed to be enjoying this?” The only thing we knew for sure was that the smog from downtown was horrible, and that was it. The Yankees were supposed to host the Chicago White Sox in the Bronx Sept. 11–13. The Mets had just flown to Pittsburgh on the 10th for a series that was supposed to begin on the 11th. But all professional sports, like everything else, were canceled.
As the days of the ensuing week went by, things slowly began to return to normalcy. People went back to work, school was back in session, and details surrounding the attacks on our country were becoming seemingly clearer. On Sept. 17, baseball resumed, and the Mets swept Pittsburgh while the Yankees took two out of three in Chicago. Then, on Sept. 21, magic happened.
The Mets brought baseball back to New York that Friday, and although it’d been only 10 days since the attacks, it felt like years since any professional sporting event was played in our city. The enthusiasm was undeniable and the celebration was extravagant. Diana Ross sang “The Star-Spangled Banner”and Liza Minnelli sang "New York, New York” during the seventh-inning stretch, and the Mets wore FDNY and NYPD caps instead of their usual baseball caps to pay tribute to New York's finest. Many teared up during the national anthem and again during “God Bless America,” but through it all, spirits were somewhat lifted as they watched baseball function normally, whether or not the world surrounding it followed suit.
Then came the eighth inning. The Atlanta Braves were beating the hometown Mets 2–1 in the bottom of the inning when Mike Piazza came to bat with a man on. Piazza took one mighty swing and the whole city watched as the ball flew — and flew — high over the fence and into New York history. He had given them the lead; New York had come back.
If you watch closely on the replay of Piazza’s home run, you can see a pair of firefighters sitting in the Pepsi Picnic Area at Shea Stadium as the ball flies past them. Those firefighters, whose world had undoubtedly been a wreck for the past 10 days, had just as big a smile on their face as anyone in the ballpark that night. They, too, believed that New York would come back. As Mike Piazza circled the bases, we knew we would rebound from this mess we were put in. We were New Yorkers.
That was what FDR was talking about. People needed a distraction, a reprieve from the sad reality of living in an uncertain world, and baseball was more than happy to help our town heal.

Last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon cross country team had their second meet of the season, competing in the Waynesburg College Invitational. The men’s team competed in an 8k, placing first out of 10 teams, while the women raced a 6k, placing second out of 12.
It is clear from the Waynesburg Invitational that the Tartan cross country team lineup is loaded with strong competitors. On the men’s side, the top six finishers from Carnegie Mellon earned a spot in the top 10 in the race overall. Senior Dan Addis led the team by finishing first in the 8k, with a time of 25:50.1, but teammate senior Nate Bussiere was only a hair behind, taking second place just 0.2 seconds later. The next finisher from the Tartans was senior J.P. Allera, who grabbed sixth place with a time of 26:35.5, followed closely by senior Justin Kurp who earned seventh in 26:38.0. Additionally, eighth and ninth place were taken by Carnegie Mellon’s junior Matt Jacob and first-year Ken Murphy. With so many strong runners finishing within just a few seconds of one another, the men’s team has pushed themselves to the next level with their exceptional teamwork.
As for the Lady Tartans, the invitational was a success. Although the women do not have the depth that the men’s team does, they make up for it with outstanding individual performances. Most distinctly, sophomore Emily Wobb won the 6k with a solid 22-second lead, with a time of 22:46.8. Wobb consistently placed high at every cross country meet as a first-year last year. Senior Courtney Baker also made great strides, finishing fifth overall with a time of 24:04.0. Finally, junior Cassie Wallace rounded out the top 10 in 24:32.6. What this women’s team lacks in size, it makes up for in talent. From the success of the Waynesburg invitational, we hope to see great things from both cross country teams this year.
Look out for the Tartans as they compete here in Pittsburgh on Saturday, Sept. 25. They will be running at Cooper’s Lake Camp Ground in the Mideast Pre-Regional meet.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team hosted the annual Carnegie Mellon Invitational this past weekend, playing against women from Division II Slippery Rock University and Division I Robert Morris University. Overall, it was a successful day for the Tartans, as they notched 12 wins in singles and went undefeated in seven doubles matches.
Returning junior and first singles player Laura Chen went 2–0 in singles, beating Caroline Texeira from Robert Morris and Sarah Lynch from Slippery Rock by the scores of 8–1 and 8–6, respectively. “I knew it was important to get this year off to a good start,” Chen said about her play. “If I want to have as much success as I did last year, I’m going to need to focus in every match, and this was a great start for me.” Others who went undefeated in singles play were new first-years Madison Rabson and Sonya Subramaniam, along with junior Cze-Ja Tam. 
Also scoring singles wins on the day were seniors Ashley Herrick, Jennifer Chui, and Danielle Rosenfeld, along with junior and second singles player Courtney Chin.
Doubles play went even better for the Tartans, as they did not lose a match throughout the tournament. The big winners for the day were the tandem of Herrick and Rabson and the combination of Chin and Chen. Both these teams look to continue their success throughout the year, as they are slated to be the top two teams on the Carnegie Mellon squad.
Carnegie Mellon continues the tennis season the weekend of Sept. 25, when the team travels to the University of Mary Washington in Virginia to compete in the annual ITA tournament.

Coming into this weekend, the Tartan volleyball team sat at 2–3 after a disappointing performance at the Haverford College tournament. The women opened up their season with a win at Marietta College, but then dropped matches to Stevens Institute of Technology, Frostburg State University, and Haverford College. In the midst of their three losses at the Haverford tournament, they defeated Neumann College. 
This Friday, the Tartans lost another match to Penn State Behrend, but they turned things around quickly on Saturday by defeating Grove City College and D’Youville College, evening out their record at 4–4.
“We played a lot better as a team.... We started to mesh and definitely began to show our true potential,” junior Maddie Rosnick said about the weekend’s matches.
The season has been highlighted so far by strong, consistent play from upperclassmen and impressive performances from a couple of first-years. Seniors Cameron Griffin, Aislinn McCloskey, and Caroline Size have been setting the tone for the Tartans, while juniors Kristin Castellano and Rosnick have been following their lead and playing well. McCloskey is averaging a team-high 2.89 kills per match, and she recorded a whopping 20 kills in the Tartans’ win against Neumann. Size and Rosnick have also been solid at the net, as they are tied for the team lead in blocks. Griffin and Castellano have been forces defensively, averaging 4.05 and 2.23 digs per match, respectively.
Even with sound performances from the upperclassmen, a few of the first-years have been able to assert themselves for the volleyball team. Among those who stand out are Emily Wright and Rachel Miller. Wright is averaging a team-high 7.06 assists per match and also contributing 2.06 digs per match. For her performances, Wright was named the University Athletic Association Athlete of the Week for the first week of the season. Miller has also been solid, averaging 1.94 kills and 2.78 digs per match. While these two first-years lead the pack of underclassmen, the Tartans have also witnessed good play from sophomore Kasey LaMothe and first-years Senna Parsa and Kerry Hennessy.
The volleyball team plays its first home matches of the season in the Carnegie Mellon Crossover Tournament this weekend. Their opponents will be Trine University, John Carroll University, Allegheny College, and Johns Hopkins University. After getting back to .500, the Tartans are looking forward to success for the rest of the season.
“We are a young team, but we are coming together and we have a lot of potential to grow and challenge the big competitors in our league,” Castellano said.

For sophomore Katie Davis, soccer has always been a part of her life. The civil and environmental engineering major and center midfielder for the women’s varsity soccer team hails from Glen Gardner, N.J., and has been playing soccer since she was eight years old. Two weeks ago, Davis helped the Tartans secure their first win against Kenyon College with an impressive header for a goal. Davis is just one of the young and talented people leading the women’s soccer team; just last weekend against Earlham, Davis assisted first-year teammate Alex Venegas in scoring the winning goal.
Davis chose to attend Carnegie Mellon because of the ideal balance between school and athletics. One of the influencing factors was a recruiting trip during her senior year of high school, where she really clicked with the team and felt she could fit in. “My favorite thing about Carnegie Mellon is the soccer team,” Davis stated. “I’m with them all the time and they’re a big part of my college experience.” Davis also attributes her success in school and clubs to soccer; she feels there is no time to procrastinate during the season, and soccer is a stress reliever from class.
When not on the soccer field, Davis devotes time to the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity. One aspect of Carnegie Mellon that surprised her was how well-rounded many of her peers are, and she enjoys being surrounded by people who “excel at multiple things.” As for the future, Davis is still figuring things out, but she is thinking about joining the Peace Corps.
Davis describes herself as a very optimistic and positive person. When asked if she could be anyone for a day, she said would be Ellen DeGeneres because she gets to sing and dance on television. She also has high aspirations for the team. “We have a new coach, new field, new attitude, and some great new talent,” she said. “We definitely have potential, and hopefully we’ll be making the NCAAs for the first time in Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer history.”
Whether in soccer or school, Davis’ positive attitude and focus will surely help her find success.

When I heard about the Tartan Rewards program, the first idea that popped into my head was to question whether or not the program was “fair.” At a place as diverse as Carnegie Mellon, it seems the school is constantly trying to push people toward mainly sporting events, and I’m not so sure it’s ever going to stick. But throughout the year, Tartan Rewards popped up at other campus events, such as Bhangra in the ’Burgh. This gave the program more of a sense of increasing school spirit overall, not just through sporting events.
Ask someone to describe the typical Carnegie Mellon student, and he or she will usually settle on “passionate.” While knowing that they are surrounded by people who are just as intense about their work gives many students a warm, fuzzy feeling, it also cleverly hides the fact that it is hard to find unifying common interests around campus. Even sports sometimes fail to bring students together.
While sports are popular among certain pockets of the community, excitement surrounding an upcoming sports season isn’t something that’s campus-wide. To solve this problem, the Tartan Rewards program was launched last school year in an effort to increase attendance and enthusiasm for sporting events. The Tartan Rewards program is an initiative that was started by Rotimi Abimbola and Adam Klein, last year’s student body president and vice president, respectively. Tartan Rewards selects several games throughout the season, with a focus on the biggest and most important, and offers special prizes and incentives for people to attend. However, for the program to be successful, it needs to create excitement about a variety of campus events while  increasing school pride in the long run.
Now, as the program continues into the new school year, a new question of “fairness” was brought to my attention when reviewing the tentative fall schedule. It includes five football games, two men’s and two women’s soccer games, and one volleyball tournament. I was surprised to see cross country absent from the list. (Men’s tennis and golf are as well; however, these teams do not have home events in the fall.) Josh Centor, the assistant director of athletics and an advisor to the program, explained the rationale behind this decision. “The intent was, to best we could, boost enthusiasm and attendance at sporting events across the board,” he said. Scheduling presented a hurdle as cross country only has one home meet at the Schenley Park Oval, a location not familiar to many students.
I was skeptical about the Tartan Rewards program at first, but it seems to be having some success. “There was a direct correlation to an increase in student attendance at the events promoted by the Tartan Rewards Program,” said Susan Bassett, director of athletics. Soccer player Leila Bouabdellaoui, a sophomore civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy major, agreed. “It advertises for the games and gives people a reason to come out. Whether they’re excited or not, it gives people a chance to socialize,” she said.
In order for the program to grow, it needs to be focused on advertising the incentives and spreading them across a variety of events. I don’t think there is any reason for the program to center on football games, and I hope that all matches are considered equally. The directors of the program should also consider building a better relationship between sports and the community. There are plenty of sporting events this season and throughout the year that are not Rewards events. If Carnegie Mellon is really striving to create school spirit, it should monitor attendance at all games. In the long run, I would hope to see increased attendance, whether students were bribed with free stuff or not. 
Overall, though, Carnegie Mellon students could use a push to get out of their typical niches, and the Tartan Rewards program is a good start at doing just that.

As the TOC and BOC conferences wrap up, many students may be left with unmet expectations. 
Whether looking for an internship or a full-time job, if the TOC and BOC do not deliver the results hoped for, students still have a wide variety of options available to them.
Explore TartanTrak
While the TOC and BOC conferences offer an excellent opportunity to meet with potential employers in person, students have a much larger pool of employers available to them all year round. 
The TOC has just over 200 registered companies and the BOC has just under 40, but TartanTrak offers over 11,000 company profiles. 
These 11,000 companies currently offer around 1,300 open positions for which Carnegie Mellon students can apply via TartanTrak.
“The TOC and BOC are wonderful opportunities for students to network with employers and to secure that first interview. But it is not the only way,” said Farouk Dey, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center. 
“There are many employers who are out there who choose not to come to the conference for one reason or another but are still very interested in Carnegie Mellon students. The first place I would always send students to is TartanTrak,” Dey said.
“I want to encourage every student, whether they get an interview or not, to go on TartanTrak and look up these employers.” Students can visit TartanTrak to submit résumés, sign up for interviews, and find contact information for thousands of recruiters. Students can register for their TartanTrak login information at www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/career/students_alumni/tartantrak.html.
Expand professional networks
According to Dey, the majority of university students across the country find their jobs through previously established connections.
“Networking is really the No. 1 way people get jobs,” Dey said. 
“Occasionally these connections can be neighbors or family friends, but most of the time these are professional connections that students have developed through joining clubs, organizations, or committees.”
Dey said that students must first be aware of the networks they have available to them and then leverage these connections. 
Many students may wonder how exactly to begin taking advantage of their connections. According to Dey, it is often just a matter of getting the word out.
“The first place to start is to let people know that you’re looking — let your parents know, let your friends know, let your roommate know. Inform people that you are approaching graduation and are beginning to look for a full-time position,” Dey said. 
“Just the fact that you’re letting them know and asking them to keep you in mind if they hear about an opportunity increases your chances of being in the right place at the right time.”
Take advantage of online networking
One networking opportunity that most students do not realize they already have available is the networks they have created online. The Internet, along with tools such as Facebook and LinkedIn, give students the option to reach hundreds, if not thousands of their friends and acquaintances with one push of a button.
“One of the tools I often recommend is LinkedIn. It is fantastic because it not only allows you to document all the people in your professional network who you know, but it also allows you to tap into a larger network through those people.”
As an example, Dey opened his own LinkedIn profile to show the power of the site. “This is my LinkedIn page and I use it very much. You can see I have 331 connections — these are people that I know personally through my career or some are also friends or acquaintances. Through these 331 connections I am then connected to 3,316,810 people,” Dey said.
Dey explained the power of such online networking services by giving a hypothetical example. “If I am interested in working for Intel, I can type Intel into the LinkedIn search. The first people that show up in my list are the people who are connected to me but also have a strong connection to Intel. They may know someone else who works there, or have worked there themselves. The great part about this is I now know who to contact to begin my search. It is a powerful way to look for connections.” 
Be persistent
For those students who may leave the conferences feeling let down, a combination of examining TartanTrak, contacting professional networks, and expanding their online presence may be the key to finding the job they desire. Accoridng to Dey, if the TOC or BOC does not pan out as students may have hoped, for many, persistence will pay off. Dey believes that it is important to not give up.
“Even the employers who you may have met at the BOC/TOC who maybe did not offer you an interview at the conference — it is okay to return to them and ask them to reconsider or if they have any other opportunities,” said Dey. “It really is a matter of engaging your professional associations, networking both online and in person, getting involved, and I would finish by telling students to not lose hope. Be persistent.”

Hundreds of fellow Tartans will be working the upcoming fair looking to stand out from the crowd and land a job. Kevin Collins, career consultant for the School of Computer Science and assistant director of the Career Center, shared his thoughts on how students can make the most out of their time at the TOC/BOC.
What to avoid 
The biggest faux pas at a fair is talking about money. Collins stressed that asking about salaries and payment is “the worst thing a student could do.” 
Such questions should be asked further in the applications process, never right up front. Something else to avoid is not knowing anything about the company a recruiter is representing. Not doing one’s homework beforehand puts one at a huge disadvantage and often annoys the recruiter as well.
As the 2010–2011 Carnegie Mellon Career Guide states, recruiters are not there to teach the applicants about what they do; they are there to “pre-screen applicants” and “promote their opportunities” within their company. 
If the students do not have enough knowledge of what the recruiters have to offer, the students appear unprepared or ill-suited for the job. This may cause recruiters to look to more informed students for the position. A fair number of people are guilty of going to different booths just for the free stuff or “the swag,” as Collins put it. Google may have cool pens, but unless you are interested in a position at the company, it is best to avoid wasting not only your time and the recruiter’s time, but also avoid wasting time for those standing in line who are genuinely interested in working for the company.
Understand the recruiter’s job
One of the best ways to interact with a recruiter is to think like one, or rather to understand what their mission at a job fair is. Collins explained that job fairs serve as a way in which companies can get a “quick assessment of candidates” and can build upon the applicant pool for their company. 
Collins also stated that job fairs “serve as a way for students to get on the company’s radar and for recruiters to remember them,” building a connection that aids in the application process. As Collins explained, the students whom recruiters are bound to notice and remember are “those who have a really good sense of what they can offer a company and know what sets them apart from others.” He further elaborated that these students have examples of what they excel at and hone in on such examples when talking to recruiters.
Sell yourself quickly
One way in which students can hone in on what they are good at and make recruiters notice them is by practicing and perfecting the art of a quick pitch, also known as an “elevator” or “30-second commercial” pitch. The Job Fair Success Guide located in the Career Center provides detailed examples and a checklist that can be used to perfect your pitch and get across who you are in the shortest time possible. An online version of the Job Fair Success Guide also exists on the website of the Career Center. 
The guide suggests among other things that an elevator pitch should make connections to the student’s résumé, show familiarity with the company, and also that the pitch should be practiced so it sounds normal and unforced. “It is all about selling yourself and knowing what works best for you,” Collins said.
Consider the market
The last thing to keep in mind is the condition of the job market right now. When asked about the number of students expected to attend the TOC/BOC, Collins stated that he felt more students would be attending the fair this time. As Collins stated, students  “are conscious of the need for experience.” He added that  “all people are being more proactive [about employment] at all job fairs, not just the TOC/BOC.”
Such realities mean that one should not be discouraged if attending the job fair does not result in employment. 
By talking with career counselors like Collins, students can find lots of different opportunities available besides those present at the TOC/BOC.
Other information on how to be successful at job fairs can be found in the Career Center, located in the lower l
evel of the University Center, as well as at www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/career/.

With around 200 companies to choose from and a crowd of equally ambitious students as competitors, making an impression on recruiters at job fairs can be a daunting task. Chris Maloney, a senior manager at Cisco and a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, has been recruiting students from the University for the past five years. Get some tips from Maloney as he provides his insights into what recruiters look for in job applicants.
Maloney believes that Carnegie Mellon students already have an advantage over job applicants from other schools because of the type of education they receive at the university. Along with having a strong technical background, Maloney believes that Carnegie Mellon students are good team players. “One of the other reasons that makes it such a good place for us to recruit is that there is such a heavy emphasis on team projects,” Maloney said. “[At Cisco] we’re looking for people that are going to be able to work in a team environment as opposed to folks that are just able to do things on their own.”
However, in a job fair like the TOC or BOC where all the students come with similar-looking, stellar résumés, the students must show the employer what makes them special. Maloney explained that if the students simply read their résumés to the recruiters, it is not enough.
“What you really have to be able to do is distinguish yourself and explain what makes you different from the other students,” Maloney said. “[You may stand out because of] your extracurricular activities, something innovative that you did as part of one of the projects, a patent that you had gone ahead and filed — those are all things that CMU students have come up and told me over the past five years.”
Along with being able to stand out in a crowd, students have to know which companies they want to work with and why they want to work with them. 
“When I ask students why they are interested in Cisco and they have no idea who Cisco is or what we do … [then the student] really can’t be that interested in working with me,” Maloney said. He  explained that knowing what companies one wants to go to and knowing where the booths of those companies are located beforehand can be extremely advantageous. Maloney said that popular companies like Google and Cisco usually have long lines at the fairs and that even if you wait for a long time, these lines never seem to get shorter.
If students know which companies they want to go talk to beforehand, they may be able to choose the appropriate lines early on.
Maloney also stressed the importance of doing prior research on the company and how it functions. He added that simply reading the latest press release from the company was not sufficient. In many cases, the recruiters may not know what is going on in one branch of the company and may not even know about the press release. 
“Understand the company as a whole … rather than focusing on specific things like press releases,” Maloney said.
Another important factor that students should keep in mind at job fairs is to be respectful. Maloney said that one of the worst things students can do is to keep crowding around the booth while one student is talking to the recruiters. 
He said that most recruiters want to spend individual time with each student. If other students keep pushing their way forward, it shows that the students “don’t really respect [their] fellow students … and that’s going to decrease [their] chances.”
Maloney described some of his most memorable encounters with students who were hired in the previous years. In one such case, a student came up to Maloney and explained why working with Cisco was her dream job. She then went on to describe how the work she was doing in college was relevant to the kind of work Cisco was doing. 
Maloney explained that the student’s knowledge of the company and her enthusiasm were two key factors that helped her get the job.
Although Cisco does look for applicants with basic programming skills, Maloney mentioned that the company has recruited a number of non-traditional applicants as well. In the past, Cisco has recruited students ranging from first-years to graduates, and also students who were not enrolled in traditional technical programs, such as biology majors. Thus, Maloney explained that while technical skills were important, factors such as the enthusiasm and motivation of the applicants were even more important.
“They’ve got to be people that are self-motivated … and really put forth the effort and try to go the extra step to make a difference,” Maloney said.

It turns out that the simple practice of turning out the lights is not saving as much energy as we think. In fact, we think we’re saving about three times more energy than we actually are when it comes to our common energy-saving activities.
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this past July surveyed over 500 participants about how much energy they believed they were saving from performing certain tasks such as turning out the lights, working on a laptop rather than a desktop computer, or switching to energy-efficient appliances. 
Cliff Davidson, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s department of civil and environmental engineering and a co-author in this study, commented on the importance of this kind of study. “If people have a poor understanding of the amounts of energy used by each of their choices, they will not be able to factor in energy use as one of the variables affecting their decision,” he said.
The survey began by asking the participants to state the most effective thing they do to save energy in their lives. The responses were then separated into two overall categories. The first was curtailment, which included actions such as turning off the lights. The second was efficiency practices, which included practices such as using more energy-efficient appliances. Fifty-five percent of the respondents stated that curtailment would be the most effective way of saving energy, while only 11 percent stated that switching to more energy-efficient appliances would do the job. Thirty-four percent of the responses were too ambiguous to be separated into these two categories, and varied from “conserve energy” (15 percent), “recycle” (4 percent), to “sleep more or relax more” (3 percent). One percent of the participants stated that they simply did not know. While more people surveyed believed curtailment was more energy effective, in reality, curtailment activities like turning out the lights save very little energy in comparison to using more efficient products. These results may come as a surprise to many people.
More detailed questions in the survey exposed some inaccuracies in the participants’ energy-saving mindsets. It was found that people could sometimes predict which practices consumed more energy, but usually underestimated the magnitude of the difference. As an example, the participants correctly predicted that desktop computers consume more energy than laptop computers.
However, a discrepacy occured when researchers asked participants how much more effective laptop computers are than desktop computers. On average, people predicted a desktop computer used 1.2 times more energy, when it actually uses about 2.9 times more energy. In addition, they correctly predicted that making a can out of un-recycled aluminum requires more energy than doing so with recycled material, but incorrectly said that making a glass bottle requires less energy than an aluminum can. Actually, it takes 1.4 times more energy to make a glass bottle with un-recycled glass and 20 times more energy when using recycled glass.
There were a few areas in which participants were accurate in predicting energy comparisons, such as how much energy is saved when using compact fluorescent light bulbs. However, participants showed very little knowledge in the comparative energy saved across various activities and practices.
The authors theorized the reason the majority of the participants claimed curtailment was the best way to save energy was because switching to energy-efficient products almost always involved further research and up-front costs. To most people, it would involve less time and effort to flick off a switch than to take the time to buy a new light bulb or appliance.
More interestingly, the participants who claimed to perform more energy-saving practices were less accurate in their perceptions of energy saving. This was possibly due to unrealistic optimism about how effective their energy-saving practices were in comparison to alternative practices.
Because switching to energy-efficient products saves much more energy than common curtailment activities, there is much ongoing discussion as to how these useful energy-saving tips and information can be relayed to the public. Since results of the experiment show that many people do not fully understand how their actions affect the amount of energy saved, it is important to inform the public about energy saving practices.
Davidson suggested that “metering in real-time in residences is a good idea, so people can immediately see how much energy is consumed while they use their computer, set their thermostat to a certain temperature, or do various activities around the house.” Certainly, the transfer of this information to the general public is crucial for making beneficial, long-term energy-saving decisions.

We love the microwave. It’s the hunger-squashing, late-night savior: Just pop in some food, and any appetite will be satisfied. It also saves time and effort, eliminating oven preheat time or any need to adjust gas settings. The microwave is a reflection of today’s busy world: instant gratification.
In any room where food is made, from designer kitchens to a simple dorm room, a microwave can be found. But just how do they work? How can they turn yesterday’s leftovers into today’s dinner with just the touch of a button?
The science behind microwaves comes from its namesake radiation. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, which are waves of energy that propagate through all space. Microwaves are created inside a microwave oven via a device called a magnetron, which creates a flow of electrons inside a vacuum using a magnetic field.
Visible light, which reflects off objects so our eyes can detect it, is also a form of electromagnetic radiation. Ultraviolet light, which causes sunburns, is also electromagnetic waves. However, visible light, ultraviolet light, and other common forms of electromagnetic waves have a higher energy than microwaves. So why doesn’t our food spontaneously cook all of the time?
The answer lies in a specific property of microwave radiation. Microwave ovens usually use waves with a frequency of 2.5 gigahertz, according to an article on www.howstuffworks.com. When the microwaves come into contact with water molecules, fat molecules, and sugars — which are common components of many foods — the energy is absorbed by these molecules. Upon this absorption, the molecules begin to vibrate quickly, creating friction; this friction creates heat. This is the same phenomenon that occurs by rubbing palms together.
Microwaves can cook food more evenly than a conventional oven because the radiation can excite molecules from anywhere within the food, while the heat from conventional ovens must permeate from the outside to the inside of the food. In addition, the food is the only object in the microwave that heats; the rest of the microwave, including the air, remains cool.
Electromagnetic radiation can be dangerous — the Kevlar that protects a patient receiving an X-ray is worn for a reason. However, microwave oven doors are designed to contain the microwaves. As www.howeverythingworks.org explains, the doors are composed of a metal mesh that has holes that are smaller than the wavelength of microwaves. This works effectively as a metal wall between the inside and outside of a microwave oven and is why we can safely see our food cooking.
The United States Food and Drug Administration created a standard for the amount of microwave radiation that can escape from a microwave oven, which is five milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately two inches from the oven surface. This level is below that which is known to harm humans.
Even though microwave radiation seems innocuous, there are some safety hazards associated with them. A well-known phenomenon is the sparking of metals inside a microwave oven. This happens when the metal has some pointed surface, as in the case with forks, aluminum foil, and takeout container handles. The metal will resonate with the microwave radiation, causing a high voltage to build up; since air can conduct electricity, a spark forms. However, this can easily be avoided by removing metal from the food to be microwaved. Other hazards include exploding containers due to the buildup of steam from heating food, which can be prevented by removing lids or creating gaps through which the steam can escape. In addition, cooking nothing in a microwave is harmful to the machinery, as it causes microwaves to accumulate inside the cooking chamber. The magnetron, which is used to produce the microwaves, will eventually absorb the radiation and be destroyed.
When used correctly, microwaves are safe, save time, and can give us the warm food we want when we want it.

Blood flow is undoubtedly crucial for survival, and when it is interrupted in our body’s most vital organ, the brain, this can lead to disastrous results. Blood supplies nutrients and oxygen to the brain, which uses a disproportionally high amount of the body’s energy. According to www.mayoclinic.com, when the flow of blood is interrupted to any part of the brain, it is called a stroke. When cells in the brain do not receive any nutrients, they die, a process that may take only minutes.
Blood flow may be interrupted for two major reasons: Blood vessels may become blocked, or they may burst. When blood vessels are blocked, it is usually because of a blood clot. Clots are caused when fats, cholesterol, and other molecules build up within artery walls, forming plaque and making it more difficult for blood to move through arteries. The buildup of plaque inhibits blood flow and eventually forms a clot.
Blood clots may be formed in the brain, which would cause a thrombotic stroke. They may also be formed elsewhere in the body, travel through the bloodstream, and become stuck in the brain, causing an embolic stroke.
When blood vessels break, it is usually because the walls of the artery have weakened to the point where a rupture can occur. According to MedlinePlus, this weakening of arterial walls may be due to many factors, including genetics, diabetes, heart disease, and age. A stroke that occurs from a broken blood vessel is called a hemorrhagic stroke, and it is usually more severe than those caused by blood clots.
The effects of having a stroke vary greatly depending on the area of the brain affected, and the duration. Since different parts of the brain control different bodily functions, the symptoms of a stroke differ greatly between individuals. Unfortunately, many stroke victims do not realize they are having a stroke, so it is necessary to know some common signs of a stroke. Some symptoms that are more prevalent among stroke patients include severe headaches and slurred speech. Another common sign is a numbness or loss of motor function in only one side of the body or face. Other symptoms include a loss of balance or coordination, any changes in alertness, and difficulty with tasks such as swallowing, talking, writing, or reading.
A physician may order a variety of tests to ascertain whether or not a stroke has occurred. According to WebMD, a common first test is a CT scan, which uses X-rays to determine if there is bleeding in the brain. A subsequent MRI can be used to predict recovery outcomes through damage assessment. Oftentimes, stroke victims recover fully enough to function by themselves at home; according to Google Health, this amounts to half of stroke victims. With medication, symptoms of a stroke may also disappear.
To prevent a stroke, the best people can do is to diligently watch their health. Eating a low-fat diet and keeping alcoholic drinks to a minimum will help prevent strokes. Exercise is also thought to help, and it contributes to a healthier lifestyle in general. Having blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked by a doctor may help predict the occurrence of a stroke; high values for both indicate an elevated risk for stroke. Quitting smoking will also contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Simply by living healthily, the risk for stroke will decrease.

Scientists create new nanostructures
Researchers at Northwestern University have discovered how to create relatively inexpensive nanostructures out of sugar, salt, and Everclear, a 190-proof alcoholic drink. While working out the problems with another experiment, they accidentally created a substance that could turn out to be very useful for the storage of hydrogen in fuel cells and for drug delivery.
Taking a kind of sugar called gamma-cyclodextrin, salt (preferably potassium chloride), and 190-proof alcohol, the team was able to construct a rigid and porous nanostructure called a metal-organic framework. They did this by first dissolving the sugar and salt in water and then evaporating the alcohol into the solution. This process caused colorless cubic crystals to form.
Not only does this discovery provide new research opportunities, but it also has intriguing applications in high-technology foods because it is edible and can store other edible substances inside its pores.

Deforestation rate decreases
The Brazilian Ministry of Environment has released a survey claiming that large-scale deforestation in the Amazon has declined by almost half in the last year. This would imply that deforestation is now one-fifth of what it was at its peak in 2004.
Using low-resolution satellite imagery, Brazil’s remote sensing agency — the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais — determined that the drop in deforestation rate is the largest since records started being kept 20 years ago.
Researchers believe that the reduction could be due to the government refusing to provide loans to people clearing large areas of forest, and due to supermarkets refusing to buy soybeans and meat produced on recently deforested land.
However, one major caveat is that such low-resolution sensing does not detect smaller clearings, which may have grown significantly. Also, as demand and prices for agricultural goods continue to increase, this could lead to greater forest clearing.

NASA employs new hurricane technology
NASA recently carried out its first observation of a hurricane using a Global Hawk drone. As Hurricane Earl moved up the East Coast earlier this month, the drone used a new piece of equipment called HAMSR, which stands for High-Altitude Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit Sounding Radiometer, to record a 3-D view of the temperature, water vapor, and other characteristics of the weakening hurricane.
NASA used measurements from the drone, two other aircrafts, and from astronauts on the International Space Station to track changes in the hurricane. The new instruments used will help scientists understand the rapidly changing nature of hurricanes. NASA will continue flights all month as hurricanes continue to form over the Atlantic Ocean.

If you’re like most students here at Carnegie Mellon, chances are that, during the Student Activities Fair, you signed up for about 50 d-lists. And chances are that, when you returned home, you were shocked to find your inbox flooded with information about info-sessions, meetings, and audition times. It really is the plague of the Carnegie Mellon student — with so many amazing activities and opportunities on campus, how do students manage to participate in everything they’re interested in while maintaining their grades in a stressful academic environment?
While you may want to participate in every activity, the truth of the matter is that you really shouldn’t. Clubs would rather have 10 members who are sincerely committed to their job and responsibility than 50 uninvolved members. The key is finding what you really want to do and committing to it. If you are the type of person who needs to do something different every once in a while, then the best option for you may be to alternate your commitments every semester. This way you can experience everything that you want to while properly showing dedication to your activities. If you’re the type of person who loves leadership positions, maybe committing yourself to one or two activities is the way to go. 
The key is finding your own personal balance. It just may be that you’re the type of person who can overload by 18 units, audition for an a cappella group, play a club sport, and work at the radio station while running for a position in student government. If you find you can maintain your grades with that level of participation, then go for it. Odds are, however, that such a schedule would be a little heavy for you, and that’s fine. Once again, it’s all about finding out just how much time you have to commit to non-academic activities and choosing your commitments based on that evaluation.
If you are able to get an accurate idea of your availability, the next step is choosing your commitments. The Activities Fair, while extremely helpful, can be a bit intimidating at times. Walking through lines of tables with people screaming at you as they throw pencils, pins, and flyers in your face can get a little overwhelming, and you may find yourself signing up for everything. There are a lot of interesting clubs at Carnegie Mellon, and only by trying everything can you figure out which commitments you should stick with. 
Whether you’re into sports, politics, arts, philanthropy, or publications, chances are that Carnegie Mellon has a club for you. While it would be impossible to try out the over 200 student organizations, you can narrow down your interests by genre to find the perfect campus organization for you.
Performance
Some of the most anticipated campus performances are those put on by the various student clubs on campus. From theater and music to comedy, the gifted students at Carnegie Mellon are working hard to make sure that the rest of the student body is entertained throughout the school year. 
Students in Dancer’s Symposium — a club commonly referred to as “DS” — are dancers, musicians, composers, and choreographers. The group practices various cultural styles of dance as well as traditional and modern styles, performing their original student choreography throughout the year at highly anticipated performances. The Ballroom Dance Club is also an extremely popular club on campus. Although they practice an impressive array of dance styles, the club accepts all members (from complete beginners to competitive experts) and even offers dance classes throughout the school year for those looking to improve their steps. Carnegie Mellon’s Bhangra team, Chak De, and the Tanah South Asian Dance Troupe are great teams to join for diverse styles of dancing. Both groups perform at the prestigious Bhangra in the ’Burgh, and can be found dancing in practice rooms and at the UC late-night events throughout the year. 
Carnegie Mellon also has several club options for those interested in vocal performance. With a wide array of a cappella groups including Counterpoint, Deewane, Joyful Noise, The Originals, and Soundbytes, there are options for all types of singers out there. 
Carnegie Mellon’s student-run theatre group Scotch’n’Soda is one of the oldest student theatre organizations in the country and has been known to produce incredible shows. With student directors, producers, actors, instrumentalists, and stage crews, every part of Scotch’n’Soda feels familiar. 
Additionally, student comedy troupes like Off the Top and The Carnegie Mellon University Variety Hour are known to produce hilarious material. If getting laughs is more your thing, consider joining one of these groups. 
Naturally, there are plenty of other performance groups on campus, but if you still aren’t able to find an activity that fits your needs, you may look into starting your own club.
Athletics
If athletics are your thing, Carnegie Mellon has several club sports for you to participate in. From lacrosse and frisbee to skiing and snowboarding, there are clubs for almost every sport you can think of. If you prefer to participate in non-team sports, there are also clubs like the Running Club, which provides students with a group-like atmosphere for exercise.  
Aside from sport teams, however, there are several other genres of clubs that have ties to athletics. The Kiltie Band and the Cheerleading team perform at football games throughout the year. If school pride is your thing, consider joining something like the Carnegie Clan, a club that bases itself around its school pride.
Publications
Aside from The Tartan, students on campus are publishing several other genres of written media. Dossier, Carnegie Mellon’s student art and literary magazine that is affiliated with The Tartan, produces a new issue every semester. The Oakland Review is a student-run literary journal that publishes undergraduate creative writing each year. The Thistle is Carnegie Mellon’s yearbook, and the club works hard to compile photos and memories from throughout the year. 
There are several other publication-based clubs on campus, including the Melon Graphic Novel Club, The Triple Helix, Thought, and The Cut, Carnegie Mellon’s only music magazine. 
Technology and Gaming
Naturally, there are several technology-based clubs here on campus. If you’re into music and audio engineering, you might consider joining WRCT, the student-run radio station, or one of the various branches of the Activities Board. 
Obviously enough, the Robotics Club is quite popular; however, techies can also get involved in cmuTV, Computer Club, or even Astronomy Club.  The Carnegie Mellon technology clubs work hard to make sure that our campus is up-to-date with the latest advantages. As Carnegie Mellon began as technical school, we take pride in living up to our reputation.
Philanthropy
If you’re interested in giving back, there are plenty of events and organizations on campus for you to join. ALLIES, an organization that supports the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered community, also partakes in several LGBT awareness events. If you don’t have plans for your next vacation, consider joining Alternative Break and traveling abroad to do community service. 
There are also several ways to get involved within the Pittsburgh community through campus clubs. Carnegie Cares provides students with various service opportunities around Pittsburgh. Big Brothers/Big Sisters of CMU utilizes the “one adult, one child” philosophy to help mentor Pittsburgh youth. There are also several religious support groups on campus that hold service events. 
Politics, student leadership, and cultural clubs
If you like to have a say in how things are run on campus, consider joining Student Senate, CMU Politics, or Mock Trial. There are also several groups that are election-based, like student government. If you are an avid member of the green revolution, consider joining Sustainable Earth and helping the university maintain its green practices. There are also several multicultural groups on campus to support the always-increasing diversity at Carnegie Mellon. Whatever your race, gender, or religion, chances are there is a support group for you.
The many extracurricular opportunities in our community can be overwhelming at times, but they always keep our campus interesting. There is hardly ever an eventless week on campus, so if you’re trying to figure out which organizations are for you, you should experiment by attending different events and club activities. Student clubs and organizations are like small families; the feeling of belonging that one can get from getting involved is unsurpassable.

We’ve all been there: that giant building right across from Kiva Han, with awkwardly sized steps inside leading upstairs. Architecture majors are especially familiar with this place after attending lectures and countless drawing classes there. As for the rest of us, we’ve probably been dragged out here by our RAs at some point, or have even taken it upon ourselves to make a visit of our own to the Carnegie Museum of Art.
For several weeks, The Associated Artists of Pittsburgh 100th Annual Exhibition, which features the work of a selection of artists from within 150 miles of Pittsburgh, has been tucked away in the Heinz Galleries. This exhibition consists of five spaces, each leading to the next in a seemingly linear fashion. 
Immediately upon entry, visitors can find Anna Patsch’s “Russian Workers.” With a quick glance, it seems as if this piece is nothing more than a rectangular piece of rusty iron hung on the wall, but soon enough, faces begin to appear within the metal. What’s most remarkable isn’t even the skill that one can imagine is required for creating such a piece, but the very idea to take this conventionally ugly material and transform it into art. 
Looking around within the other exhibits, one can find several political statements and works of photography. William D. Wade combines these two ideas in his collection, Portals and Passageways. His prints prove that embracing the very nature or limitations of a process such as photography can actually take the art one step further. By doing this, Wade magnificently portrays light and movement through space and time. 
Ron Nigro’s “Silver on Black” is a piece even more open for interpretation. Most anyone can appreciate the beauty of mystery that exists here, and questions run in the minds of onlookers: What is it? What does it look like? What does it remind me of? Here, visitors begin to discover more and more instances where art is constantly being redefined.
To some, Dirk Vandenberg’s “City without Art” is an exhibit favorite. After taking a series of images all over the city of Pittsburgh, Vandenberg cut puzzle-shaped pieces out of each print. The cutouts were then placed around the perimeter of the piece, portraying the title quite nicely and reminding us that art is the world that surrounds us. It is the sculptures we see, the bridges we cross, the buildings we enter, and even the roads we travel. 
One common theme within the exhibit seems to dominate the space, and that is the use of abstract color. Maura Koehler Keeney’s “For Everything There Is a Season” takes the visitor deep inside nature with a magnified view of plants. The portrayal of light, shadows, color, and detail makes the whole piece simply unreal. 
Nearby, Shelle Barron’s “Search Engine” and Vaughn Clay’s “Confronting Maya” both explore composition, the layering of images, and a highly varied use of both color and media, resulting in two fascinating pieces. 
Even as the exhibition space seems to come to a close, the artwork does not. Daniel Burke’s “Church Mice,” for example, is simply mind-boggling. Although the frame could not have been more than two inches deep, the depth portrayed within the piece is quite effective with the use of color and the overlaying of materials, bringing to life an image that is often unseen. 
Simply said, no visitor will regret making a trip to the museum to check out this exhibition. It gives rise to both questions and discoveries not only about art, but also about oneself.
The Associated Artists of Pittsburgh 100th Annual Exhibition is on display through Sunday in the Heinz Galleries within the Carnegie Museum of Art.

Sara Bareilles — *Kaleidoscope Heart*
Maybe Bareilles wasn’t anticipating fame, but she sure got it when her debut single “Love Song” hit radio stations nationwide back in 2007. Since then, she’s been preparing her sophomore major-label album, the recently released Kaleidoscope Heart. Bareilles is a master of catchy piano pop, but she’s got the ballads down too.
“Kaleidoscope Heart” is a minute-long angelic intro song, and it leaves you waiting for the gospel choir to burst into song. After the heavenly solo, Bareilles sings a familiar sound in “Unchartered,” featuring a commanding piano beat accompanied by playful string plucking in the vein of her previous “Love Song.” Her vocal range undulates throughout, which keeps listeners’ ears perking.
Starting off with old-fashioned circus theme music before a finger-snapping, toe-tapping piano beat comes in, “Gonna Get Over You” definitely gets you interested early on. Her verse deliveries flow so naturally, it’s hard not to go along with her for the ride.
“Hold My Heart” begins with a musically dramatic tone, but the chorus comes through like a sunbeam bursting through the clouds, resonating happiness. Near the end of the song, Bareilles really hits some strong notes and just soars vocally.
“King of Anything” seems to be a perfect pop song. It’s smart, it’s got some sarcasm, and it’s ridiculously catchy. The background instrumentation just grabs you and doesn’t let go for three and a half minutes. “Say You’re Sorry” seems to pull back the reins after the previous electrically charged songs. The song sounds like the soundtrack to a bike ride along the Santa Monica coast: light and sunny while still delivering.
“The Light” is another toned-down ballad, but one that’s not terribly slow. It’s got a recurring drumbeat between portions of just Bareilles’ vocals: “You were the air in my breath, filling up my love-soaked lungs, such a beautiful mess, intertwined and overrun.” In short, it’s a good intermission for the CD. “Basket Case” is a Norah Jones-esque, stripped down, bare-bones song that focuses more on the words than on sound production.
“Let the Rain” is a start-off-slow, pick-up-the-pace song. And then comes the chorus, sounding organic and nature-friendly with quick clapping and Bareilles crooning, “I want to let the rain come down, make a brand new ground.” “Machine Gun” has a charming piano intro with verses that swing to and fro, talking about someone who fights just to fight. The chorus changes pace a bit, and Bareilles belts out some notes that come as welcome surprises.
“Not Alone” is about as jazzy as music can get without a saxophone. The low piano chords slightly echo The Pink Panther with a touch of an espionage thriller. This sensual music isn’t what you’d expect with the lyrics, but it’s a welcome change. “Breathe Again” is another one of Bareilles’ slowly crescendoing ballads, as she cries, “All I have, all I need, he’s the air I would kill to breathe” with vocals that are simply beautiful. And finally, “Bluebird” closes the album and lets listeners down gently.
Listen up: “Unchartered,” “Gonna Get Over You,” “Say You’re Sorry” 
The verdict: If you’re not ready for an entire album, pick one of her songs and you probably won’t regret listening to it. This girl is not a one-trick pony. Listeners are getting a glimpse into every side of Bareilles with this album.
The Goo Goo Dolls — *Something for the Rest of Us*
It’s hard to believe that the Goo Goo Dolls released their first album way back in 1987. They weren’t much of a household name until the 1998 explosion of their song “Iris” brought them into mainstream music. Since then, they’ve obtained a good amount of consistent success. Their previous album came out back in 2005, so it’s been a while since the Dolls have been in the spotlight. But now, they’re back with a new album, Something for the Rest of Us, and it feels like they never even left.
“Sweetest Lie” is a solid song by the Dolls. It’s got great lyrics that flow poetically against the fortuitous guitars. The next song, “As I Am,” has a strong chorus and speaks of how great it is to find your matching puzzle piece. “Home” is the first single from the album, and it’s got the familiar guitar in the background against lead singer Johnny Rzeznik’s matured rhymes. The chorus is nice, as Rzeznik’s voice treats us to a nice vocal range while singing over his own vocals, begging to be taken back to his place of comfort.
“Notbroken” is a true gem, hiding among the many upbeat tracks on the album. What seems to be a ballad at first listen turns into a powerful anthem of love and the desire to hold on to what you haven’t truly lost. “One Night” is an anthem of spontaneity and living life in the moment. In “Nothing is Real,” Rzeznik sings about going back home to find how things have unfortunately changed. Following that, “Now I Hear,” sung by guitarist Robby Takac, talks of retrospection and regret.
The next tune, “Still Your Song,” is solid throughout. The song is a bit softer than the others, as it starts with a piano and makes use of the strings of an orchestra. The title song, “Something for the Rest of Us,” seems it would fit better as a closer with its drawn-out backing vocals and crescendo of guitars. But at the climax of the song, it dies. It goes back to the calm, adrift-at-sea crooning that seems like it’ll keep repeating until a fadeout. “Say You’re Free” is another of the songs sung by Takac, as he lends his rugged smoker’s voice to this track, definitely altering the flow of the album.
“Hey Ya” starts off soft, and you feel like it might be the theme music of a dream in heaven. But when the bridge and chorus greet us, we get to experience the guitars once again and the crescendo of a steady drumbeat. Verse two comes in, and we’re on a quicker tempo. The song starts off with: “If I could give you all the things you’ve been denied, would it change you, would you feel alive?” and continues with more great lyrics throughout. The closer, “Soldier,” doesn’t really sound like a closer, but the Dolls leave us with a powerful song about a strong person.
Listen Up: “Home,” “Notbroken,” “Hey Ya” 
The Verdict: The Goo Goo Dolls have had a great track record, and this album supports that. The songs all sound pretty similar, but they’re great stand-alone tunes if you let them be that.

The historic Byham Theater might seem like a curious venue for Canadian indie rock band Broken Social Scene, whose members admit to being more accustomed to playing in bars and clubs. As lead singer Kevin Drew noted at the group’s concert last Wednesday, “It’s been a long time since we’ve played in a theater.” However, regardless of their unusual type of venue, Broken Social Scene managed to breathe new life into the Byham.
The Wooden Birds, a four-person group from Austin, Texas, opened the concert with some down-tempo, somewhat stereotypical indie tunes composed of guitars, percussion, and the sweet crooning of lead singer Andrew Kenny. The group’s music was pleasant and low-key, and each song flowed easily into the next, leaving the audience feeling mellow and calm by the time the band ended its set. The audience quickly re-energized, however, when Broken Social Scene came onstage.
Broken Social Scene is a musical collective group with anywhere from six to 19 members at any given time. The nine musicians on stage at the Byham Theater on Wednesday started off their set with the energetic number “World Sick” that got the crowd scrambling out of their seats and into the aisles to dance. 
Throughout the set, musicians wandered on and off stage, utilizing a large range of instruments — aside from the standard guitars, drums, vocals, and keyboards, group members also used a saxophone, trumpet, harmonica, flute, and bass clarinet.
The musicians’ meanderings on and off the stage in the middle of musical numbers never detracted from their high-energy, multi-layered “wall of sound,” as lead singer and band founder Drew referred to his band at one point in the performance. The light show accompanying the performance certainly helped keep the energy level high; flashing colored spotlights roved around the stage and walls of the theater. Surprisingly, they didn’t seem out of place in the Byham; rather, the light show brought youthful energy and fresh life into a theater that is over a hundred years old.
The only moment during Broken Social Scene’s set that the audience wasn’t clapping, dancing, or singing along was during their performance of the hauntingly beautiful instrumental number “Guilty Cubicles,” which Drew announced as dedicated to the band’s friends who had died in the past year.
After an almost two-hour set, Broken Social Scene closed off with the powerful instrumental number “Meet Me in the Basement.” When the audience screamed for more, Drew acquiesced and brought out female vocalist Lisa Lobsinger, whose sweet, almost childlike voice and shy demeanor seemed especially appropriate for the dreamy “Anthems For a Seventeen Year Old Girl.” Between the song’s swirling guitar lines and Lobsinger’s breathy, repetitive lyrics, the mood in the theater was transformed from one of high-energy enthusiasm to that of blissful transfixion. 
When the song came to an end and the band members gave their final goodbyes for the evening, the audience members seemed to share a look as though they had just witnessed something transformative and magical. One can only hope that Broken Social Scene will bring that magic back to Pittsburgh sometime soon.

This past Sunday, as the debut performer in Pittsburgh’s brand-new Consol Energy Center, Lady Gaga performed for wild fans in an epic four-act show that brought together Pittsburgh’s most eclectic people to celebrate the “Monster Ball.” Needless to say, the experience was mind-blowing.
By 10 a.m., there were already several people waiting outside of the arena, decked in outrageous Gaga costumes — sparkles, red lace, bikinis, masks, wigs, teddy bears, ripped clothing, and crazy sunglasses. A girl wearing the “Bad Romance” costume — a red lace dress with tan underclothes and a bright chef-like hat — was interviewed three times by the press. A boy clad in a pink Gaga bikini with tights and a blond wig was next to arrive, along with a high-school couple. 
Everyone was dedicated to maintaining their places in line, ready to run into the stadium whenever the doors opened. Snacks were unpacked and the nine-hour waiting session began. It was only during the last few hours of waiting that the excitement grew — hundreds of people began to arrive, crowding the small line, and voices soared through the air in excitement as fights broke out and people rushed to buy Gaga T-shirts.
Finally, the moment that everyone had been waiting for arrived. The doors were opened and fans rushed into the stadium, scaling down the stairs to grab a seta. First on the stage was an exotic group called the Semi-Precious Weapons. Straight out of New York City, the band, like Gaga, gave audience members a spectacular visual performance while performing their high-energy rock tunes.
The crowd went wild when Lady Gaga appeared on stage. The combination of her unique costumes, stunning dance choreography, amazing set designs, crazy lighting features, and psychedelic video backdrops dazed everyone — most importantly, her voice thrilled the crowd as she played her piano and belted out her hit songs, always perfectly on key.
In addition to her amazing performance, the energy of Gaga’s fans was one of the most memorable aspects of the concert. This past year, Lady Gaga has soared to fame because she never failed to be unique, different, and extraordinary. She is also one of the few popular musicians today with the will to voice her opinions — the symbolism used in her concert clearly revealed her views on religion, gay rights, self-esteem, and acceptance. In her hit song “Alejandro,” a statue of Jesus appeared on stage, water pouring from the top of the statue and collecting in a pool on the stage. As the song progressed, the water turned red and the dance choreography became more expressive. The song ended with a kiss between two of the male dancers. During “Paparazzi,” the “fame monster” — a giant angler fish spanning the entire stage — gradually destroyed Lady Gaga. The effects were stunning and the crowd was in awe.

In the midst of demanding classes, increasing commitments from extracurricular activities, and the waning days of summer, everyone is looking for an escape. Granted, with papers starting to pile up and problem sets begging not to be procrastinated on any longer, finding ways to relax without stressing out later can be a daunting task. A short, light read like Alyson Noel’s newest book, Radiance, is both perfect for the end of the summer and promises a fantastic escape without a large investment of time. 
Radiance is the start of Noel’s spin-off series to her well-known Immortals books, which feature protagonist Ever Bloom learning to cope with her family’s death and, later, her new-found immortality. While paranormal romances pervade the young adult market, Noel’s books are unique in that they explore the genre without the aid of vampires, drawing instead from a variety of beliefs and the author’s research into afterlives and phenomena. Radiance chronicles the adventures of Riley Bloom, Ever’s younger sister who died with her parents and her dog in a car accident before the Immortals series began.
Readers shouldn’t expect Riley to wallow in despair about being dead to just accept it automatically; in fact, fed up with not getting to live like a normal teenager, she turns bewildered and intrigued to her new world.  In Radiance, Riley really comes into her own. In previous books, she was a millstone around her sister’s neck as a ghost, at worst an otherworldly annoyance. Now, forced to admit to herself that she’s spent her life trying to live up to and copy her sister, Riley adapts to her new afterlife and starts to be more herself. She accepts the job of being a Soul Catcher, someone who convinces spirits still on earth to move on, and teams up with Bodhi, a skateboarder who had plans to go professional before his death, who is also her mentor. 
As a narrator, Riley’s pluck and occasionally snarky attitude make her enjoyable to read about, though there are some points in the book where this can be overwhelming and unrealistic. For example, when Riley is pitted against the Radiant Boy, the first soul she needs to convince to move on, she states how terrified she is, but the way she describes the encounter carries the same cadence and nonchalance as when she’s describing how she teases Bodhi about his hairstyle. Her voice lacks a sense of urgency when there’s something at stake, needing either a variation in her sentence construction or a few well-placed words to implicitly convey her feeling of fear. 
That being said, fear is really the only emotion for which Riley doesn’t come across as fully believable. She’s independent and doesn’t back down from challenges, and her healthy dose of attitude is enough to propel the story from start to finish. Readers will be pleasantly surprised to see her character’s development, one of Noel’s strongest suits in her writing, and will find themselves looking forward to her further adventures in the next installment of the series, Shimmer.

Sometimes I get tired of the academic routines I fall into during each semester, and I know I am not alone in my thinking. I daydream about where I could be if my schedule wasn’t filled with classes and meetings. Between problem sets, I glance at one-way tickets to various exotic destinations in all corners of the world. Occasionally, I find a way to incorporate this traveling agenda into my life without derailing my college education. I spent my junior year studying in London. I took weekend trips to various cities in Europe, but when Monday morning arrived, I found myself back in a classroom.
However, the UK higher education system has one significant difference from our hometown colleges. Generally, UK universities have a four-week spring break. Once I heard about that, I swore to take that time as a chance to break away from everything I knew about life. I wanted to embark on an adventure and experience a world most people couldn’t imagine. After throwing around a few ideas with my friend Holly, we decided we would hitchhike 1,100 miles from London to Africa — specifically Morocco.
I remember the thoughts racing through my mind as I turned in my last assignment the day before I left. As I walked back from campus, I entered my own world. My decision suddenly felt enormous and immediate. I didn’t know where I would wake up each following morning. I had no way to hear the news in the world. I was living in my own bubble. I spent that last night sleeplessly packing two pairs of clothes, a sleeping bag, and other essentials into a backpack.
As the sun rose high in the sky and the adventure began, we made a fantastic breakfast, knowing it might be our last home-cooked meal for a while. In the spirit of hitchhiking, we also made a large cardboard sign starting our next destination, then hit the road. Our goal was to get to Portsmouth by nightfall. Portsmouth is a town at the southern tip of the UK, where ferries run between France and Britain.
With no reason to delay any longer, we walked to a highway entrance heading south from London, stuck our thumbs out, gave our best I-am-not-an-axe-murderer smiles, and started watching cars pass by. One thing I learned quickly about hitchhiking is that there is a significant amount of waiting between rides. After about two hours, we managed to get our first ride. An interior designer stopped and offered us a ride about halfway to our destination. He told us stories about how he used to hitchhike from the very same spot we were at when he was in his 20s. The ride seemed to fly by, and before we knew it we were saying our farewells. After another ride from a Sri Lankan man heading to work, we made it to Portsmouth, boarded our ferry, and spent the night trying to get a few minutes of rest on a noisy ship.
The next morning we arrived in Le Havre, a port city in northern France. It was a rainy day, and the town looked deserted. By pure coincidence, Holly started speaking with a British woman who then offered us a ride to her house in Poitiers, a town in the middle of France. After six hours of interesting conversation, we parted ways. By the end of the day, we had hitchhiked to Bordeaux, a city in southern France. We toured the city, checked into a hostel, and called it a night.
The third day was just as exciting, despite the fact that our bodies were exhausted. Encountering new people and places kept the adrenaline pumping. Coffee also helped a lot. By nightfall, we had reached a service station outside Pamplona, a city in Spain where they host the running of the bulls each year. Unfortunately, we arrived after the service station had closed and were forced to camp out under a nearby bridge. I remember laughing as we set up our tent, knowing that we were truly living in the moment.
The next morning was the rainiest day of our hitch. For three hours, we tried and failed to get a ride toward Madrid. Eventually, we decided to walk the four kilometers to the next service station. About two kilometers down the highway, we were conveniently escorted off the highway by a Spanish police car. After a broken conversation combining bits of Spanish, French, English, and German, we explained ourselves and were told we could not hitch on that highway. As the police left, the sun came out. We took that as a sign that our luck would turn, and by the end of the night we were partying in Madrid.
After a ride with a famous Spanish musician, an unexpected Easter parade in the beach town of Malaga, and a sketchy ride from a one-eyed man of mystery (we never understood what he did for a living), we reached the docks in Algeciras, caught a ferry, and made our way across the Strait of Gibraltar toward Morocco.
For some people, all of this waiting, driving, and lack of structure must seem like some sort of punishment for an unspeakable crime. However, at no time did our spirits die. We felt more alive on the road than in any other situation. We have more stories from total strangers than most people encounter in many years. I learned more about different cultures than in any history class I ever took. Even as I walk on campus today, in the back of my mind, a voice reminds me that there is no reward greater than pursuing my dreams.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
The TOC is this week, but I have no idea what to do. I can go and hand out my résumé, but what should I do if a company takes interest in me? Do you have any interview tips?
Thanks,
TOC Newbie
Dear Newbie,
Ah, the interview, where recruiters find marketable candidates and  pathetic losers. Which one are you? If you follow my advice, you’ll be able to disguise yourself as an actual candidate. The key is to make yourself stand out. For example, when you first walk into the interview, don’t shake the interviewer’s hand. Everyone shakes hands, and most people don’t do that good a job. Keep your hands firmly in your pockets and totally ignore his or her outstretched hand.
Once the interview starts, don’t talk about yourself. You don’t want to be arrogant, so don’t brag about how good you are at something. Instead, tell them exactly what you’re bad at — for example, working with people, respecting authority, completing assigned work, 
not stealing from the workplace, and personal hygiene.
Finally, be sure to flirt with your interviewer — a lot. Compliment her chest, stare at his crotch, undress him with your eyes. If you’re lucky, you’ll wind up with a job and engage in sexual congress.
Find out how much it pays,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m convinced that I cannot get a girl. However, celebrities get tons of girls. Which celebrity should I act like to maximize my girl-attracting abilities?
Sincerely,
McDreaming
Dear McD,
First, I’m glad you’ve realized that the key to getting girls is not to be yourself. Girls hate that. When looking for a celebrity to imitate, there are many things to keep in mind: his acting range, how bankable he is, his popularity, and, of course, whether or not he’s a huge piece of man-candy.
Personally, my celebrity man-crush is Matt Damon. He can do comedy, drama, action — the whole shebang. He even has an Oscar for Good Will Hunting! So, how to become Matt Damon? First, drop out of college, write an award-winning screenplay, and admit to a long-time love affair with Sarah Silverman. Then become rich, famous, and handsome. After that, the girls will flock to you!
Really, you don’t need to be Matt Damon. Or famous, or even handsome — just be rich. I guess you should stay in college then. You won’t get any girls now, but in 20 years you’ll be beating them off with a stick!
Gold diggers need love too,
Patrick Hoskins

Waking Sleeping Beauty
Thursday, Sept. 16
8 10 12
TThis documentary film covers the ups and downs of Disney’s animation department between 1980 and 1995. Beginning with the release of The Fox and the Hound and culminating with the release of The Lion King, this movie showcases the art of modern animation as it begins its life within the Disney corporation and the effects that Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and other executives had on the developing medium. Oddly enough, this documentary uses no new on-air footage, instead relying on vintage footage shot by personnel, sometimes illegally, to construct the narrative being told in this one-of-a-kind flick.
Iron Man 2
Friday, Sept. 17
7:30 10 12:30
Iron Man 2 was a huge financial success, grossing over $600 million worldwide, although it wasn’t as much of a hit with the critics as its predecessor. No matter, though, as the film features nearly all of our favorite characters from the first movie, including the fantastic Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who must deal with multiple antagonists, as well as his own shortcomings as an individual. Mickey Rourke stars as the primary villain, the vengeful Ivan Vanko, who has copied Stark’s techniques to develop a suit of his own. And for all you geeks out there, yes, there is even more foreshadowing toward the upcoming Avengers film in this sequel.
The Cambridge Footlights
Saturday, Sept. 18
8 10:30
What? No movie tonight due to a Scotch’n’Soda presentation of the Cambridge Footlights? That makes me want to scream bloody murder... Wait, the Cambridge Footlights? The world-famous British comedy troupe that has a distinguished list of alumni including John Cleese, Hugh Laurie, and Sacha Baron Cohen? Why didn’t you say so! Yes, the British will indeed invade Carnegie Mellon, or at least McConomy, to put on a show for the ages with some of the best British comedians in the business. This visit is part of their acclaimed international tour and will surely be a delight for all who attend.
12 Monkeys
Sunday, Sept. 19
7:30 10 12:30
This 1995 science fiction flick stars Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt living in a grim future that has been devastated by a deadly disease. To try to avoid the apocalypse, a group of scientists sends Willis back in time to collect information on the disease and a secret organization known only as the Army of the 12 Monkeys. As he is transported several times between the past and the present, it becomes unclear what is real and what isn’t for Willis, all while the plot thickens over who is truly responsible for releasing the disease. Fun fact: Because Willis wanted to work with director Terry Gilliam so much, he took a much lower salary than he was entitled to.

For you polytheistic hermaphroditic dancing queens, I have an album that will have you glued to your seat and catapulting through the celestial realms within the glimmering embers of your memories: The Empyrean by John Frusciante. (Yes, the guitarist for the Chili Peppers.)
The empyrean is that realm that you touch when consciously entering a state of calm bliss, when you glide and realize infinitely scattered shimmering centrality inherent in the universe. In terms of history, the Empyrean was used as a name for the firmament — and in Christian literature, notably the Divine Comedy, for the dwelling-place of God — the blessed, celestial beings so divine they are made of pure light, as the source of light and creation.
This album is about swelling and bursting — the painful birth of a cosmos and its awareness. Replete with Frusciante’s vocals, mind-bending guitar solos, string arrangements, whispering atmospherics, empassioned funk rhythm, and spot-on organs, this album is a gushing testament to the beauty of passion and contemplation. On this record, Frusciante’s lyrics vault about and are oftentimes abstractedly cryptic, but given his previous work, it’s clear that this album has been in Frusciante’s bloodstream for a while — he is working within his standard cosmology. Love, God, time, the self, determinism, loneliness, pain, obsession, creation: They’re all here.
If you’re interested in big names, the record features an array of collaborators and guest musicians, including Frusciante’s former bandmate Flea and friends Josh Klinghoffer and Johnny Marr, the former Smiths guitarist. There you have it. This is a big deal. For a rip-roaring good time, put on the song “Central.” It’s two-thirds of the way through the album and is at the heart-wrenching apex of this album.
Hugs and kisses,
Juan Fernandez

For those with an interest in public policy or government, the Washington Semester Program at Carnegie Mellon provides a chance to study for a semester in Washington, D.C. through American University, and, more recently, Georgetown University. With tracks as diverse as Law and Society, Peace and Conflict Resolution, and Global Economics and Business, the program offers many opportunities for personal and professional development. 
Depending upon a student’s particular interest, one can study through American University, Georgetown University, or the Capital Semester Fund for American Studies. The program a student chooses would be based on his or her preferred track and/or financial concerns. In particular, Georgetown offers four tracks; American University offers 10 tracks, including American Politics; and the Fund for American Studies offers Public Policy and Political Journalism. There is a consortium tuition agreement with American University so that students will continue to pay Carnegie Mellon tuition. A similar plan is tentatively being arranged with Georgetown University for the spring semester. Students with strong academic records can also apply for Friedman Fellowships through Carnegie Mellon. 
Unique to this program is the fact that every student also has an internship. “I think the internship is really the driving force in the program, in that it gives students a chance to have professional experience, to develop those skills ... and to make professional contacts,” said Amanda Kennard, a staff member for  the International Relations and Policy  (IRP) program. 
There are numerous internship opportunities in D.C., ranging from the White House, to non-governmental organizations, to consulting and advocacy firms. Nancy Brown, a junior ethics, history, and public policy major, is pursuing public policy through the Fund for American Studies. Her internship is with the National Academy for Social Insurance, a nonprofit organization that works with policymakers, lawmakers, and others to provide information to the public. 
“One of the things I wanted to do was have an internship and take classes at the same time.... The Washington Semester Program really made that possible,” Brown said.
Nicole Rappin, a senior BHA student, is pursuing International Peace and Conflict Resolution through the American University program, which has an international component in Eastern Europe as well. Her internship is with the International Fund for Agricultural Development, an agency of the United Nations. During her internship, Rappin said she would “attend different meetings and events throughout D.C. on topics related to international development” and then “report back to IFAD headquarters in Rome.” 
It is suggested that students check with their advisors when they know that they have an interest in this program. Once admitted to the program, students will have to verify classes with their advisors. 
Any questions or concerns can be directed to the International Relations and Politics (IRP) program. Students in any major and any school are able to apply, and applications should be given to the IRP program by Sept. 23. Currently, there are four students participating in the program, and eight students have participated from spring 2009 through spring 2010. At the time of the semester in D.C., students must be in the second semester of their sophomore year, the first semester of their senior year, or anywhere in between. Currently, applications are open to first-semester sophomores through second-semester juniors. 
“It has been a transformative opportunity for the students who go to Washington. They come back with more of an intuitive understanding of politics, and thus they add a quality to class discussions that would otherwise be absent,” said Kiron Skinner, an associate professor of social and decision sciences and director of the IRP program.

While many first-year students’ schedules contain the typical 8:30 a.m. classes and introductory level courses, members of the Class of 2014+ have schedules that boast of something unique this year to Carnegie Mellon. Whereas many upperclassmen likely recall attending Computing at Carnegie Mellon (C@CM) courses twice per week, this year, students enrolled in C@CM are no longer required to attend a C@CM class. Instead, the university-wide required course is now offered in a hybrid form online through the Open Learning Initiative (OLI). While C@CM grading scores were traditionally based on homework assignments, three in-class exams, and one group project, the new version of the course has only one graded element: the final exam, which will be administered and proctored by teaching assistants in the clusters.
In past years, student attendance in C@CM classes was mandatory. This meant that students from various backgrounds of computing experience received the same in-class instruction, regardless of whether they needed it or not. Computing at Carnegie Mellon Program Manager April Rupp expects the new course format to enable students to work independently at their own pace. In situations where students do desire additional help with the OLI course material, they can seek help during the daily support sessions led by teaching assistants in the C@CM cluster, located in Baker Hall 140D. Academic Development has partnered with the course teaching assistants to provide C@CM peer tutoring resources for the first time.
“We can now use the face-to-face time to tailor our instruction for students’ specific needs and address the high variability in students’ background knowledge, current skills and future goals. We’re no longer constrained by the 50-minute classroom session.” Rupp said.
The C@CM course curriculum has been approved by an advisory committee comprised of academic and administrative leaders. According to Rupp, this committee gathers input from faculty representing every major department in the university to ensure that “C@CM provides instruction on the requisite skills students need in order to be successful in their academic coursework.”
According to Rupp, several factors led to the recent restructuring. “One of the initial motivating factors that led us to a hybrid course model was our overuse of computer cluster resources. With more and more faculty members looking to integrate technology into their teaching, the demand for clusters has increased. C@CM has been one of the biggest consumers of the clusters for years. At the time of the H1N1 outbreak on campus last year, it became even more evident that we needed a model that relied less on face-to-face instruction,” Rupp said.
Michelle Lin and Youngeun Kim are both Carnegie Mellon seniors who have been teaching C@CM for three years. Kim, a materials science and biomedical engineering double major, commented on the change. “Some of my students like it. They like that they can pace themselves. A few students would rather take the course in a traditional environment,” she said. Lin, an electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering double major, said, “I do miss going into class and giving lectures.... That was one of the reasons I took the job. As for the changes, I feel that they are catered to the students’ needs and less to the instructors’ needs. Most of the support we now provide is online — which is convenient, but now we have been receiving a lot of frequent e-mails from students who have questions.”
Regarding her usual discourse with students, Kim shared her thoughts. “It depends on the questions they ask whether I respond with e-mail or instead decide to meet students in person during recitation…. I think it’s now better for the student in the sense that they can get feedback right away when they need our help. They get to save time, too. Rather than going into lecture and waiting for someone else to ask a question, it’s up to the student to figure out what he or she knows and needs more help with,” she said.
Both Lin and Kim agreed that teaching C@CM remotely this semester has changed their experiences as teaching assistants. “Personally, I like giving lectures and enjoyed the personal interaction that I had with students. This year it’s become less personal. I’m just here to help them get through the online course, but overall I do think that this new structure will help the students,” Kim said.
While enrolling in and completing C@CM is required for all Carnegie Mellon undergraduates, there is now an open version of the new OLI curriculum available to all students, faculty, and staff. This version may be accessed by visiting oli.web.cmu.edu and entering the course key: ccmf10open.

Newcomers to Pittsburgh may be curious to know where they can find the steel mills that the city has long been known for. Until recently, there was little left of Pittsburgh’s claim to fame. Thanks to a new project undertaken by the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area, however, visitors and Pittsburgh natives alike can now see a remnant of Pittsburgh’s glory days.
Rivers of Steel has entered into a lease agreement with Allegheny County over an area of land in Rankin, Pa. The property has a long history in iron-making and was at one time owned by Andrew Carnegie’s Carnegie Steel Corporation. In 1901 Carnegie gave $2 million to found the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which later became Carnegie Mellon University. His philanthropic effort began in earnest with the sale of his holdings in the Carnegie Steel Corporation to J.P. Morgan earlier that year. Buying out Carnegie and other steel manufacturers, Morgan created U.S. Steel, the world’s first billion-dollar corporation.
One of the properties Carnegie sold to Morgan was in Rankin, Pa., the site of Carrie Furnaces. Carnegie had bought the furnaces in 1897 to help feed his Homestead Works with purified iron. Of the furnaces on the Rankin site, only two remain today: Carrie No. 6 and No. 7.
The remaining two furnaces, built by U.S. Steel in 1907, showcase an era before computer control. All valves are operated by hand, and all levers are manual. 
Materials science professor Chris Pistorius explained the details of blast furnace operation in his course on processing design. 
“Iron ore, coke, and limestone are fed into the top of the furnace, while air at 1000°C is forced in near the bottom,” he said. “Inside, the coke burns continuously, 24 hours a day, and ultimately strips the oxygen out of the iron ore. The furnace is tapped periodically to extract the iron in molten form, purified to about 95 percent.” Before they closed, Carrie No. 6 and No. 7 each produced around 300 tons of iron every four hours.
The heat and gases make blast furnaces very dangerous environments, and very few people are allowed near them while they are operational. However, visiting Carrie has been made possible by the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area, which is offering tours on Sept. 18 and Oct. 9. 
Jim Kapusta, who worked the Carrie furnaces from 1964 to 1982, will be in the cast house describing his experience. 
“When you were on the cinder crew, you knew you didn’t need to worry about a stuffy nose — the sulfur in the air was so powerful it just cleared you out! But if you were tapping iron, that smelled sweet to me,” Kapusta said.
Furnaces No. 6 and No. 7 were idled in 1978, and the entire site had been abandoned since the mid-’80s, until the furnaces were named a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Recently, Rivers of Steel held a media day to bring attention to the tours and remediation plans for the area.
Similar redevelopment occurred in the South Side and Homestead in the past, creating the South Side Works and Waterfront shopping areas. While some evidence of steelmaking was left on those sites, it is not in the same raw form as Carrie.

Toy Story Midway Mania! is an interactive, carnival-style attraction that is the latest ride to open at Disney’s theme parks in California and Florida, and it has rapidly become one of the parks’ most popular rides this summer. Pittsburgh-based Schell Games has taken advantage of its popularity by developing a plug-and-play home version of the ride. The video game’s release last month, coinciding with the release of the 3-D summer film Toy Story 3, was met with positive reviews.
In the theme park version, riders rack up points using a spring-action shooter that points virtual projectiles — such as paintballs — at targets. The “4-D” effect gives players a new experience: Unsuspecting riders are hit with a puff of air, sprays of water, and even the splat of a paintball during the course of the ride. Schell’s home version does not offer the same 4-D experience, but promises a greater variety of targets to shoot in order to prepare players for the park version. According to Schell Games’ website (www.schellgames.com), the game puts players into a midway where they get to meet Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the Toy Story franchise’s crew.
Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center’s (ETC) own Jesse Schell is the CEO of the company that has become Pittsburgh’s largest video-game studio. Schell, who is author of the book The Art of Game Design, has taught game design and led research projects at ETC since 2002. Among his many distinctions, Schell was named one of the world’s Top 100 Young Innovators by MIT’s Technology Review magazine. Prior to his work at Carnegie Mellon, Schell worked as the creative director of Disney’s Virtual Reality Studio.
“The future is games that go absolutely everywhere — your phone, TV, computer,” Schell said in an interview with Pop City Media last week. “You will begin to see [gaming] elements show up in board games, creeping into things you buy in the store. People are looking for ways to gamify everything.”
“One of the biggest surprises in gaming last year was Facebook,” Schell added. “There are more Farmville players out there than Twitter accounts. The big change we’ve seen is we now have a big number of smaller projects: Facebook games, Web-based games, lots of projects that connect games to the real world in an interesting way. We are very busy indeed,” he said.
“I like the 4-D rides at Disney, so I am kind of interested in seeing what the game is like,” said sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Prakhar Dubey. “They are always a lot of fun and people who have a fear of heights can enjoy them too, but I can’t imagine this game being as good as the ride without the 4-D feel. I hope they were able to do something interesting with the game since it is based on a theme park ride.”
Schell Games’ next project is a Mummy Online game, based on the Universal Pictures film The Mummy.
“We’re excited to have the opportunity to work with the Mummy film franchise,” said Schell, according to the company’s website. “The action-packed story of Egyptian mythology and 1930s fortune hunters provides a great backdrop for our team to build an awesome online game experience.”

[BOLD]New biomaterials for drug delivery[BOLD]
Christopher Bettinger, an assistant professor in the materials science and engineering department, is currently working to develop new biomaterials for biomedical applications.
The focus of his research involves strategies for using organic thin-film transistors to enhance biomedical applications. “We are working with biodegradable polymers because they are non-toxic and capable of a controlled rate of degradation,” Bettinger said. “In the case of drug delivery, we find that the polymer slowly degrades into smaller fragments, releasing a natural product in a controlled environment.”
One of the challenges that Bettinger’s team faces is the rate at which water seeps into the polymers. “We’ve found that the environment surrounding the polymer is different depending on the location in the body,” he said.
The team has discovered that testing electronic devices in aqueous environments creates these challenges but also yields numerous opportunities. “We found that by combining small-molecular semiconductors and biodegradable polymers, it allows for potential electronic functionality in biodegradable medical implants that has previously been unattainable,” Bettinger said.
Bettinger received his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering, a master’s degree in biomedical engineering, and a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering, all from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
[BOLD]Carnegie Mellon staff, students named Fulbright Scholars[BOLD]
Carnegie Mellon staff member Stephanie Wallach and recent graduates Nathan Hall, James Harrell, and Megan Larcom have been named Fulbright Scholars by the Fulbright Foundation.
Wallach, assistant vice provost for undergraduate education and director of the Fellowships and Scholarships Office and the Undergraduate Research Office, has been selected to participate in the International Education Administrators Program. The program runs Oct. 16–30 in Germany.
“The seminar will provide me a chance to learn about the country’s higher education system,” Wallach said in a recent university press release. “This is important for opening up opportunities for Carnegie Mellon students in undergraduate research, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math. Germany also offers a wide variety of summer and postgraduate fellowships and funds a large number of Fulbright scholarships.”
Carnegie Mellon alumni Hall of Pittsburgh; Harrell of Freedom, Pa.; and Larcom of Middletown, R.I. were also named Fulbright Scholars. Hall will travel to Iceland, Harrell to Hungary, and Larcom to Egypt during the 2010–11 academic year through the U.S. Student Program.

Remembering Networks
Thursday, Sept. 16, 4:30 p.m.
Porter Hall 100 (Gregg Hall)
Alan Liu, professor and chair of the Department of English at the University of California Santa Barbara, will give a talk titled "Remembering Networks: Agrippa, RoSE and Network Archeology." The lecture looks at the 1992 collaborative art book Agrippa*and its associated "vanishing" poem, distributed on a diskette that was programmed to erase itself. The poem, however, was leaked and went viral on the computer networks of the day. Basing his talk on *Agrippa and on the work of his own Transliteracies Project, Liu speculates on how a "network archaeology" might be possible.

In response to protests from state attorneys general, Craigslist has shut down its Adult Services section — at least temporarily — replacing it with just a black bar that reads “Censored.” While there may be a cause for concern that some of the ads posted in this section seem to be bordering on prostitution, we at The Tartan believe that this blatant censorship is a direct violation of the American value of freedom of speech.
Without strong proof about the true intentions of these advertisements, it is unfair for attorneys general and human rights organizations to lobby for the regulation of this forum — and a blow to the freedom of the Internet for Craigslist to comply with these terms. Though the so-called “Craigslist murderer” abused the site for nefarious ends, this does not mean it should be censored. The law is clear that Craigslist is not responsible for content posted by its users. Prostitution existed long before Craigslist began, and it will, unfortunately, exist long after the site is gone. Pretending that censoring Craigslist will stop sex crimes is pure fantasy.
Moreover, banning the content from being published in the Adult Services section will only allow it to disappear from public view — nothing else. It will still appear hidden in other sections of Craigslist and on other less accessible places on the Internet. Prostitution, human trafficking, and the rape and murder cases associated with them, will continue. Removing one of their possible forums will not stamp out the illegal activities automatically. By protesting against the adult section, attorneys general are only erasing an easy-to-find directory of these activities — tantamount to just sweeping them under the rug.

Last week, an appeals court in California decided that law enforcement agencies are now legally allowed to place GPS trackers on people’s vehicles without their consent. While I am certainly not an expert on constitutional law, there is something slightly disturbing about this verdict.
The case concerned Juan Pineda-Moreno of Oregon, who was being monitored by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as he was suspected of being part of a larger marijuana-growing operation. In an attempt to gain more information about his whereabouts and build a stronger case, DEA agents snuck onto Pineda-Moreno’s property and stuck a tracking device on the underside of his car. Over a four-month period, the DEA used the tracking device to keep track of Pineda-Moreno’s movements. All of this work was done without the possession of any warrants. Eventually, with the use of evidence gathered from the GPS tracking devices, Pineda-Moreno was arrested on drug-related charges and indicted.
Pineda-Moreno appealed the decision, but a federal court ruled that the DEA did not violate any laws. Court documents showed that covert DEA agents had entered Pineda-Moreno’s driveway and placed the GPS device on his car. Since there were no “No Trespassing” or “No Entry” signs on Pineda-Moreno’s property, the DEA had not, according to the court, violated his Fourth Amendment rights. But while this might be deemed legal, it is simply not in the spirit of the law.
The case certainly proved that Pineda-Moreno was in violation of drug-related laws, but there is no way that the DEA knew this for sure before they started monitoring him. The reason search warrants exist is so that law enforcement agencies have to prove to a judge that there is probable cause for suspecting an individual. Soon, the cops or some other agency from the alphabet soup that exists in Washington, D.C. could place a GPS — or in some cases even a camera — in your car because they wrongly suspect you for some crime. They could then maintain this surveillance and monitor you for months — and there would be no way for you to know.
What is ridiculous about this whole affair is the idea that the lack of warning signs somehow reduced the expectancy of privacy. While it is clear that the DEA faces a tough task and is entitled to use every loophole in the law to its advantage, the fact that it is violating what I believe is the basic right to avoid unreasonable search should not be condoned. Tomorrow, law enforcement could simply place trackers on everyone’s car, and that would certainly make it easier to solve crimes. But in a country that prides itself on freedom, such a cheap act is reprehensible to say the least.
In the larger picture, the DEA’s actions reflect more than ever the increasing encroachment of government into our private lives, under the guise of public safety. As one dissenting judge in the case put it, “1984 may have come a bit later than predicted, but it’s here at last.” He was right to say this because this judgment not only violates our human rights, but also places more power in the hands of the rich. In analyzing the court’s decision, one of the major reasons Juan Pineda-Moreno’s property was accessible to DEA agents was because he did not have a fence. Now, imagine a well-off suburban neighborhood where all of the houses have gates and fences. In this scenario, no one would be able to enter private property and attach tracking devices to personal-use vehicles.
So, if you are rich enough to afford a fence around your property and put up signs forbidding individuals from trespassing on it, you would be free from unethical surveillance. The fact that law enforcement agents are able to take advantage of such a situation, encroach upon your rights, and perform what I believe is an illegal operation is extremely disappointing. Often, agencies have validated their actions by pointing to pressing issues such as national security, but in this case violations of the rights of an American citizen were completely unwarranted.
I hope that the federal courts carefully consider Pineda-Moreno’s appeal and reverse this abhorrent verdict. While our safety is important, it should never be achieved at the cost of our freedom.

Most of the time, when The Tartan reports on matters involving Greek life at Carnegie Mellon, it is to cover controversial or monumental events on campus. Whether it’s the spray painting of chickens by pledges, a look into the successes of a Panhellenic charity event, or simply the results of the annual Greek Sing event, unbiased objectivity is key in the creation of these articles. There are, however, certain article topics which the paper often avoids, and sorority and fraternity recruitment has more or less always been considered one of these topics.
From a critical point of view, there is much to be said about Greek recruitment. Most students involved in Greek life would argue that the experience is a positive one, but it’s hard to tell the difference between honesty and partiality. There is, notably, a large population of students that openly combats the Greek recruitment process and is not afraid to voice its opinions. While it has been said that many new students find the undying positive energy of those donning “Go Greek!” T-shirts to be a tad insincere, how are those who see Greek life in a positive light supposed to make a candid argument for themselves? The greater problem boils down to finding an honest and unaffiliated review of the Greek recruitment process.
As a first-year looking into Greek life during the first couple of weeks of the school year, I found myself in this exact position. While the easiest solution may have been to seek the advice of upperclassmen who had been through Formal Membership Recruitment (FMR) or rush week and were unaffiliated with the recruitment process, I hadn’t exactly made any upperclass best friends, let alone met any individuals with such specific experiences. The other women around me also considering Greek Life were just as clueless as I was. I found that because the Greek recruitment process happened so early in the school year, my opinion of all matters Greek was largely determined by the few guiding voices around me. To make things even more complicated, those peers — mainly my resident assistant and Orientation counselors — had been directed to keep their affiliations and opinions a secret. Overall, when it came to considering going Greek, I felt largely alone in the process.
It is necessary to state that this is not a fault of our Greek community, but more or less a fault of the system itself. If we are completely honest with ourselves, it’s impossible to imagine a system where this is avoidable.
There are two paths for individuals who find themselves in similar positions that I would like to suggest. Firstly, you can just jump right into it. While it’s true that you run the risk of hating and regretting the experience with every fiber in your body, you lose little except for a small application fee. Sure, there is a chance that you might become Greek and then decide later in your career here at Carnegie Mellon that it wasn’t the right decision, but this is fairly common and easy to fix. The other solution, which I found to be the best option, is simply to wait. Your first year is not your only chance to go Greek. Fraternities recruit at the beginning of every semester and sororities recruit at the beginning of every school year. If you are unsure whether or not to go Greek, simply waiting to get a better feel for what Greek organizations on campus are really like may be the best solution.
I am not Greek, and this article is certainly not an attempt to recruit the Tartan readership into Greek organizations. I am merely a person whose opinions of Greek life on campus were changed. When I arrived on campus as a first-year, my understanding of Greek organizations was based largely on my sister’s experiences in her sorority at the University of New Hampshire. Honestly, after hearing the stories of her recruitment process and four-year experience, I wasn’t sure that going Greek was anything close to what I wanted from my college experience. However, it’s true what they say — Greek life at Carnegie Mellon truly is a different experience.
I am so glad that I took the time to think through my decision and get a clearer opinion of what it means to be Greek. Greeks are leaders on campus and in philanthropy, and I found through my experience as a first-year that going Greek might just be the thing for me. Now in the first semester of my sophomore year, I have chosen to register for Greek recruitment. While it is true that you may join a fraternity or sorority as a first-year and know right off the bat that Greek life is for you, that is not the right choice for everyone. It’s important throughout the Greek recruitment process to know that you’re not alone, and if you do choose to take the time to get better acquainted with Greek life, you may find that your decision is that much more assured.

The absurdity of this past week was matched only by its sad irony. While Muslims celebrated Eid ul-Fitr, the end of Ramadan; Jews celebrated Rosh Hashanah, the new year; and America remembered and mourned the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, it seemed the biggest story this week was Terry Jones and whether or not he would burn a Qur’an.
It seems hard to believe that a hateful pastor from a small church in Gainesvile, Fla. could have caused the chaos that he did. But Sept. 11 has come and gone, and no Qur’ans were burned at the Dove World Outreach Center. A week from now, the media will have moved on. Yet it seems likely that Terry Jones will remain. The media and world leaders have granted him legitimacy, and he may join the ranks of Joe “the Plumber” Wurzelbacher and James Crowley (of Obama beer summit fame), catapulted to his two weeks of fame thanks to the remarks of those in power.
Jones was far from the only one advocating burning Qur’ans in the past week. Destruction of this holy book actually took place. Protesters ripped pages out in Lafayette Park across from the White House and some members Westboro Baptist Church actually burned Qur’ans. We are appalled by these offensive acts, but we also accept that fundamentalism will never be fully erased. Media coverage and official statements only lend these groups legitimacy. Fortunately, these acts received only a small amount of media attention.
It is hard to say whether the Qur’an-burning-that-wasn’t was a publicity stunt, an act of hatred, or a horrible delusion. Likely it is a combination of all three. Whatever the case, we condemn it, just as we condemn all such acts of bigotry, intolerance, and violence. While we do not dispute the right of these extremists to burn whatever books they want, that does not mean it is appropriate. The pastor burning a Qur’an and the warlord burning an American flag represent the same ugly side of human nature.

Imagine a world where all your credit cards; local, state, and national IDs; library cards; and customer advantage cards are obsolete. Fraud is impossible; crimes are solved within minutes. Utopia, one might think. Utopia, as long as privacy and anonymity lose their value. Utopia, except for those who dissent from the established order. Utopia, as long as the powers that be remain benevolent. Freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.
Welcome to the future of Leon, the sixth-largest city in Mexico. In collaboration with Global Rainmakers Inc., a U.S. biometrics firm, Leon is implementing a city-wide system of iris scanners. These devices will be able to track individuals throughout the city — in public transit, in retail stores, in corporate offices. Advocates claim the scanners will help law enforcement and make life easier for citizens. And yet this argument, as it so often does, fails to correctly balance the advantages of security with the costs to privacy.
While the introduction of a comprehensive iris scanning system in a large U.S. city would attract tremendous media attention, the system in Leon has gone nearly unnoticed in the mainstream media. FastCompany magazine has had the most in-depth coverage, and of the major news outlets, only USA Today has featured the iris scanning technology. Even with this limited coverage, however, the intentions of Global Rainmakers seem ominous. FastCompany quoted Jeff Carter, CDO of Global Rainmakers, as saying that “every person, place, and thing on this planet will be connected [to the iris system] within the next 10 years.”
The entire iris scanning system is, at least for now, opt-in for everybody except criminals. In theory, individuals could choose to keep their antiquated identification cards. But even though authorities may not be forcing people to register their iris patterns, Carter’s theory of an opt-in system involves little choice. As quoted in FastCompany, Carter believes that “when you get masses of people opting in, opting out does not help. Opting out actually puts more of a flag on you than just being part of the system. We believe everyone will opt in.”
It seems likely that the iris scanner system will be implemented in Leon without much opposition. And, if the experiment in Mexico goes well for the government, American cities may be next. With closed-circuit cameras in London, warrantless wiretapping, and airport security scanners, iris scanners hardly seem like a large step. But pervasive tracking is a danger to freedom and to privacy. It gives authorities the power to crush dissent before it can gain strength. The system may disrupt fraud, but it will also disrupt liberty.

For many students, the decision to come to Carnegie Mellon University was based not only on the hope of getting a great education but also on graduating and getting a great job. We have spent the last year organizing the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) to make sure that is the case. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, 230 booths will be filled with company recruiters from across the country. All Carnegie Mellon students and alumni are welcome to attend.
This year, the TOC is being held exclusively in Wiegand Gym and is two days long. While the two-day event may spread out job-hunting stress to a second day, it gives students more time to meet with company recruiters. An overwhelming one-day event is avoided, and more companies can attend. 
What you may not know about the TOC is that it is organized by a group of students from the Society of Women Engineers. Even before the current TOC begins, work is already underway for next year’s event. The TOC committee works all year to make each year’s TOC better than the last. As students, we understand the priorities of attendees and work to make the event serve you.  
Both of us have been involved with the TOC since our freshman year. We’ve learned a little more each year, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the event. Student and recruiter feedback is a great resource for us. So if there is something you want us to know or think should be different, speak out. The campus population is very diverse, and the more opinions we hear, the better able we are to create an event to serve it.
Finding a job is a stressful experience. Carnegie Mellon recognizes this and has a variety of resources to help make the process easier. We encourage you to check out the TOC website at (http://www.cmu.edu/toc "www.cmu.edu/toc") to see the calendar of events. You can also visit the Career and Professional Development Center website at www.cmu.edu/career/events.
So whether you need to find a full-time position, an internship, or just want to see what the TOC is all about, there is something for you at the 2010 Technical Opportunities Conference.

Students who spend time in the Gates Hillman Complex may remember the controversy last year over evening and weekend access to the building’s upper floors. After an initial period of access following the complex’s construction, undergraduate computer science majors discovered last October that their ID cards no longer opened the electronic locks on Gates Hillman’s sixth through ninth floors after hours. In the trade-off of greater freedom and use of the building’s many inviting work spaces versus greater security for graduate student and faculty territory (and their coveted coffee machines), the School of Computer Science had quietly sided with the latter.
This month, however, SCS seemed to change its mind. A Sept. 2 e-mail from Assistant Dean Mark Stehlik announced to undergraduate computer science students that their IDs now allow them 24-hour access to all of the Gates Hillman Complex “on a trial basis to see how things go.” Ultimately, this is the right decision. Although SCS graduate students may complain about the pesky populace filling their corridors and lounges, a building as prominent as Gates Hillman should not be reserved for the enjoyment of a few — especially since the building’s design makes little distinction between private offices and public working spaces. Further, it only makes sense to allow undergrads free access to their professors and TAs, many of whom work behind the previously locked doors. If all Gates Hillman users act reasonably in their resource consumption and cleanliness, the trial period will be a success.
We are, however, annoyed by the further lapse in communication surrounding the change in policy. Last year, undergraduates were not notified when they were suddenly locked out. This year, graduate students had no warning that their offices and hallways were no longer quite as secure as they had been. No matter which way the access policy is written, ignoring half of its stakeholders is certainly not the best way to promote understanding and acceptance. In what is becoming the mantra of this young school year, we again have to remind those making decisions at the university to — please — let us know.

Hewlett-Packard, the poster child for the era of garage startups that morphed into billion-dollar tech giants, has offered up their ex-CEO Mark Hurd as the star of this month’s Silicon Valley soap opera. Hurd resigned at the beginning of August after a harassment claim made by actress Jodie Fisher. And while HP’s continual turnover of upper management through scandal and intrigue — Hurd’s predecessor, Carly Fiorina, is now running for the U.S. Senate — shows no signs of stopping, Hurd’s story is just beginning.
Hurd is close friends with not just B-movie actresses but also his all-powerful buddy Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle. And while HP is in the spotlight, Oracle is hiding in the shadows. And Ellison is not going to quietly let his tennis buddy resign with a $12 million severance.
No — in an e-mail to The New York Times just days after Hurd’s resignation, Ellison made clear his feelings about Hurd’s removal, comparing it to the firing of Steve Jobs from Apple in the mid-1980s. And we all sat around saying, “Silly Larry Ellison, e-mailing The New York Times isn’t going to change anything.”
But what would? Ellison’s decision to hire Hurd as co-president of Oracle (dumping Charles Phillips, who has hardly made the news). Yes; why just write e-mails to the media complaining about others’ bad decisions when you can just hire your ousted friends to run your own billion-dollar company?
And while HP might have been willing to dump Hurd to (attempt to) save face in the wake of the sexual-harassment-claim-that-wasn’t, it turns out they don’t really like the idea of Hurd going to work for a competitor, and have thus decided to take the truly American route and sue him — not based on the non-compete clause that didn’t exist in his contract, but for the obvious necessity that he would relinquish vital trade secrets in his new role at Oracle. And while, yes, he does likely know something about HP after four years as CEO, California law will make this a tough suit to win.
But will Hurd make a difference as Oracle co-president? Who will HP find to fill his moderately sized shoes? What funny thing will Larry Ellison say next? Stay tuned for what continues to be the height of tech drama.
