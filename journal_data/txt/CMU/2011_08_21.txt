During my time in Pittsburgh, there have always been just two sports: football and hockey. As you know, there is no NBA team that resides in Pittsburgh, but one other team is always forgotten. That would be the Pittsburgh Pirates. Whenever I ask a die-hard Pittsburgh fan about the Pirates, 90 percent of the time the person says back, “Who watches baseball anyways?” Considering baseball has a larger fan base than hockey in America, one has to wonder why every Pittsburgher responds like that. And of course, it is because their beloved Pirates, also known as the “Buccos,” have not won a World Series since 1979 and have not had a winning season since 1992. However, up until last week, the Buccos were vying for a spot in the playoffs with their NL Central rivals and giving some hope to Pittsburgh’s baseball fan base.
So, with a winning record for almost four months of the season, can we officially say that the Pirates can be contenders in the next year? I respond with an enthusiastic no. When you take a look at the Pirates’ success this season, it is easy to see that pitching has played a key role, as the team is ranked 10th in all of the MLB in ERA. One of the Pirates’ best performers all year has been starting pitcher Charlie Morton, who currently has nine wins and a 3.56 ERA.
However, with the rise of sabermetrics as the dominant way of analyzing statistics in baseball, wins and ERA are no longer the only way to judge a pitcher’s true performance. First of all, Morton has no history of being a decent pitcher, let alone a good one. His ERA last year was in the high 7s, he had a walks-plus-hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio of 1.73, and he gave up a whopping 15 home runs in only 17 starts. In the two years before that, he accumulated a 5+ ERA and was clearly a mediocre pitcher. One thing that Pirates fans often overlook is that Morton is still the same mediocre pitcher this year. In fact, his peripherals suggest that he should be around the same level as his 2009 season, where he was a fourth starter at best. In 2009 and this year, he has around a 1.50 strikeouts-to-walks ratio, hitters are hitting .277 against him, and in fact his strikeouts per nine innings ratio is down by 0.2 compared to 2008. The reason why he has a respectable ERA right now is purely luck, as hitters are hitting fewer home runs but the same number of fly balls against him. Not to mention that he only has a 20 percent Quality Start rating in his past 10 starts.
Another reason why the Pirates will not be any good for at least the next two years is their hitting. They arguably have a bottom-five lineup in the league, and until recently they had first baseman Lyle Overbay, who was signed in the off-season to a stupid contract, hitting in the heart of the order. With a few trades from general manager Neal Huntington, the Pirates were able to get some respectable hitters, but no one that is going to change the face of this franchise any time soon. 
When we look at the offense, we cannot overlook Andrew McCutchen, who is one of the budding stars in the game today. I fully expect McCutchen to become a top-five outfielder in two or three years, and some can even make the argument that he deserves to be considered in the top five right now. 
The problem with the Pirates is that they have no one else in the lineup to hit. Neil Walker, who is considered to be their second-best hitter at this point, should be the sixth-best hitter in a real lineup. Although Walker was fifth in the Rookie of the Year (ROY) voting last year, that is not enough to say that he is actually a top player. Guys like Angel Berroa and Khalil Greene have won ROY awards, and both of those guys are out of a starter’s position — if not the league — by now. Walker ranks ninth in on-base plus slugging among second basemen in the MLB, and second base is widely considered to be one of the weakest hitting positions in the league. The Pirates currently have the ninth-best second baseman as their second-best hitter. It is easy to see how that is a problem. 
Will the Pirates be competitive eventually? I am sure they will. They have one of the top systems in the major leagues and a few players that they hope to have ready by 2012, such as outfielder Jose Tabata and third baseman Pedro Alvarez. However, with their low budget as well as high variance when it comes to the development of prospects, I doubt we will see the Pirates being a playoff team for at least two years. If their minor league staff is able to develop a guy like starting pitcher Jamison Taillon, who was the first overall pick in this year’s amateur draft, they should be able to compete sooner rather than later.
But, based on the history of the Pirates, is there any reason to be optimistic?

With the start of the 2011–12 school year, the student athletes of Carnegie Mellon are gearing up for an exciting fall season. To introduce the varsity teams, here is an in-depth look on what to expect this fall:
After a slightly disappointing 4–6 season last year to end the team’s streak of winning seasons, the Tartan football team enters the new season ranked fourth in the University Athletic Association (UAA).
On the offensive side of the ball, the Tartans have 10 returning starters, six of whom were all-UAA last season. Senior tight end Zach Gallup and senior offensive lineman Ross Lapkowicz hope to lead the squad to greener pastures in the upcoming season.
However, Carnegie Mellon’s leading rusher of the past two seasons, Justin Pratt, has graduated. The duo of junior running backs Jake Nardone and Patrick Blanks will be carrying the offense on the ground.
On the flip side, the defense sees seven starters from last season return. Senior inside linebacker Dan Behmke and junior outside linebacker Nick Karabin, both all-UAA defenders last season, will be the centerpieces of the Tartans’ tough defense.
Junior corner Sam Thompson is returning from injury after missing eight games in the 2010 season.
The team’s season begins on Saturday, Sept. 3 in a non-conference game against Grove City College at Gesling Stadium. Kickoff is at 1 p.m.
The team had a fruitful 2010 season, finishing 11–4–1 last year.
Even on the heels of such a prosperous season, the Tartans began preparation for a competitive 2011 season in the heart of their summer break.
On Aug. 9, the team set out on an international training trip, where players trained and competed against club teams. Over an eight-day period, the men visited Holland, Belgium, and Germany.
The CMU Invitational will mark the opening of the 2011 men’s soccer season on Friday, Sept. 2. The Tartans will face Geneva College in the first round of the invitational.
The women’s soccer team has a new face on the staff. Kara Kabellis was hired during the off-season to be the new assistant coach for the Tartans. She was formerly on the United States’ U-21 National Team, and she has coaching experience at Lewis University.
The team itself is coming off an 8–8 season in 2010. Led by the offense of sophomore forward Alex Venegas and senior midfielder Elsa Wu, the close-knit players are heading into the upcoming season with much enthusiasm.
The women’s soccer team will be looking to improve on its 2–5 record in conference games last season. The team opens its season in the Johns Hopkins Tournament on Saturday, Sept. 3.
Four of last year’s men’s tennis players found themselves on the all-UAA team after last season’s Association Championship. Two doubles pairs dominated the championship.
The senior tandem of Alex Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart were the first pair, going 2–1 in the championship. Junior Jeremy King and sophomore Duke Miller were the other pair, also going 2–1 in their match.
MacTaggart and King have now been all-UAA twice in their college careers.
The 2011 season gets underway on Saturday, Sept. 10, at the Allegheny Invitational.
Last season’s junior duo of Courtney Chin and Laura Chen saw their run end in the national semi-final match.
The women’s tennis season starts on Friday, Sept. 9 at home, where the team will host the Carnegie Mellon University Invitational at the tennis courts next to Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. 
The young Tartans golf team starts its new season at the Guy Kuhn Invitational on Sept. 18 in Meadville, Pa.
The Division III Cleveland Golf/Srixon All-America Scholar winners from last season, juniors Terence Einhorn and Michael Cheng, along with now-sophomore Ian Bangor, will spearhead the young and promising squad.
Bangor posted a 75.3 average last season, leading the team. Cheng followed closely at 79.2.
Friday, Sept. 9 is the Fall CMU Invitational, where the Tartans are hoping to press their advantage on their home course, Longue Vue Country Club.
The College Swim Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) honored the Tartans’ men’s swimming team for its academic success last season.
The team posted a cumulative 3.47 GPA, placing 12th out of the 57 institutions bestowed with the same honor.
The team will be without its leader, Alex Hansen, who graduated. The Tartans now look to dominate the UAA behind junior Dan Glaser-Garbick.
The first meet, an intersquad competition, is Saturday, Oct. 15.
With a cumulative QPA of 3.35, the women’s swim team was also honored last season by the CSCAA. Graduating senior Molly Evans was nominated for the UAA Woman of the Year award this summer after breaking eight school records in her career. But the Tartans will be without her this year, as well as leader Brianne Burton, who also graduated.
Sophomore Soleil Phan will head the 2011 campaign for the women, whose season starts along with the men’s team on Saturday, Oct. 15.
Editor’s note: Courtney Chin is assistant SciTech editor and Jeremy King is a staffwriter for The Tartan.

Students with iPhones have a new tool that will allow them to track the location and crowdedness of Pittsburgh city buses — in real time. The free iPhone application, called Tiramisu (Italian for “pick-me-up”), was developed by a collaborative team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon and the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo. Given the Port Authority’s consistently tight budget and inability to spend millions of dollars on high-tech tracking systems for its users, this application could allow riders to avoid being passed by a full bus and left in the rain (or snow).
The application is free and operates by crowdsourcing. It requires riders to share simple pieces of information about the bus they are currently riding with a main server that distributes the information to other riders. “When a Tiramisu user gets on a bus, he or she is prompted to select the bus route they are on and the current fullness of the bus. Then the application begins collecting real-time location data for that trip via the mobile device’s location sensors,” explained Taylor Raack, a master’s student in the department of computer science and a member of Tiramisu’s development team. This real-time location data is then used to predict arrival times and crowdedness for future stops.
For bus routes that do not have any real-time user activity, Tiramisu provides the scheduled time of arrival, obtained from the transit authority. However, based on data obtained in the past, Tiramisu can also predict arrival times for routes lacking real-time activity. 
“The value of our system increases with every additional transit patron who uses the application while riding a bus, so we encourage everyone who has a mobile device which can run the Tiramisu application to use it whenever they ride public transit,” Raack said. 
Tiramisu was developed from research performed by the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Accessible Public Transportation, a partnership organization between Carnegie Mellon and SUNY Buffalo. Researchers in the center began observing how people interacted with their transit agencies and how those interactions could have a positive effect on all riders. In the proceedings of the 2011 annual ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, the researchers concluded that “participants [in a Tiramisu trial study] were successful at tracing information and at using the real-time and historic estimates to improve their commuting experience.”
Raack explained that the computing infrastructure for the app is relatively light and simple, requiring little maintenance on its machinery and allowing more time to be spent improving existing features and building new ones for the transit community. Although the app is currently only available for iPhone users, Raack said that integration of Tiramisu into the Android platform is currently in the works.
Matthew Clark, an administrative coordinator for Carnegie Mellon facilities, uses the Port Authority bus system five days a week. “I have found Port Authority to be highly resistant to change for better or worse,” he said while describing a past incident in which a proposed algorithm that would streamline routes was met with hostility. “The Tiramisu system could only benefit every rider.”
The real-time bus tracking app may be helpful to incoming students. In the midst of the Port Authority’s sizeable service cut, new students on campus will be learning to use the bus system and returning students will be trying to plan their bus travel more efficiently. Raack said, “I’m very satisfied with our product so far, and as evidenced by the number of individual bus trips which have been traced by Tiramisu — 2,145 as of [Aug. 8] — it appears to me that Pittsburgh transit riders are enjoying it as well.”

In this generation, many people — from students to professionals to children — are addicted to social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or MySpace. These sites offer us an opportunity to connect with people we know and, sometimes, people we don’t know. On a daily basis, we share huge amounts of information through these connections, including personal photographs, addresses, and phone numbers. All this information makes social media sites a magnet for hackers and government agencies.
But just how accessible is this information to outsiders?
Facial recognition software can be a successful tool for extracting information from a picture by associating it with a specific name, especially when combined with other software to obtain personal information linked to the name. According to the Los Angeles Times, “Facial recognition software is growing and is being used and further developed by Facebook, Google, Apple, and the U.S. government.” Indeed, many popular programs such as Google’s Picasa, Facebook, and Apple’s iPhoto use facial recognition software.
This advent of this technology creates a sizeable risk in the accessibility of personal information. Alessandro Acquisti, an associate professor of information technology and public policy in the Heinz College and a Carnegie Mellon CyLab researcher, has conducted several experiments to examine the potential of facial recognition software to identify faces and match them with personal information.
In the first experiment, Acquisti’s team identified individuals on an online dating site where members use pseudonyms to protect their privacy. The research team took profile pictures from the dating site and cross-referenced the pictures with Facebook profile images accessible through a search engine using facial recognition software. As a result, they “ended up re-identifying a statistically significant proportion of members of the dating site,” according to Acquisti’s website, thus showing the viability of online-to-online re-identification.
In the second experiment, the group implemented offline-to-online re-identification by identifying students walking around campus based on their photos on Facebook. In this case, the team re-identified students from images taken through a webcam on the Carnegie Mellon campus before comparing them to profile images from Facebook. According to Acquisti’s website, they were able to identify around one-third of the subjects in the experiment.
In the third experiment, Acquisti’s team worked on what the team’s website calls “augmented reality,” or “the merging of online and offline data that new technologies make possible.” This means that if a person’s face can be linked to a name through facial recognition software that is in turn connected to social networking sites, it is possible to identify more sensitive information about the person. 
To prove this, the team predicted interests and social security numbers (SSNs) of some participants from the second experiment by combining facial recognition and previously developed algorithms to predict SSNs from public data. This blend of information from pictures, facial recognition, and public data warehouses is the augmented reality the team has been studying.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the real-time processing of personal information based on faces, Acquisti’s team created a smartphone application that collects online and offline personal data. The information found is then displayed over the target person’s face on the smartphone’s screen. This application can recognize faces and withdraw information about the individual from sites where similar pictures have been posted.
With such software and information scattered across the Internet on social networking sites, we may be moving toward a future in which everyone knows everything about everyone. 
At the Black Hat computer security conference in Las Vegas, Acquisti posited, “In a few years, facial visual searches may become as common as today’s text-based searches.” It is hard to imagine a future in which just a small click of a camera would result in a detailed history of a person.
In Acquisti’s words, “A person’s face is the veritable link between her offline and online identities. When we share photographs of ourselves online, it becomes possible for others to link our face to our names in situations where we would normally expect anonymity.”

Perseid meteor shower reaches annual peak
Skywatchers worldwide had their eyes and cameras ready this weekend as the annual Perseid meteor shower reached its peak Friday night. Despite threats of clouds and a coincidental full moon, amateur astronomers from California to England reported stellar sightings throughout the week. Observers called in as many as 20 meteors per hour during the shower’s peak, and NASA hosted an online skywatching party complete with live video.
Perseid meteors come from pieces of the sun-orbiting comet Swift-Tuttle. The Earth passes through the comet’s debris cloud each August, when pieces of the debris enter the Earth’s atmosphere at speeds of up to 133,000 m.p.h. and burn up. The Perseid meteor shower gets its name from the constellation Perseus, its observed place of origin in the night sky.

Amazon team invents cell phone airbag
Addressing the woes of butterfingered users everywhere, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Vice President Gregory M. Hart have filed a patent for airbags to prevent damage to mobile phones when they are accidentally dropped. The patent application, filed in February 2010, became public Thursday.
According to the application, a mobile device outfitted with the airbag mechanism would first detect that it has been dropped and determine the likely amount of resulting damage. If that damage passes a certain threshold, the device would deploy an airbag to absorb the brunt of the force of impact. Bezos and Hart list several variations on the airbag technology, including springs, reinforced edges, and a “propulsion element” to modify how the device falls in mid-air.

Researchers propose method to fight Web censors
Many Web users are familiar with using proxies to access blocked sites — until the proxy sites are discovered and blocked themselves. To bypass the cat-and-mouse game of Internet censorship, researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of Waterloo in Canada have developed Telex, a prototype system that secretly reroutes a connection without using an overt proxy.
A user running Telex first connects to any accessible HTTPS site as a decoy. Telex places a cryptographic key inside the HTTPS headers that is undetectable from the outside, but communicates the real intent of the connection to Telex-supported routers. When a Telex router recognizes a coded request for a blocked site, it can redirect the user's connection accordingly.
One drawback of the system is that it requires a large number of Internet service providers to install Telex-supported routers.

Professors develop mock circulatory system
While artificial hearts and heart-assist devices have existed for decades, the development and testing of these devices for juvenile patients has always lagged behind. The complex physical requirements for children’s devices have made it so developers cannot simply make smaller versions of adult devices.
Professors in Carnegie Mellon’s department of biomedical engineering have made strides in creating an environment for developers to test their new pediatric ventricular assist devices (VADs). They have created a mock circulatory system to simulate a child’s circulatory system and thus provide a better testing environment for these medical devices.
This new simulation is both economical to manufacture and simple to use, and it should allow for more rapid testing of pediatric VADs.

SETI project to come back online after donation
The SETI Institute will reactivate its Mount Shasta radio telescope facility by September after receiving $210,000 in donations this summer. The Mount Shasta array consists of 42 satellite dishes that search for evidence of extraterrestrial life. The site has been inactive since April of this year, when the institute ran out of funding for operations. Among the high-profile summer donors are Jodie Foster, who starred in the movie Contact, which featured the SETI project; science-fiction author Larry Niven; and Bill Anders, a former Apollo 8 astronaut.
The Allen Array monitors the electromagnetic spectrum to identify possible non-natural signals, which could indicate transmissions from extraterrestrial intelligence. Its high-altitude location allows it to make observations with significantly less interference than telescopes at sea level.

Pronoun reversal in autistic children explained
When autism was first characterized in 1943, Dr. Leo Kanner noted in his seminal paper the misuse of the pronouns “I” and “you” in autistic children. The use of these personal pronouns by normal listeners requires rapid re-mapping of their relationship to the subject; autistic listeners often reverse these pronouns, referring to themselves as “you.”
Research at Carnegie Mellon has shown where this neural dysfunction may lie for high-functioning autistic adults. The autistic subjects struggled to answer questions that contained the pronoun “you.” This behavior was accompanied by a significantly diminished connectivity between a frontal region of the brain (the right anterior insula) and a posterior region of the brain (the precuneus).

Traveling to Carnegie Mellon usually consists of crossing a bridge or 20 before arriving in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. A first glimpse of tall and reflective buildings, many of which are branded with the names “Carnegie” or “Mellon,” often implies that Pittsburgh is merely a large and serious steel city, where it’s easy to get lost in the shuffle. A few days at Carnegie Mellon is all it takes to squash these worrisome thoughts and give life to the realization that Pittsburgh is not a steel-hearted city; rather, it is a collection of small neighborhoods that are easy to become familiar with and will quickly seem like home.
Oakland
Carnegie Mellon students are quick to become familiar with this area, as campus is located right on the edge of the Oakland district. Oakland is also the home to the University of Pittsburgh’s campus. For Christy St. John, a sophomore in mechanical engineering, Oakland was the first area of Pittsburgh where she felt comfortable. Although she loves Carnegie Mellon’s cohesive campus, for St. John, “Oakland is what made me really feel that I had arrived at college.” That is to be expected, as the businesses of Oakland have capitalized on the hordes of students constantly milling about at all hours of the day. Block after block of inexpensive, indulgent eateries such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Qdoba, and Panera Bread provide an atmosphere of fun student lunches out that don’t break the typical poor college student budget. 
“My favorite part has to be half-price,” St. John said. Several restaurants in Oakland have late-night specials where certain items on their menus are half price after 11 p.m. Fuel and Fuddle, Mad Mex, and Joe Mama’s are a few of the restaurants that take part in this school-year special.
In addition to dining locations, there are always new sights to be seen. The area of Oakland closest to Carnegie Mellon is home to the Carnegie Library as well as most of the Carnegie museums, all of which offer free admission with a Carnegie Mellon student ID. Consider exploring nature with leisurely strolls through Schenley Park, which extends up behind Carnegie Mellon’s campus, making it easily accessible to students.
Squirrel Hill
A short trip in the opposite direction of Oakland, the Squirrel Hill neighborhood offers more extensive dining options. Interspersed with the frequently visited Giant Eagle grocery store and the inexpensive but no less satisfying frozen yogurt shops Razzy Fresh and Tutti Frutti are restaurants like The Silk Elephant, Aladdin’s Eatery, and Smallman Street Deli. Squirrel Hill is a great place to visit for a change from the typical American restaurant, with places that offer Thai, Mediterranean, Kosher-style food, and more.
Food barely cracks the surface of Squirrel Hill’s offerings. It may not be the shopping mecca of Pittsburgh, but there is no shortage of little hole-in-the-wall stores that newcomers would definitely miss out on if left unexplored. Avalon Exchange, A Child’s Wardrobe and Adults Too, and Jerry’s Records are three small local stores that are a shame to simply pass on by. Meg Descombes, a sophomore in the School of Drama, has often spent hours perusing these stores, sometimes with a purpose, sometimes without. “I could get lost in Jerry’s,” she said wistfully. “I’ve gotten plenty of gifts there, but it’s great because you don’t have to have a specific music taste to find what you’re looking for here.” With large selections that please both the masses and the indie types, these small neighborhood stores are undoubtedly the gems of Squirrel Hill. The committed shopper can find just about anything in these stores — all it takes is some patience, and maybe a sharp eye to spot what might be hidden.
Shadyside
One of the most upscale neighborhoods directly surrounding Carnegie Mellon, Shadyside is a favorite for senior musical theatre major Grey Henson. “This is my third year living in Shadyside,” he said. “It’s just a 10-minute walk down Morewood, and it’s really easy to waste time just wandering around Walnut Street.” Time wasted in Shadyside is usually time well spent on Walnut Street, which is the main strip of stores and eateries that usually comes to mind when thinking about the neighborhood. J. Crew, American Apparel, United Colors of Benetton, GAP, and Francesca’s are a few of the many popular clothing stores that pepper Walnut Street.
When the day has ended, some of the finer restaurants located in Shadyside, both on Walnut Street and beyond, prove to be a great treat. In the Walnut area, Girasole, Pizzutti’s Restaurant, Pangea, and Shady Grove are small but highly acclaimed restaurants that live up to their reputations for great Italian food, international cuisine, seafood, and American cuisine, respectively. “I’ve been to Girasole for birthdays or formal dinners, and  everything they offer is delicious, but be sure to make a reservation,” Henson advised. Venture a few streets over to South Highland Avenue, where you’ll discover Casbah’s Mediterranean and European food, and Oh Yeah! Ice Cream & Coffee Co. (sometimes referred to as the hipster version of Cold Stone Creamery). Both are worth the slightly longer walk.
Bloomfield
With its constant celebrations of the neighborhood’s history, Bloomfield, which lies right beyond the border of Shadyside, is best known as Pittsburgh’s Little Italy. This area takes the name to the next level, with many hole-in-the-wall restaurants that offer Italian cuisine of all kinds, from the simple gelato shop, Grasso Roberto Café, to the large Italian kitchen that will impart its cooking knowledge on anyone who wishes to stop by Merante’s Gift Shop. Bloomfield even hosts an annual Little Italy Days festival the last weekend in September; the celebration is on Liberty Avenue, the neighborhood’s main business street.
East Liberty
On the other side of Bloomfield, also bordering Shadyside, is what is described as the trendy part of Pittsburgh. Spoon, BRGR (say it out loud, and it suspiciously sounds like “burger”), and Plum are three of these restaurants, whose names alone seem almost too cool to exist, but actually specialize in gourmet American food, burgers, and Pan-Asian cuisine, respectively.
This culturally diverse area was once on the down and outs, but as a neighborhood that flourished in the 1950s, it has begun to welcome more commercial restaurants and shops, including Carnegie Mellon’s own Waffle Shop and Conflict Kitchen, the former of which also serves as a live-streaming talk show studio and public art project.
The Waterfront in Homestead
A short drive can convert into a long bus ride, as proven by the trip to the shopping center at the Waterfront. The 61D bus arrives at the Waterfront after an average ride of 30 to 40 minutes. The Waterfront is an outdoor shopping and entertainment complex. Here is the massive Loews Movie Theatre, which not only has 22 screens but also a full restaurant and lounge. It is a great place for a weekday night out, but be prepared to spend a lot of money; the price of tickets is definitely hefty for the novelty of a restaurant in the theater and “premium” seating.
The shops at the Waterfront are the main attraction; there are Costco, Target, Barnes and Noble, Macy’s, Old Navy, DSW, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Lowe’s Home Improvement, just to name a few. If anything was forgotten for the start of college, or if anything needs to be bought, the Waterfront is a great place to go.
The South Side
This area, accessed by the 54C and the 75 bus routes through Oakland, is located just over the Birmingham Bridge, and it is essentially one long road teeming with things to do, see, and eat. The densely populated portion of East Carson Street extends for over a mile, and with many late-night eateries and hangout spots, South Side is always a wonderful place to meet new people outside of the Carnegie Mellon network.
From a high-end Spanish restaurant like Mallorca to the familiarity of the Crazy Mocha Coffee Company, the South Side offers something for everyone. Although it is no Waterfront, the SouthSide Works is a small shopping center that continues the South Side’s ability to cater to many different types of people. Home to the national headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters, there is naturally an American Eagle store, along with H&M and Forever 21; for those looking for more upscale locations, the venue also offers a BCBG Max Azria, White House Black Market, and Urban Outfitters, all along the same strip.
These neighborhoods include only seven of the 89 unique neighborhoods that collectively make up the city of Pittsburgh. These seven alone could entertain and diversely educate for months, but if given the opportunity to explore even further, take it. This city has become one of not factories, but art, and don’t let that go to waste by lingering in the safe zone at Carnegie Mellon.

Beyond its reputation as a world-class research institution, Carnegie Mellon University harbors a unique heritage and set of quirky traditions. Yet, between mingling and competing with your future classmates, where can you even begin to discover what makes a true Tartan’s heart beat? From driving a buggy flying down Schenley Drive to shivering in the snow painting a fence, there is no lack of creativity to spark your interest.
Carnival: The ultimate distraction from finals
At Carnegie Mellon, April means that the highly anticipated Spring Carnival will soon take over the university. Carnival is not just a weekend event, but a tradition, encompassing yearlong preparation and dedication from students and organizations on campus. The festivities center on Midway (the parking lot behind the Morewood dormitories), and the week beforehand consists of booth-building. Student organizations, sororities, and fraternities showcase their creative talent through booths, which revolve around a yearly theme and will live only for the duration of Carnival. Prizes are awarded to the best booths in both Greek and independent organizations. The past year’s theme was “When I Was Your Age,” and booths included Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity’s first-place “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” Kappa Alpha Theta sorority’s first-place “The KAT in the Hat,” and Delta Gamma sorority’s second-place “POOH BEAR.”
The next highlight of Carnival, Sweepstakes (more often called “Buggy”) are the exhilarating races of student-constructed and driven buggies through an over-4,000-foot-long course. Although the races only last two days, the work lasts the entire school year, including hours of practicing the race course. Roles within a buggy team include a driver (usually five feet tall or less) who steers from within, pushers to roll the buggy along the course, mechanics to fix and maintain the buggy, and other members for supporting the vehicle’s progress in the course. Of booths and buggies, Jen Buse, a senior Head Orientation Counselor, noted, “It’s such a unique tradition: What other school would devote months to building a structure that will stand for only three days, or be so serious about pushing a small buggy with a person inside down a hill ... and cancel two days of classes       for it?”
Last but not least is the School of Computer Science mobot races. This competition includes student-built autonomous mobile robots, called “mobots,” navigating a course that runs 400 feet along a white track outside of Wean Hall. (Yes, that little white track has a useful and fun purpose besides confusing you on the walk to classes.) Each race lasts approximately four minutes, and no human intervention with the robot is permitted. The winning mobot takes away a grand prize of $1,000, while the races also serve to raise awareness and support for the Robotics Club.
The Fence: Embrace the Fence, paint the Fence, guard the Fence
The campus would not be the same without the iconic Fence, the original rendezvous point between the all-female Margaret Morrison Carnegie College and the Carnegie Institute of Technology, formerly all-male. Today, it serves as a message board and gathering place for the Carnegie Mellon campus. The mission is to capture the Fence, paint it only during the hours of midnight to sunrise, and protect it during the day from other would-be Fence painters, no matter the weather. Many an organization advertisement, charity message, or personal statement has appeared on our cherished Fence.
Calling all Scots: Bring out ye’ bagpipes!
Andrew Carnegie immigrated from Scotland to the United States with his family in 1848, and Carnegie Mellon continues in his rich Scottish heritage with our own blend of bagpipes, kilts, and Scotty, our Scottish terrier mascot. The Kiltie Band, featuring marching band music, performs in kilts, while Carnegie Mellon’s Pipe and Drums plays the bagpipes with traditional Scottish regalia, with Andrew Carlisle as its director. If a band is not enough to sate your curiosity, Carnegie Mellon is one of the few colleges in the country to offer a major in bagpiping. Also, Skibo Café, beyond offering an array of food, frozen yogurt, and coffee, pays homage to Carnegie’s Skibo Castle in Scotland.
Green Room: To sign or not to sign
Behind the beautiful Kresge Theater in the CFA building lies the Green Room, a testament to past and present graduating drama students. Before leaving Carnegie Mellon, drama students sign their names on the walls and ceilings. Past signees have included Holly Hunter and Zachary Quinto (Spock of Star Trek).
As you enjoy Orientation and face your first semester, be sure to remain open-minded to all of the traditions Carnegie Mellon has to offer. “Make a bucket list of Carnegie Mellon traditions and just get out there — even if you’re the only one of your friends going,” Helen Wang, associate director of Student Life for first-years, said. “The CMU experience is full of learning both in and out of the classroom. Find ways to leave this place better than you found it.... Whatever you want to put off until tomorrow, see if it can be done today — this is the CMU spirit.”

Hello, Class of 2015+!
I’m Ashtyn, one of the seven Head Orientation Counselors (HOCs) who are working hard to make your first seven days at Carnegie Mellon as memorable and as fun as possible. The other HOCs — Jen, Billy, Aaron, Veronica, Dan, and Sean — and I are very excited for all of you to become a part of the Carnegie Mellon community.
When deciding on a theme, we wanted to highlight two things. The first was that we wanted to to take Orientation back to its roots — back to its Tartan tradition. We want you to be as “Mad for Plaid” as we are. The second was that we wanted to emphasize the importance that college has in one’s journey of finding oneself. During Orientation we want you to start finding your thread. We want you to feel unique (the ‘i’ in “iPlaid”) while also feeling a part of the larger Carnegie Mellon community (the ‘Plaid’ in “iPlaid”).
Orientation is designed to help students familiarize themselves with the Carnegie Mellon community. It is our goal, and the goal of the Orientation Counselors (OCs), to help you begin the journey of finding yourself. During Orientation week, we will give you all the advice you need for your first year, ranging from the best places to study to the nicest places to eat. We are here to introduce you to your home for the next four (or five) years. Everyone on campus will be working to create a seven-day Orientation filled with awesome events; interactions with fellow first-years, upperclassmen, faculty, and staff; and free food. You’ll learn just how awesome that is as you continue your education at Carnegie Mellon. I’d like to take this time to get you pumped about some of the activities that we have planned for you during Orientation.
From forming close bonds within your housing communities to participating in Playfair — one of the biggest icebreakers in the world — the possibilities to meet new people are endless. Not only will you get to know a wide variety of first-years, you will also be able to meet some of your future professors and some faculty members of Carnegie Mellon.
Orientation activities are not limited to the campus. Explore Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Oakland, and the South Side with your OCs and classmates to find all that Pittsburgh has to offer.
Come together with your fellow classmates at Convocation to be officially welcomed into the Carnegie Mellon community, and celebrate by dancing the night away on the Clippership Cruise.
The week culminates with all the houses battling on the Cut for the coveted Carnegie Cup. Dress up, show your house spirit, and get ready to experience one of Orientation’s greatest traditions.
Whitewater rafting, biking, and rock climbing are just some of the activities offered as part of the Pittsburgh Connections program that you can enjoy during Orientation week. After that, end your Orientation by watching your fellow classmates showcase their hidden skills in the Talent Show.
Coming to Carnegie Mellon, you may feel nervous, excited, hopeful, sad, hesistant, and plenty of other emotions. Questions may be running through your head, such as: What if I can’t find my classes? Will people like me? What do I want to do with my life? Do people really wear capes? You aren’t alone in your fears and questions. Every first-year before you has felt this way. This is what makes Orientation week at Carnegie Mellon so important. For many upperclassmen, Orientation was the most helpful transition imaginable. It is our job to help you feel the same.
We have so much planned for you and we are very excited for you all to be here. So get excited, and get ready to have the time of your life.
Welcome home!
Sincerely,
Ashtyn Hemendinger and the rest of the Orientation/House staff

As you enter Carnegie Mellon, most of you will be ready to embrace college life and the freedom that comes along with it. Now you will be able to stay out until 4 a.m. on a school night, be excused from the routine of waking up early, and be exempt from doing your old chores — except your laundry. Perhaps one of the most thrilling freedoms of all is that you now have the decision-making power to eat anything you want. But with all of the choices Carnegie Mellon provides, this freedom might become a bit overwhelming. We’ve provided you with a head start to where the best food is available on campus.
The Exchange (formerly known as Ginger’s)
Located on the ground floor of Posner Hall, home of the Tepper School of Business, this place is an absolute delight. It not only provides the best sandwiches on campus, but it also allows you to create your own. Other than sandwiches, you can also choose from the daily meal — pastas, hot soups, and the like — and grab a brownie or a cookie at the counter. Jimmy Murphy, a sophomore math major, is a die-hard fan of The Exchange. He said, “The food does not carry any of the negative connotations that usually come with campus food.” And it’s not only the food that keeps him coming back to this place. Murphy added, “The people working there are happy and enthusiastic, making the whole place a great environment to eat in. Additionally, because of their location, the food is named after business concepts or places.” Murphy suggests trying the “Free Market” and the “Wall Street” sandwiches.
Hannah Kumar, a sophomore psychology and social and decision sciences double major, also rates The Exchange one of the best places to eat on campus. Although she considers the seating space inadequate for the crowd this place attracts, Kumar gave a helpful tip: “If you want to try something new but don’t know what to order, ask for ‘something good’ and the guys there will whip up something random that’s usually delicious.” She’s also experimented and has come up with a recipe for the perfect sandwich: “chicken salad, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, pickles, and spicy mustard.” Trisha Ambe, a materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major, considers the food to be fresh and tasty — plus, as a true Tartan would say, “It’s not far from the library!”
Tazza D’Oro
Located in the Gates Center, Tazza D’Oro at the R-Bar Café provides the freshest and healthiest eating options on campus. With a great variety of paninis, pastries, and desserts to choose from, Tazza D’Oro is not for those looking for a greasy meal, but it is delicious and satisfying. Each panini comes with a side of mixed greens on the plate, and you could finish off that meal with a “to-die-for apple tart,” as Michelle Berman, a junior economics and statistics double major, described it. “D’Oro caters to both vegetarians and meat lovers. It is definitely the best place to eat on campus as the interior of Gates is very modern and minimalist, providing a quiet and relaxing environment,” Kumar said. 
Laura Schraff, a junior computer science major, loves Tazza D’Oro; she said, “It’s not only because Gates is my home building — the food is delicious and healthier than probably anywhere else on campus. Also, the people there are so energetic and super nice. They’ve got great paninis for lunch and some of the best baked goods on campus. It’s also a great environment to casually hang out and study with friends.” Michelle Lin, a sophomore social and decision sciences and economics major, couldn’t agree more: “I swear you can’t go wrong with anything you order there. Whether you’re craving something savory or sweet, it will be there and it will be delicious.”
La Prima Espresso
It’s not exactly a conventional breakfast or lunch location, but La Prima, located on the fifth floor of Wean Hall, remains a great place to get food for those on the go. Available in-house are fresh baked goods like croissants, cinnamon rolls, desserts, breads, and bagels with cream cheese, and some quick meals like focaccia sandwiches. From a vegetarian’s perspective, two highly recommended options are the almond croissants and the tomato and mozzarella half-sandwiches with pesto. Lin recommends grabbing a cup of coffee from La Prima in between classes. And if plain coffee is not your deal, you need not worry. The menu also includes juice, iced tea, lattes, and even double mocha cappuccinos.
Evgefstos!
Meat lovers beware, but vegans and vegetarians are welcome to falafel, wraps, flatbread pizzas, and salads. The best side option: whole-wheat pita bread with artichoke and spinach dip. Sounds healthy? It’s delicious as well.
Pasta Villagio
Located close to Evgefstos!, on the second floor of the University Center, this is the best place to get pasta on campus, and what’s more, you can create your own. The only thing the food lacks, at least to some taste buds, is salt, so be sure to grab a few packets on your way out.
Spinning Salads
If you felt sick after eating the Schatz buffet, took only a bite of your Skibo pasta, consumed a fat-filled burger at the City Grill, and felt heartburn after chowing down some chicken wings at the Tartans Pavilion, then maybe it’s time to visit Spinning Salads in the University Center. Providing a bowl full of greens with a variety of vegetables, proteins, and salad dressings to choose from, this salad place makes even healthy food tasty.
Maggie Murph Café
This café in Hunt Library has provided fuel to many all-nighters and saved many students from failing their exams. It also deserves mention for its quick-pick sandwiches, sushi rolls, and especially bagels — choices include garlic, whole wheat, multi grain, cinnamon, and everything, along with cream cheese. Some students wander over to the library just for the bagels.
The Underground
Located in the basement of Morewood Gardens, the Underground provides free coffee during finals, when it stays open 24 hours (otherwise closing at 11 p.m.). Still, some like the Underground for other reasons; Berman insists that the grilled cheese sandwich with fries makes for a great stress-busting meal.
—
There are still many more campus places worthy of mention like Taste of India; the Carnegie Mellon Café, which provides breakfast all day long; and Entropy+, Carnegie Mellon’s own convenience store that offers frozen food, fresh items like fruits and salads, sweets, juices, and those savior energy bars.
If you get tired of campus food, put your DineX to good use and walk down to Subway on South Craig Street, or order a Vocelli pizza to your dorm. Murphy believes that most places on campus get old after a while, but with so many additional eating options available in Oakland, you should always be able to find something delicious to eat.

Upon entering Carnegie Mellon University, students tend to become hopelessly reliant on (i.e. addicted to) caffeine. Whether it is from an all-night study session or a party, a strong cup of coffee will be everyone’s best friend the following morning. Especially during your first year, knowing where to get the best coffee at the best price will prove essential.
Carnegie Mellon offers 11 coffee venues: Tazza D’Oro, Maggie Murph Café, Zebra Lounge, The Exchange, Ginger’s Express, La Prima Espresso, Skibo Café, Carnegie Mellon Café, the Underground, Stephanie’s, and Entropy+.
Each of these facilities offers a range of choices, from espressos to mocha lattes to cappuccinos. A majority of the facilities’ beverages are provided by CulinArt, which uses Starbucks products. Carnegie Mellon Café and Maggie Murph Café, as well as The Exchange and Ginger’s Express, which are owned by Mike Clarkson and Kevin Huber, are the most popular coffee locations. They offer the widest range of Starbucks products, often mirroring the full Starbucks menu.
However, other venues offer variety from those standard Starbucks products. The Underground in Morewood Gardens, Skibo Café in the University Center, and Zebra Lounge in the College of Fine Arts building are all managed by Gullifty’s Restaurant.
Tazza D’Oro at the R-Bar Café in the Gates Center is managed by the local company Tazza D’Oro. It offers a different specialty brew every day, each with its own flavor and geographic origin. Tazza D’Oro uses ingredients from local and independent farms and vendors for all its beverages and food.
La Prima Espresso is an outside company that operates its own cart near the fifth-floor entrance of Wean Hall. The venue offers students a “coffee of the month” at its cart. “I’m going to say La Prima and Seattle’s Best [from the University Center] are my favorites,” said Shilpa Balaji, a junior computer science major. “Seattle’s Best, just because I used to drink it at home all the time. Tazza [D’Oro] is probably the strongest, so that could be the best option depending on what you’re looking for, but it’s sometimes a little too thick for my taste.” In comparison, Balaji said, “the Guatemalan blend at Skibo is generally extremely watered down, which makes me not generally opt for it.”
“I generally go to either La Prima or Tazza D’Oro. On taste alone, I slightly prefer Tazza D’Oro, but they’re both good,” said Lucas Ray, a junior computer science major.
Unfortunately, a majority of these facilities are closed throughout the weekend, a time when students may need caffeine the most. Only a few are open every day of the week: Maggie Murph Café, Skibo Café, Carnegie Mellon Café, the Underground, and Entropy+. This severely cuts down on the options available to students.
Students should also be economical in where they go for coffee on campus; they should look for the locations that offer the most coffee for the lowest cost. La Prima Espresso, for example, only has 16 oz. as its largest size, and any coffee in that size costs about $4. Comparatively, Maggie Murph Café offers 20 oz. for a similar price. Wait time can also factor into a student’s preferred coffee location: More popular places on campus can take up to 15 minutes just to order a plain coffee. This can bite into students’ time between classes and affect their busy schedules.
To find your perfect and convenient coffee location, figure out your schedule and specific tastes. These will be the most important factors when differentiating among Carnegie Mellon’s many venues.

For the first 18 years of my life, I pictured college as a place where you studied one subject to the exclusion of everything else. I never expected that my social life would take up much time, or that it could affect my perception of my studies. My first semester at Carnegie Mellon went according to plan, and I spent any and all free time with other music majors, becoming painfully familiar with every practice room on the College of Fine Arts mezzanine. The way I balanced my priorities my first month in Pittsburgh, I might as well have been at a music conservatory.
For me, Orientation seemed socially overwhelming. You learn hundreds of names only to forget them seconds later, and you play icebreaker activities that echo summer camp activities of years past. But enjoy it while it lasts! Pretty soon, rather than spending your evenings talking to interesting people, you’ll be stuck in your dorm room solving problem sets.
It wasn’t until classes began that I had a chance to settle into a reasonably sized circle of friends. Some people became close to their floor-mates, while others chose to befriend classmates. In CFA especially, you’ll come to find that there’s a strong sense of community among those of the same major. After the social frenzy that is Orientation week, meeting all your colleagues in under a minute is refreshing to say the least. I found little reason to leave the building at all during my first semester, besides attending my Interpretation and Argument class and occasionally sleeping.
As a result, I managed to achieve a somewhat conservatory-esque experience. I found myself surrounded by musicians 24/7, grumbling about the coursework that wasn’t directly related to my performance major. It’s easy to forget that you can study subjects, pursue interests, or have friends outside your major when you’re constantly immersing yourself in it.
Thus, I encountered a problem. You obviously need to devote time to your coursework, but I missed out on a lot of opportunities by limiting myself so strictly. Upon leaving an environment as restrictive as high school, many students find the unlimited list of clubs and activities at Carnegie Mellon overwhelming. While this is understandable, the solution is not to decline to participate entirely. Do what you think you can handle, keeping in mind that backing out is never difficult if you find that you’ve overestimated yourself.
Carnegie Mellon offers opportunities that you could never have imagined in high school. Get a work study job, start tutoring, or join an a cappella group, Kiltie Band, or the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic. Give Greek life a try, or — for the more adventurous — go skydiving (yes, there’s a club for that too). If you have an idea for a club that doesn’t exist, then you can always start it yourself. You’ll meet some bright and interesting people, and the more diverse their interests, the more refreshing a conversation with them can be.
I took my own advice my freshman year, and through an unexpected series of events, found myself at a KGB event one Friday night. I was the only music major present and had little in common with most of the members, but that just made the situation all the more inspirational and memorable. I met some bright and delightfully quirky people by venturing outside of my social comfort zone, and I ended up having a great time. And who knew that playing a three-hour game of Galactic Encounters with a group of strangers could be so refreshing? Had I played it safe and stuck with my music buddies, I would never have guessed.
It’s difficult to predict how you’ll change your first year. Suddenly being completely responsible for myself was difficult, especially after I hit a bump in the road. Due to a complication following knee surgery, I spent my entire freshman year getting around Pittsburgh on crutches and, for a couple of months, in a wheelchair. As a result of this unique, albeit unfortunate, experience, I gained confidence in my ability to handle any obstacle college could think to throw at me and the determination I needed to finish the year (not to mention more upper body strength than I knew what to do with).
So, for many reasons, my first year wasn’t what I expected. Instead of the classical music haven I longed for after high school, I found a diverse social experience with myriad opportunities available to almost anyone who expressed a legitimate interest. So don’t look for too specific an experience at Carnegie Mellon, and step outside of your comfort zone whenever possible. The most memorable opportunities will be the ones you never thought you would find.

As any college student knows, going to school isn’t all about hitting the books day in and day out, especially when you’re in a cultural city like Pittsburgh, where it would be a shame for you not to go out and explore what the various neighborhoods have to offer.
One part of Pittsburgh that you can really get into, if you’re willing and knowledgeable, is the music scene. Sure, there’s the Consol Energy Center, which attracts some of the bigger names, but you’d be missing out if you passed over Pittsburgh’s smaller venues.
Pittsburgh is an intimate city, and, although it’s Pennsylvania’s second-largest, it’s got a cozy feel to it. The neighborhoods are pleasant, the people are friendly, and the restaurants and cafés parallel the small-town atmosphere. It’s not surprising, then, to realize that most of the concert venues are smaller and allow for personal viewing experiences.
Here’s a list of some local places that like to host traveling artists (and, occasionally, secret shows from Pittsburgh natives). Check these places out and you’ll be sure to see some worthwhile acts.
Stage AE
400 North Shore Dr. (North Shore)
Less than a year ago, this all-ages concert venue opened up next to Heinz Field. The big draw: The indoor venue, with a 2,400-person capacity, hosts events 12 months a year. And when the weather is nice enough, the outdoor amphitheater can house an audience of 5,500. In the fall of 2011, Stage AE will host college-friendly artists like Arctic Monkeys and Mac Miller, proving that although it’s the new kid in town as far as concert venues go, it can bring in some big names.
Mr. Small’s Theatre and Funhouse
400 Lincoln Ave. (Millvale)
Mr. Small’s might just be the perfect venue. It’s not meant to host big names, but there’s still an attractive number of folks who crowd the theater. Don’t let the small size scare you, though; while the place only has a capacity of 650, it never feels like you’re squished among fans. There are two full bars in the back of the room, where the older crowd stays and mingles, while younger fans can get as close to the stage as they want to. There’s really not a bad seat in the house; even if you get there late and are forced to stand in the back by the bar, you can easily see everything going on onstage.
Altar Bar
1620 Penn Ave. (Strip District)
As a whole, the Altar Bar is quite a beautiful building, although most people don’t go to admire its architecture. Inside, the venue’s three floors are attractive, but you’ll only be seeing the middle level, as the ones above and below it are for VIPs only. Visitors will definitely feel as if they are at a bar and not the usual concert setting, as the large iridescent bar and neon stairs keep you awake and energized. Be sure to check if the show you’re looking to go to is an all-ages concert or not; as the venue is a bar, most shows are restricted to the 21+ crowd.
Carnegie Music Hall
4400 Forbes Ave. (Oakland)
With a capacity of almost 2,000, this is one of Pittsburgh’s larger and definitely classier venues. The interior is exquisite; you feel like you should be wearing a tuxedo and sipping champagne when you step into the lobby. Floor seating is good, but you’re better off trying to get second-story balcony seats a bit to the left or right of the center. That way, you’re above half the audience, but still close to the stage.
Other favorites include:
Hard Rock Café, 230 W. Station Square Dr. (Station Square)
Club Café, 56 S. 12th St. (South Side)
Club Zoo, 1630 Smallman St. (Strip District)
The Smiling Moose, 1306 E. Carson St. (South Side)
A brief note of caution about attending a show at these venues: If you don’t go with someone who has a car, make sure you know where the closest bus stops are and when the buses are supposed to arrive. Just about all of these venues are not in walking distance of Carnegie Mellon’s main campus, and you don’t want to risk being late for your show.
Even if you’re not a die-hard fan, take a night off from your studies, check out a part of Pittsburgh where you can’t see the Cathedral of Learning around you, and hear some good music — all for a college-friendly price. Your overworked mind will thank you.

Dear Patrick,
It’s move-in day, and I’m really looking forward to Orientation. The only problem is that my parents won’t leave. They drove me in, which was great since I have so much stuff, and I definitely didn’t turn them down when they offered to buy all my groceries and books. But now they won’t leave. How can I get them out of my room?
Please help,
Grown-ups Take Forever to gO
Dear GTFO,
You must be the first kid to go to college. Or the last. Let’s be honest, you’re not reading this. You’re too busy unpacking or trying to chat up that cute girl down the hall. So I’ll address this directly to the only readers: your parents.
Hey parents! How are you? I know this can be an emotional day — kid growing up, all that jazz — but it’s time to go. You finally got your kid out of the house. Let him go off and learn, drink a little too much, and pull some all-nighters. Seriously, just get out of your son’s dorm room. You can hang out in Pittsburgh a little, maybe even attend some of those Orientation activities meant for parents, but now is the time to cut the cord. You’re free again! Unless you have a couple more brats puttering around the house, but they’ll be gone soon enough.
Just go home already,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
Do you have any tips for Orientation? Should I even bother with any of these activities? Is this going to be a waste of time? Because Team Fortress 2 isn’t going to play itself.
Thanks,
Scared of Orientation Socializing
Dear SOS,
Here’s the first rule of Orientation: Leave your room. If you stay inside, you’re just wasting a week of your life. Orientation is the one time at school you can walk up to anyone without any fear and strike up a conversation. No one knows anyone — it’s very freeing. No matter how awkward you are, the other person is just as awkward as you. (Another benefit of Carnegie Mellon: Everyone’s really awkward.)
The food you get at Orientation will be the best food you’ll get all year, thanks to that meal plan you’re forced to sign up for. Take advantage of it while you can. Every organization on campus will throw a party during Orientation. Upperclassmen see it as an excuse to come back early and party for a week. If that’s your scene, enjoy it before you have work and class. Take every chance you can to meet more people.
Don’t go on the Clipper Ship — it sucks,
Patrick Hoskins

The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCan), a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting pancreatic cancer, held its annual Purple Stride Pittsburgh 2011 Pick Up the Pace last Sunday. Participants from around the city convened at the North Park swimming pool in Allison Park to kick off the event, which consisted of a five-kilometer run and a one-mile walk with family and friends to honor and remember loved ones who battled pancreatic cancer.
All of the Purple Stride proceeds will go toward advancing research and aiding those affected by pancreatic cancer. 
“Fundraisers like this are good ideas,” said Brian Park, a junior social and decision sciences major. “More money is always necessary for the advance of research of medical problems.”
According to the PanCan website, “Survival rates [for pancreatic cancer] have remained in the single digits for 40 years. Look at pancreatic cancer survival rates and you’ll see something deadly wrong. Today, the five-year survival rate is just 6 percent.” PanCan’s goal is to double those survival rates by 2020. The group also hopes to raise awareness of this specific type of cancer; with high mortality rates and minimal funding, members feel pancreatic cancer deserves national attention.
The disease is especially well known to members of the Carnegie Mellon community, who lost computer science professor Randy Pausch to pancreatic cancer in the summer of 2008. His memory inspired a team called “Pausch’s People” to enter the Purple Stride event this year. Led by Adam Rauf, a master’s student in the Software Engineering Institute’s business operations department, and Vivian Lee, the executive assistant in the Institute for Software Research, Pausch’s People raised $230 for Purple Stride and the fight against cancer. 
Rauf and Lee are not the only ones at Carnegie Mellon to have been involved with cancer fundraisers. Many students participate in the annual Relay for Life event sponsored by the American Cancer Society. Last year, student groups ranging from activities clubs to sororities and fraternities walked around the Cut in an all-night fundraiser.
“I did Relay for Life last year,” said Joanne Yun, a junior in H&SS. “It was a great experience and well worth the effort. Cancer is such an awful disease, so being a part of something that’s actively fighting it is great.”
Although Purple Stride only lasted three hours, it exceeded the organizers’ expectations. With over 80 teams participating, Purple Stride beat its fund raising goal of $100,000 and finished the day with $102,804 to further research and support for pancreatic cancer patients.
Refreshments and entertainment, along with activities for kids, were provided free of charge at the Purple Stride event. Information about pancreatic cancer and PanCan’s research on the disease was also available at the event.

While this year’s incoming first-years are just becoming familiar with Carnegie Mellon’s current campus, the university administration is looking toward future development with the implementation of its new 10-year master plan.
The plan, which acts as a guide for future campus development, was made public in March after more than a year of planning by the Campus Design and Facility Development office.
All of the potential projects included in the plan, regardless of how varied, are focused on achieving a single goal: growth. 
“The master plan is aimed at supporting university growth by both enhancing the existing core campus and by developing underutilized properties purchased by Carnegie Mellon along Forbes between Craig Street and Morewood Avenue,” Bob Reppe, Carnegie Mellon’s director of design, said in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article last year.
The previous master plan, formed in 2002, included developments such as the now-completed Gates Hillman Complex. Each master plan builds upon the last one to continue the university administration’s long-term goal of improving the campus. 
According to last year’s master plan report, “Building on the momentum of the last master plan, we can continue to make this a truly great campus, one that is equal to the national and international reputation of Carnegie Mellon.”
However, fulfilling this vision depends on the approval of community members and the city, as well as the availability of funding. The current master plan has already been discussed at length with community members, as last year’s announcement was preceded by months of meetings with neighborhood organizations and community groups who could be affected by the potential projects. Last April also marked the first in a series of campus-wide meetings attended by students, staff, and faculty. The plan was set to be reviewed by both the Pittsburgh city planning commission and city council, while sections of the plan regarding Forbes Avenue within campus would need to be reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, as Forbes Avenue is a state road.
When the master plan was made public in March, Associate Vice Provost for Campus Design and Facility Development Ralph Horgan anticipated the approval process to take about six months.
“You have to be pretty thoughtful to do this,” Horgan told Pop City Media in early March. “Hopefully in July we’ll have the approved master plan, so that if we want to do something and the funding is there, we can do it.” The funding, as Horgan pointed out, is one of the main obstacles to a series of projects that will likely cost the university tens of millions of dollars.
Once approved, students can expect to see changes to campus taking place as early as this academic year. Outside lanes on each side of Forbes are set to be replaced with bike lanes, aimed at making commutes to and from the university safer and easier, as well as to “embrace Forbes as the main street of campus,” Reppe told The Tartan last year.
Other proposed changes to the face of campus include moving the Tepper School of Business from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration building and Posner Hall to a section of what is now the Morewood parking lot. This, however, is not the only new building to be expected. A new nano-biomedical energy research facility has been proposed to move into the space between Wean and Hamerschlag Halls, while a new building for administration and alumni relations staff may be housed on a section of Forbes currently occupied by fraternity houses.
Hamberg Hall, the University Center, and Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall may also be transformed, with expansions proposed for all three facilities.
Other projects mentioned in the plan include an extension of campus walkways between Forbes and Fifth Avenues and the construction of a campus-based hotel near Craig Street, to be operated by an outside party.

Filming for The Dark Knight Rises may be capturing everyone’s attention in Pittsburgh, but that was not the only movie magic occurring in the city this summer. Scientists at Disney Research, Pittsburgh (DRP) and Carnegie Mellon have been working together on technology to improve the accuracy of motion depicted in films and to enhance moviegoers’ experience watching films.
DRP developed a new tactile technology, called Surround Haptics, which would make it possible for video gamers and film viewers to experience a variety of sensations, including the jolt of a collision and the feel of bugs across their skin. Surround Haptics, which is going to be used to enhance a high-intensity driving simulator game, allows players seated in a chair fitted with inexpensive vibrating actuators to feel everything from road imperfections to car collisions.
“Although we have only implemented Surround Haptics with a gaming chair to date, the technology can be easily embedded into clothing, gloves, sports equipment, and mobile computing devices,” Ivan Poupyrev, senior research scientist at DRP, said in a press release.
DRP and Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute have also developed technology that will better allow computer animators to more realistically depict complex facial expressions. To do so, researchers attached 320 reference marks to a professional actor, and they recorded facial motion-capture data from the actor while he expressed a variety of emotions and actions. 
“We can build a model that is driven by data, but can still be controlled in a local manner,” J. Rafael Tena, a Disney research scientist, said in a press release. The researchers analyzed the motion-capture data to divide the face into 13 regions; as a result, computer animators can now manipulate the regions to create the facial poses they desire.
Researchers have also improved motion-capture techniques so they are no longer confined to a closed studio. In traditional motion capture, cameras are attached to an actor in a closed studio to record his or her motions. Animators can then use that data to create computer-generated effects or creatures, such as Gollum from the Lord of the Rings films.
DRP and Carnegie Mellon’s new method uses body-mounted cameras to estimate the position of the person in relation to their surroundings. This method allows motion capture to happen outside of a studio in practically any location — even over large distances outdoors.
“This could be the future of motion capture,” Takaaki Shiratori, a post-doctoral associate at DRP, said in a press release. As video cameras become ever smaller and cheaper, “I think anyone will be able to do motion capture in the not-so-distant future,” he said.

ECE professor recognized in computer architecture field
Carnegie Mellon’s Onur Mutlu received the 2011 Young Computer Architecture Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society’s Technical Committee on Computer Architecture.
Mutlu is an assistant professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering.
This is the award’s inaugural year; it recognizes outstanding research and contributions within computer architecture by an individual who has received his or her Ph.D. within six years of nomination. 
“This is a great honor for me as I, along with my students and collaborators, research new future computer systems that are fundamentally more capable, efficient, resilient, and economical,” Mutlu said in a university press release.
Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, Mutlu worked at Microsoft Research and spent summers at Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
Mutlu, who directs the SAFARI research group at Carnegie Mellon, reports that his group is currently examining how to improve computer memory storage. These systems use new technologies that enable energy-efficient operation.
Mutlu’s research has received several other prestigious recognitions in the past year, including the National Science Foundation CAREER Award. 
Noel Zahler, head of School of Music, resigns from post
Noel Zahler has resigned as the head of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music to become dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts at Long Island University’s C.W. Post campus. His resignation will be effective on Sept. 30.
“I know that I speak for everyone at Carnegie Mellon in thanking Noel Zahler for his indefatigable efforts and his achievements on behalf of the students, staff, and faculty in the School of Music. All of us wish him well in this new chapter in his career,” Dan Martin, acting CFA dean, said in a university press release.
According to the official e-mail notifying students of his resignation, Zahler made many contributions to the School of Music during his four years as head. He was credited with increasing the number of full-time faculty positions, updating the curriculum, adding programs, and creating new performance opportunities for students.
In the e-mail, Martin said Zahler helped raise the school’s profile and cited its recent top-10 music school ranking in the prestigious Fiske Guide.
Zahler also expanded the school’s alumni connections, initiated several fundraising campaigns, and built strong ties with local music organizations, such as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Pittsburgh Opera.

Each week, The Tartan collaborates with University Police to report on the latest incidents occurring on and near campus. But, for this issue, The Tartan has compiled a special edition of the Crime and Incident section; these are some of the more notable reports of the section from the past semester.
Burglary
Jan. 19, 2011
At approximately 8 p.m., police responded to a burglary in the West Wing dormitory.  A female student reported that she awakened to find a male intruder in her room. At the time, he was in possession of the victim’s laptop computer. The victim asked the intruder what he was doing in her room, and he replied that he wanted to look at her computer. The intruder then dropped the computer and fled the room.
Bomb Threat
Feb. 1, 2011
A bomb threat was phoned in to the desk attendant at Mudge House. Upon further investigation, officers found out that the caller was one of the desk attendant’s friends, trying to pull a prank on her.
Suspicious Person
Feb. 17, 2011
There was a report of a suspicious male in the Purnell Center basement who was confused and would not respond to questions. It was determined that this incident was related to a call that the Pittsburgh police were investigating regarding a missing autistic teen. Pittsburgh police were contacted and the teen was turned over to them.
Suspicious Activity
Feb. 22, 2011
Police responded to the Gates Center for a report of someone using one of the public bathrooms as an office and spending several hours a day there. Upon arrival, University Police spoke with the involved party, and a referral was made to Student Life.
Suspicious Activity
Feb. 23, 2011
ISS workers reported that someone was whispering to them through the vent in a women’s bathroom in Wean Hall, harassing and frightening them.
Suspicious Activity

For many readers, this will be their first year at Carnegie Mellon University; incoming students will experience a lot of “firsts” over the next year as they explore campus as well as Pittsburgh. The city itself is home to many national “firsts.” Let’s take a look at the most famous “firsts” in Pittsburgh throughout history:
1789: Inaugural publication of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the first newspaper west of the Allegheny Mountains
1893: George Washington Gale Ferris, Pittsburgh resident, builds first Ferris Wheel
1954: Dr. Jonas Salk develops the polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh
1982: Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Scott Fahlman invents the first Internet emoticon, the smiley face :-)

College should come with warning signs; if it did, some of the signs would probably read something like, “Beware: Midnight snacks, binge eating, and extra pounds ahead.”
People debate whether the dreaded “Freshman 15” is an actual phenomenon or not. Based on my experience gaining unwanted weight in college, it is as easy as oversleeping for Monday’s classes. After my first semester at Carnegie Mellon, my roommate and I both felt the toll of our college lifestyles. Eating at night and hardly at all during the day does not make a healthy body.
For some people, staying healthy and active requires little work; for others, it’s a struggle and requires discipline and sheer force of will. I am not talking to that first healthy group of people; you all can go eat celery and run laps, or whatever it is that you do. I’m talking to the latter group, the people who know they should eat healthier and exercise regularly, but can’t seem to find the will power.
Living a healthy lifestyle in college is hard, but I firmly believe it’s possible; it comes down to discipline. My first two years in college were marked by sporadic bursts of working out with partying, snacking, and studying in between. I worked every day after school and finished homework every night around 2 a.m. And what kept me going every night? Junk food, of course! Ah, those midnight walks to 7-Eleven for chips and energy drinks. Staying up all night and pigging out at Schatz’s all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet did not aid my crusade for a smaller waistline.
Bad habits like these are hard to break, so form good ones while you have the chance. Start this school year by setting aside 30 minutes to an hour every day to work out. Even if you work out for just 15 minutes, it’ll help you stay energized and alert throughout your day. Give yourself no excuse not to exercise; rent out a locker in the UC for your gear, find a buddy to keep you accountable, or put the time that you are going to work out every day in your planner. 
For myself, just “working out” never seemed to happen. I mean, what’s the point of “working out”? You don’t go anywhere when you run on a treadmill or pedal an exercise bike. There’s no immediate prize when you lift 10 pounds more than usual or use the Stairmaster for 20 minutes instead of 15. 
Many people were fit in high school, where they played sports that have been left behind since entering college. If you are this type of person, I would suggest joining an intramural sport. It’s fairly low-key, can work around your schedule, lets you be a part of a team, and gives defined goals and rewards to exercising. Exercising is actually an easy part of staying in shape during college, at least compared to taking control of what and when you eat. 
Eating is the true monster hiding in your tiny dormitory closet. When classes, work, extracurricular activities, social life, and homework are all vying for your attention, what you decide to eat isn’t even under consideration. Carnegie Mellon students lead busy lives where convenience and the weight of our wallets define what we eat.
Still, campus dining does have healthy, or rather healthier, meal options to choose from. For first-years, who have to buy a meal plan, knowing where to get healthy on-campus food is a must. Evgefstos!, in the UC, is a good all-vegetarian option with Totally Juiced and Spinning Salads across the hall. Salads and deli sandwiches to go are also made daily by CulinArt and can be found at most dining locations around campus.
Choosing healthier meal options is just as important as choosing healthier snack options. I used to grab a candy bar or a bag of chips when I didn’t have time for dinner, but all it succeeded in doing was make my body feel greasy. Some alternatives that I’ve found to be just as convenient and delicious are carrot sticks, granola bars, nuts, dried fruit, and yogurt. Most of these items can be bought on campus and stored easily. If you don’t have time for a nice breakfast — and let’s get real, who ever has time for any type of breakfast? — grab one of these items and you’re good to go.
Carnegie Mellon is a demanding school, and your life here will be demanding. Eating smart and exercising can only enhance your time at college, teaching you a level of discipline and dedication that will last beyond your years in academia. Set aside time to plan your exercise schedule and eating strategy, and you’ll find that the monster in your closet is in fact just a dust bunny.

Since its launch in 2004, Facebook has become a vital part of everyday life. From its roots in college campuses, it has blossomed into a way for people of all ages to connect on a variety of levels. At its heart, however, Facebook retains the charm and allure of the purpose it was originally created for: It is first and foremost a way for college students to connect with each other through social media.
The nature of these connections is something that is a constant source of discussion, often leading to what is well known as “Facebook drama.” One of the features that sets Facebook apart from competitors (including the newest social networking competitor, Google+) is its inherent openness. Even with careful manipulation of the privacy settings, Facebook tends to be a place where people have access to their networks’ information and photographs at any time. Such open sharing of information is often a source of stress and conflict when the information falls into the hands of someone it wasn’t intended for — whether it be a family member or teacher witnessing unsavory behavior, or gossip among peers. 
College is a transition period, where students go from high-school kids to young adults to adults. In college, you will make horrendous mistakes, get over them, and learn from them. However, you don’t have to make all those mistakes to get the experience and lessons they bring. Two simple Facebook dos and don’ts can help any student, and especially first-years, avoid Facebook drama while at Carnegie Mellon. 
Don’t: Add your whole class the day you get on campus. You are going to be meeting about 30 people a minute during Orientation week, and most of those names you won’t remember, no matter how many icebreaker games you play. I remember adding people freshman year who I had seen once; I maybe glanced at their profile briefly and then never saw or heard of them again. When walking around campus, it is always awkward to see someone who you know only through Facebook and not at all in real life. There is that uncomfortable staring match where you are both thinking, “I know that person, but I’m not sure how. Did we meet at a party? Oh no, she’s staring at me, should I say hi? But I don’t know her name, what am I going to call her? Buddy? Friend?” Other times, adding people you don’t really know can lead to problems later on. Random people having access to all the information on your Facebook profile could lead to unwanted gossip or attention. Such situations can easily be avoided restraining yourself from clicking the mouse. Joe Schmoe who you don’t know wants to be your friend? Just say no to Joe!
People use Facebook for a wide variety of reasons, but one of the biggest draws of social networking is enriching relationships with people who, for some reason or another, you are unable to talk to face-to-face. While some people may find it easy to use Facebook as a substitute for real-life interaction, I believe it should only be used as a supplement. This doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with meeting people on Facebook before meeting them in person — the “class of” groups have been a tradition for many years, and they are a great way to connect with other students starting at Carnegie Mellon in the weeks or months before they come to campus. It is likely that students have already met a number of peers who they are going to be living with or having classes with this way.
These sort of interactions are a great way to get a head start on making friends at Carnegie Mellon, but meeting people on Facebook, even within the confines of campus groups, has its ups and downs and should be carried out with thought. Social networking is often used as a cure for social anxiety, but doing so can leave users vulnerable when it comes time to actually meet. It’s easy to become dependent on Facebook for social interaction, and those who spend too much time on Facebook or any other social networking site may have a more difficult time when it comes to interacting with people face-to-face. 
Do: Limit your time on Facebook. Nobody wants to be the person who lives vicariously through Facebook. You know the type of person I’m talking about: the one who likes every single status update, leaves pithy comments on all your pictures, and sends endless game requests and pokes. There are so many things to do at college and at Carnegie Mellon. Take these few college years and go join clubs, explore the city, and meet people — real people, not virtual ones. Build relationships, then maintain them with social networking sites like Facebook.

What do superheroes, school reform, and adolescence have in common? All were themes in movies filmed in Pittsburgh this summer: The Dark Knight Rises, the tentatively named Steel Town, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower, respectively, helped to cement the city’s growing reputation as the “Hollywood of the East.” The abundance of road closures that the films’ shooting caused might have been annoying, but the chance to catch a glimpse of Emma Watson or Anne Hathaway  seems to make the extra traffic worth it.
Filmings in Pittsburgh have brought more than just celebrities to the city, though — they have also brought new jobs. In addition to the opportunities for people to work as extras on the film, the Daily Mail reports that The Dark Knight Rises has created jobs in other, more unexpected ways. For example, local company Paul’s Lumber and Supply has been “flooded with orders” from the production crew, and the Renaissance Hotel was able to hire several additional housekeepers to work full-time while the cast and crew were staying there.
This is not the first year that movies have been filmed in Pittsburgh. Groundhog Day was filmed here in the 1990s, and the movie Smart People, starring Dennis Quaid, was actually set and filmed at Carnegie Mellon in 2006. Adventureland, starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, was filmed at Kennywood, and Zack and Miri Make a Porno was shot and set in Monroeville. The number of large blockbuster films that have been filmed here has been steadily increasing — *Unstoppable*, The Next Three Days, Love And Other Drugs, I Am Number Four, and Abduction were all recently filmed in Pittsburgh.
The Dark Knight Rises is, without a doubt, the most significant film to be filmed in the city. With an estimated budget of $250 million and a fanbase already dedicated to the movie franchise, The Dark Knight Rises already has the Daily Mail predicting that it will draw tourists to Pittsburgh once the movie has been released. It seems unlikely that the movie will generate that much tourism, though — after all, the fact that Pittsburgh is supposed to be Gotham City, a gloomy breeding ground for corruption and crime, might actually make people feel less inclined to visit. Instead of tourists, hopefully Christopher Nolan’s new movie will draw even more movie executives to Pittsburgh. The Dark Knight Rises might very well be the catalyst for a new, thriving industry in Pittsburgh: the movie industry.
There are, however,  larger questions that will affect its long-term growth. Gov. Tom Corbett will need to continue the film tax program, which grants production companies a 25 percent tax break if at least 60 percent of the costs occur in Pennsylvania.
