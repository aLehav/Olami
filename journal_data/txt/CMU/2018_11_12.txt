It’s the second quarter. Defensive end Long Tran checks into the game. The opposing quarterback scrambles to the right, with Tran in pursuit. He pushes the quarterback into the sideline, causing an interception. Tran’s teammates cheer him on at the end of the play.
That was two years ago, in a game against Washington University in St. Louis, when Tran was a sophomore. After spending most of his first year at Carnegie Mellon in the weight room and studying film, it was the moment when he felt he had graduated from high school football to college football. Tran, now a senior mechanical and biomedical engineering major, is a leader on the Tartan football team. Earlier this season, his career day versus Saint Vincent — finishing with three sacks for a loss of 23 yards and eight tackles, three solo — earned him University Athletic Association (UAA) honors for Defensive Player of the Week.
Tran started playing football in grade school and is now in his 13th year. From his first game, he was hooked. He hasn’t stopped playing since.
“I really enjoyed the game the first time I put pads on,” Tran said in an interview with The Tartan. “It was really a great experience because at that time, I’d never had any exposure to teams and goal-oriented stuff. It was really fun, getting to bond with other people and make friends in a unique way.”
Fast-forward a decade, and Tran was making decisions about his college future. Carnegie Mellon came calling, and he found a perfect fit. He had the chance to play collegiate-level football, as well as a great opportunity to pursue engineering, which he knew he wanted to do. But like any student athlete, balancing both academics and athletic responsibilities was a challenge for Tran, and something he has learned to do throughout his time at Carnegie Mellon.
“It’s definitely had its ups and downs. I try to prioritize: ‘Do I have energy enough to get the film study done? I know I have a test tomorrow, so how can I proportion [it] out?’” Tran said. “I definitely think I’ve improved, time management wise. I know when to push my limits…but I also know my peak limit. The athletic mindset really helps that. You just try to get the job done in whatever way you can.”
One of Tran’s biggest challenges came in his junior year. After fully participating in workouts the summer before the season, a heartbeat reading showed that Tran had an irregular heartbeat. He was soon diagnosed with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — extra heartbeats that disrupt regular heart rhythm. While PVCs are common and often cause few symptoms, further tests revealed that Tran had PVCs at an especially high rate and that his cardiac output was abnormally low. He underwent a cardiac ablation procedure, which sidelined lined him for the entire 2017 season.
“That was really one of the rougher periods,” he said. “That was a roller coaster ride of a semester. Luckily, I got through it, I recovered very well, and I’m back on the field this year. Luckily, I had a great group of guys and coaches that helped me get through that.”
Off the field, Tran is president of Plaidvocates, a studentathlete-run organization that focuses on being a peerto-peer support team, helping fellow student athletes balance academic and athletic life. Every team at Carnegie Mellon has representatives from Plaidvocates; Tran is one for the football team in addition to being president of the organization.
“I definitely appreciate the people who helped me and spoke to me and took time out of their day to get me through what I dealt with last [year], and to see that reciprocated through this organization really is something I’m really proud of,” he said.
Alongside his mechanical and biomedical engineering coursework, Tran has also done research for various professors and labs on campus. Currently, he is working on a modular snake medical robot for his CIT Honors Research. Its purpose is to be used during surgical procedures in minimally invasive ways. With the robotics component, the snake can access the vessels in the body through a less invasive hole.
Looking to the future beyond his senior year, Tran is interested in pursuing an integrated master’s degree from the mechanical engineering department, though he is also open to working in the surgical robotics field. Because he took a medical redshirt year to recover from his heart condition, Tran has one year of athletic eligibility left to play football at Carnegie Mellon. Football has been part of his life for so long, and the integrated master’s program is an opportunity to play football for one final year.
“I think my favorite thing about the football is just the competitiveness,” Tran said. “I’m a highly competitive person. On the field, it’s a very competitive mindset. I try to pump up the guys every time before the first snap of the game. We’re out here for one job, one job only, and that’s to win. We’ll get it done. It’s a source of pride.”
With the final game of the season against Geneva this Saturday, Nov. 17, Tran looks to go out with a win.

On Oct. 27, the entire soccer world suffered an incredible loss when Thai multi-billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabbha, owner and chairman of Leicester City F.C., was killed in a helicopter crash. The widely adored sixty-year-old had been the chairman of the English Premier League soccer club since the company King Power, of which he was founder and CEO, purchased the club back in 2010.
At that time, Leicester City had just been relegated to play the 2008-09 season in the third tier of English soccer, having never played below the second tier before that. Their meteoric rise to fame and success in the years that followed has been largely credited to the impetus given by Vichai’s new ownership. His death, and those of three others in the helicopter, came as he left the club’s stadium after a game a few weeks ago, and the entire city of Leicester mourned with the rest of the soccer world.
Six years after slogging it in the third tier of English soccer, Leicester made it to the Premier League in 2014, reaching England’s top flight of soccer. With only nine of the 38 games left to play, and only four wins of the previous 29 games, Leicester sat at the bottom of the table, seemingly destined for relegation, ending their short spell in this elite tier. An unforeseeable turnaround saw them win eight of the last nine games and thus maintain their position in the league, but the celebrations were cut short when the manager, who’d garnered heroic status with the fans, decided to quit his job that summer.
The next season, to most Premier League viewers’ surprise, took off fairly well for the Foxes (as they are nicknamed), with players Riyadh Mahrez, N’golo Kante, and especially forward Jamie Vardy exploding onto the scene as top-class players. New manager Claudio Ranieri found a real rhythm, and Leicester City found themselves in the fifth position, having lost only one game 10 games into the season. Though unexpected it wasn’t uncommon for a weaker team to start well like this in the Premier League, and all expected and awaited the eventual dip in form. As the season progressed, Leicester City became the fairytale heroes, somehow managing to maintain this form and fight for a place in the top two.
The world was rooting for this underdog team. They were given a 5000/1 outside odds of winning the title, lower than each of the other 19 clubs, yet they were flying high. In May 2016, Chelsea scored an equalizing goal against Tottenham Hotspur, determining that no club could mathematically reach Leicester’s points tally in the remaining three games, crowning them champions. It was a celebration of the sheer impossible becoming true. Leicester City gave the world a story of hope, that the underdog team could overcome the traditional top teams like Manchester United or Arsenal. It was a miraculous win showcasing the true unpredictability of sport.
Years prior at Vichai’s inauguration as chairman he stated he would make Leicester a top-five club, to much disbelief from both Leicester City fans themselves and the soccer world. In being an integral part of achieving this dream, he became more than just any other chairman to the fans. In just eight years, he had embedded himself into the city, where the millions he poured into the football club were matched by his philanthropic efforts, donating millions to various local charities, social development programs, and the local hospital to aid improvements to a city that he embraced.
A man remembered by many as being the one behind the counters at the stadium serving free doughnuts and beer to the fans, he truly became a man of the people succeeded in creating something magical for. For Leicester fans, it was the little things that made Vichai the face of generosity and benevolence, it is what uplifted the entire sports community and had everyone celebrating with him and his club in their successes.
His untimely departure is tragic, but his legacy has already taken shape; Leicester City announced he will be honored with a statue outside the stadium. In the days after the accident, fans placed flowers and jerseys and personal mementos outside the stadium in remembrance. In the new age of sports dominated by solely monetary goals and functions, Vichai brought something personal to the pitch. In this moment of shock and sadness Leicester City fans remember the happiness and hope that was brought to the sporting community by a man, his club, and his endeavor.

The 2018 Major League Baseball free agents include superstars like Bryce Harper, Patrick Corbin, or Manny Machado. Normally, players like those three bounce around the top of the league, but rumors say that teams that spent their time during the 2018 season at the bottom could attempt to make a big move to increase their chances of making it to the postseason next year.
Like always, the big names will take up most of the media attention, but following the moves of smaller market teams, like the Pittsburgh Pirates, is still worth doing. Aside from declining Josh Harrison’s option, the only other move of notice that the Bucs have made is their signing of Jung-Ho Kang to a one-year contract. That move alone gives the Pirates a bit more depth on the right side of the infield, which is one of their most glaring needs for 2019, as veteran shortstop Jordy Mercer became a free agent and rookie Colin Moran struggled through the majority of his 2018 season at third base.
There’s still more work to do, of course. With Gregory Polanco out for the first half of the season while he recovers from a shoulder injury, along with Edgar Santana and Chad Kuhl losing the entirety of the 2019 season to Tommy John surgery, the Pirates have more than a few holes in their lineup. The glaring one was in the infield, where rookies Kevin Kramer and Kevin Newman look replacement-level at best in their month with the club in September. Neither corner infielder, Moran or Josh Bell, showed the power that top management expected from them.
The Kang signing helps on the left, and Bell likely just fell into a bit of a sophomore slump, so the concern is not about first base, but the middle infield is worrisome. Adam Frazier may end up filling a role in right field and on second base, but manager Clint Hurdle said that he was likely going to stick at second base, so a veteran signing in someone like Manny Machado would fill that void and more. The Pirates aren’t the kind of team to spend so much money on one player, so someone like Brian Dozier might help out in Pittsburgh. His market value isn’t going to be too high, especially with the top players already in this blockbuster free agent market, and he could be signed for multiple years, supplying a solid defense.
Right field is also an interesting spot for the Pirates. They could take the leap and try to shake things up with a vet signing there like Matt Joyce, who enjoyed a stint with the club in 2016, one of the best of his career. Perhaps a guy like Hunter Pence from the San Francisco Giants would do well in the smaller right field at PNC Park. In terms of signing more players for the outfield, re-signing Corey Dickerson to a multi-year deal here might be prudent.
The Yankees have mentioned that they’re giving up on the much-maligned and inconsistent pitcher Sonny Gray, and New York has dealt the Pirates players like that in the past, ones they’ve seen enough from and are willing to dump for some prospects. Francisco Cervelli and Ivan Nova come to mind. Trading some assets for a guy with that much upside would go a long way to solidifying our rotation if our other starters goes down. The Bucs bullpen looks to be solid, in my opinion.
If the Pirates end up doing something in free agency, I’ll be surprised, but seeing as they traded for Chris Archer and Keone Kela at the deadline this past season, it might be a new leaf for the Buccos. After the unloading of Andrew McCutchen and Gerrit Cole last offseason, we’ll just have to wait and see what they end up doing. The Pirates might push the envelope and try to win this season, who knows?

This is the first week of The Tartan’s brand spanking new sports column, Penalty Shouts. Drawing inspiration from The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts, this satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world. The column will be a short piece each week — we would never interrupt the regularly scheduled programming of The Tartan — about something, or somebody, in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Our first Penalty Shout goes out to J.R. Smith for publicly discussing a potential trade from the Cavaliers, in spite of the NBA’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Smith did an interview after another game spent on the bench smoking a joint, and with bright, red eyes and a bushy tail, he said, “I deserve to play, I need to be traded.” The 33-year-old shooting guard averages seven points a game in seven games played this season; his contract is worth $14.5 million, and the three-point shooting and controversy-sparking player has hit only a third of his threes so far this season.
Smith started his first game of the season last Wednesday against the Thunder. The veteran had to earn his way back into the jam-packed, young roster of the Cavaliers, which features huge names, like Cedi Osman. In the game, he showed why the team needed him after missing a few threes, and frankly, the team is infinitely better with him, at least on the bench. That way, Smith can shout “Kobe!” whenever sharpshooter Jordan Clarkson shoots a deep fade-away two that caroms into the front row.
That said, it’s important for Smith to find happiness with, or without, the Cavaliers. Over the years, we’ve seen what happens when he doesn’t want to play for a team — take the Zhejiang Golden Bulls of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), for example. In the lockout season of 2011, Smith played for the Golden Bulls, but his agent “forgot” to include an opt-out clause in the contract for him to return to American basketball.
Now, Smith is stuck on the bench for a team that doesn’t see his true potential as the next (but older) Stephen Curry. Who else is going to shoot that many threes a game? J.R. can. Smith currently isn’t utilized to the fullest extent of his ability, and so he is fairly demanding the Cavaliers trade him to a team that will value his skills as the best player to towel sweat off Lebron’s forehead.
The public statement of the trade is what got Smith into trouble with the league. Players before Smith have talked to their team’s front office, but it takes a real dunderhead to actually tell the press, “I want a trade.” Even Timberwolves forward Jimmy Butler has worked his way around the system, playing the league’s coy mistress to Smith’s bumbling buffoon. Eventually, by way of fax, the league office heard about the incident, and balded NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver, started a rumor about the threat of a fine.
After hearing the threat to fine Smith for violating the collective bargaining agreement, Smith said, “Let him fine me. I’ll land a plane on his beautiful, bald, waxed head.” For the record, a plane could not land on Silver’s head. Other players around the league had comments to make the rumor of a fine for Smith. Butler said, “I would never publicly ask for a trade, but I wouldn’t mind if the Timberwolves sent my contract to another team in a series of roster changes for a player to be named later.” Boston Celtics point guard (and ex-teammate of Smith) Kyrie Irving asked, “How does the trade carousel work if the Earth is flat?” Another old teammate, Lebron James, now playing with the Lakers, had only one thing to say about the incident: “Who?”

Greetings from first-time Fantasy Football loser and Pillbox Editor, Michelle Madlansacay! I’m here today to give you all a recap of Week 9 for our Tartan Fantasy Football League. My team, mmichelle123, was the only one that moved down in ranking this week (which is cool with me), while Publisher Caleb Miller kept his team, Last Manning Standing, in first. Following him are Visual Editor Tracy Le’s futbol and Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s GOAT But Ironically who kept their spots in second and third place, respectively. Sports Editor Marika Yang’s Gin and Bear It moved up a spot to seventh place, sadly bumping me down to eighth and last place.
Aside from my team’s misfortune, the past week overall has been pretty exciting for our Fantasy League.
Last Manning Standing over GOAT But Ironically, 112.52 to 92.68
Last Manning Standing now has an overall record of 7-2, while GOAT But Ironically’s record drops to 5-4. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara looks like someone to watch out for on Last Manning Standing, since his leading 29.60 points helped bring Miller’s team to victory. Miller also had some other players with abnormally high fantasy points this week, like Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick with 24.02 points and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce with 21.90 points.
The losing team, Sio’s GOAT But Ironically, unfortunately didn’t have nearly as many high scoring players this week, with only Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes scoring above 20 points this week with 26.80 points. Three other offensive players all scored below ten points, and Sio’s Baltimore Ravens defense only scored one point, contributing to her team’s loss this round.
futbol over Slugs, 129.98 to 92.96
In their second matchup against Operation Manager Adam Tunnard’s Slugs, Le’s futbol yet again finishes with a win, bringing their overall record to 6-3 and bumping down Slugs’ record to 4-5. It was futbol’s Chicago Bears defense who really led the team to victory this week, scoring 28 points. Individual players on Le’s team put up solid performances, with Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton scoring 21.18 points, Julio Jones with 18.10 points, George Kittle with 16.80 points, and Nick Chubb with 15 points.
The losing team, Tunnard’s team Slugs, had no players score above 20 points, which probably explains the team’s loss this week. Slugs’ defense, of the Jacksonville Jaguars, and kicker, Jake Elliot of the Philadelphia Eagles together had a total fantasy score of zero points. It was an unlucky week for Slugs (but not as unlucky as my week).
TARTAN FANTASY over newz, 127.22 to 80.26
Three players led Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s team, TARTAN FANTASY, to a big win this week, beating News Editor Nora Mattson’s team, newz by 46.96 points. Those players were Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas, and Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, who in total scored an impressive 75.12 points.
Mattson’s newz did have one big scorer this week: Atlanta Falcons running back Tevin Coleman who scored 27.6 points. Tennessee Titans running back Dion Lewis and Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins had the second and third highest scores of 18.20 and 16.50, respectively. Unfortunately, newz had two players who scored a total of 0 points this week, definitely contributing to the loss.
Gin and Bear It over mmichelle123, 99.44 to 79.16
Ah, finally we’ve come to the part of the recap where I tell you all about my devastating misfortune: losing to Yang’s team Gin and Bear It by 20.28 points. I’m not sure where things went wrong, but I do know that Gin and Bear It has this guy named Jared Goff, Rams quarterback, score a total of 29.34 points. I guess that’s impressive. This, without a doubt, is what led to Yang’s victory, since all the other players on her team scored below twenty points, with four of them scoring below ten points. Gin and Bear It’s kicker, Justin Tucker of the Ravens, and defense of the New York Jets did, however, score pretty well with 10 and 8 points, respectively.
My team just had a really bad week. My highest scorer was Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, who only scored 10.20 points, while the rest…well I’d rather not talk about it. But, my kicker, Saints’ Wil Lutz and my defense, of the Minnesota Vikings, did score a combined 33 points. Unfortunately, these scores weren’t enough to save me from the bottom ranking this week; Yang’s team moves up while I take its place at the bottom of the standing. But it’s all good! Hopefully next week will go better!
Anyway, tune in next week for another Tartan Fantasy Football recap from the week’s biggest loser! Le’s team futbol will take Miller’s league-leading Last Manning Standing, Tunnard’s Slugs and Sio’s GOAT but Ironically will square off against each other, Mattson’s newz will play Yang’s Gin and Bear It, while I will try to get out of the bottom versus Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY.

“The thing with science is that you can’t just do it from a cold, hard perspective,” says Andrew Wolff, a biology PhD student in the Mellon College of Science. “It’s very tied to your own personal beliefs.”
Objectivity — the removal of all personal bias from an experimental setting — is central to scientific research. Practically, however, experiments are designed by humans, algorithms are written by humans, and journal articles are edited and approved by humans. A researcher’s perspective inevitably influences their work. 
Unfortunately, in STEM, all perspectives are not always equal.
We’ve long been culturally aware of the challenges that women face in scientific research, and there’s a general understanding of the prejudice people of color face in STEM fields. The experiences of LGBTQ+ people in science are much less well known, for various reasons: While the numbers of other underrepresented groups in STEM are increasing, queer researchers have always been present, as long as they managed to hide their identity. There has also been significantly less research into LGBTQ+ experiences in STEM.
However, as academic research and cultural awareness have caught up over the past ten years or so, LGBTQ+ scientists have rapidly become more visible.
Organizations advocating for LGBTQ+ scientific researchers have existed for decades — NOGLSTP, for example — but thanks to technology and heightened societal awareness, LGBTQ+ scientists are networking more than ever before. oSTEM (Out in STEM), a chapter-based professional organization for LGBTQ+ researchers founded in 2009, now has chapters at over 75 universities. The Queer in STEM Project has tackled the lack of quantitative data on the LGBTQ+ STEM experience by surveying queer researchers about their experiences, in the U.S. and worldwide.
The internet has provided space not just for advocacy, but community. “With the rise of social media, and especially Twitter, as a field for academics, it’s a lot easier to maintain connections with other queer civil engineers, follow each other, and talk,” says Daniel Gingerich, a postdoctoral researcher in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Many research fields and institutions now have online “Out Lists” that serve as a kind of directory that LGBTQ+ academics can use to connect or seek out mentorship.
Increasing LGBTQ+ visibility is incredibly important for future scientists: The National School Climate Survey conducted by GLSEN (an organization that advocates for LGBTQ+ issues in K-12 education) found in 2013 that high schoolers whose science classes positively addressed LGBTQ+ topics were twice as likely to enter STEM majors in college — but in 2015, only 3 percent of the 10,000 high school students surveyed had seen positive representation of LGBTQ-related topics in science class.
Visibility — and awareness — is equally important for those already working in STEM, who often experience homophobia and transphobia that comes from a place of ignorance. “As a PhD I had several conflate my sexuality with pedophilia and insinuate that I would have difficulty finding a job because I was a kind of sexual deviant,” explains Chase Mendenhall, Assistant Curator of Birds, Ecology, and Conservation at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 
Sarah Frisco, a PhD student in materials science, says of their experiences in chemistry research, “There were a lot of ‘bro-y’ guys making rape jokes, and I was like, this is not where I’m gonna discuss queer identity...In the place where I worked after [undergrad], I was the only person who could be read female in the whole company, and it was the same situation. Rape jokes, fat jokes, gay jokes, all of it.”
Much of the discrimination and discomfort LGBTQ+ researchers face can be ascribed to the hypermasculine climate in many scientific fields. A 2013 study found that LGBTQ+ scientists were more likely to be open about their identities when they worked in fields with more women, such as biology. “In Yellowstone, where I did a lot of work, wolves and bears were for the macho mountain men, while birds and butterflies were for women and others,” explains Mendenhall. “I have always depended on women to help me navigate hostile environments of toxic masculinity — especially in the field where safety is a concern.”
In highly masculine environments, it’s easy to be ostracized even when there’s no active prejudice at work. “It was difficult for me to socialize because it was just a bunch of straight guys,” explains a PhD student in computer science who asked to remain anonymous. “Like they would talk about girls, they would talk about cricket…You feel like you’re missing out on opportunities because you’re not able to socialize with them the way they’re able to do it with each other; you’re not able to connect with them. I just never felt like I was a part of the group.”
However, it isn’t really the presence of straight men that causes LGBTQ+ researchers to feel excluded. A study published in March of this year found that gay and bisexual men who begin their academic careers in STEM fields are less likely to persist in STEM than heterosexual men, but lesbians and bisexual women are more likely to continue in STEM than straight women. Many researchers believe this shows that it’s not necessarily just women being devalued in STEM, but femininity — or anyone perceived as feminine.
Most LGBTQ+ scientists are very conscious of animosity toward traditional femininity — especially trans researchers, who usually have a heightened awareness of gender presentation. Many nonbinary scientists feel an obligation to externally present or identify as more feminine, to push back against the male-dominated environment. “I’ve met a lot of younger women who aren’t sure whether or not to be in STEM, and they’re like, ‘but I see you’re doing it’,” says Frisco. “I want to inspire you, but what you’re seeing isn’t necessarily what I am…When trying to make my own decisions about gender, it’s very hard to do that individually.”
Everyone who’s part of a group historically excluded from STEM research experiences marginalization differently, and many people experience it on several fronts. One of the earlier large-scale surveys of queer researchers — the American Physical Society’s 2016 LGBT+ Climate in Physics Report — found that among LGBTQ+ physicists (particularly among trans researchers), people of color and women were the most likely to experience compounded prejudice and harassment. LGBTQ+ researchers who aren’t U.S. citizens also have more considerations to balance, trying to stay safe and in good legal standing in both the U.S. and their countries of origin, while still affirming their identity.
The frequency of overlapping marginalized identities also has a positive side: when one group fights prejudice, other groups usually stand to benefit as well.
Vivian Miranda, a postdoctoral researcher in the University of Arizona’s Department of Astronomy, recounts one of her first academic presentations after coming out as a trans woman. When she asked her cis colleagues for advice on professional attire, she “was shocked that even the most well-known women in my field feared using dresses while presenting a seminar” in order to be taken more seriously. “I decided to retribute...I picked my best dress, and I presented wearing it — I could see my colleagues were cheering for me. I had just broken a new barrier [for] all of us.”
In her previous position at the University of Pennsylvania, Miranda encountered one of the most common obstacles for trans researchers: the university refused to update her name on her university ID card or in the HR system. Diana Parno, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s physics department, is a straight, cisgender woman who changed her name when she married and had the exact same problem as Miranda. “It’s been more than ten years and my whole scientific reputation has been built with my new name, but I have still had to have some extremely frustrating arguments with IT departments to get a professional username change — and with one, I’ve given up. How much worse it would be if the old name brought up symptoms of gender dysphoria!” 
Parno, a particle physicist who studies neutrinos, was a lead writer for the second edition of the Best Practices Guide for LGBTQ+ Inclusivity in Physics and Astronomy, published in April. The document gives guidelines for ensuring the research environment is safe, welcoming, and accessible to LGBTQ+ physicists at many levels of academia, from the classroom to the department to the institution. (The guidelines are not necessarily specific to the field of physics).
“Little things are important for two reasons,” explains Parno. “First, though they may not seem big on a grand policy scale, they can be very significant to the individuals experiencing them. Second, little things add up to really shape the overall climate.”
Wolff, an officer for ALLIES Grad, has seen how traditional biological terminology can ‘other’ LGBTQ+ scientists, particularly when talking about gender. “People that talk about mutations, or mutants — along the lines of like, sex determination — they usually refer to it in a negative context." He believes that open discussions on how words can be used differently can make a research environment much more inclusive.
Even in physics, hypothetically much more removed from human affairs, language makes a difference. “There are two research communities in particle physics whose traditional acronyms included the slur f**,” says Parno. “It was a coincidence that the slurs were there, but that didn’t make it any less of an ugly surprise for many scientists when they came across it. After years of pushback, in the last year both communities are moving away from these acronyms.”
Explicit acknowledgement of LGBTQ+ researchers in university policy still isn’t the standard. Often, departments that are hiring ask women and racial and ethnic minorities to apply, but don’t explicitly encourage LGBTQ+ applicants. While this omission is likely because the research on LGBTQ+ exclusion in STEM is much more recent and not as well known, it can leave academic job seekers wondering whether they’re heading into a homophobic or transphobic environment.
Many queer researchers express frustration at the lack of awareness of how being LGBTQ+ can impact a research career, even in the most welcoming settings. “As a queer person, you have to deal with a lot more things,” explains the computer science researcher. “It’s not just the fact that you’re working on difficult [research]... Your personal life is going to occupy some amount of your time and energy, and that is going to eat away from the time and energy you can give to your work.” While anyone can have personal difficulties, LGBTQ+ scientists frequently encounter obstacles that might not even occur to those outside the queer community.
After giving a talk, Miranda describes being asked if she knew a certain male PhD student, and realizing that the person was referring to her, pre-transition. “I had to explain that I was that student! No problem in the end — the person was quite sweet and thoughtful — but it reminded me that my career would be broken in half permanently. All the friendly interactions that I had in the past and that was important to project my name in the field will not be automatically translated to my new identity.”
However, most agree that visibility within the STEM community is increasing — and science itself is becoming more inclusive.
Mendenhall explains, “During my PhD I was fortunate enough to work and teach with Stanford professor Joan Roughgarden,” a trans biologist who challenged traditional ideas of sex and gender in nature. “Her research and teaching pioneered a new narrative of inclusive evolutionary biology...Roughgarden argues that sex evolved to generate diversity and diversity is beneficial and critical for the process of natural selection.”
In the same way, Mendenhall argues, diversity is critical for the advancement of science — a view increasingly common among researchers. “Science advances fastest when scientists are free to apply their intelligence and imagination to the exploration of the universe without limits and without fear,” reads the physics inclusivity guide.
Retaining scientists from diverse backgrounds will take some big changes, and a lot of small ones, says Parno. “Pushing for more inclusive and welcoming study groups. Allowing academic travel by train or car, where possible, even if it takes longer, because encounters with the TSA are so fraught for many trans people. Facilitating author name changes on previously published papers.”
Inclusive policies in the academic environment are crucial, but they can’t be effective unless they’re supported by the culture. “Students have a huge impact on the social environment,” says Parno. “My advice is to be openly inclusive and thoughtful — if you are concerned about making sure the environment is a good one for your LGBTQ peers, you are on the right path. Don’t assume that your male labmate is looking for a girlfriend, or your female study partner a boyfriend.
“Welcome people who aren’t like you into your study group; you may make new friends.”

Are people naturally violent? Can religious factors create anxiety between groups that leads to violence?
These are the questions that a new study in The Journal for Artificial Societies and Social Simulation sought to answer. A team of researchers from the University of Oxford, Boston University, and the University of Agder in Norway combined computer modeling and cognitive psychology to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) that emulated human religious behaviors in order to understand the conditions, triggers, and patterns of religious violence.
For the first time, multi-agent AI is being used to create psychologically realistic computer models in research. Justin E. Lane, a member of the research team, noted the computational advancement this study represents over previous applications of AI. “99 [percent] of the general public are most familiar with AI that uses machine learning to automate human tasks like — classifying something, such as tweets to be positive or negative etc., but our study uses something called multi-agent AI to create a psychologically realistic model of a human, for example — how do they think, and particularly how do we identify with groups? Why would someone identify as Christian, Jewish or Muslim etc. Essentially, how do our personal beliefs align with how a group defines itself?”
Applying theoretical cognitive psychology literature  allowed the team to translate the workings of the human mind into a computer program, specifically how humans process information and compare it to their personal experiences. The simulated environment contained millions of AI-based human agents with differing characteristics like age and ethnicity. While everyday tasks such as working and studying were not emulated, the simulation included the possibility of environmental hazards like disasters and disease, as well as groups of individuals interacting with each other.
The study reveals that humans are naturally peaceful, but can be willing to engage in or endorse violence when others go against core beliefs defining their identity. Long periods of mutually escalating tensions between social groups occur due to outlier members, who deny a group’s core beliefs or values and overwhelm other individuals. In general, anxiety and agitation arises when people feel that their belief systems are challenged. However, the simulation found that anxiety led to violence in just 20 percent of scenarios triggered by individuals contradicting group identity, leaving the cause of other violent engagements a mystery.
Lane said, “Ultimately, to use AI to study religion or culture, we have to look at modeling human psychology because our psychology is the foundation for religion and culture, so the root causes of things like religious violence rest in how our minds process the information that our world presents it.”

When you think of an alien, you probably picture a little gray man in a skintight jumpsuit piloting a flying saucer, not an amorphous, cigar-shaped hunk of rock hurtling through our solar system.
Scientists studying the mysterious interstellar object ‘Oumuamua, didn’t make that connection either until Avi Loeb, chair of Harvard’s astronomy department, suggested it. Though not many took him seriously, given how much uncertainty surrounds this visitor from outer space, Loeb is not backing down.
‘Oumuamua, a Hawaiian name that roughly means "first distant messenger," is an asteroid first discovered on Oct. 19, 2017, and it’s been puzzling researchers ever since. Not only was its trajectory unlike anything previously encountered,  but it displayed some strange behavior that made it difficult to classify. Observers first classified it as a comet, but it was quickly changed to an asteroid because there was no coma, the glowing “envelope” surrounding the body of the comet due to the sublimation of ice caused by the sun. Researchers later changed it back to a comet because the object displayed strange accelerations that couldn’t be explained by gravity alone, indicating that something must be coming out of the comet.
Loeb offers an alternative explanation that would neatly answer all the questions about ‘Oumuamua, if it weren't so implausible. According to Loeb's paper, the object is a piece of debris from a destroyed alien probe powered by a theoretical solar sail, a propulsion technology based on the idea of harnessing the radiation emitted by stars. Over time, a solar sail could generate enough velocity to exit a solar system.
‘Oumuamua could be a busted up alien probe gliding through space on a solar sail, or it could be an unexplainable low-activity comet. There’s no way of verifying either way, because ‘Oumuamua has long since left our solar system. In fact, because its proposed size and shape were off estimation, no one could even get a good photo.
Though our interstellar visitor is gone, the debate over its classification remains, and a year later, is still going strong. Loeb’s theory has taken the media by storm, the widespread coverage leading to the spread of rumors and sensationalist content.
Predictably, astronomers aren’t thrilled about this. As Benjamin Weiner of the University of Arizona expressed in a tweet this past Wednesday, Loeb’s speculation does a disservice to the scientific community, with scientists now working overtime to stop the spread of false information. In a time when science is often decried as fake news (think about all those global warming deniers), these frustrations are understandable.
Whatever you may think about ‘Oumuamua, its brief visit reminds us all that the universe is astoundingly large, and that we are but a single speck of dust in a cosmic ocean. Who knows? Maybe there are aliens out there, launching more probes as we speak.

Tisbert Sketch Comedy presented their show Let’s Get Hitched this past weekend in the Cohon Center Studio Theater, and it was a hit! One of the best aspects of the show was how the main wedding sketches were intertwined with various absurd and hilarious sketches, dealing with topics ranging from losing Santa Claus to epic laser tag battles to church. The audience participation made for an entertaining addition to the already amusing performance.
One of the most notable sketches, and one of my personal favorites, had to have been the family photo. This sketch dealt with the all too familiar situation of taking a family photo with a little more absurdity added in. The characters portrayed in the scene added to the amusement: with a father and a mother (Zivan Vasquez and Katherine Sabel) who fought like crazy, a bored daughter (Amber Quinn), an overenthusiastic son (Thomas von Davier), and a very uptight photographer (Grant Seastream), what could go wrong?
Another sketch, as mentioned before, dealt with a nonexistent Santa Claus. The two Santa elves (Zivan Vasquez and Katherine Sabel) broke the fourth wall and went in search of a worthy audience member to be Santa. After the selection, the audience member came down onstage and put on a Santa hat, and the kids filed in one by one. Two kids (Grant Seastream and Amber Quinn) had their own problems coming in to see Santa Claus. This posed a particularly sticky situation to the audience member. The end was a bizarre twist of events in which the Easter Bunny (Thomas von Davier) crashed the party and the sketch went into mayhem!
The wedding sketches, the center focus of the production, were very well thought out. They commented on some seemingly relatable and some very preposterous scenarios. From a dare to object to the wedding, a flower girl eating the petals, and a particularly hilarious youth pastor (Zivan Vasquez) officiating the wedding, these sketches had it all. The couple, Cynthia and Doug (Amber Quinn and Thomas von Davier), finally got married at the end, after dodging the crazy maid of honor, Kourtney (Katherine Sabel), and the silly best man, Dave (Grant Seastream), bringing the show full circle among its crazy scenarios.
Overall, the performance was incredibly enjoyable, brought out lots of laughs and was very charming. Bravo Tisbert!

When we hear “break up song,” we tend of think of cheating, wistfulness, grief, and Taylor Swift. Most breakup songs are filled with pain, some embodying the audio equivalent of a wave of sadness, and others embodying vengeance and vindication towards an unfaithful ex (Carrie Underwood’s “Before He Cheats,” anyone?). But little do we hear a breakup song about acceptance — about what comes after the pain, the denial, and the anger. And Ariana Grande’s newest single “thank u, next” is ushering in a new era of break up songs that celebrate self-love, strength, and personal growth.
“thank u, next” was released just months after her incredibly successful fourth album, Sweetener. While the title of the song may appear petty or dismissive, the song is anything but – Grande is gracious and kind, thanking her exes for teaching her how to be patient, how to love, and how to deal with pain. While it’s difficult to imagine thanking your exes, particularly those that bring painful experiences back to mind, Grande has taken the difficulty out of it. Rather than drone melancholically, she celebrates her own personal growth and her ability to use those painful experiences to become a kinder, more loving person.
The song is filled with Ariana Grande trademarks — floaty vocals, tight harmonies, and an almost bouncy accompanying beat. It is happy and celebratory — the kind of song you would sing with your best friends in your living room after a hard day. It is both intimate and vulnerable in its emotion and public with its message of personal growth, a balance that’s often difficult to achieve (especially in mainstream pop). While we may not expect a breakup song from Grande, we may have expected something more somber and ballad-like, especially given her recent breakup with ex-fiance Pete Davidson. But “thank u, next” is one of few pop songs that’s actually focused on celebrating yourself after the period of re-building and re-learning after a relationship. The most impactful line of the song deals with exactly that: “*I met someone else, We havin' better discussions. I know they say I move on too fast, But this one gon' last, 'Cause her name is Ari, And I'm so good with that.*”
The past 18 months have been incredibly difficult for Grande — the suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester, her break up with Pittsburgh-native rapper Mac Miller and his deeply tragic death, and her break up with ex-fiancé Pete Davidson. It’s difficult to imagine how someone who’s been through so much at such a young age could be so full of love, and yet here she is — emerging stronger than ever by revealing her vulnerability and bettering herself from her experiences. It is a testament to her true strength, of being able to not only move on but to feel empowered and loved in her choices and relationships. It is so inspirational and astounding to see her bounce back and thrive after such encompassing periods of grief. She sings with a clear smile in her voice, “*I’ve got so much love, I’ve got so much patience, I’ve learned from the pain, I turned out amazing. I’ve loved and I’ve lost, but that’s not what I see. ‘Cause look what I’ve found, there’s no need for searching.*”
For the difficult year that much of the world has had, it’s almost as if Grande knew this is what the world needed. This song is a message of female empowerment. It displays incredible presence and self-awareness while simultaneously infecting the listener with a fun beat. In the face of tragedy, Ariana Grande’s new single is filled with unfettered and almost impossible optimism. It is a song that serves as a band-aid for the heart, reminding the listener that sometimes the process of bettering yourself is what’s really important. Grande tweeted on Nov. 11, “what an interesting, challenging, painful and yet beautiful and exciting chapter of life ….. when it rains it pours but I’m embracing all of it. I’m excited for whatever else the universe has in store for me. She’s growing n she’s grateful.” As someone who admires and respects her for making the art that she did, “I’m so f**kin’ grateful” for this song.

I’m always in the mood for trying new restaurants, but like everyone, I have my favorite spots that I know won’t let me down. We need these restaurants — places we bring our family when they visit, places we always go to with specific people, places that fit a certain mood or appetite. For me, one of those places is Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33, better known as just Cafe 33, which satisfies all of those different situations. I’ve taken my parents there, I’ve gone there to catch up with friends, and it’s my go-to spot for consistently good Taiwanese food.
Cafe 33 is in Squirrel Hill, at the intersection of Forbes and Shady Avenues. Take any 61 bus, and you’ll get within a block of the restaurant. After, if you miraculously have room in your stomach left, walk down Forbes or Murray Avenue for Cold Stone or Waffallonia.
Cafe 33 is small, unassuming, and easy to miss, but just look next to the large Starbucks. Inside, the single room is small and casual — nothing fancy. A converted laundromat, it only seats forty people, so be careful if you’re venturing in a busy rush-hour meal time. You’ll see a wide variety of patrons, some getting an authentic taste of home or others trying something new. Many of my friends from Taiwan say this is the best place in Pittsburgh for Taiwanese food. If you’re not sure how Taiwanese cuisine is different from Chinese food, this is the place to go to see for yourself.
Of course, the star of the place is the food. The menu offers so many choices, it can be overwhelming: a multitude of seafood, chicken, pork, beef, and vegetable entrees and select dishes over rice, as well as a long list of noodle soups. I highly recommend anything on the “Over Rice” menu, but my favorite is the Fried Chicken Cutlet Over Rice ($8.50). The chicken is crispy and juicy all at once, and goes perfectly with the side salad and hard-boiled tea egg. If you’re not in the mood for chicken, try the Pork Chop ($8.50) or Minced Braised Pork ($8), both over rice.
On the other side of the menu, Cafe 33 has twenty-six different noodle and noodle soup choices, and I can’t say you can go wrong with any of them. There are the familiar Lo Mein options next to the more traditional Taiwanese Pan Fried or Chow Fun dishes. I’m a fan of the Cafe 33 Special Thick Noodle Soup ($11), which comes with a lot of fish in a hearty broth.
Cafe 33 is close to campus and decently priced, but most importantly, the food is consistently great. The service is simple and clinical, but gets the job done. If you’re looking to give a new place a try, you might soon find this place on your own eatery go-to list, just like how it crept up on mine.

This article contains spoilers for the School of Drama's production of Dutchman. 
Dutchman joins this year’s exclusive club of “what on earth did I just watch?” The play is centered around two characters, Lula and Clay, who interact mostly on a subway for the entirety of the play. Dutchman is one of those productions that is hard to talk about without spoiling because the story is one long conversation split up by a bizarre dance/party sequence in the middle.
There are three kinds of people who watch plays: those who don’t get it at all, those who know everything and make fun of the play for being predictable, and those who are with the play the whole time and are intrigued, even if they don’t fully understand it. Dutchman is one of those plays where it’s hard for the audience to fall into the first two categories. 
It wasn’t until the end that it made sense, that the play is a metaphor for interracial relations and black identity in the United States. Clay is a representative of the mild-mannered black man, while Lula represents the pressure from white society, trying in various ways to goad Clay into an intense reaction, such as pretending to understand black culture, calling Clay several racial slurs, or telling Clay to stop being complacent by trying to fit into white culture. Clay snaps and goes into a thoughtful monologue on how African American culture silently represses generations of rage, and if African Americans were to act rationally they would just kill all whites to end their oppression. He no longer knows whether it’s the silent rage or the repression of that rage that takes a greater toll on black identity. It’s a bold statement, one that was written decades ago during the Civil Rights era and holds just as much significance today. It’s a testament to the writing that this message was conveyed in a compelling manner without feeling like it was preaching to a choir.
Dutchman is another excellent production from the School of Drama. Their selection this year seems to encompass a great variety of socially conscious, thematically relevant, and unique plays. I’m excited to see what other intriguing productions the School of Drama has in store for the rest of the year.

Be Here Now by Ram Dass, also formerly known as Dr. Richard Alpert, is more than just a book. This story is a guide for those embarking on the inner journey towards home or Om. Whichever you prefer.
This epic shares experience, clinical knowledge, and pop-culture references from today and the past, in order to give the reader comprehensive tools to themselves. Nothing more than that; it’s a spiritual tool. I sought out this book in a time of intense searching for answers that I always felt I had within myself, but didn’t know how to access. I feel as though this book should be essential for every student here at Carnegie Mellon, and other college students across the world, because it helped me access my heart in a way I hadn’t imagined before. This book is more than a comprehensive look at the journey of Ram Dass: it is a look at the unfolding of the ego, and of the Universe always serving as the best guide that there can be.
This book is centered around a journey. But not a journey that takes place on the outside towards a destination, but a journey within. A journey towards seeing one’s soul, past the ego — a journey of seeing oneself in the pureness of love and understanding. The book is divided into three different portions. The first portion of the book outlines Dr. Richard Alpert’s transition into becoming Baba Ram Dass, which means “Servant of God.” He talks in detail about his experience teaching psychology at Harvard during the psychedelic era in America. He also shares his experience of using these psychedelics to experience oneness with the Universe and with God. He clarifies that this wasn’t enough for him, because there was always a come-down; the sensation is nothing but temporary, so eventually he would become
sober. The second portion is illustrative and contains mantras for the regular joe schmoe to read and meditate over. He places an emphasis on meditating over the mantras because “knowledge is eternal and with time and patience, all knowledge finds it way to resonate and bring clarity.” The last portion of this book is called “A Cookbook For A Sacred Life”. It has a table of contents dedicated to different yogic practices, all the way up to sexual energy. This section of the book is my favorite because it has quotes supporting each section from a multitude of sources. You’re not getting a one-sided perspective, but a universal one.
This book is for practitioners of all faiths. Whether you’re Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or any other, there is something for you within this book. It doesn’t just stop at religion and finding ways to help us reach our God (or gods), but it goes above and beyond to not idolize or ostracize any religion. It includes all the knowledge and spiritual practices of different religions so that the reader is well equipped and informed.
If your goal is to read something that will in turn help you to master yourself and the inner journey towards home (Om), then Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass is just the book for you. It’s without a doubt the best and most viable option for anyone not necessarily looking to enter a religion or religious practice, but looking to advance their spiritual practice, whether they are religious or not.

This week, Movies in McConomy will be screening two different thrill rides.
Ocean’s 8
The newest installment in the Ocean’s franchise stars Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean’s sister, and follows her creation of a new team to pull off a heist. The film is effectively the same as Ocean’s 11 but lacking a lot of the style of Steven Soderbergh’s original. It’s not particularly special, but unlike some other reboots or remakes of franchises, this film has respect for its source material. If you want a fun, inoffensive film that will kill some time, I would recommend checking this one out. Otherwise, stick to the original Ocean’s 11.
Mission Impossible: Fallout
Go watch this. You have no excuse not to if you’re available and want something to watch. It’s playing in the Cohon Center and it’s free. This is one of the best big budget action films since Mad Max: Fury Road and maybe one of the best action films ever. It’s a great homage to old-time spy action thrillers with several twists and turns. All the characters are fun to watch. The story is engaging. Ethan’s character gets some depth for once. They call back to the other films really well. But most importantly, the action is just jaw-dropping. This has the best of every kind of action sequence: it has one of the best skydiving sequences, one of the best fist fights, one of the best car chases, one of the best heists, one of the best foot chases, and, of course, the best (and only?) helicopter chase ever filmed. The level of effort that the entire crew, especially Tom Cruise, put into this film is incredible, and every other studio needs to take note of this and put in this level of effort and care into their own big budget films. If you have nothing to do and are choosing to binge Netflix, close that and go watch this instead. You won’t regret it.

For the record, I went to this restaurant at midnight, which is technically morning. Thus, this does count as brunch.
Anyway, I recently went to Fuel and Fuddle, a restaurant that specializes in American comfort food. The reason I went so late was because 1.) I hadn’t eaten dinner, 2.) I had just been on a bus for 12 hours, and 3.) after 11 p.m., Fuel has a late night menu where everything on that menu is half off. So, a group of friends and I went with the sole intention of stuffing ourselves like turkeys.
The location: Fuel and Fuddle is located near the corner of Oakland and Forbes Avenue. A good way to remember this is that it’s right next to Stack’d, a fact that blew my mind as I walked there. It’s not too far away from everything in Oakland, and it’s located in a fairly busy spot.
The food: We played ourselves and accidentally ordered much more food than we anticipated. With the low late night prices, it was way too tempting to order the entire menu. We ordered pork nachos for the whole table, two of my friends both got individual orders of the same pulled pork sandwich, and I split a cajun chicken sandwich and pierogies with my third friend. The fact that we finished all of that food is a testament to its quality. It had been a while since I’d had good pierogies, and Fuel reminded me why I missed it. The addition of the adobo sauce, bacon, and sour cream only made the experience better. I don’t normally enjoy chicken at American restaurants because I find it to be too dry or unseasoned for my liking, but the cajun chicken at Fuel was incredible. Both my friends who ordered the pulled pork sandwich really loved their sandwiches, although they complained about being stuffed after eating half of it. However, the best dish was the pork nachos. I salute whoever came up with that idea and the people who prepared the dish that night.
The vibe: Even at midnight, the restaurant was fairly packed, with several patrons enjoying the late night drinks and food while watching NFL highlights. There was some nice classic rock playing in the background to really set the mood, and after a particularly long day, we were all instantly re-energized as we entered the restaurant.
Lit or Nah: I would easily classify Fuel as lit. My overall experience was great, and it’s incredibly fun to go here with several friends and eat as much food as humanly possible for a very affordable price. I highly recommend checking out Fuel—be it early in the day or late at night.

Dear Michelle,
The holiday season is approaching, and I’m super excited! This has always been my favorite time of the year, mainly because my family and I have the best traditions. It’s a time when I genuinely feel at my happiest. I know that my holiday season experience might be a little different because I’m in college now, and honestly, I’m sort of worried about that. I really don’t want all the stress from school to ruin the holiday season for me. I want to be able to celebrate the holidays, while also finishing off my semester on a good note. Do you have any tips on how to do that?
Thanks,
Help On Living In Denial About Year-end Stress
Dear HOLIDAYS,
The holiday season is also my favorite time of the year! And I understand that it’s difficult to have to find ways to keep up your family traditions and feel at home, especially when you’re so far from home. But over the past few years I’ve been in college, I’ve learned some good ways to do so.
The first thing you can do is make up your own traditions with friends! I’m sure during this time of the year, a lot of people, including your friends, are starting to feel homesick and miss their families. Since a lot of you are feeling the same way, this would create a good opportunity for you guys to find some fun activities to do together during your free time; to create spaces where you all can spend quality time with one another, and be like a family. Something nice you all could do is have a potluck dinner, where you all can bring dishes that you usually eat with your families during the holiday. Not only is this a great way to bond with your friends, but you can learn so much more about them and their cultural backgrounds. 
Another thing you can do, if you feel like you’re missing out on the holiday celebration while being on campus, is decorate your dorm! Of course, ask your roommate (if you have any) if it’s okay to decorate the entire dorm, but it’s so easy to put up even a few decorations on your wall or door to help spread the holiday cheer.
And while it may not seem like campus is getting into the holiday spirit just yet, you can just take a twenty minute bus ride downtown this Friday for Pittsburgh’s annual Light Up Night event, or check out a fully-decorated Phipps Conservatory in about a week or two. These two events are all about celebrating the holiday season, and you’ll get to experience all the decorations, lights, music, and even fireworks! It might not be obvious, but Pittsburgh really does love the holidays as much as you and I do. And while it might be different from how you usually celebrate at home, making your own holiday traditions with a “second family” in Pittsburgh can be a really wonderful thing. It’ll take some time to get used to, but hopefully these will become experiences you can look forward to in your coming years of college. Hope this helps!
Best,
Michelle

By now it’s no secret: at least 19 percent of students at Carnegie Mellon are living with food insecurity. The 2017 Campus Cupboard study on food insecurity at 11 colleges in the Pittsburgh area showed that for nearly 2,700 students at this school, access to food is a problem. Since last fall, students and university administration have been working hard to change that. On Friday afternoon, the fruits of their labor were celebrated at the brand-new CMU Pantry open house.
Located on the first floor of the Residence on Fifth housing community, the CMU Pantry aims to reduce student hunger by giving students access to free non-perishables and produce, as well as other basic needs items. Any Carnegie Mellon student can shop at the CMU Pantry after filling out the registration forms, and can return on a biweekly basis.
The Pantry is run by a mix of volunteers and paid staff, who assist new and returning shoppers with finding items, developing shopping lists, and meal planning. The small space consists of a checkout table with shopping guidelines, a walk-in refrigerator for fresh produce and dairy products, and a shelf section. On the shelves are condiments, a wide array of canned goods, grains, baking supplies, snack foods, and personal hygiene products.
About 60 people from the Carnegie Mellon community attended the open house, receiving fliers on topics like “Eating better on a budget” and “Smart snacking.” Pantry staff led visitors on tours of the small space, showing a sample shopping bag of items: a bag of rice, a carton of milk, a tube of toothpaste, a box of cereal, and multiple cans of beans, peas, and other vegetables.
Also in the Pantry is the “expired” shelf, which includes items ranging from Cliff bars to Matzoh to tortillas which have passed their “best by” date. Pantry Coordinator William Coggins explained that the “best by” date on most foods is somewhat arbitrary: “This food will still be good for a while, with no change in taste or nutritional value.” Items on the expired shelf, along with fresh produce from the walk-in refrigerator, have no limit on consumption: students can take as many as they need.
Along with access to food, said Coggins, a first-year graduate student in Heinz College, education is a major priority at the Pantry. “We realize that a big barrier to healthy eating could be not knowing what to do with food,” he said, gesturing towards a stack of recipe cards stacked on a shelf.
Of the numerous speakers at the open house, the only non-Carnegie Mellon affiliate was Charlese McKinney, the Network Development Director for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (GPCFB). She spoke highly of Carnegie Mellon’s quick response to the study and of the importance of institutional partnerships: “Our traditional networks work with thousands of people in the Pittsburgh area,” she said to the room, “but there are thousands more we aren’t reaching. Campus Cupboards help us reach young bright minds who are struggling with food insecurity.”
The CMU Pantry is now a part of the GPCFB network, and will receive a majority of its staple items from the larger organization. GPCFB will also provide free produce donated by local farms. Other sourcing will come from campus food drives, community organizations such as 412 Food Rescue, and purchasing via the Pantry’s Division of Student Affairs (DOSA) budget.
“There’s also the potential to go out and buy directly from grocery stores,” said Stephanie Laughton, Vice President of Campus Affairs for the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), “particularly keeping an eye on the fact that our student population is very international and may not want a mostly American selection.” Laughton, a fourth-year PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering, played a key administrative role in the transition from proposal to reality this fall.
The initial push for the project came mostly from within the graduate student community. In what could only be described as perfect timing, second-year Heinz student Sarah Pesi began graduate school just before the results of the Campus Cupboard survey were released. “On the first day of graduate student orientation, I found myself in a conversation with Gina Casalegno about the study,” she recalled. Pesi spent the previous year managing the University of Pittsburgh food pantry as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, and has struggled with food insecurity in the past.
She founded the Graduate Student Assembly Basic Needs working group last fall to better understand the specific issues contributing to the problem, which eventually led to the creation of the Campus Food Insecurity Committee. This committee, consisting of staff and students from both undergraduate and graduate programs, worked with SLICE, Dining Services, Pitt, and the GPCFB to make the Pantry a reality.
Pesi, who has since stepped back from leading this effort to focus on school, spoke highly of the committee members. “We would spend hours on things,” she reminisced about the spring of 2018, when a core group of about six graduate and undergraduate students plugged away at the thirty-page comprehensive proposal document. “Our team was small but mighty,” she said with a smile.
In her closing remarks Friday afternoon, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno expressed admiration for the efforts of the students and staff who made the CMU Pantry a reality, and looked to the future. “This issue is personal,” she said, “But I’m thrilled to say this is just the beginning. It doesn’t stop here.”
The CMU Pantry is free to all students and is located on the first floor of the Residence on Fifth (4700 Fifth Avenue). To donate shopping bags or inquire about volunteering, email the Pantry Coordinator at cmu-pantry@andrew.cmu.edu or call the SLICE office at 412-268-8704.

President Farnam Jahanian used his Oct. 26 inauguration address to announce that “the Allegheny Foundation has committed a $30 million lead grant toward the transformation of Scaife Hall into a modern, new home for Mechanical Engineering.” 
The transformation will mark the seventh significant change to the infamously-latticed 1962 engineering building. This time it will be a complete rebuild, with an emphasis on modern labs, reconfigurable classrooms, and collaborative spaces, and probably a goodbye to the Pringle-shaped lecture hall in the front. 
The large grant came from the Allegheny Foundation, a subsidiary of Scaife Foundations, another namesake of Alan M. Scaife. According to their website, the Allegheny Foundation “confines most of its grant awards to programs for historic preservation, civic development and education.” The grant for the new Scaife Hall is the largest grant ever offered by the foundation.
Past grants of the Allegheny Foundation mostly include local educational and community-oriented donations. Outside of the community, the foundation mostly donates to conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, the CATO Institute, and the American Legislative Exchange Council.
President Jahanian noted in his inaugural address that the grant from the Allegheny Foundation pushed the “total infrastructure investments in engineering over the past decade to more than a quarter billion dollars.”
The Tartan interviewed Allen L. Robinson, Engineering and Public Policy Department Head and Raymond J. Lane Distinguished Professor in Mechanical Engineering, who shed some light on the potential impact of a new Scaife Hall from the perspective of the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
Currently, Robinson says, Scaife Hall and Mechanical Engineering spaces are “lacking in several dimensions.” With the move towards more project-focused and flipped-classroom courses in the College of Engineering, traditional classroom spaces are not optimal, Robinson said. He continued, “New Scaife will have those sorts of flexible classrooms. This will benefit MechE, other engineering departments, and [the] university as a whole.”
Robinson also notes that “the number of MechE students has more than doubled since I joined the faculty about 20 years ago,” with large growth in undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations, though the spaces the Mechanical Engineering program occupies on campus have largely remained the same.
With the increase in multi-disciplinary research taking place in the College of Engineering, current lab spaces that favor small research teams are outdated and lacking, Robinson told The Tartan. New lab spaces will encourage collaboration among students and faculty alike, and will be able to accommodate new research on “novel technologies such as DNA-origami, biohybrid robotics, and biomechanics,” Robinson says, continuing, “these types of research require different types of infrastructure that don’t exist in Scaife.”
Ultimately, Robinson says that a new Scaife Hall “will dramatically enhance our graduate and undergraduate education programs. It will also accelerate our research activities by promoting highly collaborative research in critical emerging areas.”
President Jahanian aired similar sentiments in his inaugural address, saying that due to this expansion, Carnegie Mellon University “will be better able to compete for the best students and faculty, driving Pittsburgh’s reputation as a hub for innovation.”
With this new Scaife Hall, as well as the new Tepper Quadrangle, the forthcoming ANSYS Hall, and the recently purchased Shadyside apartment building, Carnegie Mellon University is furthering its infrastructure expansion plans in Pittsburgh.
Construction is yet to begin, but the new building is expected to be double the size of the current Scaife Hall in the same location. There is no scheduled completion date as of now, but construction will probably push students out of Scaife sometime soon.

On Nov. 2, Carnegie Mellon purchased a Shadyside apartment complex known as Fifth Neville for $16.98 million, one of its most expensive real estate investments to date.
According to Allegheny county real estate records, the Fifth Neville complex had been assessed at $3.6 million, which means that Carnegie Mellon paid more than $13 million over the assessed price for Fifth Neville, more than $217,000 per unit. This far exceeds the price per unit paid for the 319-apartment Ascent 430, a luxury apartment in Warrendale with a number of amenities such as a swimming pool, conference rooms, and even more. While some may question why Carnegie Mellon would pay so much more than the county’s assessment for the Fifth Neville apartment complex, university spokespeople and outside business professionals think that this is an excellent purchase.
The Fifth Neville apartment complex is located at 4705 Fifth Avenue, quite close to the corner of Neville Street. Carnegie Mellon spokesman Jason Maderer said in a statement to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the benefits of the investment are twofold: it will allow Carnegie Mellon to both satisfy the increasing demand for university-owned housing, and also allow Carnegie Mellon to be more flexible in initiating future renovations to existing buildings. Carnegie Mellon plans to renovate Fifth Neville to elevate the complex to university standards in matters such as life safety.
The managing director of Colliers International’s Pittsburgh office, Gregg Broujos, acknowledged that Carnegie Mellon paid a great deal for Fifth Neville when he spoke to the Pittsburgh Business Times. Regardless, he stated that “Oakland has and will continue to demand the highest prices, quite frankly, in the state.” As the healthcare and scholarly center of Pittsburgh and one of a number of the city’s most popular cultural centers, Broujos and others see the cost as fully justified due to the ever-increasing demand for properties in a coveted area stuffed to the brim with activity.
Although Fifth Neville was constructed 60 years ago, the six story high, 78-unit apartment complex has recently been updated to modern standards. In addition, it is at a nearly full capacity. Most of the 78 units are single or double occupancy. The university has stated that Fifth Neville’s location is ideal for Carnegie Mellon students.
Fifth Neville is near other Carnegie Mellon-owned housing complexes on Fifth Avenue, including several recently bought from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, which will make it relatively simple for Carnegie Mellon to incorporate it into its “institutional master plan.” Moreover, it’s only a short walk from Fifth Neville to the Tepper Quadrangle and, in turn, to Carnegie Mellon’s main campus.
In 2015, Carnegie Mellon requested that the zoning for a parcel of land it bought from the diocese be changed to EMI, or Educational, Medical, and Institutional. Although Carnegie Mellon planned on constructing a five-story building to serve as a “hub of student life” to be completed by the spring of 2018, that plan is still on hold for the time being. That building would have been Carnegie Mellon’s first academic facility in Shadyside.
Erika Strassburger, the city councilwoman for Shadyside and parts of Oakland, has met with Carnegie Mellon leaders to discuss the Fifth Neville purchase, but she has yet to hear of any concrete plans. “[I look forward to] a full community process once plans are developed,” said Strassburger to the Pittsburgh Business Times.
Carnegie Mellon’s purchase of Fifth Neville marks its latest expansion beyond the boundaries of the main campus and into the largely residential Shadyside. Fifth Neville itself was a commercial residential apartment complex itself prior to Carnegie Mellon’s purchase of it. Current residents of Fifth Neville will be forced to leave the complex upon the completion of their respective leases.
In a broader sense, Carnegie Mellon’s purchase of Fifth Neville is representative of its increasing focus on expanding the university, both in terms of campus housing and academic buildings. One need only look at Carnegie Mellon’s plans for the brand new Scaife Hall, the constant construction on many parts of campus such as the Mall, and the recently completed Tepper Quadrangle to understand Carnegie Mellon’s plans for its future.

Some around Pittsburgh might find it hard to communicate to people outside the city just how it feels to have been so close to such an incomprehensible tragedy as the one that took place at the Tree of Life synagogue. This past Saturday, those that entered Commonplace Coffee were reminded that Pittsburgh is sadly not alone in this experience.
A group of alums from Frasier Woods, a school in Newtown, CT, donated $650 so that patrons of Commonplace Coffee, a coffee shop in Squirrel Hill, could enjoy a free beverage. Those that are a part of the Newtown community understand what it is like when a national tragedy happens in your neighborhood. The gift was organized by a Frasier Woods mother, Kathy Craughwell-Varda, who told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that while she knew the coffee would not fix everything, the acts of kindness that her community received following the attacks on the Sandy Hook Elementary School helped residents cope.
A post on Commonplace Coffee’s Instagram page explained, “They understand that it affects all of us, and that as individuals and communities, we need to make sure we’re taking care of ourselves. Join us today for some coffee and healing, and also in thanking this incredibly kind group of people.”
Students frequently patronize and work at Commonplace Coffee, which some would argue is one of the best of the coffee shops close to Carnegie Mellon. One such student was Mason Young-Shor, a junior majoring in Design who happened to be meeting a friend for a cup of coffee on Saturday. As he was waiting online to make his usual order, a medium black coffee, he noticed the barista did not accept payment from the people ahead of him, explaining that the donation from Newtown families covered the expense of their coffee.
Young-Shor found himself “grateful, not so much for the $2 but for making me feel a part of the community.” He has lived in Squirrel Hill for two years, but tended to think of himself as primarily a member of the Carnegie Mellon community. This donation made him “[look] back at all the times [he] had been able to engage with strangers through the comfort and community [that] Commonplace and Squirrel Hill offer” and “place value in those connections.”
The gift offered at Commonplace that day, from Newtown residents to Squirrel Hill residents, was not just one of coffee. “The gift that Newtown families gave me and I hope all the others who were fortunate enough to sit down in Commonplace that day, who read this article, and members of the Squirrel Hill or any similar effected community, was a sense of being, being part, being supported, and being loved, and I am grateful for that,” Young-Shor said. As Craughwell-Varda said to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this gift was meant to “just let them know we are thinking about them, and that they are not alone.”

Over the last few weeks, the Student Senate has been working tirelessly to serve the undergraduate population. From Oct. 21 to Oct. 26, the Senate hosted a whole week of engagement. During Senate Week, the Undergraduate Senate informed and offered many activities for the students, including the Strip Crawl, an event called “Key to my Success,” a Q and A session about any comments or concerns regarding Housing Services and Facilities Management Services, and an information session to assist organizations on applying for funding resources and special allocations. The week was a valuable experience for Carnegie Mellon students to see how the Senate is continuously representing the undergraduates, reflecting the theme of representation.
Within the last two weeks, the Senate has been deeply involved in the discussion of the Housing Master Plan. Communicating with representatives, the Undergraduate Senate is playing a critical role in the consultation and advisement of new study spaces, students centers, fitness centers, computer clusters, and other resources that will benefit the undergraduate population.
Finally, the Senate has continued its role of providing mid-year funding to clubs and organizations that recently formed or have recently acquired unexpected costs. This happened to several organizations, including the Chess Club and the Spanish and Latin Student Association. Determined to support programs and offer benefits to the Undergraduate population, the Senate continues to review finance requests to support student organizations. The Undergraduate Student Senate is continuing to tackle new problems, develop new events and opportunities, and advocate on behalf of the student population.

The 2018 midterm was argued to be one of the most significant midterm elections in recent U.S. history. As reported last week by The Tartan's Editorial Board, many of the House seats were "up for grabs, while 35 out of the 100 Senate seats [were] up for reelection." Before the poll results were released, FiveThirtyEight forecasted a "7 in 8 chance Democrats win [House] control," solidifying the prediction of an upcoming "blue wave."
With a nod to last week's piece from The Tartan Editorial Board, all three of the endorsed candidates — Tom Wolf, Bob Casey Jr., and Dan Frankel — were elected as Governor, Senator, and State Representative, respectively. Although Pennsylvania's gerrymandering had allowed a disproportionate number of Republicans to represent the state, with the recently redrawn legislative maps, Pennsylvanians got the chance to choose leaders more accurately representing them and their political beliefs in the 2018 midterms.
The extent to which the blue wave hit is arguable. Although the Senate maintains its Republican majority, we saw a massive increase in the number of minorities representing the diverse American population. 107 women were elected to the House this time around, two of whom are Muslim. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez set a new precedent for young citizens wishing to enter the political arena by becoming the youngest congresswoman at age 29. Despite these historical milestones, there are still ballot recounts and signs of voter suppression worth investigating.
In the Texas Senate race, Republican Ted Cruz narrowly beat Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke by 2.6 percentage points. Texas elections carried problems due to faulty and outdated voting machines as well as crowded polling stations. Some voters caught on to the errors and manually changed their ballots to reflect their choice in candidates, but it is unknown how many ballots were affected. Texas, in response, blamed user error, not the faulty and outdated machines.
Texas is not the only state impacted by machine-induced errors; they may have contributed to voter suppression in Georgia as well. Republican Brian Kemp was up 1.6 percentage points over Democrat opponent Stacey Abrams, but multiple voters were turned away, had their absentee ballots rejected, or could not have their voting registration verified. Despite the close ballot count, it is unlikely that a ballot recount would swing towards Abrams’ favor, but voter suppression on even a small scale can set a dangerous precedent to the erosion of democracy.
In Florida, Broward County experienced a statistically significant undervote rate. While all other counties in Florida saw no more than a 0.8 percent difference in the number of votes cast for governor and the U.S. Senate, Broward County experienced a 3.7 percent difference. Multiple factors — including poor ballot design and, again, faulty ballot machines — could have played a role in this discrepancy. In Florida’s Senate election, Republican Rick Scott beat Democrat Bill Nelson by a mere 0.18 percentage points. Given this tight margin, Florida is facing a statewide recount.
Of course, the topic of gerrymandering pops up again. Pennsylvania was previously reported as one of the most gerrymandered states, but in 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court deemed the gerrymandered map unconstitutional. Consequently, this election saw results which were much more representative of the popular vote. In 2016, PA Democrats won 48 percent of the statewide votes in contested House elections but only won 27 percent of the seats; in 2018, Democrats earned 53 percent of the popular vote in PA while earning just under 50 percent of the contested seats. In the meantime, North Carolina — another historically gerrymandered state — saw 50.3 percent of the votes going towards Republicans, yet Republicans took 10 of 13 possible seats. This difference between the number of votes and the number of seats taken echoes that of the 2016 election, which is no surprise considering North Carolina still has the same gerrymandered districts that they had in 2016. Other states — such as Wisconsin and Michigan — were also negatively impacted by gerrymandering.
Voter suppression also influenced the midterm results. North Dakota came under fire for not allowing P.O. boxes to be used as addresses for voter IDs, disproportionately affecting the Native American population, who almost exclusively use P.O. boxes for home addresses. Additionally, Georgia’s “exact match” law barred many voters from participating in the election due to discrepancies between what is written on a registration form and what is present in state records. Although these are the two major examples that caught headlines, some other states such as Maryland, Arkansas, and Missouri have seen an increase in regulations for voter IDs required to vote.
For a country that prides itself on having free and fair elections, there seem to be quite a few examples contradicting that image. Although the end results of the midterm election are unlikely to change drastically after recounts, steps to ensure a more representative House and Senate must be taken. With the 2020 election on the horizon, these seemingly minor obstacles may add up to affect who is elected as Leader of the Free World.

Last week’s midterm elections showed us what can happen when people bother to vote. Control of the House of Representatives will change hands in January, and many races that are normally written off as safe for one party ended up either very close or delivering upsets. The one-party rule of the federal government will come to end. These are things to celebrate, and they hopefully point to a general reawakening of American civic engagement. But amidst the good news of a potentially recovering democracy, the midterms showed us there’s still a lot of work to do to achieve a truly fair electoral system.
We knew well before the elections took place that there are plenty of people in this country who want to preserve the legacy of segregation by keeping people away from voting, and who find it defensible to use their positions of power to keep themselves and their acolytes in high position. The big story two weeks ago was in Georgia, where the candidate and election-overseer Brian Kemp was shown to have deleted hundreds of thousands of voters from the registration polls, while withholding tens of thousands more absentee ballot and voter registration applications. The majority of these applications belonged to African-American citizens. But that’s last week’s news, and Kemp wasn’t done suppressing the vote then.
Despite Kemp's claims that everything went smoothly in Georgia on Election Day, people reported hours-long lines to vote at some polling places, especially in the traditionally democratic Atlanta area. Voters in Gwinnett County, expected to be a highly competitive district, ended up waiting hours to vote, because the voting machines at Annistown Elementary School were delivered to the site without power cords. We can’t even walk outdoors without a tangle of power cords to keep our various devices working properly, and a state government can’t remember that electronic machines need a power source? Considering, again, that one of the candidates in this election was the person in charge of Georgia’s elections, it seems less like a genuine mistake and more of an accidental-but-on-purpose way of making sure that Kemp came out on top. Court orders, spurred on by lawsuits from groups like the Georgia National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), forced the state to keep some polling sites open later than normal to account for the earlier delays — but the damage could have already been done. We don’t know how many people were forced to leave rather than wait at polling sites, and we don’t know what other forms of suppression might be lurking under these more obvious displays.
If there is a silver lining to the cloud of suppression, it’s that we don’t know for sure that it will actually end up working in favor of those who tried to cheat. As of Saturday, the gubernatorial election in Georgia has still not been called by the Associated Press, as the state works its way through absentee and provisional ballots. The two candidates are separated by less than 2 percent, and there is a possibility that, although Kemp has the small lead, the two candidates will have to face each other again in a December runoff election. But the critical thing about this election is the numbers. The goal of suppression is to disadvantage your opponent, and to that end, Kemp failed. Even after purging people from the voter rolls and making it as difficult as possible for people to actually cast ballots, he ended up in a race that is, for him, uncomfortably close. There’s a lesson to be learned here: we can overcome the cheat-to-win policies of American conservatives if we actually show up in large numbers. We very nearly did it in Georgia. There are also recounts currently taking place, for two races in Florida, where ballots seemed to have gotten mixed up.
Republicans in this country are on notice. In terms of policy, they know that they have a relatively narrow (and shrinking) group of core supporters. And to be guaranteed victory in competitive races, they have stopped playing by the rules that they claim to hold so dear. The biggest takeaway from Tuesday’s elections should be this: it is unquestionably discouraging to hear these stories of voter suppression. After all, why even bother voting if there’s a chance that those in power will not only ignore but invalidate the message that voters have for them? If last week’s elections in states like Georgia (and Florida, and Arizona) show us anything, it’s that the days of the cheat-to-win tactic working are numbered. When people vote, we overcome the cheating strategies of people trying to ignore progress and keep the country in the past.

On Oct. 26, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) sacked the Prime Minister, Ranil Wikramasinghe of the United National Party (UNP), ending a three-year-old alliance often marked with internal turbulence, and setting off a Constitutional crisis in the island nation. He then installed an ally-turned-foe-turned-ally, Former President Mahindra Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as Prime Minister. Two weeks later, on Nov. 9, President Sirisena dissolved the Sri Lankan Parliament and called a snap general election to be held on Jan. 5. He also suspended the House until Nov. 16, based on reports released at the time of the writing of this article.
This latest political tussle between Rajapaksa and Wikramasinghe has experts and lawyers divided on the constitutional legality of Sirisena’s action. Under Article 33 (2)(c) in the 19th Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution, “in addition to the powers, duties, and functions expressly conferred or imposed on, or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall never have the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.” The president’s ardent supporters cite this article to defend his actions. However, there are also serious problems, as Article 70(1) of the 19th Amendment also states that the president cannot dissolve the Parliament before four and a half years into its five-year term unless requested by two-thirds of its members.
Article 33(2) is also a general provision describing the powers and functions of the president, including the power of the president to dissolve the parliament. But Article 70(1) is a specific provision that limits this power of the president in regards to the dissolution of the parliament. And based on the standard rule of interpretation, a general provision must always be read subject to a specific provision. 
As the Wikramasinghe-Sirisena coalition had lasted a little more than three years, this renders the Sirisena’s move to dissolve the Parliament unconstitutional, according to several legal experts.
In 2015, when Sirisena and Wikramasinghe’s parties, which are rivals and ideological polar opposites, teamed up for the elections to defeat incumbent Rajapaksa, it caused ripples of surprise all around. However, now that Wikramasinghe’s political star and public popularity has waned thanks to slowed economic growth and several internal tussles between the former-rivals-turned-allies, Sirisena covertly formed an alliance with Rajapaksa. One of the main reasons, according to reports, is Wikramasinghe’s strongly worded statement that he issued in New Delhi after meeting the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Oct. 20 about the delay in Indian projects in Sri Lanka, that seemed to be blaming the president. Wikramasinghe’s visit to India also came in the backdrop of reports in which Sirisena accused the Indian government’s Intelligence Agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), of plotting his assassination, which Wikramasinghe repeatedly denied ahead of his visity in order to maintain Indian confidence in his government. Another reason, analysts speculate, could be the rejection of two of Sirisena’s nominees for the Supreme court and an Appeals Court.
Whatever the reasons may be, the Rajapaksa-Sirisena alliance is back, sparking fear of violence in Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa is known for quelling the insurgency and ending the civil war with the ethnic Tamilian separatist group, Liberation of Tamil Tigers Eelam (LTTE). But the massive human rights violations, including the murder of LTTE chief Prabhakaran’s 12-year-old son, who was handed a pack of biscuits before being executed, have cast the international spotlight on the various methods of suppression used by Rajapaksa and the Sri Lankan army in Tamil-dominated regions like Jaffna, even after the war ended. Rajapaksa is also very pro-Chinam and his tenure saw massive amounts of Chinese investments, including the construction of a port in Sri Lanka. In fact, when he lost the elections in 2015, Rajapaksa accused India of orchestrating his defeat.
Reports indicate that prior to his firing, Wikramasinghe had argued with Sirisena about a proposal to grant the development of a Colombo port project to an India-Japan joint venture. Wikramasinghe had allegedly argued that the decision should respect the memorandum of understanding signed by Sri Lanka, India, and Japan. However, reports suggest that Sirisena wanted to reject the proposal. 
These reports seem to suggest that the tussle for power between India and China for investments in Sri Lanka may have led to this latest political crisis in Sri Lanka. While India remains concerned that China intends to turn Sri Lanka into a military outpost, which could greatly harm India’s security and territorial integrity due to its proximity to Sri Lanka, China continues to grow its portfolio of investments in Sri Lanka, welcoming it into its ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR) program in 2017 and subsequently increasing investment. 
Wikramasinghe’s United National Party is going to the Supreme Court to challenge what it calls the illegal dissolution of the Parliament by Sirisena. Meanwhile, countries around the world are observing the situation cautiously. The Japan International Cooperation Agency put a $1.4 billion soft debt to a light railway project in Colombo on hold, while the U.S. Department of State released a statement calling on President Sirisena to reconvene the Parliament to let democratically elected representatives decide who will lead the government.

It seems that the almighty Yeezus has had another revelation.
On Oct. 30, Kanye West took to Twitter, tweeting that “My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!”
It’s not clear what caused this change of heart, but it’s likely that this tweet came in response to West’s controversial meeting with President Trump on Oct. 11. During their exchange, Trump sat quietly while West, who was wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, unloaded a stream of consciousness rant that covered topics as diverse as North Korean nuclear disarmament and mental illness, all in his characteristically bombastic style. West concluded their meeting by embracing Trump, and openly claiming that he loved the president.
West’s performance drew sharp criticism, with many pointing out that the hip-hop artist’s friendly relationship with the president makes it seem like he supports the hateful ideologies and downright bigotry championed by Trump and his base. Clearly, these comments were not ignored.
West has a reputation for being a defender of controversial people, and much like everything else, he does it in his own way. This generally entails unleashing an unfiltered torrent of thought at the most inopportune time (such as his rant telling everyone to leave Elon Musk alone). Speaking without thinking is bad enough when you’re an ordinary person, but when you’re as big as Kanye West, your words have weight, and you need to choose them carefully.
It’s good that West finally recognized this problem and has chosen forego politics to focus on his work, for which he is infinitely more qualified. But the scenario with West is just a reminder that celebrities are getting increasingly involved in our national conversation.
On the one hand, there’s nothing wrong with celebrities supporting causes or messages that they believe in. For example, Pharrell Williams sent a cease and desist order to Trump when he used the song “Happy” at his Illinois rally on Oct. 27, the same day as the Tree of Life synagogue shooting. It’s clear that Pharrell does not support Trump, and it’s his prerogative how his music is used and in what context. Other artists, including Rihanna, have made similar requests. 
In a more proactive sense, big stars like Oprah Winfrey and Will Ferrell have taken to campaigning for the candidates of their choice, both going to Georgia to support Stacey Abrams in her close race for governor against Brian Kemp.
Endorsing anyone as a celebrity is risky, and if not handled properly, it could lead to consequences. This was evident when Taylor Swift endorsed Tennessee candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in, where she did so through the medium of Instagram (of all things) by posting a lengthy, poorly phrased justification that not only missed the mark but also promoted divisiveness in politics.
Politics is a sensitive thing for anyone to talk about, especially big industry stars who have far more clout than the ordinary person. It’s important for celebrities to realize that, should they choose to leverage their fame and power in favor of some individual or cause, they must do so in a measured, respectful, and targeted way. Otherwise, they are only stirring the pot with controversial comments and endorsements and creating more problems, rather than solving them.
If that sounds like too difficult a task, then it’s worthwhile to consider stepping out of politics for a little while. It’s better late than never, and, as West showed us, if you want to stop digging a deeper hole, step one is to put the shovel down.

The Carnegie Mellon fence became the symbol of a grave on the night of the Oct. 29. Students painted the fence black, with two white Stars of David sketched on the vertical pillars. And then the students invited the campus community to engage in the Jewish ritual of placing a small rock on the fence as testimony that the grave was visited and the individual’s passing mourned.  This is just one example of the host of actions taken by the Carnegie Mellon students in response to the horrifying tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue last week on Saturday, Oct. 27. While there are far too many instances to enumerate individually and I provide examples of a few below, the massive show of support that I have received from Carnegie Mellon students (and the broader campus community) has made the grief somewhat more manageable. 
I teach on Mondays and Wednesdays and came to class on the Monday following the shooting, prepared to teach. As the class time drew near and I took my position at the front of the room, it became clear that I was unable to focus on the material and unable to stand up and lecture. I simply sat down at the table with the students and opened a conversation about the events of the previous weekend. I told the students that I had been attending services in my own synagogue (not Tree of Life) on Saturday morning, that we had been in lockdown, that parents had huddled with their children and that we had not known whether the shooter was headed in our direction after Tree of Life. I also told them that I am proud to be Jewish but now a little more frightened to be a member of this minority group. I then invited students to ask me questions. I only managed to remain in the classroom for 15 minutes before stating that I could not continue and, instead, invited the students to come talk to me in my office if they wished. It only took a couple of minutes before a line of students, neatly arranged in single file in the corridor of Baker Hall, appeared outside my door. Students entered individually or in pairs, hugged me, and expressed their outrage and their condolences.  Many students had already emailed me over the preceding weekend expressing concern about the safety of my family and offering to provide assistance for my affected community.
One such email received just after noon on Saturday the 27th reads “I unfortunately lived through this numerous times in my home country (name deleted), so I know how anything I can say will not help when these things happen in your community.... Please let me know though if there is absolutely any way I can help anyone you know (or don’t know), blood, transportation, etc. anything I can do. My number is 412-xx)”. 
And I am grateful to so many other students on campus. There was the extraordinary effort and commitment of a group of grieving students who partnered with the university to plan and then host Monday’s gathering in Rangos, and the Carnegie Mellon students — Jewish and not Jewish — who flocked to this service in Rangos on Monday evening, requiring a second overflow location in the Cohon Center. And the students whom I have only encountered occasionally on campus but who still left notes under my office door expressing their sympathy. And the members of the Alpha Epsilon Phi fraternity who donated all the food originally intended for their 412FoodRescue fundraiser so that it could be shared by students looking for refuge and togetherness at the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion on Saturday night.
And this email: “Good evening Dr. Behrmann. First, I want to say that you and your family have my greatest condolences after the events that transpired this weekend. Although the lives of so many people have been cut short or immensely saddened, I am relieved that you are okay. As an African-American, I tend to lose sight of the hate that so many other minorities face in this country, so if it offers any kind of emotional support, I want you and your family to know that I will do my part, no matter how small, to contribute to the well-being of all citizens, and not just those who look like me."
And… it goes on.
For Jews, amongst the highest forms of praise a person can receive is to be referred to (in Yiddish) as a mensch. This word translates roughly into "a person of noble character, of integrity and honor." The Carnegie Mellon students showed their collective menschlichkeit this past week. I thank the students for their contributions this past week and am deeply grateful to be part of this amazing community. Together, we are all stronger.
