The preliminary races of the 92nd annual Sweepstakes competition, colloquially known at Carnegie Mellon as Buggy, took place this past Friday morning. Eleven different organizations were represented in this year’s competition. 
This is the first year that Carnegie Mellon had a corporate sponsor for the design competition. Chrysler judged the buggies based on design, and upped the stakes by providing prize money for  the first, second, and third place winners.
The teams had been training for the Spring Carnival competition since September, and by the time the preliminary races rolled around on Friday, they were ready to go. The preliminaries began with women’s heats, and the men’s heats followed shortly. 
The nice weather and sunny skies from Friday turned sour for the finals on Saturday. The start time of the women’s finals was moved up to 8 a.m. because off a last-minute decision made by the Sweepstakes Committee. The men’s races were about to start when rain began to fall and the men’s finals were cancelled. This resulted in the men’s preliminary scores being used as their final scores. 
The Student Dormitory Council (SDC) took home both the men’s and women’s first place trophies. This is the second time that SDC won both men’s and women’s races in the past four years.
The Fringe women’s A team buggy, Bonsai, had an unfortunate crash in the preliminaries. Fortunately, Bonsai was the only buggy that crashed this year. It was the first crash for senior architecture major Becky Peterkin, who has been racing for four years. She crashed into the hay-bales when she was turning into the Chute. The crash was attributed to a mechanical error involving the wheel. Peterkin was not injured, but was emotionally shaken up; luckily, she was able to put the crash behind her and move forward. Later that day, Peterkin was able to race again for the Fringe men’s A team.
“It was a fantastic year and I am so proud to be a part of Fringe,” said first-year computer science major and Fringe pusher Lydia Utkin. “It’s disappointing that we crashed because, by times, anything could have happened. But that’s part of the sport, and the teams who won deserve it. I can’t wait for next year and another shot at the big trophy!” 
The women’s preliminary times were reflected in the final runs as SDC-A came in first at 2:30.903, slowing down from a preliminary run of 2:30.684. SDC-B came in second place with a time of 2:37.346, also slowing from a preliminary run time of 2:37.304. In third place was SigEp-A with a time of 2:41.147, improving from a preliminary time of 2:42.356.
The men’s results were based off their preliminary runs due to rain. In first place was SDC-A with a time of 2:05.841, the eighth fastest in the history of Buggy. Fringe-A finished second with a time of 2:07.134, and SDC-B took the bronze with a time of 2:08.212.
“Buggy is a really exciting event that I’m proud to be a part of,” said third-year architecture major Kyle Woltersdorf, who pushed Hill 1 for PiKA-A. “It’s the tradition that keeps me connected with hundreds of alumni who come back to see us compete.” PiKA-A finished fifth in the men’s races with a time of 2:10.194.
This year’s Sweepstakes has shown growth and maturity in teams, as SPIRIT took time to work on the mechanical layout of its buggies in an effort to increase safety. A new team, Apex, was comprised entirely of first-year residents and was supported by other organizations to start its own buggy program in January. Apex won the Spirit of Buggy award this year.

Mr. Yuk, the Carnegie Mellon ultimate Frisbee A team, traveled across Pennsylvania the past two weekends to compete against other teams for a spot at the upcoming Ohio Valley Regionals.
The team participated in the Western Pennsylvania Conference Tournament that was held April 14–15 in Trafford, Pa. The University of Pittsburgh was the first seed, followed by Shippensburg University and Pennsylvania State University as the second and third seeds, respectively. Mr. Yuk was seeded fourth.
Only the top six from the tournament advance to the Ohio Valley Regionals. Ohio University, Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University, University of Cincinnati, Toledo University, University of Dayton, Wright State, Millersville University, and University of Pennsylvania have already advanced from the Ohio and East Pennsylvania Conferences. 
On the first day of competition, Mr. Yuk faced the Edinboro University Fighting Scots and won 15–11. After, they fell to the University of Pittsburgh Panthers 15–9. Mr. Yuk took the next game against Indiana University of Pennsylvania Crimson Hawks 15–9, before finally falling 15–8 to the Penn State Nittany Lions.
On Sunday, Mr. Yuk won both of its games. First the team beat West Virginia University 15–4, and then the team was victorious over the Shippensburg University Raiders, 15–9.
Because of the team’s victories at the Western Pennsylvania Conference Tournament, Mr. Yuk advanced to the third seed for the regional tournament in State College, Pa., next weekend. Ultimate Frisbee teams from the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State will also participate and will provide tough competition for Mr. Yuk.

In a year filled with attention-grabbing headlines and news-filling brawls, the Pittsburgh Penguins’ season ended with more of a fizzle than a bang. Although the Penguins came back 3–2 after being down 3–0 in the first round with the Philadelphia Flyers, the team ultimately could not overcome its defensive struggles and fell 5–1 on Sunday to lose the series.
Throughout the regular season, the Penguins hid its defensive weaknesses behind stellar offensive play. It was easy to mask giving up two or three goals a game when the offense consistently scored three to four goals. Even the statistics were deceptive; the defensive metrics ranked the Penguins’ defense as the 15th best in the league. But one look at its series against the Flyers quickly reveals that it is not even close to a championship-caliber defense.
The Penguins goaltender Marc-André Fleury took a beating this year due to his team’s porous defense. He is still one of the better goalies in the league, but it puts a lot of strain on a goalie’s body when he is expected to stop nearly 40 shots every night. When Fleury is on top of his game, the Penguins are one of the league’s best with the high-octane offense backed up by solid goalkeeping.
During its last off-season, the Penguins’ biggest issue was the health of captain Sidney Crosby, but with his successful recovery, the Penguins can focus on more pressing problems. The team’s offense was ranked No. 1 this season, and most of the main scorers are still under contract. Winger Steve Sullivan is an unrestricted free agent. With an expected increase in the salary cap, along with the hope of reworking Crosby’s and alternate captain Jordan Staal’s contracts to sign them long term, there will be at least $5 million of cap space. This should be more than enough to resign Sullivan while still keeping a fair amount of salary flexibility.
On the defensive end, the Penguins need a lot of help. Defenders Matt Niskanen and Brian Strait are both restricted free agents, meaning the team gets to match any offer made by others if they want to resign them. 
The Penguins may be better off letting both these players walk and promoting one of their young defenders, while using their extra cap space to sign a young second-tier defender such as current Montreal Maple Leafs defender Chris Campoli or Dallas Star defender Sheldon Souray. Another option would be not to resign any of their free agents and go after a top tier defender like Washington Capitals player Dennis Wideman or Nashville Predators blue-liner Ryan Suter. 
Regardless of their needs this off-season, the Penguins will be returning most of the same players from this season. The key for the team is to find the few pieces it needs to toughen up defense and allow Fleury to make it through the season, in order to allow its high-powered offense to carry them to all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals.

After an unexpected playoff run for Carnegie Mellon club hockey, the team bids farewell to its graduating teammates: senior center Chaten Boscha, senior goalie Torrey Brenner, senior forward Ephraim Hathaway, and senior defenseman Dan Behmke. The team is losing its offensive firepower in Boscha and Hathaway as well as its dominant defense in Brenner and Behmke.
“The senior class has continuously ensured we have a solid offense and defense. It is going to be tough trying to piece together lines when such talented players leave,” said sophomore defender and winger Bryn Loeffler.
The team will make extensive efforts to recruit first-years to join the team in the fall. “We’re going to have to recruit a lot of freshmen for all positions on the ice to fill this void,” Loeffler said.
With so many big contributors leaving, junior forward Andrew McCoy and sophomore winger Keith Hoover will be next to lead the club hockey team. The two were the nonsenior point leaders for the team and will be expected to carry a heavier load next season.
“Keith’s line, with Mike [Purowitz] centering him and Tye [Lampl] on the other wing, have a great opportunity to help fill the shoes of the seniors. They worked so well together and really understand how to move the puck and communicate with each other,” Loeffler said.
Boscha led the Tartans in output throughout the season. His 48 points were by far the most on the team, scoring 28 goals and dishing 20 assists. McCoy was second on the team with 30 points, and Hathaway was third with 27.
The Carnegie Mellon club hockey team began their playoff run in February. Despite not having the home advantage, the Tartans beat the University of Pittsburgh, Greensburg Bobcats 8–1 in the playoff opener. This playoff win was the first for the Carnegie Mellon hockey team in 17 years. The following game was also without home ice advantage. The Tartans faced the Medaille College Mavericks and won 4–1. In the grand finale of the 2011–12 season on Feb. 26, the Tartans faced the California University of Pennsylvania Vulcans in the championship round, losing 8–5.
“Winning in the playoffs came down largely to Brenner’s spectacular play in goal. We beat the first place [Mavericks] team 4–1 despite giving up nearly sixty shots on goal. He was utterly indomitable,” Boscha said.
During the championships, Brenner recorded a .895 save percentage on the season, but his .981 save percentage in the 4–1 victory over the Mavericks was essential to the Tartans’ victory. He saved 53 of the 54 shots on goal.
“We had a great season and were so close to a championship. We fell behind early and could not make a comeback to win it in the end like we had been able to do all season,” said sophomore defensive player Kevin Fulton.
The 2012–13 season will begin in September, but no games are scheduled yet.

The 18th Mobot competition was held last Friday. The event challenges participants to create complex, autonomous machines that travel through a course beside Doherty and Wean Halls. The annual tournament was held in conjunction with celebrations for the end of National Robotics Week. In addition to the Mobot races, there were tours of the Robotics Institute, lectures, and a reception.
There were three categories for participants: “Undergraduates,” which included undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon; “Open Class,” which included graduate students, faculty, and staff; and “Exhibition” for competitors not associated with the university. Six teams represented the undergraduate competitors, three for the Open Class category, and two for the Exhibition category.
Each team was allowed to run its mobot through the course twice and the best performance was judged.
The kilt-wearing announcer, Robotics Institute senior research technician Greg Armstrong, provided interesting robotics facts and comic relief as a large crowd gathered to watch the 11 teams prove their craftsmanship, dedication, and technical know-how.
Participants had their mobots travel through ordered gates spread throughout flat and downhill sections. Although speed is a factor, the machines were primarily judged on their ability to accurately navigate through the gates.
And, of course, the mobots had to be autonomous, with human interaction of any kind being prohibited. The participants used sensors to identify the white curved line painted on the mobot course to guide their bots.
The white line, however, does not have high contrast to the concrete walkway. This aspect proved to be troublesome for most of the participants. Adding in factors like sunlight and shadows, many of the robots weren’t able to get past the first few gates.
The winning team from the Undergraduate category was Gaussian Blur, comprised of senior electrical and computer engineering majors Billy Keyes, Nolan Hergert, and Chao Wang. Their hard work paid off as they were the only team to successfully navigate through every gate. The feat was accomplished in a time of 2:13.84.
Wang, who participated in the Mobot competition for the first time, found that the most challenging aspect of the competition was allowing the software and hardware to work together to create a cohesive machine. The experience has led him to a new interest in robots.
“I am not going to do robotics as my career, but it definitely tickled my interest in robotics. I may ... build some new robots after college just for fun,” Wang said in an email.
The Open Class category was won by team Pimientos Verdes, comprised of Breogan Amoedo, Julio Ortiz Villajos Maroto, Manuel Lopez Antequera, and Jesus Bonache Martinez, all of whom are staff members of the Robotics Institute. They were able to reach the fifth gate with a time of 1:5.33.
Some of the participants, like Exhibition competitor Eli Richter, came from outside the university. Richter went on to win the Judges’ Choice prize. Although he placed second in the Exhibition category, making it through gate five in 29.24 seconds, the judges wanted to recognize his unique strategy of not following the curved lines.
Richter, who is part of the club HackPittsburgh, said that he’s been a fan of Mobot for years. “I grew up in Pittsburgh; I grew up watching this race. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while,” he said.
Richter said that the experience of working with Mobot has taught him a lot: “I had to build the car, I had to design the sensors, I had to program the robot. It was a really cool experience.”

Can computers identify good writing as well as humans? According to a recent study, they can, and some researchers at Carnegie Mellon had a hand in it.
Elijah Mayfield, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) who is advised by LTI professor Carolyn Rosé, recently participated in a study that looked at how various essay-scoring software programs matched up against human graders. After grading 800 different essays, Mayfield’s software, which he developed with the help of six other LTI researchers, was found to perform just as well as the other programs in terms of assigning an overall score.
“They performed statistically indistinguishably from each other,” Mayfield said of how well the computer programs performed in relation to human graders. “They all were at or slightly above or slightly below human performance.”
These results are just a few years ahead of plans for most states to move their current pencil-based standardized tests to computer-based ones in 2014, according to National Public Radio. 
The hope is that the switch will lessen the cost of administering these tests, as computers would take on more of the grading labor. For example, Ohio could save as much as 40 percent on state testing costs each year by having computer programs play a larger role in grading.
Organized by researchers at the University of Akron, the study compared the scores of 800 student-written essays graded by nine different computer programs, one of which was Mayfield’s open-source “LightSIDE” text mining program.
Most of the programs in the study learned to grade by example. “You need to give it training examples and say, ‘This is what I’m trying to learn to do,’ ” Mayfield explained. “It will take the text and figure out how to do all of that automatically.” In short, the programs would take essays that were graded by humans, and try to mimic the grading patterns on new essays. Mayfield explained that this is the goal of machine learning.
In assessing the quality of an essay, LightSIDE put a lot of weight on sentence structure. 
If the program recognizes a lot of highly structured and complex sentences, then the text is likely to be of high quality. However, in order to spot the complex sentences, the program first has to recognize the various pieces, such as certain parts of speech, that may compose those types of sentences.
“You’ll see things like coordinating clauses or conjunctions, sentences that aren’t just simple statements of facts,” Mayfield said. “If you’re looking at things like prepositional phrases or adverbials, all these things don’t occur in those basic sentences.” Mayfield explained that LightSIDE searches for these types of words and sentence structures because this is what appears to be the elements that human graders concentrate on in the examples that the program learns from.
“What the model has learned is that for human graders, whether they were told to or not, it’s those complex sentences and sentences that show a lot of structure and causality and coordination that they’re giving high scores to,” Mayfield said.
Some of the other vendors took a different approach during the essay-grading study. Their software looked for essay organization, such as how the thesis statement transitioned into the body paragraphs and how it flowed into the conclusion. Those methods worked in terms of assigning scores to essays that were similar to those given by human graders, but LightSIDE, despite its more general approach on assessing the text, did not lag behind in performance.
“Even if you use the simple, local structure of the sentence and the state-of-the-art machine learning, we can manage to match the performance of the vendors who are using all this complex rubric-based technology,” Mayfield said.
While the computer programs were able to assign a single score to an essay just as well as human graders could, the programs still lack the ability to recognize more abstract properties of an essay, such as creativity.
“As it gets to, ‘Does this person have literary worth? Is this person creative?’, Those are questions that are much harder for machine learning to do,” Mayfield said. “I don’t think we’re at a point yet in that domain that we can match human graders.”

Repeated thudding noises on your window might have you looking at small white pellets, commonly known as hail. Hail is a form of precipitation: Small pieces of ice fall from the sky and cause more than a billion dollars in damage each year, according to the National Weather Service Forecast Office.
During severe weather, a convective cell can form in the air. A convective cell refers to warm air rising and cool air sinking in the same space. As the warm air rises, it cools and eventually turns back into liquid form. If the air continues rising to where the temperature in the atmosphere is below freezing, water will supercool; when there is enough of this supercooled water, it begins accumulating as ice in clouds.
Strong updrafts, also present during severe weather, push up on the ice in the clouds, keeping them suspended. However, when the updraft stops, the ice falls down again. The process is repeated over and over as the ice begins collecting layers to form hailstones. According to weather.about.com, “If you cut a hailstone in half, you would see alternating concentric layers inside it.”
Larger hailstones form when the hailstone falls and melts as it encounters warmer temperatures only to be pulled by updrafts to refreeze. Multiple cycles of this process can result in extremely large hailstones. Hailstones as large as eight inches in diameter have been found in the central United States.
The ideal conditions for the formation of hailstones are found in tall clouds; these reach high into the atmosphere, allowing for a wide range of atmospheric temperatures in the cloud. The below-freezing temperature would be found higher, while warmer temperatures would be lower. As warm air rises within the cloud, it will freeze near the top. As it falls, it will melt and updrafts will push the ice back up the cloud to refreeze. Often, swirling updrafts like those found within a tornado are ideal for hail formation.
A hailstone needs a nucleus to form. An ideal nucleus forms when supercooled water droplets or clumps of snow gather together to form clusters. According to www.wisegeek.com, “If a bug, a piece of dirt, a seed, or another small particle gets blown up into the storm cloud, it creates another possible nucleus for a hailstone.” This nucleus serves as a site for ice to build up, but it can also melt in warmer temperatures and collide with other nuclei to form larger clusters.
If the weather is cold and windy enough, the clusters begin to add on layers of ice in a process called accretion, which is very similar to how a candle gains layers when it is dipped into wax. Opaque, white layers form on hailstones when air bubbles get trapped in the icy droplets. Clear layers are formed when large supercooled water droplets freeze upon contact with the emerging hailstone.
As the hailstones grow larger, they gain weight, which increases the chance of being pulled down. If the updrafts are not strong enough to counteract the pull of gravity, the hailstones will fall from the cloud.
Not every hailstone that falls from a cloud will make it to the ground. As the hailstones fall, they enter a warmer atmosphere. Therefore, hailstones can melt in the atmosphere, never reaching the ground as concrete objects; these hailstones become rain. 
The outer layers of hailstones also melt when they come into contact with other precipitation in the air.
Hail showers are not limited to cold weather, since hail formation is dependent on the temperature in the upper atmosphere. On a very warm day, for example, the humid air can rise very quickly into a mass of cold air in the atmosphere and supercool, initiating hail formation.
With a hot and humid summer coming up, keep in mind that hail can still form. It is generally advisable to stay inside if hail begins falling, especially since the speed at which some fall can be harmful. Large hailstones can also cause damage to pets, outdoor furniture, and vehicles, so moving them inside a garage would be ideal protection.

New species of gecko discovered in Papua New Guinea
A new species of gecko with black and gold bands across its body was discovered deep in the jungles of Papua New Guinea. 
The lizard, which measures about 13 cm in length, was given the species name Nactus kunan for its distinct color pattern — “kunan” means “bumblebee” in the locals’ Nali language. The gecko’s color scheme makes it easier to conceal itself on the forest floor.
“It belongs to a genus of slender-toed geckos, which means these guys don’t have the padded, wall-climbing toes like the common house gecko,” said Robert Fisher of the U.S. Geological Survey Western Ecological Research Center. Fisher, along with other biologists, discovered the new species.

Photoreceptor transplants let blind mice see
Scientists at University College London (UCL)’s Institute of Ophthalmology have restored the sight of night-blind mice by transplanting light-sensitive photoreceptor cells into their eyes. Night-blindness is a condition that effectively renders its victims blind in low-light conditions.
“We’ve shown for the first time that transplanted photoreceptor cells can integrate successfully with the existing retinal circuitry and truly improve vision,” said UCL professor Robin Ali in the report. “We’re hopeful that we will soon be able to replicate this success ... and eventually to develop human trials.”
Ali and his team claim that once their treatment has been optimized for human patients, it can be used to treat a variety of degenerative eye diseases.

Progress made on objective depression diagnosis
A team of Northwestern University researchers developed a new method for diagnosing depression through a blood test. The team focused on early-onset depression, which occurs in teens and young adults. The researchers identified 26 blood markers for depression based on research done on depressed and anxious rats, which are known to mirror many of the behavioral attitudes found in human patients. 
From there, the team ran tests on 14 teenagers with depression and another 14 without. The tests found 11 blood markers in the depressed teens that were absent in the blood of the non-depressed test subjects. The researchers hope their findings pave the way for a more objective approach to diagnosing early-onset depression.

A smile a day keeps the doctor away
A review of more than 200 studies by Harvard School of Public Health researchers suggests that happier people have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. 
The researchers revealed that factors such as optimism, life satisfaction, and general happiness reduced a subject’s risk of heart and circulatory diseases, in spite of the subject’s age, socioeconomic status, smoking status, or body weight. Disease risk was 50 percent lower in the most optimistic individuals. 
The researchers stressed, however, that their work only implies this correlation and should not be regarded as definite proof.

Polar bears did not descend from brown bears
A team of European and American scientists are reporting that polar bears, long thought to have branched off from brown bears about 150,000 years ago, are not at all descended from brown bears. The researchers came to this conclusion after comparing DNA samples from 19 polar bears, 18 brown bears, and seven black bears. 
Their analysis showed that the brown bear and the polar bear had a common ancestor, but their lines split about 600,000 years ago. The new findings challenge the previously held belief that bears adapted very quickly, meaning that the survival of the polar bear may be further threatened by aggressive climate change.

The Midway tent was packed last Thursday night, with many who couldn’t get tickets lined up in the back, in preparation for the annual Spring Carnival comedy performance. This year, CollegeHumor.com comedian Streeter Seidell opened for headliner Nick Offerman, who is known for his role as Ron Swanson on the television show Parks and Recreation.
While both comedians are big guys with a decent amount of facial hair, their styles are very different. This contrast between the acts made for an excellent comedy show.
Unsurprisingly, Seidell’s comedy rested on college life and issues. From the “Freshman 15” — for four consecutive years, in his case — to the perpetual sickness that many college students suffer from, his humor appealed to the audience. His observational jokes were full of insight on the life of a college student.
There were times when Seidell strayed to the gross and vulgar side (particularly with descriptions of naked old people in the campus locker room), but even then the crowd was overcome with laughter. At times his formula and material seemed borrowed from articles and videos on CollegeHumor.com, but the crowd of college students enjoyed it (no doubt a reason for the website’s popularity). Overall, his performance was consistently funny. He could have very well been the main performer if his routine had gone on longer.
After Seidell wrapped up his portion of the show, Offerman’s entrance truly riled up the crowd. Shirtless and wearing a Booth hardhat, he leaped on stage, stretching his leg against the back rails. This, along with him buttoning up his patriotic shirt adorned with stars and stripes, made for an excellent introduction into his act.
The performance involved lots of humorous moments that only Offerman could bring to Carnegie Mellon. His deadpan humor was present throughout the performance, which centered on of his “Ten Tips for a Prosperous Life.”
Offerman made a point to separate himself from the character of Ron Swanson while still exhibiting the kind of humor he is known for on Parks and Recreation. He discussed his personal life often, with tales of his wife of 12 years, actress and comedian Megan Mullaly. His show was interspersed by comedic songs played on guitar, a talent fans were most likely unaware of prior to his performance.
Throughout the show, Offerman built his credibility with the Carnegie Mellon crowd in an unexpected way: He demonstrated his vast knowledge of the book series Lord of the Rings. While initial references to hobbits weren’t incredibly nerdy, the deeper comparisons between David Bowie and Elrond and the mere mention of lembas bread showed a side of Offerman that wasn’t expected, but was appreciated by the audience.
However, there were times when the show seemed to drag on. Noticeable gaps without any laughter populated the latter half of the show. This may have been a side effect of framing the show with the “Ten Tips for a Prosperous Life.” However, it clearly contrasted with Seidell’s shorter yet more consistently funny performance.
But where Offerman lacked comedic stamina, he made up for it with heart. The show felt like it wasn’t merely a standup routine, but truly a message he was trying to get across to the crowd of Carnegie Mellon students. Behind the laughs and songs, his advice was something to learn from.
It may not have made for the best comedy show, but Offerman’s performance still affected the audience strongly. The seventh of his ten tips, “Avoid the Mirror,” was particularly powerful. He stuck on the point, “If you have a body, you’re beautiful. If you have a nose, you’re beautiful.” After repeating this sentiment a few times with great sincerity, a girl in the audience was overheard saying that she was going to cry.
The comedy show at Spring Carnival featured two hilarious comedians. Through his ability to relate to the audience, Seidell had the audience consistently laughing. Offerman maintained the style of humor he was known for without being pigeonholed as Ron Swanson. The contrast between the performances enhanced the overall experience, creating a memorable show that will be hard to top in years to come.

The theme of this year’s Spring Carnival, “As Seen On TV,” allowed for a number of creative individual booth themes, but also provided some challenges for certain organizations. Instead of basing booths on cheesy infomercials, as the theme might suggest, most groups chose television shows for their booth themes.
Patrick White, senior mechanical engineering major and Midway chair, organized the judging and helped pick the theme. “It ended up between ‘At the Theater’ and ‘As Seen On TV,’ ” he said. “And then ‘As Seen On TV’ won the final vote.”
With its Indiana Jones-themed booth, Kappa Alpha Theta came away with first place in the Sorority category. The sorority’s booth was highly detailed and, despite certain touches being ruined by the rain, it created an all-encompassing environment for visitors to explore and enjoy. Visitors were taken on tours in small groups, led by members of Kappa Alpha Theta. This tour-style presentation made the booth seem more like an experience than other booths, where visitors just walked through and looked around on their own.
The Asian Student Association won first place in the Independent Organizations category this year. Its booth was based on Looney Tunes and featured a number of creative touches. While the Asian Student Association’s theme wasn’t terribly novel, its booth was well-constructed and deserved the win.
Featuring an impressive façade that mirrored the exterior of Squidward’s Easter Island statue-shaped house, Spongebob’s pineapple-shaped house, and the Krusty Krab, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Spongebob Squarepants-themed booth won first place in the Fraternity category. With such an amazing exterior, the fraternity’s booth grabbed visitors’ attention before they even entered. The inside of the booth featured different rooms from the cartoon show and included details like glowing jelly fish. With its attention to accuracy and detail, Sigma Phi Epsilon created a memorable booth that stood out from the others.
In the Blitz category, Lambda Phi Epsilon won first place for its World Cup-themed booth, which featured a miniature field where visitors could play soccer. Upon first glance, it didn’t even look like a booth, but it actually provided a nice space for some of the younger visitors to play and run around.
Second place in the Sorority category went to Delta Gamma for its Shark Week-themed booth and Delta Tau Delta for its Lunar Landings booth in the Fraternity category. Delta Gamma’s booth, which featured several fake large sharks, sand on the bottom floor, and a laser-cut ship’s wheel, was one of the more impressive and enjoyable booths to walk through, and it was clear that the sorority members had spent a lot of time constructing it.
Third place in the Sorority category went to Alpha Chi Omega for its traveling circus-themed booth. While the booth did not really fit the overall theme of “As Seen On TV,” it was nicely decorated and felt very sturdy. Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Pinky and the Brain booth won third place in the Fraternity category.
Not all booths were so enjoyable, however, as some felt like they were thrown together at the last minute.
Fringe’s Planet Earth-themed booth was underwhelming, despite its theme being one of the best. BioSAC’s MythBusters booth featured interesting facts, but it was not very exciting to walk through.
This year’s theme of “As Seen On TV” opened up an opportunity for creative booths, and while some organizations did a great job with the theme, others chose themes that did not quite fit. “There’s a lot of room for interpretation, so it’s always interesting to see what people can come up with,” White said. “I think a lot of them you could actually link back [to the theme] pretty easily.”
“We’ve been trying to make the booths a lot safer and stronger and I think we’ve done a lot of good stuff with it,” White said. The increased safety standards imposed this year and the inclement weather provided an interesting challenge for many booths, but ultimately did not hinder the outflow of creativity on Midway.

Not even the cold, less-than-ideal weather could keep students from gathering on the College of Fine Arts lawn to watch Passion Pit perform live. As Spring Carnival 2012 came to an end, Carnegie Mellon students and non-affiliated Pittsburghers alike came together at the concert, sponsored by AB Concerts, which began with a performance by WRCT’s DJ Gusto and local band Donora.
At 7:30 p.m., Gusto began mixing music to entertain the growing crowd. According to Gusto’s fan and friend, Deren Guler — a master’s student in architecture who waved a supportive sign during his friend’s performance — the DJ uses Serato turntables, allowing him to scratch music playing from his computer instead of phonographic records.
“He uses a lot of hip hop and electronic — it’s accessible stuff, but he keeps it interesting. He has really great flow and rhythm. It’s never choppy,” Guler said. “He has awesome Hispanic and Latin influences as well.”
Gusto wrapped up after 30 minutes; the stage was then readjusted for local indie pop sensation, Donora. The band, headed by vocalist and guitarist Casey Hanner, opened with its song “The Untouchables.” The group’s vibrant onstage presence was matched by colorful images exploding onto a projection screen.
“You’re all very brave for coming out in this weather. But I don’t blame you, because I want to see Passion Pit too,” Hanner said to the crowd.
During the band’s performance of the song “Mancini’s Dance Hall,” a large inflatable penguin — which would later end up in the hands of Passion Pit’s lead vocalist Michael Angelakos — began to make its way through the crowd.
Passion Pit finally took the stage at around 9:20 p.m., welcomed by the deafening din of an anxious audience. The tangible excitement was reciprocated by the band. Angelakos almost never stood still, jumping and moving from one side of the stage to the other, as he worked his way through the set of songs. The band played the familiar hits that made it popular, including “Better Things” and “Sleepyhead,” as well as a number of songs from its upcoming album.
Before performing the new song “Carried Away,” Angelakos spotted an enthusiastic audience member towering over the crowd as he stood upright on the shoulders of another concert-goer.
“You,” Angelakos said, pointing right at the fan, “have impeccable balance. I want to see how long you can keep that up. Stay right there. I’m going to sing this next song directly to you.”
Angelakos continued to build a rapport with the audience throughout the show, making explicit declarations of his positive feelings for Carnegie Mellon’s campus and students. He also asked that the audience promise to attend the next show Passion Pit performs in Pittsburgh.
Sophomore physics major Samuel Greess thought Passion Pit was an excellent choice for this year’s Spring Carnival concert. “Much better than Big Boi,” he said, referencing last year’s performer. “They’re a good band. I’m a fan, and I’ve been to their concert before.”
Hannah Douglas, a first-year student in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, was also enthusiastic about AB’s choice of Passion Pit for the concert. “I’m proud of CMU. I love that the school is so in touch with what’s popular with our generation,” she said.
While the general sentiment among audience members was positive, the concert was not unanimously well-received. Sophomore chemical engineering major Ian Dolan was among the disappointed, saying of Passion Pit’s music, “I think the melodies are weak, the harmonies are trite, and the overall feel is boring.”
After an encore performance, the concert literally ended with a bang: The annual fireworks display was the perfect finale to the exciting night, bringing Spring Carnival 2012 to a close.

From the moment the lights dimmed, it was clear that The Drowsy Chaperone was not your conventional Broadway musical. The whining voice of the narrator instantly made an impression with his grumbling criticism: “I hate theater. Well, it’s so disappointing, isn’t it?”
These first lines were certainly an unusual way to gain the audience’s favor with any theater production, but it became clear as the story unfolded that the creators of the musical knew exactly what they were doing. With its playful approach to the fourth wall, The Drowsy Chaperone, as portrayed by members of Scotch’n’Soda, celebrated and satirized theater.
The musical, which takes place in the 1920s, describes the tumultuous events leading up to the wedding of Janet Van De Graff, played by senior vocal performance major Caity Pitts, a showgirl who is leaving a career of stardom for what she believes to be true love. A series of amusing and chaotic mishaps, including the neglect of Janet’s drowsy chaperone, reveals the drama and absurdity of the human experience.
However, mere plot description only tells half of the story. Sophomore computer science major Matthew Alsup carried the show impeccably with his portrayal of the character described simply as the Man in Chair, who observes the events of the show from the comfort of a chair in his home, isolated from the rest of the set. This crotchety but passionate character started off the show as a narrator of sorts: By starting and stopping a recording of the show on his record player, he was able to pause and resume the action onstage, as if the show were not a live performance but instead a recorded one.
The humorous and bitter commentary of the Man in Chair continued throughout, and he quickly grew to have a much more important role. Occasionally he stopped the recording to add sardonic remarks, acting as an omniscient voice of sorts, commenting on the characters and events of the musical and showcasing his extensive knowledge of theater. Despite his sarcasm, the Man in Chair had an obvious soft spot in his heart for this musical and he added a personal dimension to the events of the show, alluding to his own bitter romantic history as the audience watched the characters on stage.
This fascinating and surprisingly relatable character would not have been done justice without the outstanding performance of Alsup. Despite the daunting amount of material to memorize, Alsup hardly stuttered, delivering the sharp commentary of the Man in Chair with a comically overdramatic air.
Alsup’s performance was by no means the only outstanding one; the entire show was sprinkled with vibrant characters played by equally vibrant actors. Senior voice major Gillian Hassert excelled as the nonchalant, imperious Drowsy Chaperone. Meanwhile, other characters such as the bumbling Mrs. Tottendale (played by Christine de Carteret, a bachelor of humanities and arts student in history and architecture) and the self-proclaimed Latin lover Adolpho (played by first-year voice major Joel Goodloe) brightened the musical with their hilarious antics.
Beyond the content of the musical, the original creators of the show took the opportunity to make broader commentary about the nature of the theater. At various parts of the show, they made it a point to remind the audience that the musical they were viewing was just a musical — an effect that is the exact opposite of what writers and producers usually try to achieve.
Mostly, this effect occurs through the role of the Man in Chair as a sort of barrier between the characters and the audience: Just as audience members started to empathize with the drama onstage, some unexpected interruption rudely drew them back to reality. At one point, much to the audience’s confusion, the Man in Chair played an entire scene from a very different musical after accidentally selecting the wrong record from its sleeve. In another scene, the Man in Chair’s house lost power just at the culminating dramatic moment of the musical, ruining the mood of the show.
Though at times distracting and confusing, these clever interruptions had an interesting effect. They drew the audience’s attention to the mesmerizing ability of a theater production by repeatedly shattering its illusion of reality. As The Drowsy Chaperone suggests, the magic of a captivating show is enough to make its viewers believe in false characters in a false setting, yet this spell can be broken by something as simple as the sound of a telephone ring.
The Drowsy Chaperone thus engaged its audience in a wide range of ways, with vibrant actors and an amusing tale paired with challenging commentary. This musical, impeccably performed by members of Scotch’n’Soda, captivated viewers with a rich and multilayered production that proved to be much more thoughtful and complex than it at first seemed.

The way the event was advertised, one would have thought that costumes from the immensely popular British drama Downton Abbey would have been on display in the lobby of the Purnell Center for the Arts last Friday afternoon. Instead, it ended up being a tour of the costume shop and a commentary on both the drama school’s collection of historical clothing and on the clothing used in the BBC show, which — while a bit of a surprise to the 20–30 visitors who attended — was nonetheless fascinating.
The tour began with a short interview with the school’s costume design shop manager Ken Chu, who described his job and that of students and staff working in the School of Drama’s costume shop. He half-joked that his department is one of the busiest in the school, providing costumes for about 22 shows per year, which is a staggering number compared to the 10–12 shows per year produced by regional theater companies. “But everyone says that [they’re the busiest],” he said smiling.
Chu and Amanda Jenkins, the wardrobe supervisor and rentals manager, then led the group upstairs to the costume shop, where some of the school’s period dresses were on display. “Some of these dresses are from as early as 1870,” Chu said, pointing at a floral-pattern dress that was originally white, but has since faded and thinned like old parchment.
Chu and Jenkins were joined by costume staffers Marlene Speranza and Leslie Maxson, described by Chu as the staff tailor and draper, respectively. Jenkins then took the floor to talk about what everyone was actually there for: the costumes of Downton Abbey.
She pulled out two copies of what looked like a ragged, book-bound newspaper with miniscule type and expert drawings of extremely tall, turn-of-the-century-fashioned women. These were fashion magazines from around the era of the second season of Downton Abbey, around the beginning of World War I. The costumes in the show attempt to be true representations of how the wealthy “upstairs” people would have dressed at the time, Jenkins said.
In the first season, set in the late Edwardian era (the season opens with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912), the in-style look was slim and column-like — a “tunic/hobble-skirt look,” as Jenkins called it. Since women weren’t exactly industrial workers at the time, the dresses — although more comfortable than the corsets and voluptuous gowns of earlier eras — were still not made for quick movement. “They’re not called hobble-skirts for no reason,” Jenkins said.
As time progresses in the show, so does the wardrobe: In one episode, one of the younger female characters, Sybil, wears “harem pants,” much to the horror and surprise of some of the other characters (actress Maggie Smith’s character was not amused).
Jenkins, who often works with clothing rentals for film, noted that the show is very realistic about how often women changed their clothes in this period. Even wealthy families were not so rich as to have closets packed with hand-made dresses and gowns; thus, women would have a few choice morning and day dresses, and would dress again later in an evening gown. If one watches the wardrobe in the show carefully, one notices that characters reuse their gowns very often.
Speranza commented that, while the show is rather true to the past, the women’s hair is toned down in Downton Abbey from what it actually would have been like in the 1910s. The costumers also have to think about their audience, she said. “It would have been much more extreme, and pretty distracting, if they made the hair how it would have been at the time,” Speranza explained.
The Carnegie Mellon costume shop staff suspects that Downton Abbey’s third season will open with more Jazz Age-style costumes, since it will be set in 1920. Season three won’t begin airing until next year.

Student group OM hosted a celebration for the Hindu holiday Holi last Saturday in Porter Hall and on Flagstaff Hill for interested students. The holiday, known as the Festival of Colors, is notable for how participants throw colored powder at each other. Most end up completely covered in all sorts of different bright shades. The event has a positive reputation on campus and draws large crowds every year.
Holi is a holiday that welcomes in the new season, celebrating the passing of winter and the arrival of spring through fun and festivities. While a Pittsburgh spring often consists of a few inches of snow and freezing temperatures, it was difficult to dampen the mood. The cold and wet day did nothing to deter students from packing the basement of Porter Hall.
OM accommodated well for the weather by hosting the pre-celebration preparations in Porter Hall. Participants received a free T-shirt for the event, printed with OM’s tagline for this year’s celebration, “Color Me If You Can.” Another nice touch was the Indian buffet open to those celebrating the holiday.
After a few small rain delays, the main portion of the celebration began on Flagstaff Hill. Packets of colored powder were sold for $1 outside Porter Hall, with which participants went wild. The chaos of all of the colors being thrown in the air and at other participants was incredibly fun. Anticipating when someone may hit you with a handful of powder was important, especially if you didn’t want to cough up blue for the rest of the day. While the event is usually attended by various groups of friends, the lines between friends, acquaintances, and strangers disappeared with the white of the T-shirts.
Overall, OM’s Holi celebration on campus was a truly unique and fun experience. The experience of being covered in all sorts of colors, blending together with a palette of friends and strangers alike, is truly memorable, and is an experience all Carnegie Mellon students should have.

Seamlessly switching between extended jam sessions and familiar material, Brooklyn-based psychedelic folk band Woods played an excellent show at Garfield Artworks last Saturday. The band’s performance was preceded by shorter sets by MMOSS, another psychedelic band from New Hampshire, and Unicycle Loves You, a Chicago-based noise pop band.
MMOSS, in particular, was a perfect opener for Woods. With its droney guitars set off by an earthy flute, MMOSS set the tone for the rest of the concert. MMOSS just finished recording its newest album and released the first single, “Spoiled Sun,” from the album in early April. Many of the audience members seemed unfamiliar with the band’s music, but the sound was similar to that of Woods, and the set was enjoyable.
After a short break, Woods took the stage. The band is comprised of singer-guitarist Jeremy Earl, tape-effects technician G. Lucas Crane, bassist Kevin Morby, and multi-instrumentalist Jaris Taveniere.
The group played songs from nearly all of its five studio albums, including fan favorites like “Time Fading Lines” from 2010’s At Echo Lake, “Rain On” from 2009’s Songs of Shame, and “Pushing Onlys” from 2011’s Sun and Shade. Perhaps the best part of the concert was Woods’ continuous transition between actual songs and seemingly impromptu jam sessions. After 15 minutes of hazy guitar loops and repetitive percussive beats, Earl would break the trance with his almost whiny vocals, entering the next song.
The subtle vocal harmonies present on Woods’ recorded albums were hardly noticeable in the band’s live performance, likely a result of the decent-at-best PA system at Garfield Artworks. Despite the sound system, Garfield Artworks was the perfect venue for this concert, creating an intimate and welcoming atmosphere. The small venue was fairly crowded, with enthusiastic fans standing on the chairs lining the walls and gathering close around the small stage.
Overall, Woods put on a strikingly sincere performance, with Earl’s vocals easily floating over the rest of the group’s layered guitars and percussion. The musical talent of the group was evident in their live set, always keeping track of each other’s movements and the audience’s vibes.
Earl also runs Woodsist, a Brooklyn-based lo-fi record label that releases all of Woods’ albums in addition to those of other psych-folk bands like Ganglians, Sun Araw, Psychedelic Horseshit, Raccoo-oo-oon, and The Fresh & Onlys. Woodsist also hosts a two-day music festival every summer in Big Sur, Calif., that features the label’s bands.

Dear Patrick,
My friend can’t help himself around women, especially when he’s been drinking. He usually just makes an ass of himself, but recently he keeps going after the same women as me. Last time he started off trying to wingman me and wound up spending the night with her. What’s the most acceptable form of punishment?
Thanks,
Babes Lacking, Other Chap Keeps Enchanting Dames
Dear BLOCKED,
Your friend sounds like a terrible wingman. He seems to have skipped over that entire chapter in the Bro Code. However, his actions could just be because of poor communication. In that case, make sure he knows what girl you’re interested in and vice-versa so there’s no conflict.
Now that may help you in the future, but he still needs to know that there are consequences for his previous actions. As the bigger man, you won’t hold a grudge, but you may want to remind him that accidents do happen. Maybe his brakelines get cut. Maybe he wakes up with a doll’s head in his bed. Maybe his face just accidentally runs into your fist.
It’s not assault if he deserves it,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I recently graduated, but came back to Carnegie Mellon for Spring Carnival. While here, I can’t help running into people I didn’t want to see or talk to. How can I avoid them in the future without seeming rude?
Sincerely,
Just Avoiding Greetings, Otherwise Feeling Flustered
Dear JAGOFF,
You have a few options. First, you can just never come to Carnegie Mellon again. This is probably the easiest option, but you may miss out on some important events, like your brother’s graduation. That might not matter to you, but you probably don’t want to deal with your parents’ yelling.
Instead, try projecting the right attitude. The key is to seem busy. However, that may be harder than it looks. All you have to do is appear angry. Angry people always have something to do, and no one wants to spend time with them. Just apologize angrily and say you have to go. They’ll be too put off to keep talking.
If it worked for George Costanza, it’ll work for you,
Patrick Hoskins

Think of your favorite song. Regardless of whether it has lyrics or not, it probably elicits some sort of emotional response from you. Then again, even if a song isn’t your favorite, it is still most likely tied to a set of emotions and feelings. Can music even exist apart from a connection to the human condition? While this may seem impossible, I would urge you to consider the music of Monolake as a possible contender for completely soulless music.
Robert Henke, the man behind Monolake, has boldly produced music that severs itself from any emotional connection. This year, Henke released the album Ghosts, a sonically dense album that utilizes numerous simultaneous polyrhythmic melodies within a single track. The album features vocal samples of computer voices and, according to Henke, is based on a series of short stories he wrote; however, unlike most of his other work as Monolake, no sort of emotional connection is created. Ghosts recalls the sounds of IDM, garage, minimal techno, and dubstep, but these sounds are manifested as skeletal ghosts that bar themselves from human touch.
The idea of soulless and emotionless music may be alarming to some, but it is truly a remarkable achievement. I have never heard an album so meticulously crafted and mastered. The fact that each sound makes a statement solely based on its compositional strength and relationship to form, rather than its perceived emotional connection to the listener, forces the listener to pay attention to the physical effect each sound has on the body. When performing live, Monolake treats its audience to a multi-channel surround-sound experience complete with a spellbinding visual accompaniment. While witnessing this spectacle, listeners feel no thoughts of anger, darkness, love, happiness, or any other sort of emotion; rather, they are completely entranced by the physical effect the sound has on the body.

100 years ago: April 18, 1912

The Waffle Shop, located at 124 South Highland Ave., has become a unique part of the Pittsburgh arts community over the past four years. The Waffle Shop and the programs it facilitates will continue to operate through the summer. However, the popular combination art project and restaurant will close its doors on Aug. 1.
Although it serves primarily breakfast fare, the Waffle Shop is only open between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Sundays and from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Over waffles, patrons are invited to discuss art, politics, or anything they desire. The conversations are filmed and broadcast live, and highlight reels are released on the Waffle Shop’s website. The building also houses Conflict Kitchen, an affiliated project that sells takeout food from countries the U.S. is in conflict with.
“After four years of operation, I feel that [the Waffle Shop] has kind of run its course,” said Carnegie Mellon art professor Jon Rubin, one of the founders of the project. “We have to raise a lot of money to support the project. Our food sales cover about 40 percent, and the rest comes from foundation support. We get a lot of support from [East Liberty Development, Inc.], and our landlord’s been very generous with us. But it’s quite a bit of money to have to raise on a yearly basis, and I’m not sure we can keep doing it. We have fewer people coming to the project, so our numbers have been going down for the past year slowly.”
Rubin said that the Waffle Shop has had a successful four years. “I think it’s been an amazing run, especially for the students who have worked as employees,” he said. “All good things come to an end.”
Rubin plans to focus future efforts on Conflict Kitchen, which will soon be moving to a Downtown location to increase visibility.
The Waffle Shop’s closing will also have a large impact on some other programs, such as the Waffle Wopp, a talk show for teens run by the mentoring organization Hip-Hop on L.O.C.K.
“[The closing is] devastating to the Wopp, and we hope we can continue to run this program,” Jamar Thrasher, Chief Communications Officer for Hip-Hop on L.O.C.K., said. “We provide this service to over 2,000 students.”
In the past, the Waffle Shop has provided both equipment and its unique environment to the Waffle Wopp. Despite the loss this poses for his organization, Thrasher maintains a positive attitude. 
“We still have a great relationship with the shop. We have a huge relationship with CMU. I think it’s great [Carnegie Mellon] students are involved; we really get to see the work ethic of theirs,” he said.
Sophomore art major Nathan Trevino said that late-night trips to the Waffle Shop are a College of Fine Arts tradition. “I know almost all the art school is going to miss the Waffle Shop. It was just a thing that we did. It was late, so we went and got waffles,” he said.
Trevino summed up his opinion of the Waffle Shop as a whole: “Go there now.”

Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul stopped by his home town of Pittsburgh last Friday to speak as part of his presidential campaign trail. About 2,300 people attended his speech at the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum. His message, which emphasized the importance of an isolationist foreign policy and the dangers of an overreaching government, drew enthusiastic applause from his audience.
“Dr. Paul’s message of liberty has been resonating strongly among young people all over the country,” said Christina Garmon, a master’s student studying French horn performance and the leader of the Carnegie Mellon Youth for Ron Paul chapter. “With Pittsburgh having such a large student population, it is a great location for him to speak.”
The crowd was mostly composed of the students and young adults who have come to form a large demographic of Paul’s supporters. They broke into applause and chants of “President Paul” as he made his entrance.
“If the election was limited to those between the ages of 18 and 30, I might well win this election hands down,” Paul said.
Paul started his speech with a commentary on the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the U.S. The Federal Reserve’s leverage over the economic policies of the public and private sectors has come into question by Paul, especially in light of the recent recession. Paul’s critical comments incited the crowd into a deafening roar of “End the Fed!” to which, after it had died down, he replied, “That sounds like a very good idea.”
“For the first time in history, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve is one of the big issues of the campaign,” Paul said. “I propose next year, after the election, we pass a bill that repeals the Federal Reserve Act.” This exclamation also drew a loud applause.
Paul then shifted his focus to the global war on terrorism. He said that it has been one of the most “overbearing” wars the U.S. has ever fought. Paul compared the War on Terror to World War II, claiming that the length of time U.S. soldiers were exposed to immediate danger then was very short compared to the war today. He also expressed a concern for the thousands of soldiers coming back from overseas with injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder — a concern that may have stemmed from his medical background as a doctor.
“If we care about our active duty people,” Paul said, “if we care about our national defense, [and] if we care about our veterans, we [should] change our foreign policy, defend this country, and not be the policeman of the world.”
Paul also detailed his stances on a variety of other national issues. He said that the defeated Stop Online Piracy Act and the proposed Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act are too controlling, while the 2001 Patriot Act “penalized American citizens.” He also pointed to the prejudices that drug laws have toward minorities, and even suggested that we “get rid of all the drug laws.” He also highlighted the benefits of using gold as acceptable legal tender.
Paul ended his speech on an idealistic note. “The purpose for liberty ... is to pursue virtue and excellence,” he said. “The philosophy of freedom is the only way to achieve not only peace, but prosperity as well.”
Chris Hsu, a sophomore computer science major, enjoyed the message Paul had to offer, even if it wasn’t entirely new to him. Hsu said that he has been a Paul supporter since last summer. 
In fact, Hsu is such a huge fan that he paid $250 to have lunch with Paul and his wife, Carol Paul, along with about 80 other supporters, before the speech.
“It was really surreal,” Hsu said of the luncheon. “It was really weird seeing this visionary person right in front of you.... When he shook [my] hand, it was really firm. He was really friendly.”
Hsu said that one factor that drew him to Paul was his consistent message about liberty.
“It was sort of a realization of what kind of values are actually important for government to hold,” Hsu said. “When I started reading up on Ron Paul, at first I was kind of a skeptic.... What I realized was how solid he was in his statements. He has been saying the same things over and over again. He has not changed in his positions.”
Not everyone who went to the rally had much prior knowledge about the candidate.
“I came here without really knowing his views on a lot of things, but I was impressed by what he had to say,” said Jon Hewson, a sophomore business and finance major at the University of Pittsburgh. “I like a lot of the stuff he had to say about the Fed.... I like the idea of ending the Fed, and I think that will support America as a whole. That is personally what hit me the most.”
Amanda Sassa, a sophomore Spanish major at Pitt, agreed. “I liked what he had to say on liberty, and how there should be less government intervention,” she said. “I also like what he had to say about not censoring the internet.”
“I think if a lot of people listen to what he has to say, a lot of people would change their minds,” Hewson added. “He’s a cool cat.”

Carnegie Mellon’s Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC) was officially renamed the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center on Wednesday, in honor of former University President Robert Mehrabian.
Mehrabian, who served as university president from 1991–97, oversaw the creation of the CIC.
Friends, colleagues, and students of Mehrabian spoke at the dedication ceremony, which was held in the CIC and attended by approximately 100 members of the campus and Pittsburgh communities. The speakers included current University President Jared Cohon; Board of Trustees member Tom McConomy; former Vice Provost for Education Indira Nair; alumna Rebecca Allbrecht Allison, who attended Carnegie Mellon during Mehrabian’s tenure; and President of the Regional Industrial Development Corporation of Southwestern Pennsylvania (RIDC) Donald Smith. Mehrabian himself also spoke.
“When I came here, I felt that Carnegie Mellon was on a great trajectory, and I saw my job as trying to keep it on the trajectory that Robert had laid out,” Cohon said.
Cohon pointed to Mehrabian’s emphasis on undergraduate education as one of the best aspects of his presidency: “I’ve had the experience — and I’m sure Robert did too, when he was president — of going to see alumni from the ’70s and the ’80s, and they would not hesitate to say to me, in very public settings, ‘I hated Carnegie Mellon. I got a great education, but I hated Carnegie Mellon.’ You don’t hear that, I haven’t heard it yet, from someone who graduated in the ’90s.”
“I was a faculty member when President Mehrabian came,” Nair said. “His whole impact on education was amazing. He came here as a president saying that he wanted to bring undergraduate education back up, because we’d had great undergraduate education under President Doherty, and then the next generation was all intent on the research. And so he wanted to bring attention back to undergraduate education, and then he appointed all these committees and made us all work.” Nair said that Carnegie Mellon was one of the most improved universities in the country in terms of graduating student satisfaction in the ’90s.
Many of the speakers emphasized Mehrabian’s role in facilitating tech start-ups and bringing industry to the region.
Nair said that the CIC, which provides laboratory and office spaces to companies that want to collaborate with Carnegie Mellon on innovative projects, was the perfect building to name after Mehrabian. “This was what he was about,” Nair said. “He was as much about education as about this relationship with Pittsburgh, and bringing industry to Pittsburgh.... That industry coming back to Pittsburgh in a different way — not the steel, which is high machine industry, but the high people industry — was Robert. So this is the right place to dedicate to him.” 
Apple, Disney, and Intel all occupy space in the CIC.
Sophomore computer science and statistics double major Kevin Gilbert attended the dedication as part of his role on the President’s Student Advisory Council. “I really wanted to come out to this event because it was under Dr. Mehrabian’s administration that the seeds for the School of Computer Science were born,” Gilbert said. “The School of Computer Science is unique across the entire country. It’s the only one of its kind where computer science is treated as a school and not just as a field. So I was really excited and honored to come to this, to meet the president who was able to accomplish all that.”
In his address, Mehrabian thanked many of the people in attendance who helped him or worked with him during his time as president. He emphasized the contributions that other members of the university and local communities had in bringing industry to the region. “Pittsburgh is a vital, creative environment, and Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh played a great role, but it’s the leadership of Pittsburgh that’s played a great role,” Mehrabian said. “It’s a great place for everybody here.... When it comes to Pittsburgh, we always put our differences aside.”

Warren Washington, an atmospheric scientist, visited campus on Tuesday to lecture on the use and history of climate models to study and predict climate change. Washington, who is a winner of the National Medal of Science and was the second African-American to receive a doctorate in atmospheric sciences, covered the history of the first climate models he worked with back in the ’60s. He also discussed how the accuracy of computer-simulated models has changed, and how with future innovation “we can improve the simulation of the atmosphere.”
After showing “a glimpse into the future of climate modeling,” he discussed the danger that these models are trying to predict. Washington said that carbon dioxide levels will be two to three times higher by 2100 than they were two centuries ago.
When asked how he responds to climate change skepticism, even in the face of evidence like the earlier openings of the Northwest Passage and overall glacial retreat, Washington responded, “Skepticism is good for us in many ways. It makes [scientists] work harder.”
Washington emphasized, however, the need for “open-minded skepticism,” and recounted a story of a skeptical colleague who changed his mind on climate change after designing his own experiment and achieving the same results as Washington and other scientists.
During the lecture, he stressed the improvement in model design for the global climate, from the modern high-resolution ocean models to a new atmospheric grid structure that allows for more accurate simulations of the El Niño and the La Niña effects.
“His use of empirical data and detailed computer models went beyond common environmental rhetoric,” said James Petka, a first-year engineering and public policy and chemical engineering double major who attended the lecture, in an email. “Transforming all of the world’s natural forces into a single computer program is an absolutely incredible feat.”
Coordinator of Student Development M. Shernell Smith, who was one of the people who worked to bring Washington to campus, said that in addition to being accurate, Washington was accessible. “I liked the fact that he was very plain-spoken,” Smith said. “He could bring it down to a place where people who that may not be their interest ... can see the effect the changes have had on their lives.”
Washington addressed two strategies that can be implemented to confront climate change: mitigation, or the reduction or elimination of what is causing the problem; and adaptation, in which society adjusts to what changes will come. 
He said that this problem is far different than that of typical water or air pollution, which fade from the environment within a few years after pollutants are restricted, because greenhouse gases take so long to break down in the atmosphere.
“Stopping on this problem late means we have a large amount of warming in the system that will keep on warming for some time,” Washington said.
Because of this, Washington argued for as much mitigation as possible. Geoengineering methods such as space mirrors or high altitude sulfur injections would limit heat levels in the atmosphere; but according to Washington, they would not solve other problems from greenhouse pollutants, and in many ways are Band-Aids on a broken leg. The strategy Washington recommended to the audience is to reduce the emission of the pollutants themselves.
Without any action done to mitigate the effects of climate change, Washington’s models and his colleagues’ models predict more heat records, fewer cold records,  and stronger rain and snowfall. The models predict that these weather conditions, coupled with severe drought, will result in the northward spread of tropical diseases like malaria and yellow fever, as the increasing temperatures favor their disease vectors.

Study finds Pittsburgh CO2 emissions same as in 1940
A group of researchers led by civil and environmental engineering Ph.D. student Rachel Hoesly and civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy professor H. Scott Matthews recently released findings that show the per capita emission rate in Pittsburgh was the same in 2000 as it was in 1940, even though the overall carbon dioxide emissions in Allegheny County dropped by 1 percent per year between 1970 and 2000.
The study, which was co-led by Michael Blackhurst, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, shows that Pittsburgh’s per capita emissions rates have not changed, despite the disappearance of the carbon dioxide-producing steel industry from the area.
“Pittsburgh lost most of the energy-intensive metals industry and the jobs that went with that era by the 1980s, which led to a very large reduction in energy and carbon emissions,” Matthews said in a university press release.
He then added, “It only reduced the total footprint by 25 percent. Cities will need to develop more rigorous engineering and economic analysis to meet emission goals.”
“The fact that the energy footprint per person hasn’t changed in 30 years is sobering news for metro areas that want to achieve similar reductions,” Blackhurst said in the same press release.
Researchers say studies on death penalty insufficient
According to a new report from a National Research Council committee led by Carnegie Mellon public policy and statistics professor Daniel Nagin, current studies on the effectiveness of the death penalty as a crime deterrent are not sufficient enough to draw concrete conclusions.
The report reviewed research  which had been conducted since a government moratorium on the death penalty was lifted in 1976.
“Fundamental flaws in the research we reviewed make it of no use in answering the question of whether the death penalty affects homicide rates,” Nagin said in a university press release. “We recognize that this conclusion may be controversial to some, but no one is well-served by unsupportable claims about the effect of the death penalty, regardless of whether the claim is that the death penalty deters homicides, has no effect on homicide rates or actually increases homicides.”
The committee officially concluded that current research should not be used to make public policy decisions regarding the death penalty, because it does not sufficiently control for the effects of noncapital and other punishment as deterrents and is based on unfounded assumptions.

Booth is one of the most noticeable and celebrated events of Spring Carnival. It is the only festivity that is truly affected by the overarching theme of Carnival every year; no other activity, such as Sweepstakes or the annual Scotch’n’Soda show, depends on an interpretation of the Spring Carnival theme.
This year, the theme was “As Seen On TV.” Immediately, this idea brought to mind the notorious store with the same name (found in your local strip mall, of course).
The announcement of the theme is always exciting; students can’t help but wonder what diverse and creative booths will come out of each organization. This sets up a certain expectation for Booth, and potential disappointment. Student organizations participating in Booth should be aware of similar themes over the years and should strive to challenge themselves to build unique booths.
Student organizations this year seemed to literally interpret the theme and centered their booth themes on television shows. 
This in itself is completely fine, but the booths were strikingly similar to last year’s booths. Spring Carnival 2011’s theme was “When I Was Your Age” and the booths featured blasts from childhood pasts. This year’s booths did not exactly differentiate themselves from last year’s counterparts: Themes such as Looney Tunes, Blue’s Clues, and Spongebob Squarepants were all present this year. While these shows obviously fell under “As Seen On TV,” they are also fitting for “When I Was Your Age.”
While cartoon shows and other television programs comprise of a significant part of our youth, a greater distinction needs to be made between booths from one year to the next. Part of the problem lies with theme variety.
Spring Carnival themes have the tendency of being recycled after so many years, with novels, TV shows, history, childhood, and locations around the world being topics that consistently appear.
However, to come up with a completely new and original Carnival theme every year would be impossible. 
Thus, it also falls upon the student organizations participating in Booth to create variety from year to year. Students involved in Booth should recognize whether similar booth ideas have happened within their time at Carnegie Mellon, and should thus strive to create a unique experience for annual visitors of Midway during Spring Carnival.
This similarity between booth themes from last year’s Carnival and the current one is disappointing. The Spring Carnival theme should inspire organizations to tackle something they’ve never tackled before, push their creativity, and produce something wholly original. 
The point of changing the overarching theme each year is so organizations can’t just simply recycle their old ideas; it is to prompt ingenuity and imagination.

The relationship between a musician’s life and the consumption of his or her creative output is pretty unpredictable. This past February, both Sony and Apple were slammed for increasing the price of Whitney Houston’s albums The Ultimate Collection and The Greatest Hits in the United Kingdom iTunes store within a day of her death.
Yet when deceased rapper Tupac Shakur “showed up” for a surprise performance at Coachella via computer projection with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, it was generally positively received.
While there is a huge difference between raising the price of an artist’s work less than 24 hours after her death (regardless of whether it was because of an pricing error, as Sony stated) and re-animating the dead, there is a definite factor of irreverence associated with both.
Contrary to popular belief, the Tupac that appeared was not a hologram. It was actually a commercialized version of an illusion called Pepper’s ghost, which projects an image onto a mirror positioned to reflect the image on a piece of thin mesh hung over the front of the stage, creating the illusion of a three dimensional figure. It has angles and shades that give the illusion of depth, but in reality it is simply an image. Dr. Dre has stated that he intends to take this “Pac-o-Gram” on tour in the near future. There is very little about this decision that can be viewed as redeemable. The idea of a dead rapper performing “live” is not only creepy, but ultimately degrades Tupac as a performer and musician.
It is impossible for any two live performances to be the same. With Pepper’s ghost, however, this variability is flattened. Each performance must be perfectly choreographed beforehand, which destroys the spontaneity of a live concert. And really, what’s the point of a concert if there is no spontaneity? However, this is not what is most sinister about “Pac-o-Gram.”
One of the reasons that Tupac is so loved is his singularity as a musician. With “Pac-o-Gram,” you might be able to see Tupac perform at Madison Square Garden, and then see him perform again at a bar two blocks away 30 minutes later. Thus, his uniqueness is essentially destroyed. It is tacky, tasteless, and disrespectful of musicians. But even more frighteningly, it suggests that musicians are more valuable dead than they are alive.
Tupac’s posthumous discography is notoriously huge. Eight albums have been credited to him since his death and this is merely the next step in the desecration of his memory. Make no mistake; his duet with Snoop Dogg at Coachella was awesome to watch and was by all means unexpected. But this is no different than releasing eight albums of “new” material posthumously or raising the album prices of an artist’s work immediately after his or her death.
This is a move motivated by greed and will only succeed in watering down Tupac’s reputation. While death is unfortunate and inevitable, it brings a certain solemnity and gravitas to an artist’s work that is inimitable. This zombification is incredibly disrespectful.

My name is Jesse Kummer. I am the former captain and current treasurer for the ultimate Frisbee team at Carnegie Mellon. I want to discuss leadership.
Having been on the team for five years, I have seen many different personalities in charge. We have all run the team differently. Through this, I have learned that the dynamic of any team can be partially predicted by the actions of the person in charge of said team. I strongly believe that a person in charge should be someone who has been focused toward the organization’s achievements for quite some time.
First of all, a leader has to be someone who is willing to take on the role. It should not be someone who is thrust into the role due to outside shenanigans. The president or captain of an organization must express that desire to other members of the group. 
Once that has been accomplished, a potential leader should outline a definitive set of goals he or she hopes to accomplish while in office. Without a definitive set of goals, there cannot be a system of checks upon that leader. Everything that a leader does needs to be checked alongside his or her goals for the organization. If something does not match up, a member should be able to call the leader out and know why he or she is doing a certain thing.
Having open communication is an integral part of any group dynamic. Anyone should be able to speak to the leader or some sort of adviser or coach and add his or her own thoughts on what the organization should be doing. Without outside checks and balances, an organization may run amok and focus more on holding steady instead of rising up and accomplishing new goals.
Leadership is more than just wanting some organization to succeed. It is wanting to rise up and soar to new heights. Regardless of what group you are in, there is always some vision you have yet to achieve. I believe it is the charge of any leader to figure out the best way to improve either the talent or the visibility of his or her organization.
A leader cannot be simply a holdover for the next person. It cannot be just a title that is passed down. There needs to be a vision; it could be something as simple as improving alumni relations or as deep as changing the entire team dynamic. The point is that there needs to be something unique being brought to the team. If that is not happening, then there needs to be a discussion about what the organization needs at that point in time.
Electing a new leader is a huge issue for any organization. It can end up being a boom or a bust. It is imperative that the organization understands this beforehand and forces those who wish to lead to come up with a plan of action. If this is not done, I fear that a group will stagnate and accomplish little in the upcoming year.
Good luck to every organization that will be experiencing a change in leadership this coming semester. I hope you have passionate individuals looking to take the reins.

The Joint Funding Committee (JFC) finalized student organizations’ budgets this past week, giving us an opportune moment to talk about everyone’s favorite subject: money.
If you’re not involved in any clubs on campus, you might think that JFC allocations don’t affect you, but we argue otherwise. The Student Activities Fee is currently $95 a semester (that’s $190 a year), and a large portion of it is allocated to JFC, which in turn allocates it to student organizations. The newly elected student body vice president for finance wants to increase that fee by 20 percent.
If you haven’t looked at the budgets that just came out, we encourage you to do so. Anyone with an Andrew ID can view them at stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/budgettracker. The site isn’t well-known outside of the world of student activities, but we figure if students are paying $184 annually, they might as well know how that money is being put to use. This year, the JFC allocated a total of $1,120,719.36 to 203 organizations. That’s a lot of money, and that’s just the Pittsburgh campus.
The problem with the activities fee is that it’s the same across the board. All students — undergraduate and graduate students both in Pittsburgh and Qatar — have to pay that same activities fee, whether they use it or not. 
While it would be impossible to establish fees directly proportional to an individual’s involvement in clubs and campus activities, setting the same activities fee for undergraduate, graduate, and Qatar students is unfair. If you look at the JFC budgets for this year, it’s clear that Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh undergraduate population takes the most advantage of the activities fee. In fact, an increase in the fee would be a good thing — for undergraduates. It would allow more organizations to be recognized and to get the budgets they really need to do exciting things on campus.
An increase in the activities fee would not, however, benefit Qatar or graduate students as much. Qatar hardly ever uses its entire allocated activities fee, and the surplus isn’t used immediately for the benefit of students but instead goes into the Qatar Foundation. Similarly, while graduate students on the Pittsburgh campus may participate in their own organizations as well as the same clubs and activities that undergraduate students participate in, they depend primarily on individual departments for event funding.
In 2009, a Campus Conversations report conducted by Student Activities found that 29.2 percent of students polled on the Pittsburgh campus wanted the activities fee to remain the same. On the Qatar campus, 77.5 percent of students polled wanted the fee to remain the same. When students were asked about the maximum increase they would support, the overwhelming responses were either 10 percent or 0 percent.
If the activities fee must be increased, measures should be taken to differentiate among undergraduates, graduates, and Qatar students. It’s time that the fee was separated into different sections, with Pittsburgh undergraduates paying one fee, graduates paying a different fee, and Qatar students also paying a different fee. This way, the fee can be utilized in the specific ways that each group needs. After all, the student activities fee should be just that — for the benefit of the students.

The recent Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, has drawn media attention because of the Secret Service scandal. Unfortunately, what was discussed at the summit has not received as much scrutiny by the U.S. media. The event had no major achievements and, as usual, the Latin American countries stood united in pushing the U.S. to recognize Cuba.
This summit, however, differed from others because the push for Cuba’s recognition and future invitation to the next summit was led by Colombia, the United States’ closest ally in the region. This is surprising, since the Colombian president is a moderate conservative, not known for any communist sympathies. The U.S. needs to reform its policies and work with the suggestions of regional leaders like Colombia in order to achieve true progress.
The current U.S. administration needs to either recognize Cuba — thus ending a policy that injures U.S. influence and respect south of our border — or continue our embargo on Cuba in order to win the swing state of Florida. President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia pointed out as much, stating that the current administration will fold on the issue in three years, presumably after the presidential and midterm elections have passed, when President Barack Obama does not need to appeal to the Cuban-American vote in Florida. Opening trade with Cuba would benefit the U.S. economy, especially southern Florida, and thus benefit the current administration, since the U.S. historically was Cuba’s No. 1 trading partner. Currently, we lag far behind China, Canada, and the Netherlands in terms of trade with Cuba.
The second unique aspect of the summit was Santos’ leadership in the push for ending or at least modifying the U.S. War on Drugs. Drug production in Colombia has decreased over the past six years, yet total drug production in Latin America has remained unchanged, with drug cultivation simply shifting borders. The war on drugs in Latin America is another failing policy for two reasons: It does nothing to affect the so-far inelastic demand in the U.S., and the criminalization of drugs creates a black market premium. Both of these reasons draw the criminal underworld throughout the Americas into the drug trade. Because of this, drug production moves from regions with U.S.-backed anti-narcotic operations to regions lacking such aid.
Colombia’s leadership on both of these issues matters to the U.S. not only because of its status as an ally, but also because — over the past decade — Colombia has risen from a near-failed state suffering a three-sided civil war to a rising star and a regional leader. Although the U.S. has had a questionable past with Latin America, we still can have a role to play if we work with our allies and support decisions made by democratic leaders of all political stripes in Latin America, even if those choices are out of line with U.S. foreign policy.
The candidate that wins the next presidential election will have to compromise with our southern neighbors, or see relations cool with  them. Nicaragua and Ecuador boycotted the summit in protest, and if no change is made by the U.S., several more nations will join them in three years.

On April 14, in Austin, Tx., police officer Thomas Griffin gunned down a man’s dog after reporting to the wrong house. 
The woman who made the call was reporting a case of domestic disturbance to the police, but gave Griffin the incorrect address. Consequently, Griffin arrived at the house of Michael Paxton, who was playing with his Blue Heeler named Cisco in his backyard. Paxton was going to retrieve something from his truck in the driveway when he encountered Griffin, who immediately pulled a gun on him. 
Following behind, an alarmed Cisco barked and began advancing toward Griffin. Paxton — who was still at gunpoint and unable to restrain Cisco — begged the officer not to shoot his dog, stating that he would not bite. Griffin ignored Paxton’s pleas and pulled the trigger, killing Cisco.
Some claim that Griffin was in a stressful situation, not knowing what to expect. But in any case, Griffin was responding to a domestic disturbance call and was ready to use a gun. 
Not only did Griffin hold an innocent man at gunpoint, he also used deadly force on an animal that never attempted to attack him. Cisco was only barking and did not make contact with Griffin. Paxton claimed Cisco was docile and had never acted aggressively toward anyone. Nonetheless, Griffin pulled the trigger and Cisco suffered for the officer’s unwarranted reaction to the situation
I understand that Griffin faced an unpredictable situation when responding to Paxton’s house, but aren’t all police reports unpredictable? Officers are trained to handle stressful situations and unusual circumstances better than the average citizen. 
An advantage of organized law enforcement is standardizing how potentially threatening situations are handled by officers of the law. Police training reiterates these measures — one of the most important being that deadly force should only be used as a last resort. As a police officer, Griffin failed to respond reasonably.
The most angering aspect about this situation is that Griffin is not currently facing any repercussions. 
The Austin police department has done nothing to reprimand him for his lack of sagacity, claiming he acted in self-defense. Paxton has only received an apology from police chief Art Acevedo, not even from Griffin himself. In a video Paxton took after the incident, Griffin looks less than remorseful, making a shrugging gesture with his hands. Griffin had even tried to shift the blame, asking Paxton, “Why didn’t you get the dog?” Apparently, being held at gunpoint is not an excuse anymore.
An online petition called “Justice for Cisco” urges the Austin police department to reprimand Griffin. The petition currently has over 32,000 signatures, well on its way to the goal of 50,000. 
I am disgusted by the Austin police department’s apathy to such a breach of justice. They need to recognize their wrongdoings, or people will continue to suffer from similar mistakes and rash actions made by law enforcement in the future. 
The Austin police department has neglected its duty to righteousness; it is now our job to preserve it.
The petition can be found at www.change.org.
