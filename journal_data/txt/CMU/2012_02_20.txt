“Linsanity” is sweeping the nation. The story of Jeremy Lin, the undrafted New York Knicks guard from Harvard University, has exploded in the media since his performance on Feb. 4 against the New Jersey Nets. He is the ultimate underdog. Two weeks ago, he was unsure of his job security; now he’s the Eastern Conference Player of the Week. He has set the record for the most points scored in a player’s first six starts, and he single-handedly put the Knicks back into playoff contention when they were falling by the wayside.
Lin led the Palo Alto High School basketball team to a California state championship, but he wasn’t recruited to a single Division I basketball program. He went to Harvard University, where the academic competition is strong but the athletic prowess is not. Lin played against substandard competition but still solidified himself as a good college player.
He was undrafted out of college, but was signed last year by the Golden State Warriors and struggled to stay on the team. After getting cut by the Warriors, he was signed by the Houston Rockets and cut before he was able to play a single game. Ironically, Lin has since blossomed with the Knicks.
Lin’s rise to fame could not have come at a better time for the NBA. With the end of the NFL season, the NBA was ready to capture the interest of the American public. Basketball fans are always aware of the up-and-coming NBA stars before the players are even out of high school — Miami Heat forward LeBron James’ high school games were broadcast on ESPN.
Typically, the big stories involving young players center around them failing to reach their potential. That is why Lin’s story is much more enthralling. He came out of nowhere and captivated the sports world, both in America and abroad. In the U.S., Lin’s jerseys have become a leading seller in sports apparel. Globally, multiple Asian television providers now carry Knicks games, so the first Taiwanese-American NBA player can be broadcast across the world.
Lin got his shot in the worst of situations. He was pulled off the bench as a last-ditch effort by Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni to save his floundering team. The Knicks were desperate for a solid guard since Chauncey Billups, now with the Los Angeles Clippers, left the team last season. Before Lin, the Knicks were in bad shape. After starting the season 6–4, the Knicks lost six straight and hadn’t reached a .500 record, until Lin and their subsequent winning streak.
He has played incredibly well the past two weeks, but his scoring pace is going to be nearly impossible to maintain. With the return of all-star forward Carmelo Anthony, Lin’s game has to change. With Anthony averaging over 18 shots a game, Lin will be forced to be a more balanced point guard than a high-volume scorer.
It’s important to realize that Lin is only human. While he was scoring the most points for any NBA player through his first six games, he was also shooting far too many shots. Lin has to accept that most nights he will be the Knicks’ third-best scoring option. He showed signs of progress in his first game with all-star teammate forward Amar’e Stoudemire, taking on six shots but dishing out 13 assists in 26 minutes of playing time. That night, Lin showed the kind of weapon he can be for his team. With his ability to drive to the basket, Lin can draw in defenders, opening up his teammates for uncontested dunks and three-pointers.
Lin has been a godsend for New York, but fans must realize it’s not his scoring ability that makes him great: It’s his ability to open up the floor. He won’t average 25 points per game for the rest of his career. But eight assists per game is an attainable mark. The quicker Lin, the Knicks, and the public can understand this, the faster we can stop celebrating Lin for the high-volume scorer he has been, and embrace the amazing point guard he can someday become.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, last Wednesday and stayed through Saturday for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship meet. The men’s team took fifth place in the conference, while the women came in third overall.
Swimming in his first season for the Tartans, first-year Anton Razanav had a strong performance. Razanav won the 200-yard backstroke on Saturday; his time of 1:51.53 was not only a season best, but an NCAA qualifying time.
“This season, as a rookie, I want to make a good name for myself in Division III swimming as well as in the UAA. If my times allow me passage to nationals in March, then the only thing I can hope for is to improve even further. But I am focusing on one thing at a time in order to maintain a clear view of my goals,” Razanav said.
The Tartans’ next-best finish came from junior Daniel Glaser-Garbrick finishing second in the 200-yard butterfly with a provisional time of 1:51.42. Following Glaser-Garbrick, junior Brandon Yee also placed in the same race, coming in fourth place at 1:53.00.
With a personal goal to make it to the NCAA meet this year, sophomore Austin Bohn came out strong at the UAA meet, winning the consolation final of the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:08.20.
At the deeper end of the pool, senior divers Eli Fatsi and Mike Alexovich finished sixth and seventh on the one-meter board with 437.70 and 400.40 points, respectively.
For the women’s swimming team, first-year Debra Lin won the consolation final of the 200-yard backstroke at 2:06.99, a season best for her. First-year Kelley Sheehan also placed in the same event, finishing in third place with 2:08.40.
Sophomore Soleil Phan, who has been swimming since she was seven, swam in the finals of the 100-yard freestyle and finished sixth with a time of 52.78.
Junior Breanna Stillo followed closely behind, coming in seventh with 53.23 in the same race. Speaking about her experiences and goals, she said, “It was an awesome experience being part of the first women’s relay to go to Nationals last year, so it would be great to send an even bigger group of people there this year.”
Junior Price Kinney finished in fourth place in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:24.59, a season-best time for her. Sophomore Tatiana Duchak made the finals with a preliminary time of 2:28.50, but was disqualified during the final run.
At her last UAA meet, senior Hannah Gonzalez swam in the consolation finals for the 200-yard butterfly, finishing strong in third place with a time of 2:10.87.
The men and women who made an NCAA provisional mark this season are waiting to hear if they made the draw for the National championship meet that will be held in Indianapolis, Ind., in March.

After several close games that ended in defeat, the Tartans finally pulled out a clutch victory against the favored Emory University Eagles on Friday. With the final seconds of the game ticking away, sophomore guard Sean Brophy hit a game-winning three-point shot. The game was tied at 79 points, but Brophy’s shot gave the Tartans a 82–79 lead and the victory with 0.6 seconds left. 
The Tartans have lost three close games since Jan. 15, but they finally exhibited composure in the clutch. 
“We focused on not beating ourselves. In late game situations, we emphasized knowing the situations, being careful with the ball, and not always taking the first option on offense,” said sophomore guard Rashaun Riley.
Senior forward Joe Kromka led the way with 18 points. Sophomore forward Christian Manoli and senior John Duhring put together solid stat lines. Manoli put in 17 points and four assists while Duhring added 15 points, eight rebounds, and four assists.
But Brophy’s only field goal of the game was the biggest for the underdog Tartans.  
“They made their free throw and Coach decided not to call a timeout,” said sophomore guard Marshall Massengale, who has been on the injured list for the last two weeks recovering from a concussion. “Christian got the ball, drove to the left side. He drew two defenders and kicked it out to Sean. The rest was history.” 
The Tartans’ shooting was excellent, hitting 48.4 percent from the field and 50 percent of their threes. Additionally, they hit 93.8 percent from the free-throw line, clobbering the Eagles’ 59.1 percent mark.
On Sunday, the Tartans faced another conference foe, the University of Rochester Yellowjackets. Despite digging out of a 14-point gap, the Tartans could not pull a victory, losing 81–74.
Just past the halfway mark of the second half, the Tartans were down 52–38. Coach Tony Wingen then called for a full-court press, which stifled the Yellowjackets, and the Tartans made their run.
“We were consistent with our press defense. We also tried to give as many ball screens as possible and run pick and rolls for our big men,” Riley said.
The constant attack in the paint opened up the floor for Carnegie Mellon, and a three by Riley tied the game with 6:52 left. 
The Tartans were up by as many as five points, after a three by junior guard Andre Moore and a floater by Riley. But late-game turnovers did not help, as the Yellowjackets regained the lead and held on for the win.
Riley led the way with 18 points on seven-out-of-nine shooting. Brophy had a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Tartans put together a solid team-scoring effort, with seven players scoring six or more, shooting 53.2 percent as a team.
Their play this past weekend brings the Tartans to 8–16 for the season, and 3–10 in University Athletic Association play.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team was dealt another loss at home last Friday night. The Tartans hosted the Emory University Eagles in their second and final meeting of the season. The Eagles extended their winning streak to four games with Friday’s 83–60 win, while the Tartans have now lost three games straight. 
The game looked promising early on, as the Tartans had a quick 9–0 lead from three-pointers by first-year guards Chandler Caufield and Gabrielle West. The Eagles’ full-court press rattled Carnegie Mellon and hindered their offensive rhythm. However, the Tartans managed to break through and find some open spots at the basket.
Carnegie Mellon maintained the lead for most of the first half, until the Eagles went on a 15–0 run to halt the Tartans’ strong start. With 6:18 remaining in the half, Emory took a 22–21 point lead. The Tartans could not regain the lead for the rest of the game. 
The Tartans tried to battle their way back in the second half, but trading baskets with the Eagles did not close the gap. The Tartans needed stops on defense, but offensive rebounds gave the Eagles 21 extra shots to further extend their lead. Although Carnegie Mellon handled the Eagles’ full-court press in the first half, it got the best of the team in the second. They turned the ball over 17 times in the second half.
“In the second half, we weren’t guarding the arc on defense as well in the second half, and had no inside-out game on the offensive end,” first-year guard Aspen McKeever said.
The Tartans finished the contest with four players in double figures. West led the team with 14 points, and sophomore guard Jacquie Shaw added 13 points. McKeever and junior forward Emily Peel pitched in 11 and 10 points, respectively.
“I think we just need to focus on playing together on both the offensive and defensive ends, as well as running through the offense and getting good looks for everyone,” McKeever said.
Yesterday, the Tartans hosted the University of Rochester, the No. 11 team in Division III, winning the contest by a final score of 67–62. The win pushed the Tartans’ record to 9–15 for the season and 3–10 in the University Athletic Association conference. 
The Tartans held on to a five-point lead with clutch free-throw shooting. The Yellowjackets’ senior center Jodie Luther had two clutch buckets late in the game, but free throws by Caufield and Shaw helped seal the victory.
Yellowjackets junior guard Kristyn Wright air-balled a three at the end of the game, but Shaw was able to rebound the miss and run out the clock.
Peel poured in 20 points on only 11 shots and seven rebounds. Shaw added 17 points, eight rebounds, and five assists. McKeever also scored in double digits with 14 points.
“We didn’t do anything differently to prepare for this game, we just had to play as a team,” West said. “We had great intensity for all 40 minutes of the game.”
The Tartans’ final game of the season is this Saturday. Tipoff is at 3 p.m. in Skibo Gymnasium.

When multiple children died of an  E. coli outbreak that stemmed from a Jack in the Box restaurant in 1993, the bacteria made national headlines. Millions of people around the world continue to die from multiple strains of Escherichia coli and other organisms from the Shiga toxin family of bacteria despite efforts by the federal government to fight the strain, according to an MSNBC article. To aid in this fight against the toxin, researchers at Carnegie Mellon may have found a friend in the element manganese.
Shiga toxin bacteria has been the culprit in millions of deaths, especially in developing nations, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release. Although there are currently antibiotics to fight the bacteria, the treatment forces the dying bacteria to release more toxins. This discharge can prove fatal for some patients. 
Searching for a solution, postdoctoral researcher Somshuvra Mukhopadhyay and professor Adam Linstedt, both within the department of biological sciences, discovered the effects of the metal manganese. Their research was recently published in a January issue of the journal Science.
Much of their answer came from searching one of the most basic units of life: cells. The Shiga toxin entering a cell will quietly take over and shut down ribosomes, the cellular machines that create essential proteins for the body. 
The researchers observed that the toxin would latch itself onto GB3, a fatty membrane found in some cells. The toxin would then enter the cell, roaming around and interacting with a protein named GPP130, which Linstedt discovered in the mid-’90s. From there it would visit other cellular regions, and eventually the ribosomes. Without ribosomes, the cell is deprived of important proteins; this can create major issues within the body.
Even after looking closely at this model, the researchers were unaware of how the toxin was able to successfully bypass so many parts of the cell. They knew that the GPP130 protein played an important role in the movement of the toxin, but they didn’t know how to stop it. 
“The original idea can be traced to a phone call from Don Smith at UC Santa Cruz, a toxicologist working on [manganese],” Linstedt said via email. “He thought he saw an effect of [manganese] on GPP130. We started a collaboration and my lab, especially Somshuvra, verified and then extensively characterized the effect of manganese on GPP130.”
That “effect of manganese” Linstedt spoke of was that the metal can cause a deterioration of GPP130, leaving the Shiga toxin all dressed up with no place to go. In addition to being barred from the cytoplasm, the toxin was displaced to the lysosomes where it could be destroyed. The treated cells were 3,800 times more protected than those without manganese. 
The next step was to test the effectiveness of manganese in mice. After formulating a safe dosage, the researchers exposed groups of mice to the Shiga toxin along with the manganese, and another group with just the toxin alone. Within four days, the mice treated with manganese were completely unharmed — in contrast to their stiff counterparts in the control group.
This discovery is promising for health advancements and brings enticing possibilities for future Shiga toxin treatment. Manganese is a relatively inexpensive and abundant metal. If the research gets past human trials, it could be a feasible treatment.
Researchers still need to check if manganese can protect against E. coli. Although it is a clear protector against pure Shiga toxins, there needs to be more research to see how the manganese affects the bacterium that carries the toxin.
Mukhopadhyay, however, is confident. “It is very likely the manganese will also work against the bacteria,” he said. He added cautiously, however, that it is by “no means an absolute certainty.”
In addition to figuring out the effect on bacteria, the researchers want to test the effectiveness of manganese in combination with antibiotics. Linstedt plans to study the manganese after the toxin has already created intestinal damage — their success in mice was only a preventative treatment.
Human trials, while distant, are in sight. “These assays will take a few months to a few years,” Mukhopadhyay said, assuming that all the studies will go as planned.
Eight years after discovering the connection between GPP130 and Shiga toxin, the researchers have finally found an ally in manganese. Although more research must be done, the manganese brings possibilities for the millions suffering from Shiga toxin-induced bacteria.

This month is February Album Writing Month (FAWM), an annual online songwriting challenge for musicians to write a collection of songs in a month’s time. Though the challenge of composing 14 songs by the end of February may seem daunting, the technology embedded in the challenge’s website, FAWM.org, is designed to give participants some help.
The creator of the challenge, Burr Settles, is a Carnegie Mellon postdoctoral researcher in the department of machine learning. He thought of the project as a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2004. What started as a fun extracurricular activity gradually turned into a platform for musicians to share new songs globally. 
Settles explained that in the last couple of years, FAWM has spawned new research used for building statistical language models to help songwriters overcome writer’s block. The interactive tools featured on FAWM.org that try to facilitate creativity include Titular, LyriCloud, Struxxure, and Plot Spline.
Musicians can use Titular to generate song titles and start the creative process. LyriCloud displays a number of semantically related words, starting from a seed word given as input. When typing in “life,” for example, some of the words that one might receive are “delish,” “freebie,” “soul,” “taxicabs,” or “unexamined.” 
These are not random words, Settles explained. They are based on automated analysis of song lyrics from the internet and of frequently associated words.
Struxxure helps with generating song structures, such as verse/chorus/bridge constructions. Plot Spline is a framing device for creating a song’s plot. An example of a generated spline, according to the website, would be: “Write a song in second person (“you”) in which the main character is thinking out loud. The story takes place in the present, and the scene is a moving vehicle.”
The FAWM website has become a “testbed for interactive machine learning technology to support online communities and creativity,” Settles said. It has facilitated the study of social influences, such as whether leaving comments or collaborating on a song motivates individual success or if those behaviors are associated with the number of songs a user writes. 
For example, if FAWM newcomers receive comments in the first couple of weeks after posting, they are more likely to continue to contribute. Ideally, every song will get at least one piece of feedback.
Anyone who publishes 14 songs is automatically declared a winner. So far this month, there are roughly 50 winners.
Vincent Poprocky, a senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in information sciences, has participated in the FAWM challenge multiple times. Although he plays bass in a band, he uses the website for his own songwriting. The one-month deadline is his motivator for writing many of the songs that he plans to use for solo shows this year. 
Completing the challenge “is a good opportunity to have something that you can be proud of and show people,” Poprocky said.
In a world where artists are constantly looking for innovation, the FAWM challenge tries to give some direction, Settles said; it helps users to come up with ideas that are plausible but novel, while drawing some boundaries. 
Although technology has been utilized as an art medium, Settles said, it has not been used enough to help humans in the creative process. This project tries to use computer science in support of the humanities and the creative arts.

Each year, companies announce a new slew of cell phone features. Personal digital assistants, like Siri for Apple’s newest iPhone and Iris for Android phones, have made using cell phones easier than ever before. These digital assistants make using a cell phone more intuitive: Instead of having to press buttons to give commands, one can simply talk to the cell phone as if it were another person.
The technology underlying these digital assistants has some of its roots in our campus. 
In May 2003, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency initiated a project called Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes (CALO) under its Personal Assistant that Learns program. The CALO program brought researchers from several universities, including Carnegie Mellon.
Alex Rudnicky, a research professor in the computer science department involved with the project, described CALO as having “revolved around the notion of having a computer system that would know about you, things you liked, and provide you access to information.” CALO was run by SRI International, an independent non-profit research institute that conducts contract research for government and business agencies. In 2010, Apple acquired Siri from SRI International and released it as an app. 
Personal digital assistants require the use of two technologies: voice recognition and information synthesis.
Voice recognition helps the devices accurately convert human sounds into words, while information synthesis interprets what the human user needs and finds the information needed to complete the request.
According to the website SmartPlanet, voice recognition technologies have been around since 1940.  Scientist at Bell Laboratories Homer Dudley patented a machine called the “Parallel Bandpass Vocoder,” which could recognize and output sounds based on what it heard. The first technologies of this kind could only recognize a few words by comparing them to signals in their memories and selecting the ones that best matched. 
Since then, the technology has become more flexible and accurate, but its basic structure has remained the same. Because machines are not capable of understanding human speech, the best they can do is form reasonable guesses about what certain words sound like and when humans are likely to speak certain words.
Madison Calhoun, a sophomore chemical and biomedical engineering major, is a longtime iPhone user. Calhoun said that “while the technology is an improvement over what came before and is very convinient, it’s still not very good at recognizing voices.” However, as more people use voice recognition technologies, the more data these machines gather and the more intelligent they become.
After voice recognition, personal digital assistants synthesize the information that a user requests. This essentially involves a form with several slots for questions. “For each slot you have a question, like ‘Where do you want to fly?’ ” Rudnicky explained. 
The digital assistant’s software comes with many such forms, and attempts to fit the words it hears into one of them.
For example, the software might have a form for looking up restaurants nearby. This form might have a blank space to be filled with the type of cuisine that the user wants. 
If the digital assistant hears the phrase “Japanese food” in the user’s request, it could make use of the keyword “food” to realize that the user wants to look up restaurants. Then, it could default to this form, fill in the missing information, and perform a search for local Japanese restaurants. If the form is incomplete, the digital assistant might ask questions or ask the user to provide more details. 
Digital assistants also continuously improve themselves by tailoring to their users; when a user tells the phone it is wrong, the phone remembers this and learns from its mistakes by fine tuning its algorithms to match the user’s needs. While this might sound long and complex, Rudnicky said that “a lot of these things whittle down to a fairly simple process.” 
The technology behind personal digital assistants is still fairly new, but one of the limitations Rudnicky would like to see it overcome is its exclusivity to smartphones. The machines could also be more intuitive and more accurately understand a wider set of accents and colloquialisms. Until then, Calhoun said that she will stick to “typing with her fingers because it’s much faster most of the time.”

Texting affects ability to accept and interpret words
A linguist at the University of Calgary in Canada claims that texting has a negative impact on a person’s linguistic ability to interpret and accept words. The linguist, Joan Lee, asked 33 university students questions about their reading habits, including text messaging, and presented them with both real and made-up words. 
The study found that people who read more traditional media such as books and newspapers were more accepting of new words, while those who read less but texted more were less accepting. “The people who accepted more words did so because they were better able to interpret the meaning of the word — or tolerate the word — even if they didn’t recognize the word,” Lee explained in a Science Daily article.

Space junk ‘janitor’ plans to clean up outer space
Scientists at the Swiss Space Center are designing a machine that would clean up space junk orbiting around Earth. Since 1957, nearly 6,000 satellites have been launched into Earth’s orbit, but only an estimated 800 are still operational. The remaining satellites are classified as space junk. 
The new machine will clean up this space junk by either capturing a piece of it and self-destructing by burning up in the Earth’s atmosphere, or by propelling it into Earth’s atmosphere to burn while the cleaning machine remains in space.

Study shows babies understand words at six months
A study performed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that infants between six and nine months old can understand words spoken to them before they even learn to speak. 
The scientists showed 33 babies aged six to nine months images placed side by side.They then tracked their eye movements while a parent asked them questions such as, “Where is the apple?” The study found that the babies were more likely to fix their gaze on the correct image, indicating that they understood how the word was associated with the object.

Why do some dinosaur fossils look so weird?
Many fossilized dinosaurs have been found in twisted postures with their heads and necks abnormally arched backwards. Scientists have always thought that this occurred from death spasms, but two researchers from Switzerland and Germany have recently come to the conclusion that these twisted configurations may have occurred long after the dinosaurs’ deaths. 
After experimenting with chicken carcasses, they found that a ligament in the upper spine released energy as surrounding muscles and other soft parts decayed, causing the neck to arch backwards. The scientists believe a similar process occurred in dinosaurs after death.

Research reveals true cost of meat-based diet
Researchers at Lancaster University in England found that if everyone in the United Kingdom switched to a vegetarian diet, the reduced greenhouse gas emissions would be equivalent to a 50 percent reduction in exhaust pipe emissions from the United Kingdom’s entire passenger car fleet. 
The scientists calculated the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that result from the production of various foods, and found that meat had the highest emissions. They concluded that switching to an all-vegetarian diet would decrease greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production by roughly 25 percent.

Facebook hacker sentenced to eight months in jail
The hacker who breached Facebook’s cybersecurity last April received an eight-month prison sentence this past Friday. Last April, 26-year-old British student Glenn Mangham stole sensitive information from Facebook’s internal network while in his bedroom in York, a city in northern England. 
Prosecutors described the incident as the most serious case of social media hacking to date. Facebook, which currently boasts 845 million users, released a statement saying, “We take any attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network very seriously.”

“Vibrant. Visceral. Introspective.”
That’s how Christian Fleming, a senior directing major, described his rendition of Hair, which was performed last week in the Helen Wayne Rauh Theater in Purnell. Fleming was behind the scenes of the show that served as his senior thesis. “Instead of documenting the journey of a generation of youths,” Fleming explained, “we are trying to create a compelling, personal story of one man’s life.” This plot adjustment was intentional, and Fleming said it contributed to his desired vision for the production.
As audience members filtered into the theater, they were greeted by Claude (played by junior acting major Jacob Tischler), the show’s main character, sitting silently in a hospital bed in the middle of the stage. Claude thinks back to the moment he received his draft card for the Vietnam War. He is greeted by some familiar faces: From behind a 30-foot white sheet come the 11 members of the “tribe,” spinning Claude’s hospital bed as they parade around him. Their leather vests, bell-bottoms, and voluminous hair provide colorful and vibrant contrast to the drab, hospital gown-wearing man weakened by post-traumatic stress disorder.
The tribe whisks him back to the time when he was young and rebellious, when he adopted the title Aquarius. With this confidence and bravado, Claude drops out of school, not holding back in expressing his true feelings to his principal, who is scandalously imagined as a Nazi. The free-spirited hippies show Claude a new life, unbounded and full of beauty.
However, Claude’s parents pressure him to “start being an American” and get a job. The beauty of the stage is exemplified in a great scene when Claude explains everything he has to his parents. During this song, called “I’ve Got Life,” the members of the tribe were seamlessly integrated into the scene as background dancers. Tischler’s voice dominated the song, from the slower emotional parts to the energetic wordy bits.
Claude deals with a difficult dilemma in the show: He wants to make change, but doesn’t want to go to war to do it. When he receives his draft card, however, he begins to think seriously about his departure. Claude then sings “Hair,” the title song, a number dedicated to the luscious and lengthy locks that defined the late ’60s. This song is the epitome of the show’s message the importance of self-expression. It begins slowly, with ­Claude and fellow friend Berger (played by Rodney Jackson, a junior drama major) harmonizing gradually before exploding into a lively parade of expression and resistance.
In a pivotal scene, the members of the tribe surround a fire with the men lining up one by one, each tossing his draft card into the flames. Claude is last in line, and as his friends cheer him on, he approaches the fire. But when he goes to toss it in, he can’t. This moment of indecision is emphasized by the piano’s high notes, played by junior piano performance major Stephanie Mao.
And suddenly, reality hits. The playfulness of the first half of the show is gone, and the impending dangers of war quickly approach. Those in charge of the show’s props did an excellent job, especially in this portion of the performance, substituting canes for muskets and bent wire hangers for bows and arrows.
All too soon, the grim and gritty reality sets in as fellow soldiers are shot while crossing trenches — wonderfully accompanied by a sharp, low crash on the piano. Some take their own lives with imaginative yet disturbing depictions of self-strangulation and lighting themselves on fire. The dramatics continue as Claude ends up in a one-on-one fight with an enemy soldier.
Claude steals his opponent’s knife and fatally stabs him, but is so horrified by what he’s done he convulses in horror and begins to cry. In the end, Claude falls victim to the violence of war and suffers several knife gashes — accentuated with a loud piano crash, reminiscent of the slashing from the infamous shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho.
The tribe members return him to the hospital bed where the show began, giving their goodbyes. The light goes out on the tribe, shining only on Claude as he curls up in bed. Total darkness fills the stage as the tribe sings the last lines of “Let the Sun Shine In.”
This show is as big as the hair it’s named after, but the theater only had a 140-person maximum capacity, so scaling down the big production was no easy task. The cast of 12 tackled an impressive 24 songs, each member getting his or her own solos throughout the show. A single, static set with just the right amount of detail served as the backdrop to the show. Despite being a scaled-down version of the original, this production of Hair hit all the right notes.

“The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is a tragic tale of love and loss,” says the director’s note in the playbill for Scotch’n’Soda’s Eurydice. The 90-minute show, which had three performances last weekend in the University Center’s McKenna/Peter/Wright room, was directed by Andy Minton (junior ethics, history, and public policy major) and Brad Sherburne (third-year architecture major).
According to Minton, the realization of this production began more than a year ago, when he first approached Sherburne with the script, written by American plawright Sarah Ruhl. The directors’ vision was immediately evident in the beautiful set. The McKenna/Peter/Wright room was transformed into an immersive world, which brought about a sense of whimsy and wonder.
Metallic objects such as ladles and eyeglasses hung from the ceiling; the quirky trinkets seemed like they were floating due to magic rather than fishing wire. The set teleported the traditional Greek myth into a more modern era, although the exact time period was ambiguous. The blue palette of the set — from the wallpaper to the umbrellas framing the stage — was a clever nod to the frequent references to water throughout the play.
Eurydice follows the story of two lovers, Eurydice (played by Jasmine Peterson, a sophomore computer science major) and Orpheus (played by Raz Golden, a first-year international relations and politics major). On their wedding day, Eurydice encounters a Nasty Interesting Man (played by Will Weiner, a junior social and decision sciences and statistics double major), who lures her to his apartment with promises of a letter written by her late father (Eli Diamond, a junior drama major).
Unnerved by the suspicious character, Eurydice tries to leave but falls down the stairs and enters the Underworld, joining her father. She also joins three Stones: Big Stone (Christine de Carteret, a fourth-year architecture and history double major), Little Stone (Larissa Jantonio, a sophomore communication design major), and Loud Stone (Erika Tang, a junior economics major).
The Stones function as a stylized version of a Greek chorus, bringing the play back to its traditional roots. Offering explanation and commentary, the Stones provide a necessary contrast to the rest of the piece, as they speak rhythmically and often in unison. The three actresses’ hard work on characterization was obvious, as each Stone had a distinct personality, walk, and voice. Their dark blue and green costumes were almost gothic; elements such as corsets and dark lipstick helped portray the darkness and bizarre nature of the Underworld.
The Underworld itself was denoted by a creative use of lighting: Colder, bluer lighting separated it from the more cheery, warmly lit Overworld. The blue lighting was no doubt used to conjure up the idea of water. After dying, Eurydice arrives via a rain-filled elevator: Water dripped from some invisible source above the stage, creating an aesthetically pleasing effect.
Although Weiner’s performance as Nasty Interesting Man was captivating and unnerving, he really shone as the Lord of the Underworld. The strange, childlike being, with a colorful, oversized bowtie and buttons, rode down the aisles on either side of the audience on a comically tiny tricycle. Weiner was perfectly creepy and hilarious as this character, and successfully portrayed the suspicious similarities between his two characters.
Golden, as Orpheus, was incredibly moving with his expressive face and entrancing voice. Since his character is left alone in the Overworld quite early in the play, the majority of his performances were monologues as he expressed himself through letters to Eurydice. While this had the potential to be redundant, Golden’s emotive performance kept the audience interested.
Although the acting was on par, it was the design that had everyone talking afterwards. First-year vocal performance major Ethan Crystal said, “With the limitations presented by the room, especially with the lighting, I thought they did an excellent job. I was really impressed.”
Lindsay MacGillivray, a sophomore mechanical engineering major, was captivated by the bold stylistic choices made by the directors. “The set and everything was really artistic. I felt it really captured the essence of the show ... and when the back door opened and there was the waterfall — that was really, really cool,” she said.
The small performance space had its strengths and weaknesses. It increased the feeling of intimacy, since everyone was so close; the performance was often brought right into the aisles next to the audience. MacGillivray said, “I left feeling very incorporated into the show even though I was just sitting there watching.”
The only drawback of the space is that those sitting any further than four or five rows back may have had a difficult time seeing the stage, particularly when actors were sitting or lying on the floor. However, given the intricate emotions in the delicate piece, perhaps the intimate space was the right choice.
For audience members who were already familiar with the traditional Greek myth, the show was a refreshing take on the story. “It was the traditional story of Orpheus, but with a twist.... It was much more relatable,” MacGillivray said. The directors’ efforts of more than a year’s work were worth it, as cast and crew came together to create this stylized piece in a cohesive manner.

The undergraduate English department kicked off the Creative Writing Student Series on Thursday night with its first event for the spring semester. The event was loosely themed around Valentine’s Day, and was aptly titled “Hearts (And Other Organs).” Three students were featured readers and a few other students participated in the open mic portion toward the end of the event.
Held in The Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center in Baker Hall, commonly known as The Glad, the event had a feeling of intimacy and comfort. The lights were dimmed and attendees sat around the room on an assortment of couches, tables, and rocking chairs. Instead of feeling crowded, the setting made the event feel more like a gathering of good friends. The bookshelves that line the walls and the coffee maker in the corner made it obvious that the out-of-the-way location is a favorite of writers.
The series is under new management this semester: Ila Foley, a senior creative writing major; Ines Pujos, a senior creative writing major; and Madeleine Barnes, a senior art and creative writing double major, are now running the series. They recruited readers to participate and ran a raffle after the readings had concluded. All undergraduate students in the English department are eligible to perform in the series, but students can only read once per semester.
Foley felt like event was a success; she remarked that she was “glad to see people come out,” and that it was nice to see “lots of familiar faces.” Since the event is held in such a tiny space, the audience was fairly small. However, all members of the Carnegie Mellon community are invited to attend and enjoy some original readings as well as pizza, soda, and candy.
Thursday’s readers were senior creative writing major Brian Sherwin, junior creative writing major Austin Moyer, and sophomore creative and professional writing double major Anna Albi. Their prepared works, along with the pieces shared by the few students who participated in the open mic portion, made for an enjoyable evening. Barnes described the night as being filled with “vivacious readers and lots of crunching candy hearts.”
Since most in attendance were affiliated with the English department, there was a real sense of community and support for one another throughout the evening. Foley described the series as “good community building,” and the post-show environment supported her description. Patrons talked, joked, and ate while the pink and red streamers that decorated the walls were removed and the lights came back up.
The series definitely started off on a high note. Two more events are scheduled, with the final reading taking place at The Frame toward the end of the year. This last event in the series will showcase all of the senior creative writing majors.
Although it is nice to maintain a special bond within the English department, it would be nice to see future events marketed to the broader Carnegie Mellon community. Perhaps next time the crowd will be even larger and more varied, so more students can watch these writers share their work.

Regent Square Theatre has been showing the 2012 Oscar-nominated short films since Feb. 10, in preparation for the Academy Awards on Feb. 26. This year’s Oscar-nominated shorts showcase a variety of creative influences in the field. While some are certainly stronger than others, all of the contenders have a unique story, style, and perspective.
Live-Action
Pentecost, an Irish film directed by Peter McDonald and Eimear O’Kane, follows the story of Damian, a young boy who is forced to serve as an altar boy when he would rather be out playing football (soccer). This comedic film portrays Damian’s tough decision between conforming to what his parents want him to do and following his heart. Pentecost had the audience laughing all throughout the credits and into the opening of the next film.
Raju is a German and Indian film directed by Max Zähle and Stefan Gieren. The story shows a German couple that travels to India to adopt a young boy. The couple faces a moral dilemma when they find out that the child they are adopting was not abandoned, but rather kidnapped. The film was well made and featured an excellent soundtrack, but the nuances of the story would have been better in a feature-length film with more background about the couple’s relationship.
The two films that followed, The Shore and Time Freak, were enjoyable but forgettable. The Shore was the longest of the short films and seemed to drag on. Despite its heartwarming message of making peace with regrets and facing a troubled past, the film lacked any compelling reason to pay attention for 31 minutes. Time Freak is an American film about an inventor who creates a time machine, but gets caught up traveling around yesterday. The short was funny and the audience seemed to enjoy it, but its cuteness also made it seem a bit amateur.
The last film for this category was Tuba Atlantic. Directed by Hallvar Witzø, this Norwegian short follows the final days in the life of Oskar, a 70-year-old man who is going to die in six days. He is faced with the challenge of making peace with his brother before he dies, and is only able to do this by sending huge sound waves across the Atlantic Ocean from a giant tuba that he and his brother built when they were younger. The film brought tears to my eyes three separate times in 25 minutes, and it was the only film in the Live-Action category that received applause from the audience at the end.
Animation
The films in the Animation category were less impressive as a whole than the live-action films.
Dimanche/Sunday, a Canadian film directed by Patrick Doyon, followed the story of a family’s Sunday routine and a young boy’s imagination. The animation was cute and the music was excellent, but by the end the audience was left underwhelmed.
A Morning Stroll shows the story of a New Yorker who walks past a city-savvy chicken on his morning promenade. The scene is shown three separate times — once set in 1959, once in 2009, and once in 2059. Each scene has a different animation style, which made it one of the more visually interesting animated shorts.
Wildlife, directed by Amanda Forbis and Wendy Tilby, follows the story of a young Englishman who travels to the Canadian frontier to become a cowboy, only to find that he doesn’t quite fit into his dream life. His life is compared to that of a comet throughout the film, and in the end, the young man sees a comet in the sky and freezes to death in a snowy field. The story was interesting, but the film seemed to drag on for much longer than 13 minutes.
The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore is an allegory about the healing powers of books. The animation was sophisticated and impressive, and the message of the story felt very relevant when it seems like few people read novels anymore. The film was a bit cheesy at times, but it was enjoyable and delivered a poignant message.
The last film of the evening, La Luna, was a coming-of-age fable about a young boy who helps his father and grandfather clean stars off the moon every night. The story was well written and humorous, and left the audience with a positive message about finding oneself.
Predictions
While all of the short films deserve their spots as nominees, two films stood out. Tuba Atlantic will win in the Live-Action category. The story was beautiful and the film was expertly produced. Humorous and heartwarming, it was impossible to walk away from the theater without making some sort of positive comment about the film. The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore will win in the Animation category. It was perfect: perfect story, perfect animation, perfect message, perfect for the award.
The Oscar-nominated shorts are showing at Regent Square Theatre through Feb. 23; the Academy Awards will take place on Sunday, Feb. 26.

On Friday, The Frame was transformed into a sleek display of video art. The Frame Film Festival, a combined effort of Carnegie Mellon’s student organizations ArtHang and Film Club, displayed the diverse and eclectic film work of students.
The show was largely formulated by sophomore art majors and ArtHang heads Caroline Record and Michael Bennett; Claire Gustavson, a sophomore art and ethics, history, and public policy double major; and Film Club president and senior art major Benjamin Welmond. Sophomore Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts student Andrew Bueno, digital media manager for ArtHang, was the technical head who worked behind the scenes and really got the “show on the road,” Gustavson said.
The downstairs portion of The Frame was dedicated to the work produced by the Film Club since 2010. These narrative pieces included 2010 works like “Zombie College: The Musical,” 2011 short group projects from Film Club, and more professional pieces like the trailer for “Static Shock,” a fan film by senior directing major Stefan Dezil, which will be released in March. Rows of metal chairs sat facing the projection, and the notoriously creepy underground space of The Frame was transformed into a theater.
Talia Levin, a first-year Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in directing and creative writing, explained her experience in Film Club while watching the projected shorts downstairs. “All that you really need to make a movie is people who want to do it.... Film Club is a nice way to know these people,” she explained. “The only way you can learn [how to make films], especially in a place that isn’t a film school, is to keep doing it over and over again.”
The upstairs portion of the The Frame was dedicated to the student work submitted to ArtHang. The dividing walls from last week’s show were kept intact in order to create four separate viewing spaces for the work. Two of the sections displayed several small televisions with their own DVD players and headphones displaying videos on a loop. These devices were slightly hypnotizing to watch, as viewers walked from one TV to the next. Other sections were transformed into larger viewing spaces with seating and films projected onto the wall. The work displayed on this floor varied, but was generally abstract rather than narrative.
The technology that was working to keep the show running seemed to seamlessly continue the loops of video, deliver the audio needed, and run without noticeable glitches. Bueno admitted that the technological aspects of the show provided a challenge, since each separate television had to be working and also have a headphone jack.
First-year linguistics major Edward Wojciechowski III commented upon leaving, “I liked that the array of films showed varied in genre. There was something for everyone.”
This show displayed over 30 student works in an intimate and engaging space. The integration of two student groups allowed for a more thorough display of the many different types of film work created on campus, and provided for a successful show.

Making their way to their seats at Carnegie Music Hall last Tuesday night, the show’s attendees must have wondered if they’d come to the right place to see From The Top, an NPR program hosted by renowned pianist Christopher O’Riley. A showcase for musicians under age 18, From The Top was in Pittsburgh for a live recording.
The stage looked more like it was set up for a three-ring circus than for a live taping of a radio show: Along with the music stand and grand piano, there were four microphones on stage right, a high wooden chair and small table on stage left, and a curious black box covered with a black cloth. One could almost visualize jugglers dancing about the stage and the young performers playing their instruments while dangling from trapezes.
The black box ended up being an actual magic trick: The show’s announcer, Joanne Robinson, placed a red suitcase on the black box and proceeded to pull out an assortment of plastic flowers and plant them in a vase on the small table. The box then got up and walked off stage — there had been a woman handing Robinson flowers from the box. Other theatrics included one of the show’s producers cartwheeling on stage and an announcement that “coughing during the music is punishable by death.”
Once the actual recording began, a euphonium soloist was the first to perform. It was certainly an odd opener, but 17-year-old Grant Jameson made the instrument — a mini-tuba of sorts — sound like a lilting, brassy bassoon. The versatility he presented was astonishing.
What truly made From The Top different from a classical recital were the interviews. After every young musician’s performance, O’Riley would chat with him or her at the microphones on stage right. These interviews seemed to be planned out in advance, but they were still interesting. They served to let the audience know a little more about the young musicians, while adding some comedic entertainment.
Two of the acts — 17-year-old violist and Pittsburgher Daniel Orson, and the Temple University Music Prep Honors String Quartet — were very good, but paled in comparison to the two best musicians of the night.
Aleksandr “Sasha” Voinov, a home-schooled 14-year-old from the riverside Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickley, has been arranging and composing his own music since he was six years old. He gifted the audience with a flashy performance of Frédéric Chopin’s Polonaise, the Romantic composer’s “let’s rock out” piece for piano. Quite the little showman, Voinov took moments to recoil from the piano like a cat crouching to pounce, so that he could have the momentum to pound out some of the more exciting chords.
During the interview, Voinov revealed that his showmanship tends to control how he presents his performances. For example, last year he arranged a version of “Frosty the Snowman” for piano and orchestra, and performed it with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra — dressed as a snowman. He finished the interview by going back to the piano, donning a frizzy black wig, and playing his own jazzy arrangement of Niccolò Paganini’s famous Caprice No. 24.
The show’s peak, however, was violinist Kelly Talim, a 16-year-old Illinois resident and student of Carnegie Mellon music professor Cyrus Forough. She performed Belà Bartok’s Second Rhapsody with seeming effortlessness. Judging her solely by that performance, one could rightfully say that she’s bound to have a successful career.
The show itself wasn’t flawless: While interviewing Jameson, who was talking about how he comes from a long line of brass players, O’Riley made the remark, “I enjoy a line of Jamesons, now and again.” There was also some feedback during the interview with the Temple University Quartet, so part of it had to be re-recorded. However, the phenomenal young musicians definitely made up for the inherent pitfalls of a live radio show.
From The Top, and all of NPR’s shows, air on WQED 89.3 FM.

A city that used to be a veritable hotbed of American Jazz, Pittsburgh has seen what could be described as a process of jazz atrophy. Cultural institutions like the August Wilson Center and the Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild feed off a legacy of jazz, not a vibrant scene.
Traditional venues, like CJ’s in the Strip District, have strict age restrictions (CJ’s is closed to patrons younger than 30) and prevent jazz from being experienced across generations. Additionally, WDUQ, formerly Pittsburgh’s only jazz radio station, changed to an NPR news station last year. There are simply not enough lively hubs for the cultivation of an innovative jazz scene in Pittsburgh.
In light of this seemingly atrophied jazz environment, two events in Pittsburgh reveal that the local contemporary jazz scene is rekindling: On Mondays, AVA Lounge in East Liberty hosts Interval Monday, and the Thunderbird Cafe in Lawrenceville hosts Space Exchange on Tuesdays.
On what is considered the week’s dead night for entertainment in Pittsburgh, AVA Lounge offers one of the hottest jazz jams, incorporating silent film projections and an open stage. The weekly session was founded by pianist Howie Alexander in July 2007, and is now known as the premier event for jazz music in Pittsburgh due to the local and nationally recognized talent it attracts.
Typically, the sessions consist of two sets. The first set belongs to the Interval Trio (Alexander, Paul Thompson, and James Johnson III), while the second set opens up the stage to musicians in the audience. The jam session features both jazz standards and original compositions, and resident DJ J. Malls (also known as Jason Molyneaux) spins classic jazz vinyl during breaks. A documentary-style web series, called The Interval Trio & Friends, is currently being produced that focuses on the lives and sessions of the musicians.
In contrast to the Interval Monday jam sessions, Space Exchange at the Thunderbird Cafe is marked by an approach that resembles a New York City artist residency, something rarely seen in Pittsburgh. Saxophonist Ben Opie, drummer Dave Throckmorton, guitarist Colter Harper, bassist Matt Booth, and guitarist/drummer Chris Parker are the core members of Space Exchange, and they collectively oversee the programming for the evenings.
In 2011, the group decided to approach Thunderbird Cafe owner John Pergal for a shot at a weekly residency. Because Pergal has supported the group’s past efforts, this collaboration seemed natural. However, the group has actively argued that Space Exchange neither be billed as a jazz event nor as a jam session. As a result, patrons won’t find musicians casually strolling in to display their skills in a specific genre. Rather, they will find a variety of ensembles associated with the core members, rotating in and out of the Thunderbird Cafe, waltzing across the boundaries of styles.
Aiming to develop a lasting presence in Pittsburgh, the group draws on the public interest in some of the collective’s established bands like Opie and Throckmorton’s Thoth Trio, Harper’s Rusted Root, and Opie’s audacious free jazz orchestra, Opek.
Given the history of Pittsburgh’s local jazz scene, events like Interval Monday and Space Exchange give hope for a playful and innovative scene in the future. As it stands, jazz enthusiasts need not fear a continued atrophy of the local scene. Jazz is happening; now it is up to the audiences to continue sharing the experience.
Future performances at Space Exchange will feature Opie performing the works of American composers Thelonius Monk, Anthony Braxton, and Ornette Coleman, alongside bassist Jeff Grubbs and Throckmorton’s “Book Exchange.”

Dear Patrick,
My roommate got a new girlfriend, and I have mixed feelings about it. He’s never in the room anymore, which is great. On the other hand, I hate seeing him happy. He used to be full of contempt and rage, but now he’s mellowed, full only of hatred and anger. Is there a way I can keep him out of the room and unhappy?
Thanks,
Need Original Tips, Laughter Of Neighbor Encourages Lonesome Yearnings
Dear NOT LONELY,
It may seem like a smart idea to sabotage his new relationship, but if they break up he’ll probably spend a few weeks moping around your room, complaining about the noise, your mess on the floor, and his abject despair. And that’s much worse than having him out of the house and happy.
The key is to keep them together and to make him unhappy in other ways. For instance, if she has a friend he hates, suggest they go on double dates together. Convince her to take him clothes shopping. If he wants to look good in front of her, you can use that to get him to do stuff for you. Just remember: It’s more important that you have the room to yourself.
Don’t worry about your own encroaching loneliness,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I just got a new girlfriend and I’m spending a lot of time with her, so I haven’t been hanging out with my roommate as much. It’s pretty clear he’s getting jealous and lonely, but won’t admit it. How do I get him to open up?
Sincerely,
Can’t Appreciate Roommate’s Position
Dear CARP,
Well, the first thing you need to do is rub it in his face. Really let him know how happy you are in your relationship. Let him stew in his envy. At some point, it’ll boil over and he’ll do something passive-aggressive, like writing about you in his newspaper column. Then, get him drunk. He’ll probably make a tearful, heartfelt confession about his feelings. You can hold this over his head for a long time.
If that doesn’t work, try bringing your girlfriend around your apartment for visits. The three of you could all hang out together! He definitely won’t hate that. Maybe the two of them could become besties. You could even try to set him up with her friends. I’m sure he won’t mind your unsolicited intrusion into his personal life one bit.
Or just take him to a bar to cry into some whiskey,
Patrick Hoskins

Last October, M83’s sixth album, Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming, was released. After months of build-up, a pretty good single, and a music video about runaway telekinetic kids who throw a super-hip party in a warehouse (or something like that), critics and fans alike devoured it.
As a huge M83 fan, I was just as pumped as everyone else for the supposedly epic double-album that would forever change the way that I would perceive music. After listening to the album a couple of times, waiting for that moment of spiritual awakening, I realized the awful truth of Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming: It was just another M83 album. A very good M83 album, but an album that was hyped to an absurd extent.
Due to this hype, it was impossible for me to tell if I genuinely liked the album. I eventually got so sick of all the praise that I started to hate it on principle. On the flip side, when my friend introduced me to M83’s debut album a couple years ago, I didn’t have some exterior force telling me how I should react to it. I felt like I was truly discovering something, building a relationship with the music.
This relationship-building is why there are so many venerated classics that continue to be played to this day: Pink Floyd’s The Wall, Led Zeppelin’s Led Zeppelin IV, pretty much everything The Beatles ever put out. But our inability to detach ourselves from this relationship and our continued insistence on publicly extolling them has prevented anyone who came after their time from building a real, individualized relationship with the music.
So if you have an album you really love or a band that you would give anything to see live that you just have to show people, check yourself. Suggest it and let your friends discover it for themselves. The only way that good music will survive the generation it was composed for is if a new generation can view it as genuinely meaningful, and not just as a facet of culture.

100 years: Feb. 15, 1912
There is a new tardiness policy for the spring semester: All tardies to class must now be followed up with a letter to the dean explaining the nature of the lateness and asking for pardon. The Tartan jokes that Carnegie Mellon will soon turn out “the next great American novelist” due to all of the explanations students must write.
50 years: Feb. 28, 1962 
A Mardi Gras-themed “masked ball” has students excited to spend Friday night in the Skibo Ballroom. Hosted by the International Club, the event will feature traditional dances from various countries followed by a floorshow hosted by the Queen of Mardi Gras, with prizes for the best costumes.

Love and sex are the central themes of this week’s editorial section. One writer criticizes the lack of condom advertisements by major news networks, and another writer explores whether “true love” exists at Carnegie Mellon by asking the question, “Does Carnegie Mellon exist?”

SciTech runs a review about a new piece of musical technology: the iPod. Toted as “sleek” and “unique,” The Tartan writers give the device a big thumbs up for innovation and usefulness. The iPod can store around 1,000 songs, costs around $400, and is the size of a deck of cards.

A 1980 Carnegie Mellon alumnus writes a letter to the editor arguing for the Scottish terrier as the new mascot. He argues that the Scottie mascot has already been unofficially used for a while and will be more effective at selling merchandise than a highlander or piper — which the alumnus fondly refers to as “a man in a skirt.”

Like Crazy
8 10 12
Like Crazy is a romantic drama that won the Grand Jury Prize at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. Jacob, an American design student, and Anna, a British exchange student, fall in love over a year’s time and stay together for a summer. After visiting family in England, Anna is denied re-entry into the United States, forcing the couple into a strained long-distance relationship. _Like Crazy_’s script was improvised almost entirely by the actors. Fun Fact: The ex-wife of the director has stated that the movie is basically a re-enactment of their own romantic history.
A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas
8 10 12
Set six years after the sequel, the franchise that helped relaunch Neil Patrick Harris’ career is back and just as funny as ever. This film follows the fearless duo as they embark on another spectacular journey after Kumar accidentally burns down Harold’s father’s prize Christmas tree. It’s silly, yes, but what else would you expect? Fun Fact: Danny Trejo, who plays Mr. Perez in the movie, wears an ugly Christmas sweater in the film; that alone should be reason enough to see this.
Wet Hot American Summer
10 12
Wet Hot American Summer is one of the most underrated comedies to come out in the last 15 years. It stars a bevy of comedic actors including Janeane Garafolo, Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, Elizabeth Banks, and many more. The movie shows these men and women as camp counselors who hilariously make it through the final week of summer camp. The film is very tongue-in-cheek about itself. Several scenes are too over the top to even describe. It’s the perfect movie to just sit back, turn your brain off, and watch. And isn’t that a fantastic thing to do around midterms?

Around 60 members of the university community met last Tuesday afternoon to discuss Carnegie Mellon’s options amid a state funding crisis that has the Port Authority of Allegheny County proposing a cut of 35 percent of its bus and light rail service.
Ryan Wolfe, Carnegie Mellon’s director of Campus Services, led an hour-long town hall meeting in the University Center’s Danforth Lounge to inform attendees about the proposed cuts and to answer questions about how the university could compensate for a reduction in bus service.
Wolfe presented an analysis of Carnegie Mellon’s use of the Port Authority system and how it would be impacted by planned route cuts. In the six months from July to December 2011, students, faculty, and staff have taken around 900,000 rides on 100 different routes. Nearly 90 percent of the ridership is concentrated in the 20 routes most frequently used by members of the university.
Among the top routes, the Port Authority has scheduled the 64, 69, and 58 for elimination in September. Another, the 28X, would stop at Robinson Town Center and no longer serve the airport. The buses most frequently used by Carnegie Mellon riders, the 61 and 71 series, would continue to exist with service reductions. Of these, only the 61B, 71A, and 71D would continue to operate after 10 p.m.
At Tuesday’s meeting, discussion of Carnegie Mellon’s response to the proposed transit cuts fell into three areas: direct talks with the Port Authority, possible lobbying of the state government in Harrisburg, and enhancing the university’s shuttle and Escort routes.  Many of the audience questions concerned shuttle expansions, but Wolfe cautioned that a university-run service would be much smaller and more focused toward campus than the public buses.
“We’re not even in a position to replicate the top 20 routes ... with our own shuttle and Escort system,” he said. Still, he said it would be possible for Carnegie Mellon to replace a few key routes, perhaps jointly with the University of Pittsburgh. Service to Greenfield and the airport would be the top two priorities, though airport service would likely operate at reduced hours compared to the current 28X.
“I guarantee you that, if there’s no 28X, we will find a way to get people to the airport,” Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy said at the meeting.
An audience member suggested that the current Pittsburgh Technology Center (PTC) shuttle could stop in Greenfield on its way to Second Avenue. Lieutenant Joseph Meyers, who directs the shuttle and Escort program for University Police, said that he had already been thinking about reworking the PTC route.
“My original thought was to run it through Oakland (at least on the return run) to provide another option for any Oakland folks to get to campus,” he wrote in an email after Tuesday’s forum. “I really hadn’t considered the Greenfield possibility because no one has ever expressed a desire for Greenfield service.... It’s certainly something I would explore if requested.”
Other attendees asked if it would be possible to combine shuttle operations with neighboring universities or adding connecting routes to the East Busway. Meyers said that Carnegie Mellon and Pitt students can already ride each other’s shuttles with proper ID, and Carnegie Mellon’s current A, B, and AB shuttles already make stops at the East Busway’s Negley Station.
The financing of bus rides — whether by campus shuttles or by the Port Authority — was also a recurring theme during the forum. Carnegie Mellon is set to open talks with the Port Authority this week over the university’s next five-year contract with the transit agency, which will begin later this year.
Under the current agreement, the university pays the Port Authority a preset amount each year, no matter the actual number of rides taken. Murphy said that the sum works out to around $1.08 per ride, up from 58 cents five years ago. 
Outside of Carnegie Mellon, Murphy said, the Port Authority takes in approximately $1.30 per ride but spends more than $4. 
Some in the audience questioned whether Carnegie Mellon should offer to pay more, either for pragmatic or ethical reasons. In a follow-up interview, Wolfe said that extra payments from the university would have little effect on the authority’s service level or bottom line. “They have a $64 million problem,” he said of the Port Authority. “Even if we were able to give them a million more dollars, that’s not helping. In the grand scheme of things, it’s not enough to help.” Carnegie Mellon paid approximately $1.5 million for bus passes this year, Wolfe said.
Carnegie Mellon’s next contract with the Port Authority will include the use of “smart cards” that users will tap against fare boxes rather than showing them manually to the driver. Pitt has already tested and converted to a similar system. According to Wolfe, the university will begin a test over the summer and fully convert to the new cards over the course of next school year.
Smart cards will tie transit pass validity automatically to records in the Carnegie Mellon Card Office instead of requiring an expiration date to be printed on university IDs. The cards will also facilitate more precise ridership tracking and change Carnegie Mellon’s contract with the Port Authority to a per-ride payment rather than a lump sum.
But with contract negotiations in the future, the Port Authority’s cuts still not finalized, and a transit funding bill pending in the state legislature in Harrisburg, Carnegie Mellon’s ultimate response to any public transit cutback is also yet to be decided.
On Tuesday, Wolfe encouraged audience members to participate in the Port Authority’s public hearing process, either by filling out the authority’s online comment form or by attending a day-long hearing scheduled for Feb. 29 at the David Lawrence Convention Center downtown. 
He said the university will likely release an official statement through the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a nonprofit group of area business and university leaders whose goals include improving the region’s transportation infrastructure.
Student Senate Chair Will Weiner, a junior statistics and social and decision sciences double major, said that student government is planning a trip to Harrisburg to lobby in favor of House Bill 2112, a proposal to fund public transportation in the state with $200 million from Pennsylvania Turnpike revenue.
Senate has also launched www.stoppatcuts.com, where visitors can sign a petition in support of the bill.
Ultimately, concrete action depends on the Port Authority’s final service plan — due to be voted on by the agency April 27 — and the state legislature’s budget hearings later this month and in March.
“There are so many variables and unknowns right now for us to begin to even formulate a strategy,” Meyers said in an email. “My main concern right now is getting some definitive answers about [the Port Authority’s] fate in enough time that we can react thoughtfully and decisively.”
Wolfe agreed, saying that the university is, to some extent, playing a waiting game. “We’re going to watch what we see out of Harrisburg, kind of what the tone of the whole situation is, and as we get closer to April I think we’re going to start seeing what is the likelihood of these cuts actually coming true,” he said. “We’re going to probably experience a certain amount of cuts. Whether or not it’ll be the full 35 percent, it’s probably too early to tell.”

A diverse group of people with careers in media held a discussion called “New Media/News Media” in the Steinberg Auditorium last Wednesday. The six panelists spoke in front of a nearly full auditorium about the current state of media and the directions they see it taking in the future. The panel was held by the Center for Arts in Society, a collaborative effort between faculties in the College of Fine Arts and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences that explores the interaction of society and art.
The panel consisted of an editor from the Pittsburgh City Paper, a columnist and an editor from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a reporter from Essential Pittsburgh Radio, a blogger, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer. 
Professor of art James Duesing introduced the program, and associate professor of English Kathy Newman introduced the panelists. An informal attitude prevailed, with panelists referencing each other and discussing the points others raised. The panel closed with questions from the audience.
Chris Potter of the Pittsburgh City Paper presented a slide show about his experiences integrating social media into his work. He explained the importance of distinctions between official and unofficial online presences for journalists by sharing a lighthearted tweet claiming that a local television reporter known for gross inaccuracies was not “a person at all, but 12 marmots bundled up in a suit.”
Potter also talked at length about website design for print publications. “Designers and writers are making America dumber by increasing white space and decreasing text,” he said. He ended his presentation by asking for donations for his newborn daughter’s college fund, exclaiming, “Print journalism is dead, everyone!”
Tony Norman, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist, said that he does not believe print journalism is dead yet, but likened mainstream media to dinosaurs right before the asteroid impact, and blogs to the first mammals. However, he believes that after mainstream media loses its profitability, a series of “aspirational changes” will allow the industry to reclaim a unique environment similar to that found at tech companies like Google.
“We joke about the established media being dinosaurs and falling apart,” said John Allison, associate editor for the Post-Gazette, “but we’re resilient, we’re creating something people want.” Allison later said that while he was glad to be invited to give his views and learn campus attitudes through the tone of questions, he found that young people lack the “romance for print” his generation held.
Andrew Schwartz, a first-year information systems and statistics double major who attended the event, concurred, saying, “I get my information from my Twitter feed, I subscribe to Anderson Cooper, I subscribe to The New York Times.” However, he enjoyed and recommended the panel, although only for those with an interest or stake in journalism.
The other panelists were more hopeful for the future of media. Photographer Martha Rial explained her new affinity for journalistic slideshows that combined photography and narration. Award-winning blogger Maria Lupinacci went over how she managed to achieve success in the blogosphere, and explained how she believes the future of journalism will be a balance of traditional and new media.
Deanna Garcia of Essential Pittsburgh Radio said that while the future of all media, radio especially, seems to be somewhat unclear, Carnegie Mellon students may have an edge. “The mix of backgrounds and the strength of the programs here ... may mean that a student or professor here may know more about what’s going on in the world of new media than ... a station owner or editor,” Garcia said.

Carnegie Mellon is participating in the three-week Campus Conservation Nationals (CCN) competition from Feb. 6 to Feb. 27.
CCN is the first national competition aimed at motivating college students to reduce electricity and water consumption on their campuses. All the participant schools —about 150 colleges this year — work together to reach one collective goal: to save one gigawatt-hour of electricity consumption.
In response to the nationwide CCN, Carnegie Mellon has organized a competition among residential halls on campus. 
The nine buildings in the contest are Boss House, Donner House, Hamerschlag House, Henderson House, McGill House, Mudge House, Scobell House, Stever House, and Welch House. The residence hall that conserves the most electricity will be rewarded with a pizza party.
Barbara Kviz, the co-chair and environmental coordinator of Carnegie Mellon’s green practices committee, is in charge of the event. According to Kviz, Facilities Management Services (FMS) obtained the baseline electricity consumption before Feb. 6 in the competing residential halls. 
The data will be compared to the consumption rate during the competition in order to determine the percent reduction. 
On Feb. 6, FMS launched a website where students can check real-time electricity usage data as well as previous data. According to Kviz, the real-time data has been helpful in pinpointing anomalous energy usage.
“We are finding in one  particular building, in Henderson, something is going on there that is generating a tremendous amount of electricity,” Kviz said. “We are trying to investigate what that is, because we don’t know what it is.”
Julie Woo, a first-year in CIT who lives in Boss House, said in an email, “I was aware of this competition because I saw it on the whiteboard that I walk past everyday [sic] on the way to my room. I think posting it in the dorms and high traffic areas where people walk by daily is a good way to publicize the event.”
However, she also said that the competition really hasn’t changed the way she consumed energy because it had already been her habit to turn the lights off when she left the dorm.
Not all students are aware of the competition. Alex Gerber, a first-year math and economics major who also lives in Boss House, said in an email, “No, I have never heard of the contest. I would like to know more about it, as it sounds like a promising incentive to conserve energy on a daily basis.”
Zac Vennard, a senior international relations major and an RA in Boss House, said in an email, “Students can be better exposed to the competition through more promotion in general. We’ve received very few emails about this, and the few outlets of information (posters and here-say [sic]) that are being used are too passive. I believe that if we really want to get the word out, we need to make a much bigger deal of the competition and our participation in it.”
He said that the website would be a very good tool to better promote the competition and to get students actually interested in the event.
According to Kviz, the website will remain active after the competition ends. She said that the competition’s organizers are searching for a student who can help them to improve the website’s interface.

A man convicted of insider trading warned Tepper School of Business students in a video conference on Tuesday not to make the same mistakes he did.
Garrett Bauer, a proprietary trader, pled guilty to insider trading in December 2011. Bauer was the “tippee,” as he put it: The person who trades on secrets given to him by an insider. 
In Bauer’s case, the insider was his long-time friend, mortgage banker Kenneth Robinson, as well as lawyer Matthew Kluger. Bauer traded on Robinson and Kluger’s secrets for $37 million, according to the federal government’s estimates. The proceeds were split among the three men.
Since being released on a $4 million bail, Bauer has spoken at numerous business schools about the consequences of insider trading.
“I really want to prevent you from committing my crime, insider trading, or really any crime in general,” Bauer said in the short prepared speech that began the conference. “There are catastrophic consequences which nobody believes is going to happen to them.” Bauer said that insider trading is common in the field of business, and he wants to ensure that today’s students do not engage in it, for their and others’ sake.
In his prepared remarks and during the question-and-answer session that followed, Bauer described in detail how he had committed his crimes, how he was prosecuted, and what the future likely holds for him.
Roshan Sriram, a first-year Tepper student, said that one of the most interesting aspects of Bauer’s speech was his descriptions of life in jail. “It was really interesting [hearing about] everything from his whole experience in the process, his whole time in jail,” Sriram said.
Bauer shared many details of his experiences in jail, from finding a spork that he used for every meal to being issued a phone card that never worked. He said that if he gets his anticipated sentence of nine to 11 years, he will probably be held in a minimum-security prison, which is arranged more like a camp than a jail.
Jennifer Cai, first-year business administration major and activities director of the Undergraduate Finance Association, which coordinated the event, said that she hoped the talk gave students a personal look at insider trading.
“His personal anecdotes were amazing. Some of it was so emotional for me,” Cai said. “I could really imagine being in jail.... I liked how he shared so much of his personal experience. He could have talked a lot more about investment and trading, but instead he talked a lot about how he felt.”
The questions students asked ranged from personal to business-oriented. One student asked whether Bauer had spoken to Robinson since he had turned him in. Another student asked whether Bauer had ever heard a trader refuse to trade on insider secrets. To both questions, Bauer said he had not. One student asked for the specific names of firms that Bauer had gotten good deals with, but Bauer did not provide them.
Sriram felt that the conference was effective. “You hear about [insider trading] a lot. It’s a very present problem in this country,” he said. “I didn’t know that the consequences were that severe. His future is basically ruined.”
Cai agreed. She said that Bauer was an important and unusual speaker to have. “We’re interested in preparing our members for careers in finance, and I think a lot of times some ethical issues are overlooked, and I thought this was a good chance to emphasize the ethical issues,” she said. “I thought it added a lot of value to what we do as an organization.”

CIT awarded new grant for transportation improvement
The Carnegie Institute of Technology, along with the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, received a $3.5 million grant last Wednesday which will fund research related to the improvement of transportation. The grant, which spans the next two years, focuses specifically on initial inquiry into, and eventual development of, innovative technologies that will make transportation safer and more efficient.
As a result of the grant, a new initiative called the University Transportation Center for Technologies for Safe and Efficient Transportation, or T-SET UTC, will be developed by Carnegie Mellon and Penn, and located on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus.
Carnegie Mellon electrical and chemical engineering professor Raj Rajkumar will serve as the director of the UTC. “State-of-the-art computing and communication technologies can significantly advance the safety and efficiency of transportation, since extending the physical infrastructure is both very expensive and limited by existing road layouts,” Rajkumar said in a university press release.
The center will also work closely with Traffic21, a multidisciplinary research team currently working on the development of technologies that will deploy information to improve safety conditions of transportation options.
The Carnegie Mellon and Penn UTC was chosen as one of 22 grant recipients out of 63 applicants. 
Research reveals offshore wind turbines at storm risk
A group of professors, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy researched the risks hurricanes pose to offshore wind turbines in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions. Recently, the researchers released their findings. They say that some turbines are at risk.
Engineering and public policy professor Paulina Jaramillo is the primary author of the paper summarizing the results, which appeared last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The group’s research focused on the shore regions with the most accessible offshore wind resources. Those regions were struck by hurricanes more than 90 times between 1949 and 2008.
“The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that if the U.S. is to generate 20 percent of its electricity from wind that some 50 [gigawatts] of power will have to come from offshore turbines that may be vulnerable to hurricane damage,” Jaramillo said in a university press release. “While no offshore wind farms have been built in the U.S., there are several in advanced stages of planning.”
The research team proposed the development of prevention and safety measures that would allow these turbines to measure wind direction. Ideally, such measures would help prevent serious hurricane damage in the future.

Officers learned that this male had previously been issued a defiant trespass warning for being on campus when he was not supposed to be. They also found that there was a warrant out for the man in Chicago, Ill. 
The male was placed in custody, and later transported to the Allegheny County Jail and charged with defiant trespassing.
Carrying a False ID
Feb. 16, 2012
A Carnegie Mellon security officer found a wallet in the computer cluster in West Wing. 
The wallet was turned over to University Police. During an inventory of the contents of the wallet, a fake driver’s license was located, along with the owner’s real identification. 
The owner of the wallet responded to the University Police station to recover her wallet. Upon the owner’s arrival she was cited for carrying a false ID.
Defiant Trespassing
Feb. 16, 2012
A staff member at the Mellon Institute called the Carnegie Mellon security desk to report a suspicious male wandering through the building. The security officer receiving the call recognized the male from the description given, and detained him until University Police arrived on the scene. The male initially gave the officers a false name. The officers were able to positively identify him. 
He was issued a defiant trespassing warning letter and told that if he returned to Carnegie Mellon property, he would be arrested and prosecuted for trespassing.

Late last month, the Pentagon released a report that stated the rate of sexual crimes within the U.S. Army — most frequently “rape, sexual assault, and forcible sodomy” — has increased by 64 percent since 2006. Of these reported sex crimes, 95 percent were committed against women.
Liz Trotta, a correspondent for Fox News and the first woman to cover a war for a broadcast news channel, commented last Sunday that these “feminists” — as she seems to call women who serve in the military and those who support the notion that these sex crimes are happening — have only themselves to blame.
“Now, what did they expect?” Trotta said during a Fox News segment. “These people are in close contact, the whole airing of this issue has never been done by Congress, it’s strictly been a question of pressure from the feminists.”
Trotta’s statements are erroneous on several accounts. Her first mistake was assuming that the 64 percent increase in reported sexual crimes was due to the steady increase in the number of women in the military.
At a Pentagon press conference last Wednesday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta rightfully pointed out that this statistic is only indicative of the number of reports of sexual assault within the military, not the actual number of assaults that have taken place.
Last year, there were 3,191 reports of sexual assault within the military. Panetta suggests that the true estimate is around 19,000.
The fact that the percentage of reported sexual assaults has increased so dramatically over the past six years should be viewed as a good thing because an increase in reports does not mean an increase in sexual assaults. However, Trotta also condemned recent increases in funding to support programs that assist victims of sexual assault in the military. It is likely that without these programs, even more of the alleged 19,000 victims would be unheard, too ashamed or unwilling to step forward.
Trotta also fails to recognize that a significant number of the victims who haven’t stepped forward are probably men.
The army’s ranks are currently 86 percent men and 14 percent women; forced sodomy among men is probably much more common than the statistics of sexual assault reports reveal, due to the emasculation of the act.
Trotta’s remarks reflect the larger societal issue of blaming rape on victims.
Not only should Trotta quickly release an apology for her comments, but our culture as a whole needs to change so that victims are comfortable reporting these crimes and receiving the help they deserve from society.

President Jared Cohon emailed members of the university last week with two important announcements: the Inspire Innovation capital campaign hit the $1 billion milestone, and tuition for the 2012–13 academic year is going to be increased. The fundraising milestone is a major accomplishment for the university and its supporters, and we hope potential donors continue to invest in Carnegie Mellon’s future.
That said, most current and prospective students were more interested in the tuition increase. Although we regret the necessity of annual tuition increases due to inflation and economic pressures, we support the Board of Trustees’ decision to implement a relatively modest increase in tuition rates next year.
Many students’ first reaction to tuition increases is frustration or anger — after all, Carnegie Mellon already has one of the highest tuitions in the country. However, the university’s rapid rise in prominence in recent decades has created financial shortfalls relative to comparable institutions. University leaders would prefer to fund financial aid, for example, largely from the endowment, but they are currently unable to do so. Only through continued fundraising successes like the Inspire Innovation campaign will these goals be reached.
Additionally, we support the university’s leaders in their efforts to involve undergraduate students in the consideration of each year’s tuition. Michael Murphy, vice president for Campus Affairs, hosts an annual dinner where administrators, faculty, parents, and students discuss the undergraduate experience at Carnegie Mellon, particularly tuition and fees. These events, and others like them, should continue in future years.
University administrators are aware of the financial and human costs of tuition increases, but they also have a responsibility to continue improving Carnegie Mellon’s educational quality and student experiences.
This year’s modest tuition increase is an effective balance between students’ finances and the university’s future.

The Keystone XL pipeline, which has been hotly debated the past few months, was denied its permit last month by President Barack Obama on the grounds that he did not have enough time to adequately review whether the pipeline would be safe. This was after a compromise between Republican and Democratic members of Congress resulted in a deadline for a decision on the pipeline.
Republican members, led by Speaker of the House John Boehner, resurrected measures late last month to construct the pipeline. Boehner’s goal is to give the House Committee on Energy and Commerce the power to grant the pipeline’s permits instead of the president.
Construction on the pipeline should be approved because it would create a number of jobs, allow the U.S. to decrease its dependence on foreign oil, and be environmentally safe.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce projects that 250,000 jobs would be created by the pipeline’s construction. According to a report by ABC News, Boehner said that the pipeline would add about 100,000 jobs to our economy.
More modest projections from TransCanada, the company trying to construct the pipeline, claim that around 20,000 jobs would be created directly through construction.
This doesn’t include the indirect economic stimulus that the construction would provide by acquiring supplies, or through the money that the workers would inject back into the economy.
Regardless of which projection is correct, a project this massive is an easy free-market solution to creating short- to medium-term jobs through the construction and long-term maintenance of the pipeline. The pipeline has the potential to jump-start some long-term economic growth. This would be a much needed shot in the arm for our stagnant economy.
Opponents of the pipeline claim on several blogs and environmental awareness websites, notably grist.org, that it doesn’t aid U.S. energy independence because much of the oil going to Gulf Coast refineries is set for export and not sold to U.S. markets. Though they would be correct, the reason that this oil is being exported is because proceeds on oil exports are tax free, according to tarsandsaction.org.
If the U.S. were to equalize tax rates and make the domestic market as competitive as the foreign market for oil, then the Keystone XL pipeline would be just half of a two-part solution to increasing energy independence.
If tax reform is enacted, then we will have a gateway toward a safe oil partnership with Canada, a nation with which we have a history of friendly trade relations. As of right now, however, even if the U.S. were to enact this tax reform, we still wouldn’t have developed the domestic oil resources needed to be independent. This is why development of the pipeline would help give the United States options in the future if we want to promote energy independence.
The biggest objection to the Keystone XL pipeline is its environmental impact. The pipeline’s route would go through the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water and agricultural support for many in the Midwest and hosts a large wildlife population.
However, the pipeline is “the most technologically advanced and safest pipeline in the world,” according Rep. Ed Whitfield (R–Ky.), a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. TransCanada has designed it to have 57 improvements on U.S. standard safety requirements.
In addition, there are 200,000 miles of comparable pipeline in the U.S. that have managed to operate with little or no harm to the environment.
The pipeline would help the U.S. economy in many ways without a large environmental impact. Congress needs to approve its construction for the economic security of our country.

Due to the ill effects of smoking, the federal government is pushing for graphic images of emaciated lungs, decayed teeth, and stomachs after surgery, to be required on cigarette packages.
This order, which comes from the Family Smoking Protection and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, allows the government to regulate the tobacco industry.
Even though major cigarette producers are complaining that the new law violates the First Amendment’s freedom of speech clause, the use of these labels is necessary for the protection of people’s health.
When it comes to the question of an individual’s health versus a company’s freedom of speech, the health of the individual should be the priority.
This is particularly noteworthy when the number of people who die each year from tobacco-related conditions averages around 443,000 per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the article Tobacco Use: Targeting the Nation’s Leading Killer At A Glance 2011.
Cigarette companies are clearly arguing that their freedom of speech is being infringed upon for their own self-interest. 
If they truly cared about the health of their consumers and, in turn, the overall health of the nation, cigarette manufacturers would have already searched for a healthier alternative or been more willing to warn potential buyers of their product’s negative effects.
Because the companies themselves made such little effort for change, they now have to fight government regulations such as these graphic warnings.
As noted by the Food and Drug Administration on its cigarette health warnings website, “tobacco use is the leading cause of premature and preventable death in the United States.”
Complete freedom of speech, as advocated by cigarette companies, is detrimental to the welfare of Americans.
This freedom contributes to a practice that has been deemed dangerous by various institutions, including a group of 22 states that recently announced their endorsement of the graphic labels.
The fact that cigarette companies are opposed to these new labels, when other countries have had these measures in place for years, is extremely disturbing.
According to journalist Lara Salahi of ABC News, the United States is “now playing catch-up to more than 30 countries” that have similar graphic cigarette label laws already in place.
There is no doubt that these labels would encourage consumers to quit or avoid these habits in the first place, as they do in other countries.
Even though not all of these countries promote freedom of speech to the same degree that the United States does, the warnings required by these nations must be considered a model for the United States if the government hopes to significantly curb the amount of smokers in the country. After all, these new labels more clearly convey the factual implications of smoking.
Many critics claim that if the gripes of the cigarette companies are heard before the Supreme Court, they will win the battle that they have been fighting for almost a year now.
If this were to occur, the Supreme Court would clearly be showing the nation that the rights of large corporations are valued over the health and rights of individuals.

North Carolina father Tommy Jordan posted a video on YouTube on Feb. 8, titled “Facebook Parenting: For the troubled teen,” of himself discussing a recent Facebook post made by his daughter Hannah. For the first seven minutes of the eight-minute video, Jordan chastises his daughter for posting her complaints against her parents, calling it rude and disrespectful.
Citing that this wasn’t the first time she was irreverent, Jordan then proceeded to shoot eight bullets into the laptop that he bought and upgraded for his daughter.
As of last Friday, the video had 26.5 million views. The popularity of this video demonstrates the frustrations that many parents feel when they cannot control their children’s behavior online. While it may seem rash or extreme, Jordan’s actions neither cross the line nor become unacceptable.
The use of a gun in the video has drawn the most ire from critics. According to KSLA News 12, Child Protective Services visited Jordan’s home in order to make sure it was a safe environment for his daughter.
While his daughter’s safety is the primary concern, she was never in danger. Jordan never physically threatened his daughter during the video, only promising that she was going to be grounded for an extended amount of time. His use of the gun, while extreme, was controlled. He was not in a fit of rage while shooting — he very calmly shot the laptop.
Jordan’s video is a form of discipline that, while more public than most, does not cross the line. While the video may not be indicative of the entirety of the relationship, the actions in the video correspond appropriately to the nature of his daughter’s behavior.
Jordan’s daughter should be more embarrassed of the comments in her own post than of her father’s reactionary video.
When everything is posted, blogged, shared, and tweeted, the disciplining of children is also becoming more public. While his methods are far from normal, Jordan’s actions are justifiable and indicate the frustrations parents have at a time when children have many public outlets.

Last week, the Obama administration backed off of its previous demand that religiously affiliated institutions — such as Catholic hospitals or Baptist colleges — provide birth control to its female employees for free.
This previous demand would have lumped these institutions in with regular employers, but instead left religious institutions, such as churches and synagogues, alone. Religiously affiliated organizations currently receive taxpayer funding, yet are not required to follow the same laws as the secular organizations receiving government handouts.
Religiously affiliated institutions have no right to force their beliefs on their employees or customers, when they are being supported by taxpayer dollars.
When Congress passed the 1965 Civil Rights Act, it was mainly focused on eliminating racial discrimination, but it also included a clause about religious affiliation. Religious institutions that want to hire based on religion or expect employees to follow a strict moral code must explicitly state that expectation and demand at the time of hiring.
But what if an employee changes his or her views, or the views of the institution change? In a Catholic hospital, every doctor has to agree to follow the hospital’s ethics code that bans all contraception, abortions, and all other procedures banned by the Catholic Church. These doctors are also forced to follow any new moral medical guidelines the Church adopts during their tenure.
Many times when patients need to be hospitalized, they do not have the ability to choose the hospital based on religious affiliation. In these cases, patients lose many of their rights, since some hospitals enforce a moral code that nullifies many legal documents — such as living wills — and at times puts patients’ lives in danger.
No institution has the right to decide what is moral or even best for its employees, particularly when it comes to the employees’ own health, based on religious principles that they may not believe in. There is an expectation of privacy and personal choice under our constitution and currently religiously affiliated institutions are not protecting or accepting of this right.
While there is a need to protect religious institutions, they should lose this protection when serving public needs and getting taxpayer funding. Once an institution accepts government funding, it should be required to adhere to all government regulations and laws like any other organization.
Religiously affiliated institutions must make a choice between strictly enforcing their morality, and accepting government funding with all of the laws and regulations that come with such support.

Generally, I think children are sticky and noisy, and that they spit a lot. Perhaps those are just the preschoolers I know, as well as the ones on Toddlers and Tiaras. These are the kids that fit the hyper, bratty image of the typical American toddler.
Sociocultural theorists state that a child is raised by the values and traditions of its society. In the book Bringing Up Bébé, Pamela Druckman observes the sociocultural differences in child-rearing between Americans and Parisians. She concludes that French parenting is superior to American parenting. I can’t help but agree that French children are raised to be more polite, patient, and overall civilized.
It’s rare to see a quiet, idyllic family enjoying a peaceful meal at Pamela’s or The Cheesecake Factory. Kids in restaurants can be tyrants: They throw forks at their parents, race around the tables, and scream into the waiter’s ear. This scene does not happen in Paris. French children sit quietly, eat their meals, and contribute to conversation, all while having their napkin folded on their lap.
In a nutshell, French parents are firm and authoritative. They do not cripple under the crying, screaming, or demanding of their children. They draw clear boundaries that their children know not to cross, so the obedience seems almost automatic.
It appears as though American children today have evolved to innately know that if they shed enough tears, they will eventually get their way. Their parents or babysitters instantly concede because no one has the time to endure tantrums. It all fits into the frame of the busy American lifestyle.
Middle-class French parents are excited about their kids. They talk to them, explore with them, dive into literature with them, and enrich them with culture. They are granted several public services (such as free preschool programs) that allow them to build this special hands-on bond that American parents seem unable to form.
American parents, who don’t have access to free preschool and other similar child development programs, are swamped with work and rely on daycare and nannies. It is impractical for American parents to engage in the same routine child outings because there is not enough time or energy in the day to do so.
It is not rational to expect parents to raise children by a universal standard, and therefore unrealistic to expect all children to develop the same. However, it is undeniable that French parenting results in children that are, essentially, easier to handle than American children. In this current state, it is not always possible for American parents to cut back on work hours or take the occasional day off.
So, unless there are more minutes in the day or more economically available public services, American parenting won’t emulate French parenting anytime soon. Although American children are sticky, noisy, and prone to cause disruptions, it would be fantastic to have a dinner conversation not interrupted by a wailing toddler.

I do not know how to respond upon learning that Carnegie Mellon University is touting a percentage increase of “only” 4 percent in tuition for the 2012–13 school year, which will bring the tariff to an astounding $44,880 per annum. “Sticker shock” sets in for those of us who are old enough to remember college tuition of the “dark ages” of the 20th century.
I attended Carnegie Mellon after graduating from high school in 1974. The tuition for the year at that time was $2,950. My late mother, piano performer and teacher Gloria Siegle Spiegler, attended Carnegie Tech from 1939 to 1943. When she began this wonderful period of her youth, the tuition was $150 per semester. 2012–13 tuition is more than 15 times that of 1974. If the prices of all essential commodities and services had increased by that amount, the American people could not afford to live.
I understand that most CMU students receive some type of financial aid, but that does not negate the fact that a quality college education is generally unaffordable. One must be fabulously wealthy to pay “sticker price” to attend Carnegie Mellon University.
It would be interesting to learn what changes would be made in administrator and employee compensation and other lavish university expenditures if an independent efficiency expert examined the ledger with an eye toward cutting fat.
