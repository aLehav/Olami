The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team faced a rough week in their most recent round of University Athletic Association play, falling first to Case Western Reserve 0–1 Friday night and then to number 10 University of Rochester 1–2. The Tartans stand at 6–7–2 for the season and at 1–3–2 in the UAAs, with one game left next Saturday against Emory University. 
The Tartans had a slow start against Case Western, with neither team hitting a breakthrough in the other’s defense until the 62nd minute, when the Spartans’ offense scored the only goal of the game. While the Tartans had superb offense, with attempts by first-year Katie Davis, junior Emily Overstreet, sophomore Elsa Wu, and sophomore Ashley Baker, the Spartans’ goalkeeper, Anna Kennedy, managed to save every kick to keep Case in the lead. 
The following Sunday the Tartans traveled to New York to face number 10 Rochester for one of their final UAA matches. Like the previous game, both the Tartans and Yellowjackets put up solid defense, preventing any action until two minutes before the end of the first period, when Rochester’s Ellen Coleman headed the ball in for a goal to put Rochester ahead 0–1. Wu had a lone shot attempt, and junior goalie Anya Rosen had one save for the period.
Just eight minutes into the final period, the Yellowjackets scored their second goal to increase their lead to 0–2. With minutes left before the buzzer, Overstreet directed a corner kick to Davis, who directed the ball in Rochester’s net for the Tartans’ only goal. Rosen contributed another save, along with Overstreet and first-year Lissie Arndt, who each had one effort at a goal.
“The team had an incredible second half against Rochester and we definitely outplayed them,” Wu remarked. “I guess it’s just a pity that we didn’t have a good first half, because if we had played the entire game like we did the second half, we would have won.”
“Our team had one of our best games against Rochester this past weekend,” Overstreet said. “We worked hard as a team and did an excellent job stringing passes together. Unfortunately, we let up two goals early and seemed to run out of time before we could tie it up.”
Although the Tartans will not make the NCAA playoffs, they remain determined to end the season on a positive note.
“For our last game at Emory, we just need to go in with the same mentality we had at Rochester,” Overstreet added. “We can win the game if we continue to work hard and play as a team. Depending on other UAA results, a win at Emory would put us in the middle of the rankings at the end of the season.”
Wu agreed with her teammate. “Unfortunately, the result of the game won't change anything. We’re out of the running for NCAAs, but I know the team wants to end the season with a definitive win, so that’s what we’re going to do.”
The Tartans play their final game of the season next Saturday when they travel to Atlanta, Ga. to face Emory University.

Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, staff, and alumni enjoyed Homecoming festivities this past week, including the Carnegie Mellon University football game against Washington University at Gesling Stadium on Saturday at 1 p.m. The football team opened its 2009 University Athletic Association (UAA) play with a 21–13 victory over the Bears. The game improved the Tartans’ overall record to 5–3 for the season.
After a rainy first half, the Tartans found themselves trailing 13–0. “We started the game a little flat, but knew that we would find a way to turn things around,” senior Socrates Zacharias said. “Taking advantage of the right opportunities let us capitalize to take the lead. The momentum change came when [first-year] Sam Thompson recovered a fumbled punt in the third quarter.” Late in the third quarter, junior punter Richard Pattison’s 55-yard punt resulted in a fumble that Thompson recovered at the Washington 10-yard line. With his first rushing touchdown of the season, senior quarterback Phil Pantalone brought the score up to 13–7 on third and goal on the four-yard line with only 14 seconds left in the third.
The strong Tartans defense then quickly forced the Bears to punt, but a bad snap was fumbled and recovered by Carnegie Mellon junior Tom Todd at the Washington 17-yard line. Only two plays later, senior Andrew Lovrovich brought the Tartans a 14–13 lead with 12:21 on the clock in the fourth quarter.
With the score close and the clock running down, the Tartans turned on a powerful rushing attack. Through 15 plays, a 75-yard drive, and eliminating 8:32 off the clock, the Tartans increased their lead. Junior running back Justin Pratt scored a one-yard touchdown, making the score 21–13 with only 1:36 left in the game.
The Bears had one last chance to bring the game back, but this was soon halted by an interception by Zacharias. This interception secured the Homecoming win for our Tartans. “The offense really pulled through with an 8-minute drive late in the fourth quarter,” said Zacharias. “We’re all ecstatic that we never gave up and were able to get our fifth win.”
The football team will play its last home game in Gesling Stadium this Saturday against Case Western Reserve at 2 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon Tartans started off the season with an impressive performance on Saturday with the men’s team winning the meet 158–136, and despite a good fight, the women lost 181–117 against Clarion University.
The Tartans were able to win five events during the meet. The women’s major contributors were junior Molly Evans, who won the 100-yard backstroke, 200-yard backstroke, and the 200-yard individual medley, along with senior Sara Andrews — who won the 200-yard freestyle — and first-year Dorothy Yu winning the 200-yard breaststroke. Andrews won the 200-yard freestyle, just touching out Clarion’s Rebecca Burgess by 0.04 seconds. Yu was able to finish her race with a time of 2:26.20, starting out the race with a split of a 1:09.86 and getting a two-second lead on the competition.
The women’s team placed very high in other events as well. Yu placed second in the 100-yard breaststroke, and fellow teammate Brenna Stillo touched third in the 100-yard breaststroke with a personal best time of 1:08.95. Sophomore Victoria Adams raked in two second-place finishes in the long distance events of the 500-yard and 1000-yard freestyle. Junior Brianne Burton was able to place third in the women’s 50-yard freestyle with a time of 24.72. To finish off the meet, the Tartans finished second in the 200-yard freestyle relay with the team of Andrews, Stillo, Burton, and sophomore Hannah Gonzalez, with a time of 1:42.66. Sophomore Olivia DeFazio was able to finish third for the Tartans’ diving team on the 1-meter board and finished fourth on the 3-meter board.
“I was upset that I didn’t win the 100-yard breaststroke, but I tried my best and didn’t let it stop me from doing my best in my next event,” said Yu, who won her next event, the 200-yard breaststroke. Stillo believed in her team, adding, “I think we did really well. We had a lot of lifetime best times and amazing swims, which I think really shows where this team is headed.”
The men’s team also had an outstanding meet, winning nine events. The Tartans were able to start off the meet with a great start, taking first and second place in the 200-yard medley relay. 
The winning team of junior Michael Panzitta, senior Jason Huber, first-year Dan Glaser-Garbrick, and junior Josh Mathews finished with a time of 1:38.38, while the team of seniors Scott Moorby and Andrew Seo, junior Travis Piper, and senior Jeffrey Dahlen touched in with a time of 1:39.16.
Senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki had a great meet, winning both of his individual events in the 500-yard and 1000-yard freestyle. The men were able to sweep the 1000-yard freestyle, with Altman-Kurosaki in first, junior Frank Olechnowicz finishing second, and senior Gates Winkler touching third. Glaser-Garbrick also had an impressive meet, winning the 100-yard and 200-yard butterfly. 
First-years Brandon Yee and Arthur Hong placed second and third in the 200-yard butterfly with times of 1:58.41 and 2:01.92, respectively. Yee also placed second in the 200-yard freestyle (1:44.78) and third in the 100-yard butterfly (53.80).
The Tartans also swept the 100-yard breaststroke, with Huber finishing first in 1:00.31 and Seo a close second at 1:00.66. Sophomore Ben Howe finished third in the event. For the 200-yard breaststroke, Seo was able to pull out the event placing first, with Huber in second and sophomore Michael Rong finishing third. First-year Kevin Kuntz said, “Clarion had some fast swimmers [but] just didn’t have the depth to win the meet.”
The Tartans will next be in action on Saturday, Nov. 14 for a meet against Grove City College beginning at 1 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team suffered its first loss in nearly two months as they were edged by the University of Rochester this past Sunday. The game was a must win for Rochester, who came into the game three points behind the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference leaders, Carnegie Mellon. Both teams have also shown extremely strong records this year and are ranked number 9 (Carnegie Mellon) and number 11 (Rochester) in the NSCAA/Adidas Division III Rankings.
From the kickoff, both sides came out very aggressive as they pushed for the crucial first goal. The Tartans came very close to scoring first as seniors Ricky Griffin and Ryan Browne were able to connect, but Browne’s shot was saved by Yellowjacket goalkeeper, Michael Peacock. Minutes later, Rochester answered back as senior midfielder Scott Cady scored off a crossed ball. 
The Tartans continued to press for a goal and nearly got it in the 35th minute when senior forward Pat Lutz mistimed a pass from senior midfielder Keith Haselhoff that would have sent him in on a clear goal-scoring opportunity. The game saw end-to-end action, and despite both teams tallying more than 10 shots, the 1–0 scoreline stood and Rochester went on to claim the victory.
Carnegie Mellon came into the game slightly fatigued, as this was their second away match in three days. The Tartans were able to beat Case Western Reserve University 2–0 on Friday, when Griffin scored his 18th goal of the season and Browne put one in as well. Senior goalie Maks Khurgin recorded his 11th shutout of the season.
The Cardinal and Gray are now 14–2 for the season and 5–1 in conference play. Going into the last week of the regular season, Carnegie Mellon and Rochester are now tied for first in the UAA, and a loss this week for either team will determine the regular season conference champions. With the NCAA tournament less than two weeks away, the last game of the season will be especially important for seeding and whether the Tartans will play at home in the first two rounds of the tournament.
Carnegie Mellon finishes off the regular season this Saturday as they travel to Atlanta to face Emory University.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country teams traveled to Cleveland, Ohio this Halloween to compete at the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship, hosted by Case Western Reserve University. The men’s team finished the meet tied with Emory for their third consecutive second-place finish at the meet, 26 points behind New York University, who took the title for the fourth consecutive year. The women placed seventh, 12 points ahead of the University of Rochester.
The Tartan men were led by sophomore Matt Jacob’s sixth-place performance in the 8k as he crossed the line in 26:33.69, 26.97 seconds behind the winner. Junior J.P. Allera finished next for the Tartans 12.86 seconds behind, ending in 11th place, and senior Dario Donatelli (26:53.44) and junior Dan Addis (26:54.70) finished in 14th and 15th respectively. Juniors Nate Bussiere (21st) and Justin Kurp (43rd), as well as senior Chris Rizzo (48th), rounded out the field for the Tartans to secure the tie, as Emory’s bottom three runners placed 28th, 36th, and 53rd.
“I feel that I personally ran very well,” men’s captain Donatelli said. “I have had a poor season so far, but in the meet this week, I was a lot closer to where I feel I should be. Our goal was to be competitive with NYU and to beat Emory this week. We were able to be close to NYU and we were obviously very competitive with Emory so we are happy with the team’s performance. Our fifth man Nate ran very well as he was able to get up and be competitive where we need him to be to allow us to compete at a high level.”
The women’s side was able to yield equally strong results. First-year Emily Wobb continued her strong rookie season, finishing 10th overall in the 6k with a time of 24:10.22. Wobb has now been the Tartans’ top finisher in all six of their races this year. Junior Courtney Baker came in 19th place at 24:28.44, followed a minute later by first-year Jackie Altshuler (25:28.06) in 44th and junior Danielle Morse (25:35.19) in 47th. Junior Laura McKee, first-year Eva Humphrey, and sophomore Cassie Wallace also scored points for Carnegie Mellon, finishing 57th, 58th, and 68th, respectively.
“The conditions of the course didn’t allow anyone to finish with a good time, but the experience was awesome,” said Wobb, who ran a 6k at Oberlin last week in a quick 21:56. “The race was really messy, but a lot of our girls had good races and our guys performed really well. I had lost contact with the top group early in the race...we were spread out too far apart.”
Both teams now have a two-week hiatus before competing at Lehigh University’s Mideast Regional in Bethlehem, Pa. on Nov. 14.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s crew teams participated in the Head of Occoquan in Fairfax, Va. last Saturday along with 25 other East Coast schools — including the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Duke — on what is considered to be one of the most challenging courses in the country. 
The 6000-meter course was the first away race for the varsity crew teams and the first competitive race for the novice team. 
The men’s varsity 4+ took fifth with a time of 18:50, and the women’s varsity team also had a decent finish, taking 10th in 20:45 out of 31 boats for both teams. The race concludes the fall season for the crew teams.
“Our fifth-place finish was an improvement from last year and a good way to end the season,” junior men’s captain Justin Perry said. “Now we know who is still ahead of us, and that will be our motivation to train all winter.”
The Tartans came into this challenging race strong, building off their success from strong finishes at the Head of the Ohio a few weeks back.
The Tartans had boats entered in seven categories that also included men’s and women’s varsity 8+ and men’s lightweight 1X. The men’s team was coxed by graduate student Bryan Cheung and rowed by Perry and juniors Sean Lubner, Jonah Coste, and Ed Burn. The women’s side was coxed by junior Nadja Yacker and is supported by senior rowers Alyssa Fogel and Megan Larcom, junior Claire Herdeman, and first-year Paige Wilson.
Beginner’s luck did not help the men’s novice 4+ team, who managed to finish the race in 23:42 but collided with an opposing boat during the race. 
“The race felt really good. We were in a good shape and I think we held our own against the other crews,” sophomore Dmitriy Yakubov of the novice men’s 8+ team said. “I think there is room for improvement and our time could be better, but at the end of the day, I believe everyone in that boat gave all they had to give, and that’s what matters most.”
“The [Head of Occoquan] course was definitely the most challenging course I’ve ever coxed, but the girls in my eight and four were able to power through the turns,” coxswain Gabbi Coloyan noted. “The girls in the four were especially able to crank on the power, and we were able to edge past other boats.”
The crew teams have one scrimmage left against Pittsburgh and Duquesne at Washington’s Landing on the North Shore before they head into winter training.

With one regular season game remaining this season, being No. 9 in the NCAA Division III is a pretty gratifying reward for the hard work of senior Pat Lutz and the determined and skillful Tartan men’s soccer team. Recently, Lutz collected his third UAA Men’s Soccer Athlete of the Week honor, as well as being venerated as the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Player of the Week. Lutz was a key player in the Tartans’ double-victory weekend against Brandeis University and New York University, with the game-winning,  lone goal against Brandeis and another goal and an assist in the NYU matchup.
Lutz is majoring in mechanical and biomedical engineering, and at this point is deciding between graduate school for biomechanics or finding a job in the field after he graduates in the spring. An avid fan of staying in shape, Lutz would love to channel his savvy of the human body into an additional study of kinesiology if he had the chance. Staying active and playing soccer has family ties for Lutz, as his father taught him and his brother how to play when they were young to hone their competitive spirit. Lutz notes that his favorite sport growing up was actually hockey, and the Lebanon, Pa. native remains an ardent Philadelphia Flyers fan. Although going to school in Pittsburgh means having to endure the Penguins hockey rivalry, Lutz enjoys the activities that city living has to offer and the change of pace in comparison to his country upbringing.
The Tartans’ final UAA regular season game will be against Emory University in Atlanta, Ga. on Saturday. Lutz, who has been successful in scoring game-winning goals in past seasons, aims to be a part of the team’s enthusiastic bid to become conference champions.

“Oh, don’t worry. Whales don’t eat clownfish. They eat krill. Oh look, krill!”
As Dory taught all of us in Finding Nemo, some whales — some of the largest animals ever to have lived on this planet — eat near-microscopic animals known as krill. The blue whale, at up to 100 feet long and 200 tons, lives on a diet of millions of creatures only a few centimeters in length. “Whales remain the most mysterious of our distant cousins,” said John Wible, curator of the mammals section at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
On Saturday, the museum opened Whales | Tohorā, an exhibit created by Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand’s national museum, available to the Carnegie Museum through the support of the New Zealand government. In addition to a breadth of information on whales, the exhibit also features artifacts and information from the Māori — pronounced “mow-ree” — of New Zealand, a tribe whose lives in many ways incorporate whales — or tohorā, in the Māori language. Most of the text for the museum’s labels was in fact written by the Māori.
One way the museum alludes to the original home of the exhibit is that many of the multimedia presentations — including a cartoon titled “Tinarau and the Whale” depicting a folk tale of the Māori in which a proud and selfish man is punished for exploiting a cherished whale — offer the option of listening to the voice-over in Māori in addition to English. Like Finding Nemo, the Whales exhibit offers treats for both children and adults interested in whales. A life-size replica of a blue whale’s heart invites anyone of a smaller stature to climb through and listen to it beat. There is even information inside inaccessible to the average fully grown adult and meant exclusively for children. On the other hand, a child is not as likely as an adult to appreciate the raft invented by New Zealanders to rescue beached whales on display on the other side of the room. Dispersed among the entertaining information — such as a small chamber in which visitors can listen to the sounds that a variety of whales make — are a few more emotionally charged displays. In a jar, there is a torn plastic bag that once contained a pair of rubber gloves. This bag was extracted from the stomach of a Shepherd’s beaked whale and was determined to have been the cause of the whale’s death.
The Māori, like the population of New Zealand as a whole, were among some of the most prolific commercial whale hunters in the 19th and early 20th centuries, though now they represent some of the strongest opponents of commercial whaling. A few particularly vicious-looking weapons are encased beside a history of whaling in New Zealand, where the whale was used for its meat, oil, teeth, and bones. It was such a significant part of their lives that the Māori word parāoa means both “sperm whale” and “chief.”
The sperm whale is a prominent feature of the Whales exhibit: Two huge sperm whale skeletons face visitors the moment they walk through the doors to the exhibit. The skeletons dwarf even those of the dinosaurs visible a few floors below the entrance.
It is the largest of the toothed whales, a subgroup of whales that includes dolphins and porpoises. The blue and the humpback whales are known as baleen whales — ones whose diet consists mostly of krill. Toothed whales hunt larger fish and other marine creatures. One of the challenges of hunting in the darkest, deepest parts of the ocean is that visibility is minimal, so toothed whales rely on echolocation to locate prey. Echolocation is featured in a number of portions of the exhibition, including a video explaining how it functions as a sperm whale hunts a giant squid. The sound is expelled from an organ in the whale’s head, and — like sonar — bounces off an object in the distance back to the whale. The whales interpret the sound using a set of bones in the back of their jaws in a process similar to the one used by the bones inside a human’s ear. Whales’ fins are another place where the anatomy resembles human anatomy. One portion of the exhibit explains how whales evolved from hoofed mammals on land. There is enough information in this comprehensive exhibit to teach something new to almost everyone — a great example of the kind of multidisciplinary learning inspired by Andrew Carnegie.
Whales | Tohorā will be on display at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History until May 2.

Keeping track of the universe is no easy task; after all, the edges of the visible universe stretch nearly 93 billion light years across (a light year is about six trillion miles). Even so, dauntless researchers — at Carnegie Mellon University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Washington — are striving to do just that.
The U.S. Department of Energy has supplied a $1.6 million grant over a period of three years to fund the research of an automated method to detect astrophysical phenomena. The initiative is a collaborative effort between the three universities and is headed by Jeff Schneider, a research professor in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science. According to Schneider, limitations currently exist in the algorithms scientists use to analyze data gathered from powerful telescopes. “Current survey telescopes essentially scan the skies, log every image and object they see, and store them at data centers accessible to scientists around the world,” Schneider said.
Researchers have to prepare for the future, when even more powerful telescopes will be used that will gather greater amounts of data per day. One such telescope being built is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in Hawaii, which will be fully operational in 2016. Another is PAN-STARRS, also in Hawaii, which is already operational but expected to expand.
However, storing all of this data would take up petabytes of memory space — one petabyte is equivalent to one million gigabytes. Sorting through this much data, using current methods, would be impossible.
As a solution, Schneider’s research is intended to implement several methods to have machines sort through the data. This would incorporate both data mining methods, which is the process of finding patterns within data, and machine learning methods, which would allow computers to learn and make decisions based on given data. Schneider hopes to have machines implement anomaly detection, which has them “learn” a set of data about typical objects, and compare them with data from new observations.
Atypical objects would be marked as potential new discoveries. In addition, he hopes to implement unique pattern detection, a more global form of anomaly detection. As Schneider explained, “[Unique pattern detection] methods follow the same basic concept as anomaly detection, but they search for unique patterns over lots of objects rather than a single one. For example, maybe it would find that stars in galaxies that have the same size and shape as the Milky Way tend to also have higher proportions of metals in them.”
Currently, simulations exist that demonstrate events that take place in the universe. Schneider plans to create algorithms that will better match these simulations to observed activity in the universe. Further plans include using only data to create simulations to predict future events. “Here, the algorithm starts from scratch and has to figure out what the dynamic equations of a simulation should be in order to generate data like what we observe in the sky.” This research will hopefully bring about a better understanding of the universe, something so large, yet about which we know so little. Dark matter and dark energy, for example, may take up most of the observable universe, but our understanding is still unclear.
Astrophysics is not the only field that can benefit from this initiative. Schneider sees a larger picture for the future of his research: “All the other sciences, and especially the life sciences, are currently being deluged with the same avalanche of data that is simply too much for scientists to understand on their own. They need new discovery algorithms that will help them understand and find the knowledge in their data.” He notes that their work in science has become so complicated that, at times, it is necessary for computer algorithms, not scientists, to make discoveries. This research will, in effect, have machines analyze data and present findings to researchers. Schneider predicts that the future will hold even more complexity in terms of our understanding of the universe and the machines we use for research. “The details of the scientific models themselves may be too large and complex to be understood by individual scientists. This will call for even more sophisticated algorithms that are able to interact with scientists.”
There are countless discoveries waiting in the vastness of the universe. Schneider’s outlook for the future of astrophysics is hopeful: “We may find new kinds of objects that have never been observed before. We may find interactions that were previously unknown, such as the differing types of stars or galaxies that exist in very old or very young parts of the universe.”

On Oct. 29, the Perlis Atrium in Newell-Simon Hall, where TechBridgeWorld Interactive took place, had an almost festive atmosphere about it. 
Everywhere there were people of all ages — there were even some tech-savvy toddlers running around. Tables set up across the atrium had students explaining the various projects that TechBridgeWorld undertook.
TechBridgeWorld is a program at Carnegie Mellon University in which students use technology to help underdeveloped countries. 
This year marked their fifth year of activity, and it also marked the first year an internship was open for Carnegie Mellon students.
Several of the students who were part of the internship, known as Innovative Student Technology ExPerience (iSTEP), explained their many innovations that they put to use in countries like Tanzania and Ghana. Several video and slide show presentations helped explain the goals of iSTEP.
Bradley Hall, a senior in mechanical engineering who was part of iSTEP, helped introduce new cell phone technologies to social workers in Tanzania. “These phones were used for collecting data from the field and aggregating it,” Hall explained. The social workers would keep track of the country’s demographics, including the number of impoverished children in their area, and send the data to a major city in Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, where it would be inserted into a government database. The internship will once again be available in the summer of 2010, working to improve the technology available and to collaborate with other organizations and schools. Hall was also part of a team that developed the Electronic Braille Tutor, a device that would assist the blind population in learning written braille. Using an electronic stylus pen and a series of cells, the student could choose a variety of learning activities, from letter recognition to full-fledged free spelling of words. 
The audio feature of the Braille Tutor is especially useful. In Tanzania, many teachers of blind students are blind themselves, and if the audio is there to correct any mistakes, it saves the teacher from having to rewrite the students’ work themselves. Another important piece of technology on display was the Literacy Cell Phone game. Directed toward primary school students in Tanzania, it was a game that tested grammar that could be downloaded onto a cell phone. 
Its subjects, however, extended far beyond proper sentence syntax. One test run yielded questions about soccer and the Swahili language, and a correct answer resulted in a graphic of a soccer player scoring a goal appearing on the screen. Along with such displays of innovative technology, there was even an online interactive quiz on the countries involved in TechBridgeWorld and computer facts in general. M. Bernardine Dias, the creator and director of TechBridgeWorld, said she based her mission for this project on her childhood in Sri Lanka. 
“I was fascinated by the technology, but I realized that the technology coming in wasn’t able to fit into our culture.” This became the goal for TechBridgeWorld as a whole: technology that could be adapted to a specific culture. “The goal of a project changes depending on what the community needs,” said Beatrice Dias, a Ph.D. student in engineering and public policy, who is also a part of TechBridgeWorld.

You may not know it, but it’s on many of the songs that you hear. It is pretty hard for untrained ears to notice it, but it is very much there. For some artists, it is their claim to fame, while others pretend that they have never used it. Some listeners think that it is the best thing to happen to popular music, while some think it is the worst. Independent of public opinion, few technologies in the last 10 years have changed the music we listen to as much as it has. The technical term for it is pitch correction, but everyone knows it as Auto-Tune.
Auto-Tune is actually a piece of proprietary software made by Antares Software that was first released in 1997, and it has an interesting history. The founder of Antares (Andy Hildebrand) actually worked with Exxon to analyze seismic data for oil prospecting. This involved sending sound waves into the ground and listening for the reflections to determine the location of oil deposits and other regions of interest. Of course, the Earth’s crust is a messy and chaotic place, and making sense of the data required extensive analysis to extract useful information. Hildebrand found that many of the methods to do this could be applied to audio production as well. 
What pitch correction software, like Auto-Tune, does is analyze and modify audio signals in a very specific way. According to Riccardo Schulz, associate teaching professor at the school of music here at Carnegie Mellon, pitch correction software is used to “fix up” vocal and other instrumental performances. You input the key and the scale that a song is in to provide a reference frame for the software. When the software receives an audio signal (someone’s voice, for example), it compares the pitch of the signal with the correct pitches for the given key and scale. If the pitch is off, it modifies the signal to move it to the correct pitch (hence pitch correction). It is not perfect, however. If the signal is so far off the mark that the nearest note on the scale is not the note you want, it will still shift to that wrong note, resulting in some awkward sounds. It also works better when the pitch is off by just a little bit, as large shifts tend to introduce noise and weird, artificial-sounding distortion.
It is important to note the difference between pitch shifting and pitch correction. The former involves shifting the frequency of the sound in one direction or the other to change its pitch. It is often done manually and has been around much longer than effective pitch correction software has. It is a highly general term that has many different implementations. Pitch correction is just one such implementation in which the pitch shifting is performed automatically (by the computer) and the shifting is used to reach the target pitch that the recording engineer wants. Schulz notes wryly that pitch correction is used for “recording and live performance, especially for singers who don’t sing in tune.” In recording studios, pitch correction is used to polish tracks and to gloss over any mistakes that the singer may have made. It provides a degree of consistency, which allows recording engineers to work more effectively. And yes, it is used to allow mediocre vocalists to sound “better” than they would. In live shows, it is used extensively to ensure that a sore throat or the stress of an overlong tour doesn’t reduce the quality of the performance. Many artists describe it as a sort of “safety net.”
Schulz also points out that for many genres, such as hip-hip, pop, and rock, “the recording is part of the art.” Many producers and recording engineers take this to heart and use pitch correction as an instrument in itself. The most well-known of such producers is the artist T-Pain. Pitch correction and its more general use for pitch shifting can create new and innovative sonic textures. It can also be used to allow samples that are in different keys or even samples that aren’t musical enough to be used freely.
Many would claim that the use of pitch correction marginalizes the talent of singers by allowing anyone and everyone to belt out a pitch-perfect song. Indeed, we are all so used to hearing perfect voices on songs that we now expect nothing less, and that very expectation ensures that even talented vocalists are compelled to use pitch correction. The truth is that pitch correction cannot salvage truly horrible singers. It assists, rather than overshadows, most singers and allows them to make the songs that we, the listeners, demand.

Retinoblastoma is a type of cancer that develops in the retina — the lining of the eye that senses light as it comes through the front of the eye. Though it is a rare form of cancer, it is the most common form of ocular cancer (cancer affecting the eye) in children, and according to the National Cancer Institute, about 300 children per year in the United States are diagnosed with this form. About 40 percent of retinoblastoma cases are inherited, and this form of cancer was actually the first to be associated with a genetic abnormality.
It is also possible, however, for retinoblastoma to occur sporadically, or without a family history. If a genetic mutation is found, the chance of having a second child with retinoblastoma is 40 to 50 percent, while if no genetic mutation is present, the chance drops to 2 to 5 percent. Retinoblastoma is rarely found in adults.
Retinoblasts are rapidly growing cells that mature to form the retina. However, sometimes these cells do not stop growing when they should, and instead keep reproducing; these excess cells then form a tumor in the retina. These tumors can continue to grow — some tumors almost completely fill the vitreous humor, the jelly-like substance that fills the eyeball, and others may break off and spread to other parts of the eye, eventually traveling outside the eye to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body.
Retinoblastoma has been linked to mutations in a gene called RB1. RB1 is a tumor suppressor gene that normally prevents cells from undergoing uncontrolled division.Mutations in RB1 give rise to the production of a faulty protein  that is unable to regulate the division of cells. The cells thus rapidly multipy, forming tumors.  
Retinoblastoma can occur in either one or both eyes. A common symptom is leukocoria, or white pupil. This occurs because of the tumor that is present in the retina — the pupil is not actually white, but when a light is shown into the eye, it appears to be white. Another common symptom is that the eyes will appear to be looking in different directions, along with eye redness, eye swelling, and a constant dilation of the pupil.
There are a variety of tests and treatments available for retinoblastoma; the treatments used differ depending on the location and size of the tumor. Chemotherapy is often used to shrink the size of the tumor on the retina so that another type of treatment can be used to completely remove the tumor. In addition, chemotherapy can be used when the tumor has spread from the retina to other parts of the body.
There are two types of radiation therapy that are used to treat retinoblastoma as well — internal radiation, or brachytherapy, and external beam radiation. In any type of radiation therapy, high energy beams, such as X-rays, are used to kill the cancerous cells. In internal radiation, a small disk made of radioactive material is stitched into the eye near the site of the tumor and left for a few days while the radiation is released from the disk. This allows a higher concentration of radiation to be used and reduces the chance that the radioactive beams will damage healthy cells. In external beam radiation, a machine outside the body delivers the high-powered light beams; however, this type of treatment can have side effects if the radiation reaches the brain, and thus this treatment is reserved for patients with advanced forms of retinoblastoma.
Additional treatments include laser therapy, or laser photocoagulation, where a laser is used to destroy the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor — without a fuel source, the cancerous cells die. Cryotherapy, or cold therapy, uses extreme cold to repeatedly freeze and thaw the cancerous cells, which causes them to die. Finally, in hyperthermia, or heat therapy, extreme heat is directed at the cancerous cells through the use of ultrasound, microwaves, or lasers. If the cancer has not spread beyond the eye, survival rates are very high. If it has spread, survival rates depend on how far the tumor has spread.
However, in very severe cases, the affected eye must be removed. When this occurs, a ball made of plastics and other biocompatible materials is placed in the empty eye socket, and the muscles that control the movement of the eye are attached to this implant. Although the implant cannot see, the eye muscles adapt to the implant and control its movement just as they controlled the movement of the natural eye. A few months after the surgery, an artificial eye can be placed over the implant, custom-made to match the healthy eye. The artificial eye sits behind the eyelid and attaches to the implant, so that as the eye muscles move the implant, it appears as though they are moving the artificial eye.

Space programs develop new spacecraft
Anatoly Perminov, head of Russia’s space agency, stated Wednesday that a nuclear-powered spaceship was necessary for the success of the country’s space program. Perminov wants to replace the aging Soyuz system used by astronauts for several decades and currently used to reach the International Space Station. Russian president Dmitry Medvedev encouraged his Cabinet to provide the required $600 million. 
According to Perminov, the new design could be completed within three years, with nearly another decade needed for construction and testing. After being delayed a day primarily due to poor weather conditions, NASA successfully launched the Ares I-X rocket Wednesday morning.
The rocket, which forms part of the proposed Constellation system designed for long-range exploration, lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla. and flew for approximately six minutes before parachuting into the ocean.

Researchers work to slow down death
Scientists studying the processes of cell decay and death are working on a breakthrough that can drastically slow metabolism. 
Much of the research is being conducted by Mark Roth of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. He believes that by replacing oxygen in cells with hydrogen sulfide, cells will not decay. He has successfully conducted experiments on fish and small mammals. 
These creatures are exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas, which causes their heart rate and other biological indicators to drop almost to zero, a state which appears like death. When the gas is removed and replaced by normal oxygen, the subjects return to normal. Roth believes his research, if it can be applied to humans, will give doctors more time to conduct surgery on critically wounded patients. He received a MacArthur Genius grant for his work, and is currently expanding his research to larger animals and humans.

Google develops free GPS software
Last Wednesday, Google released Google Maps Navigation, a GPS application for phones running its Android 2.0 operating system. With similar functionality to existing GPS devices such as those by Garmin and TomTom, a primary difference is that there is no charge for Google’s software. 
The application integrates with Google Maps, and therefore features such as Google Street View are available to help users find their destinations. Traditional GPS manufacturers saw their stocks fall dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the announcement. Due to the connectivity of Android devices and Google’s extensive database, the GPS market will have to reconsider its business model. At the moment Google Maps Navigation is available only on the Verizon Droid, but upcoming Android 2.0 phones will also have access to this most recent “killer app.”

While it may seem that Pittsburgh doesn’t have very much to offer when it comes to dining and entertainment, it is actually quite the opposite. Areas that are looked upon as the cultural hubs of the city were not very accessible to the student population until a semester ago, but these places — namely, Station Square and SouthSide Works — have now been opened up to Carnegie Mellon students through a great service called the Carson Loop bus.
For those who are still unaware, the Loop bus is a service that was started by Student Government last semester to encourage students to discover other Pittsburgh neighborhoods. The bus leaves from the UC turnaround on Friday and Saturday evenings and makes stops at Station Square, different streets in the South Side, and then, true to its name, loops back to Carnegie Mellon. The departures are frequent and convenient enough for students to enjoy a great night out at any of these locations.
Station Square is one of the most culturally alive areas in Pittsburgh and demands a visit. Peppered with great restaurants, steeped with unique history, and known for great nightlife, this part of the city provides visitors with a true Pittsburgh experience. Read on to find out what the places have to offer and what you might be interested in visiting while you’re there.
A Romantic Evening 
Station Square provides the perfect setting for an intimate but fun date with your love interest. From taking a scenic ride down the three rivers of Pittsburgh to catching a glimpse of the city’s breathtaking skyline at night, Station Square offers a number of diverse options for the perfect date.
The Inclines 
People always say great things about the New York skyline, but Pittsburgh’s skyline is something else altogether. Although missing national landmarks like the Empire State Building, the city offers a different view because of its location on the confluence of three rivers. The bright lights of buildings and bridges make this view more than memorable — and catching a glimpse of it is made easy because of the Duquesne and Monongahela Inclines situated at Station Square.
These inclines are a cable-powered means of transportation that were historically used to travel between the river valleys and the hilltops. Today, they survive as a service for Mount Washington residents and for visitors to who wish to view the Pittsburgh panorama. As the inclines are a part of the Port Authority transportation system, their use is free for all Carnegie Mellon students upon showing a college ID. So go ahead and take a free ride up Mount Washington to catch a glimpse of the ’Burgh by night.
Clippership Cruises 
Many Carnegie Mellon students went on a Clippership cruise during Orientation week — or at least those who opted not to go for Casino Night did, but experiencing it the first time with a bunch of people you just met and going again with a close set of friends or your love interest is entirely different.
The cruise offers a chance for passengers to view Pittsburgh by night — and there’s no better way to witness it than while sailing on the rivers. Passengers have the option of taking a dinner cruise and eating a delicious meal while making their way around the city, or taking a sight-seeing cruise during the day and noting all the famous landmarks and monuments.
Horse and carriage rides 
With winter coming our way, there’s nothing more romantic than snuggling up in a horse-drawn carriage and experiencing the first snowfall while taking a ride around Station Square. Get the feeling of being a part of old-world America through this experience. For more information about times of the carriage rides and prices, call 412.913.0664.
Grab a Bite 
Enjoy a great Friday night out on the town with a group of friends by having a nice dinner at one of the great restaurants Station Square has to offer. With options ranging from the classic Italian meal to delicious fondue, the following are some places that are worth stopping by.
Buca di Beppo 
If you’re going with a big group of people, this Italian restaurant is a great place to dine. The service is friendly, and the menu has many classic favorites, such as the bruschetta, that are delicious options to start with. The cheese manicotti is a great entree, and combines a creamy Alfredo sauce with a chunky marinara perfectly. The baked ravioli is also a good option for cheese lovers, as it combines melted mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Keep in mind that the serving sizes are pretty large, so feel free to share!
The Melting Pot 
Just as the restaurant’s tagline says, The Melting Pot is a great place to “dip into something different.” This delicious fondue restaurant is a great place to go, especially if you’re craving cheese or chocolate. The Melting Pot serves up different varieties of delicious cheese fondue and great options to dip into your cheese. Try the Wisconsin Trio, a blend of different cheeses, white wine, sherry, and scallions, or go for something simple with Cheddar Cheese, a mix of sharp cheeses, lager beer, garlic, and seasonings. Bowls of bread pieces, fresh vegetables, and apple quarters provide the perfect complements to the cheese fondue.
Communal cooking is a big part of this restaurant, so you can try an entree in which you’re given all the ingredients and you can cook it yourself! Plates of meat and vegetables are provided with a boiling pot of broth, so customers choose what they’d like to try, season it, and enjoy their meal the way they prefer.
But, of course, if chocolate is what you’re craving then just stop by this restaurant for some dessert. Customers can pick between dark, white, or milk chocolate fondue and can also opt for swirl-ins like caramel and Oreo pieces. The chocolate fondue comes with a plate of fresh strawberries, cheesecake, bananas, pound cake, brownies, Oreo cookies, and marshmallows. Needless to say, this selection is all you need to get an instant sugar high.
Hard Rock Cafe 
Everyone’s favorite international chain has a branch at Station Square. Stop by Hard Rock Cafe to enjoy some great food, the great atmosphere, and to have an all-around relaxing evening out. The café hosts some interesting musical events and concerts that are worth a visit, so listen to some local Pittsburgh bands or watch your favorite singers play when they come into town.
Station Square has a lot more to offer in terms of dining and nightlife, and all that’s necessary to discover more is a little exploring and, of course, getting on the Loop. The restaurants are more on the expensive side of the student budget, but you can make a trip to Station Square a special night out with your close friends.

The new café opening at the Gates and Hillman Centers is more than just coffee — it is going to be a fantastic experience in itself. Just when it seemed the buzz about the new building was dying down, Highland Park’s Tazza D’Oro café announced its opening in the space in less than two weeks. The location in the R-Bar Café on the third floor of the Gates Center is definitely a place that one can constantly revisit and never get tired of enjoying. The bright colors, comfortable chairs, and open spaces are all extremely inviting. The owner, Amy Enrico, commented on the café’s mantra in the Jan. 1 issue of the Pittsburgh City Paper. “The thing we’re good at isn’t tangible — it is to create a culture and experience around coffee,” she said. And the café definitely has an unpretentious charm that would be almost impossible to duplicate.
Looking back at what Enrico said, it is quite clear what she meant. She wanted to create a destination, a spot in the community — and there are no better words to describe Tazza D’Oro. Based on a few visits to the Highland Park coffee shop, it was evident that there were some familiar faces, and some new — all extremely content with being there. 
From people conducting personal tutoring lessons to having their first date there, this cafe has had several visitors, each of them coming back for more. Over the years, the meaning of “going for coffee” has been revolutionized, and it has become all about the company you go with, the location, the atmosphere, the reason why you are there, and, most definitely, the coffee. And Tazza D’Oro has it all. When you visit the Highland Park branch, it is very hard to find a vacant seat, and so it is easy to presume that those comfy chairs in the Gates Center location will definitely be worth fighting for!
The café offers a wide selection of coffee and espresso, delicious paninis (the artichoke and tuna or the eggplant are extremely tempting), scrumptious biscotti (try the vanilla, it is delicious), and cookies (the peanut butter and the chocolate chip one can easily become favorites), along with several other pastries and Sunday brunch items. It is easy to sit for hours with the Sunday brunch menu — each item available looks mouth-watering. 
Try the tasty Pizza Romana from the daily menu. It consists of artichoke hearts, prosciutto, kalamata olives, sauteed portobello mushrooms, and delicious melted fresh mozzarella cheese. Since Enrico insists on using locally produced ingredients, the food is extremely fresh. 
There are a variety of coffees available, from the traditional Italian cappuccino to flavored lattes to an Americano. The café also serves cups of the Highland Park blend — a dark, smooth, yet sweet coffee, made from coffee beans from such parts of the world as Africa, South America, and the Middle East. 
Also available are a wide selection of over 50 choices of herbal teas and regular teas. Making a choice can get confusing, so feel free to experiment. The Lychee Black tea is extremely unusual and has a sweet Asian grape fruit-like flavor, proving the uniqueness of the different flavors at this cafe. You should also definitely try the Harney & Sons Chocolate mint black tea.
Tazza D’Oro at the Gates and Hillman Centers is going to become an ideal location to get homework done, catch up with a friend, or simply get away from hectic Carnegie Mellon life. Go ahead and try one of the to-die-for Italian cappuccinos — they’ll transport you straight to Italy — along with a delicious cookie. After one taste, you will definitely be back, fighting for a chair or an open window seat.

My summer in England was perfect. It was a balance between high life in London during the weekdays and cozy, sunny weekends with family in Reading; what more could anyone ask for? 
While I was studying at the London School of Economics, I lived in a residence hall on High Holborn Street. This means that all the restaurants and theaters at Covent Garden, or “London’s Theatreland,” were right around the corner. Also, Oxford Circus, the primary shopping area in London, was only two “tube” — the colloquial name for London’s subway system — stations away. 
The first major difference between American and British universities that struck me was the visibility of alcohol. Even though many college students in U.S. consume alcohol, it is mostly under the radar. This might have to do with the legal drinking age being 21, unlike in England, where it is 18. Even then, not only did the LSE campus boast no fewer than three bars, so did my residence hall. Every so often, I would find myself reading an official e-mail reminding me of the attractive offers on beer for the night. 
Another difference was the dining. The cafeteria in my residence hall would only serve breakfast, and the famous English breakfast is a lovely way to start a day. I enjoyed having breakfast in the cafeteria, not only because of the delicious beans on toast, bacon or the fresh fruit, but also because of the company. Every morning I would meet people from some different corner of the world, with different stories to tell. 
Pick a cuisine and you’ll find at least one restaurant serving it either on Kingsway or at Covent Garden. Covent Garden, contrary to what the name suggests, is not a garden. It is an area in London with lots of entertainment. However, among the tall buildings and busy roads, the city pleasantly surprises people with parks — small and big. On those rare sunny days, my friends and I would get a lunch “take-away” from a restaurant and enjoy it over great conversation while sitting in a park. On the not-so-sunny days, we would grab a bite at one of the on-campus pubs and stay warm. 
Living in “London’s Theatreland,” I absolutely had to go for a musical. My friends and I went to watch The Lord of the Rings. The stage was exquisite and elaborate and some pieces of decoration extended beyond the actual stage. It could even move to rise and fall to various different levels. The performers danced and sang almost oblivious to all this movement. Their performances were breathtaking, especially Gollum. He crawled over the curtain with the ease, flexibility, and grace of a spider. The fact that I can clearly remember it after more than a year says it all. 
Even though I was having fun, sometimes the fast-paced city life got overwhelming. So, I would go to Reading — where my family was for the summer — to relax. Reading is a large town about 40 miles west of London. 
My family and I rented a boat on a Sunday and had a picnic on the river Thames, which flows through Reading. It was exciting and challenging to maneuver the boat at the lock — a device used to facilitate water transport between water on different levels. The picturesque countryside, the cool breeze, and the delicious snacks just made the experience even more worthwhile. While in Reading, we also went strawberry picking. At the farm, we were each given small baskets to collect our picked fruits and vegetables in. We picked a lot of strawberries and tasted even more, and also picked carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and other berries. The farm where we were, was also conducting a scarecrow decorating competition. The scarecrows were impressive, with delicate details. After all this hard work, we decided to enjoy some traditional afternoon English tea with scones and cream. Needless to say, it was very delectable. 
There was nothing unfamiliar about England. I am fluent in the language that is spoken there and the food and transportation was very predictable, so I wasn’t pushing myself out of my comfort zone. But it was as rewarding an experience as any other, and a very memorable summer.

As the saying, “time is gold,” goes, people want to use time as efficiently as possible, and being students at Carnegie Mellon, we are no exception. Among the many advantages that the Internet gives us, one of the most important ones is online shopping — one of the best ways to save time. The Internet is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; and you don’t have to worry about finding a parking spot. Tiffany Barth, a senior chemical engineering major, commented on the facility. “Time is the main reason I shop online; I have no time to actually go out shopping,” she said. Here are some websites where you can get some fashionable pieces.
Bluefly.com
Based in New York City, Bluefly offers a wide variety of items, ranging from clothes to jewelry. This site often features designers such as Marc Jacobs and Diane von Fürstenberg at discount prices. Due to the site’s wide selection of items, it might be easier if you have a specific item in mind before you shop.
Shopbop.com

Modcloth.com 
Modcloth is based in Pittsburgh and was established in 2001 by Susan and Eric Kroger, recent Carnegie Mellon graduates.

Many of the pieces are available for under $100. The store also offers hip accessories.
While online shopping is a big time saver, there are some shared concerns about it. Because you cannot try on the clothes, you can never actually know how they are going look on you. Esra Aras and Yasemin Silahtaroglu, first-year architecture majors, commented that they never know what size to order. So here are few tips about shopping online.
Check the shipping and return policy 
Always check the return policy before you purchase an item. Since you cannot try it on until it actually arrives, it is safer to have a flexible return policy. This way, you can return or exchange the item if you don’t like it.
Read the buyers’ reviews 
Reading other buyers’ comments can give you a good sense about the quality of the product. It can tell you a lot about sizes, too: if the product runs true to its size or a bigger one. However, be careful if there are only a few reviews, because it can give you a biased view toward the product.
Save the shipping fee 
Often, online stores will offer free shipping if you spend a certain amount of money on their products. If you are only planning to buy one product, however, and the shipping fee is expensive, consider asking other friends who are interested in buying products from the same website to purchase things together.

Over homecoming weekend, Carnegie Mellon’s independent student theater organization, Scotch’n’Soda, debuted their performance of The Mystery of Edwin Drood.
Last Friday evening, McConomy Auditorium filled with students and alumni alike, all ready and eager to witness Scotch’n’Soda’s opening night. From the moment one walked into the theater, it felt like a trip into Victorian England. The ticket sellers, the ushers, and everyone involved in the event were in character — maintaining thick English accents and being exceptionally informal with the crowd. As the seats began to fill up, the cast members themselves wandered into the audience, keeping character in conversations and describing to their various sections the voting processes saved for the end of the show.
In The Mystery of Edwin Drood, each performer had two roles: their primary role as a member of the Music Hall Royale traveling theater group, and their secondary role as a cast member within the production being performed by the Music Hall Royale. In this particular show, the misfits of the Music Hall Royale put on a hilariously flamboyant rendition of Charles Dickens’ final, unfinished mystery novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood.
Dickens’ book is set to take place in the fictional city of Cloisterham and is narrated and named after an Edwin Drood (played by senior history major Laura Thorén), who tells the story of his uncle and choirmaster John Jasper (junior English and philosophy major Nick Ryan). Jasper has fallen madly in love with his musical pupil and his nephew’s fiance, Rosa Bud (first-year drama major Olivia O’Connor). Rosa also catches the eye of Drood’s arch nemesis, Neville Landless (first-year architecture major Bradley Sherburne), who has just moved from Ceylon with his twin sister Helena (sophomore BHA student Liz Martindale). The story makes for a hilarious love triangle. Suddenly, on Christmas Eve, Drood goes missing and audiences are left to uncover the murdering culprit behind his disappearance.
“It was funny,” said Ruthie Tane, a first-year in the science and humanities scholars program. “The audience participation was the best part of the show. By the end, we had all worked together to vote the dumbest cast member the detective and the holy reverend the murderer. It’s like everyone was on the same twisted page.”
The amount of dependency placed on the audience truly was one of the most unique aspects about this show. The performers encouraged audience members to boo and cheer for other troupe members, and with the intense level of audience participation and the relaxed, friendly atmosphere, it was as if every member of the audience were playing their own role.
Had one not known, it would have been safe to assume that this production was the work of top-notch drama majors straight out of Purnell. The music and songs were beautiful and seemingly effortless for the performers. Each actor did a spectacular job in transforming themselves to fit their role. Perhaps most deserving of a special mention was Ryan, along with Alex DiClaudio, a graduate student in creative enterprise management, who played the Chairman.
Audiences responded particularly well to the comical ways of Caitlin Cox: “The actress who played The Princess Puffer did a spectacular job,” said Alina Narvaez, a first-year BHA student. “She was hilarious and her voice was so unique. I also thought the actress who played Helena Landless [Martindale] did a beautiful job with her songs.”
Although the show did seem a bit lengthy, it was impossible to keep from laughing the whole way through. Overall, Scotch’n’Soda began their year with a truly enjoyable performance.

Mercè Rodoreda is not alive. She died of cancer in 1983 and was buried in the cemetery of Romanyà. However, had she been among the characters of her final novel, Death in Spring (La Mort i la Primavera), she would have been placed in the middle of the villa plaza, on her deathbed, where she would have had cement poured into her mouth till her stomach was full. She then would have been interred, not into a hole in the ground, but sealed into the carved-out trunk of a still-living tree. This was not her fate. But then without this ritual, we can believe — as her fictional villagers would have — that her soul escaped.
Death in Spring can be read as a novel exploring escape — not how to escape, but who and what to escape from. Narrated from the point of view of a 14-year-old boy who begins the novel witnessing his father’s attempted suicide, we are met with a confusing array of violent events and descriptions of the beauty and uniqueness of the village. While specific events are glossed past in just sentences, we are given recurring descriptions of the neighing of the horses, the imminent danger and control of the river that runs past and underneath the village, and most frequently the odors that permeate the houses, the woods, and the trees in which the dead are encased.
Each of these things — the horses, the smells, the river — is meant to be understood symbolically, each holding a specific role in the world that exists for these villagers. As an example, the village prisoner, once a thief, serves for all the crimes of the villagers. Constant torture and spectacle lead to his dehumanization — the end goal of his punishment. On the day he is declared a creature no longer human, he is freed from his cage and released to live in the woods. He doesn’t disappear into the darkness or the past; rather, he remains, befriending our boy-narrator and watching over the village people, judging them for their own crimes.
Rodoreda is not telling a story of a boy who, after the death of his father, takes his step-mother as his wife and with her creates a daughter who falls in love with the oppressive blacksmith’s malnourished son, as uniquely imagined as that is; she is capturing a state of mind. Her own life and experiences through the Spanish Civil War have informed all of her writing, and Death in Spring is no exception. But this is not a literal account of the war; it is an emotional and psychological understanding of war and life under totalitarianism, reflecting back after 40 years.
We are not given the answers to fixing an unhappy marriage, the death of a parent, or distance from a child, nor are we handed solutions for escaping tradition or even escaping the pains of adolescence. We are not given a story where the best of the villagers unite to overthrow a vicious dictator. This novel is just one boy’s account of living life; it is an example that tells us a story: a beautiful and evocative and viscerally bloody story about life and death.
Death in Spring is Mercè Rodoreda’s last novel, published posthumously. It was translated into English by Martha Tennant and was published by Open Letter Books, Rochester, N.Y., in 2009.

In the Comics section of this issue, a piece titled “Wherein they Differ” describes an interaction between a man and woman. The woman states, “When a man starts to talk he never stops to think,” and the man responds, “And when a woman starts she never thinks to stop.” Maybe this was actually the Facts of Life section.

“Alcohol is healthy” is a blurb for a Forum article that cites a study in which brain-damaged lab rats that were fed a caffeine and alcohol combination showed improvement in their ability to function. It’s a shame that we aren’t more like lab rats — not that it will stop me from immediately attempting to duplicate this study myself.

Dear Prerna,
I live in a lovely off-campus apartment that I used to call home, until the “attack of my roommates.” My apartment has now taken a new shape — it has become gross, with clothes everywhere and unwashed dishes — basically, a living disaster. I keep telling my roommates to clean, but they don’t seem to listen anymore. I have to clean everyday, and it really can get tiresome. How do I get them just to clean their own dishes or just to pick up after themselves?
—Obsessive Compulsive Distressed Roommate
Hey OCDR,
I know exactly how you feel: You always want things to be perfectly clean and organized—why can’t everyone around you just feel the same way? Well, believe me, there are people out there who can eat off a dirty plate. 
Maybe you can set some boundaries — request them to do whatever they wish to their room, but not the common area. Just don’t expect the moon from them on day one. Let them take it step by step, maybe picking up their clothes first, then doing the dishes, then cleaning up every other time. If it still doesn’t work, ask a neutral friend to speak to them and explain the situation. Hope it works out; after all, cleanliness is next to godliness.
Keep it clean,
—Prerna
Dear Prerna,
Let me get this out there: I am not a bad matchmaker. Anyway, I have this friend and she’s a decent catch, so to speak, but she just refuses to fall for the boy I chose for her. What can I do to make her willing to see this boy, or at least stop thinking about her silly ex and test the waters? I think you, giving advice like me, might understand where I am coming from.
—Hitch II
Dear Hitch II,
Did you know that the original Hitch (from the movie Hitch) also faced many problems while setting people up? First, find out why this friend isn’t willing to forget about her ex — usually most people try to distract themselves with new eye candy. Does she still have strong feelings for her ex?
Also, most importantly, is this new boy worth the effort and is he her kind? It must be hard enough for her that her heart is broken — you don’t want to put her in a situation where it might break again. If the new boy is worth it, and the ex and your friend are definitely not going to work out, maybe invite them both for lunch and then, suddenly, remember that math homework that is due in an hour! But, remember: You are the friend first, matchmaker second. 
Best of luck,
—Prerna

A lot of people say that fall is a nostalgic season, and I wholeheartedly agree. In my hometown of Harvard, Mass., fall is an important time because it is the season for apples, the ubiquitous fruit around town. Phil’s, Carlon’s, Doe, Westward, and Mountain View Orchards all offer their own ciders, pies, doughnuts, and various other apple-inspired products, along with the standard “U-Pick” options. We used to have the Three Apples Storytelling Festival in the center of town. We’d gather in the basement of our church, peeling and cutting apples for apple pies that the church would sell to raise funds. Because of this, October has always been a nostalgic month for me.
I recently read an article on Slate.com about Creed. The ’90s band is apparently back together, recording and touring. This brought back my memories of the music of the late ’90s and the early 2000s, back when I was moving through elementary and middle school. There was Smash Mouth, with “All-Star;”  Creed, with the grunge-like guitars and vocals, singing with a vaguely Christian message; and, of course, there were the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, et al., of which every girl in my grade had a favorite member that they would one day marry. But my favorite back then was the Goo Goo Dolls. In fact, my first kiss was with a girl named Loren in seventh grade, and happened to the strains of “Iris.” All the seventh and eighth graders were in our school cafeteria, dressed up for our “Snowflake” semi-formal. As everyone paired up — many awkwardly — for the slow dance, I didn’t realize how prescient the words “sooner or later it’s over” would be.
The Three Apples Storytelling Festival moved out of town a few years ago. The apples are still there, though I’m 10 hours away throughout peak season. There have been more dances, more girls to dance with, and at least a few more kisses since then. But I’m past that stage. I have a girlfriend now, and we’re going on three years together. Yet, I still think back to the cafeteria, back to seventh grade, Loren, and John Rzeznik’s voice saying “everything’s meant to be broken.” It was the closest to heaven that I’d ever been. And maybe it still is.

The A-level of Baker Hall, including the Giant Eagle Auditorium, flooded Sunday morning.
An incident over the weekend caused flooding in most of the rooms, including a number of offices and classroom areas. Workers were drying the facility with electric blowers even as graduate students were carrying out work in their offices.
The Carnegie Mellon registrar’s office has scheduled alternative locations in the University Center for classes that would normally take place on Monday in the auditorium. There is no word for individuals or organizations with activities scheduled for Sunday on the floor.

In the past few weeks, Carnegie Mellon University has held clinics for students, faculty, and staff to receive the seasonal flu shot and the vaccine for H1N1, otherwise known as swine flu. It first appeared in the United States in April 2009 and has since spread to 46 states. The contagious virus, which has proven especially to strike those between the ages of six months and 24 years, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11 of this year.
As more than 1000 American citizens, including 100 children, have died, President Obama declared H1N1 a national emergency on Oct. 24 of this year. In effect, this declaration gives hospitals the power to effectively treat those in need with such options as alternative care sites.
“I think that this is an appropriate measure because it provides health care systems with the flexibility and resources they will need to respond to a high demand for care,” said Anita Barkin, the director of Student Health Services. 
Typically, there are 36,000 flu-related deaths a year and 200,000 patients hospitalized from non-H1N1 flu-related effects.
By the end of March or April, the United States is hoping to have distributed 250 million doses of the vaccine. According to www.flu.gov, as of Oct. 21, approximately 11 million doses, including over 400,000 to Pennsylvania, have been issued to states. The vaccine comes in two forms — one a nasal spray and one an injection. “The nasal spray is live attenuated [weakened] virus. The injection is inactivated virus. The nasal spray is not recommended for persons who have underlying medical conditions like asthma or diabetes,” said Barkin, explaining the difference between the two. The nasal spray, which the University has distributed, is approved for those from ages 2 to 49, and adults require one dose while children require two.
To ease concerns over the new vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) explained in the pamphlet handed to students who received the vaccine that it was made in the same manner as the one for the seasonal flu. Side effects so far appear to be site redness and those typical of the seasonal flu, such as headache, congestion, cough, and mild fever. Those with weakened immune systems should not receive the nasal spray. On campus, “seasonal flu vaccines have been made available through clinics that have been occurring since mid-September. Our first H1N1 vaccine clinics were held on Oct. 13 and 15 in the University Center,” said John Hannon, the director of student development. The university was trying to increase student awareness of the vaccine and increase turnout.
“I’m not really sure what will make people take it more seriously, but hopefully spreading the word will do the trick. That’s why they’re having clinics in residence halls this week,” mentioned Ariel Rosenberg, a resident assistant in Stever House and a junior science and arts major.
At the flu clinics on Oct. 26 and 27 in Morewood Gardens and the Carnegie Mellon Café, the university’s supply of approximately 2000 doses of nasal spray was depleted. More than 1300 students were vaccinated since the nasal spray was offered, along with faculty and staff. Although the supplies are currently exhausted, the university is still prepared to help those who may become ill and will notify students as soon as more supplies of the vaccine arrive.

To students, Homecoming Weekend means getting a free T-shirt or Tartan towel, socializing, getting a hot cup of chili, and watching the football game. To alumni, Homecoming Weekend signifies Alumni Weekend, reconnecting with old classmates over dinner, and seeing how much the school has progressed. But this year, Homecoming is much, much more.
Homecoming was given a complete makeover this year with the revamping of old events and the addition of new ones. Dana Weinstein, a junior business administration major and the leader of the Student Homecoming Committee, said, “The main purpose of all of these events is to get Carnegie Mellon students more excited about being here and give them a quick break. It also allows them to have a chance to interact with alumni in a non-networking environment, which is something that they might not get as often as they like.”
Some of the past events that were re-worked this year were the Student Homecoming Kick-Off BBQ on Wednesday and LMAO, An Evening of Comedy and Music, on Thursday. “The events this year were actually an initiative started by the committee last year. We began these events last year because we felt that Homecoming wasn’t really for students, and we wanted to make more events that were student-centric and would make students feel as though they were welcomed at Homecoming events, even though we do invite alumni to all of the student-oriented events,” said Weinstein.
Spirit Week and the Highland Games were two of the new additions to the Homecoming schedule. “We added a few events this year, such as Spirit Week and the Highland Games, to replace the ‘B There’ campaign that occurred last year during the Friday night of Homecoming, so that we could still have a larger Friday night event,” said Weinstein.
Spirit Week gave students the opportunity to show off their Carnegie Mellon spirit, pride, and creativity by dressing to the respective day’s theme. The themes were: Rep your Hometown, Nerd Day, College Spirit Day, Class Colors Day, and Tartan Pride. Students could receive a raffle ticket each day they participated for the chance to win an Acer Aspire One netbook and to accumulate points for the Highland Games.
On Thursday, students celebrated Diwali and Eid ul-Fitr in Wiegand Gym. The celebration of Diwali, also known as the “Festival of Lights,” is a major Indian festival signifying the victory of good over evil. Eid ul-Fitr is a joyous occasion celebrating the achievement of enhanced piety. The event included crafts, performances, and a buffet of traditional Indian cuisine.
The week concluded with the Highland Games, a class competition involving fair-style games. First-years, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and alumni had the opportunity to compete while enjoying performances, food, and other Scottish traditions.
With all the new additions, some old traditions still stand. The Alumni Awards Ceremony and the Tartans football game were two staples of the traditional Homecoming week.
Since 1950, the Alumni Awards have recognized alumni, faculty, and students for their service to the university and for their achievements in the arts, humanities, sciences, technology, and business. More than 750 individuals have been awarded through the program. The Alumni Association awarded its honorees at the Alumni Awards Ceremony Friday at 5:30 p.m. All alumni, students, faculty, staff, and friends were invited.
The Alumni Association is also extending the invitation to submit nominations for the 2010 Alumni Awards. The Service Award Nomination deadline is Monday, Nov. 30. Anyone may nominate as many candidates as one likes, but they should be people who have exemplified outstanding service to the university. For more information, contact Adrian Massey.
Following the Chili Cook-Off, hosted by the Carnegie Clan, the Tartan football team played the Washington University Bears on Saturday at 1 p.m. at Gesling Stadium. During the game, the Carnegie Clan also operated a canned food drive.

A lot of industries have been hit hard by the circumstances of this economic slump, and many of the effects of this crumbling economy have been witnessed here in Pittsburgh.
Most recently, according to writer Barbara Ehrenreich of the San Francisco Chronicle, advances in electronic books and other easier methods of technological information sharing have been leading to the death of the book industry. 
Book sales tracked on www.bookwire.com show that the book industry has always been successful, at most times outgrossing both the film and music industries and always landing among the top three moneymaking entertainment proprietors in the United States. 
However, the most recent trend among booksellers all over the country has been a significant drop in sales percentages.
Local booksellers all over the United States have been forced to file bankruptcy, and larger book chains like Barnes & Noble are making cutbacks to prevent a similar outcome. 
Last Wednesday, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the Barnes & Noble bookstore on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill would be closing at the end of this year.
Industries outside of bookselling, but greatly affected by its success, have begun to see the consequences of its failure. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh recently decided to close four of its local branches in Beechview, West End, Lawrenceville, and Hazelwood earlier this month. 
Additionally, the remaining branches will adjust to shorter operating hours, multiple staff cuts, and increased public fees.
“It’s sad that the economy dictates how the students of Pittsburgh can access books,” said Peggy Lees, a first-year in the Mellon College of Science. “It’s a decision that has a direct effect on our education. I guess I just always assumed that having knowledge available to us was our right.”
Pittsburgh Library director Barbara Mistick accredited the closures to dwindling library funds in a statement posted on CarnegieLibrary.org. The post reads, “In the face of declining revenues and projected budget deficits, the Board made the very difficult decision to adopt an action plan that includes reducing service hours throughout the system, closing and merging branch locations and reducing staff.”
Due to the large amounts of recent public rallying, it’s clear that Carnegie Mellon students are not the only people who seem upset with the Board of Trustees’ decision at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.
The grassroots crusade to fight the library closures has moved its way onto Facebook and online petitions. Lobby enthusiasts have released details about their scheduled protests, gatherings, and fundraisers in the hopes of rallying those neighborhood locals directly affected by the closures. “All libraries are important,” writes the creator of the Facebook library closure petition group, Tess McShane, a Homewood resident. “When one neighborhood library closes - it represents an unraveling of Pittsburgh’s social fabric.”
The efforts of these citizens have not gone unnoticed. On Oct. 29, Pittsburgh Council president, Doug Shields, announced that he would propose a $600,000 grant to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh this year in order to keep the closing branches alive. 
While nothing is finalized, the move is a definite a step in the right direction for closure opposition forces.
Fundraising efforts have also seen significant success. The Pittsburgh foundation was able to raise over $1.2 million for charity on Thursday, and up to $100,000 of it was directly donated to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl also released a statement saying he was willing to increase the city’s contribution to the library system in order to keep the four branches open and the people happy.
While the book industry is seeing significant downfalls all over the United States, citizens of Pittsburgh are unwilling to accept the local consequences. Though citizens have been able to have an immediate impact on the opposition against local library closures, having any influence on the closing of larger branch businesses like Barnes & Noble will prove increasingly difficult.

Zhong Liang starts procrastinating every 10 to 30 minutes, because every 10 to 30 minutes he gets a coding error. As a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, he gets a lot of these errors, which leads to a lot of time procrastinating, which leads to a lot of time on Facebook.
This is a familiar story for many, especially at Carnegie Mellon, where work abounds in various forms: papers, midterm exams, projects, etc.
For Terry Zhou, a first-year math major from China, the way Chinese students take notes in class is different — they use only notebooks. But at Carnegie Mellon, Zhou mainly uses his computer. To really focus, he prints notes for class to avoid distractions. When asked if it’s better that students use laptops less in China, he said, “I think I use my laptop too much; I prefer to print something out and read it on paper, especially if it’s really hard and requires concentration.”
Zhou’s form of procrastination is spending time on Facebook. When he feels like he has spent too much of his time on Facebook, he disables his account, only to re-enable it a few days later.
In contrast, there are people like Matt Chabalko, a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering, who spends upward of four hours simply surfing the Internet. Explaining that he is most productive under pressure, he sums up his work ethic and life philosophy: “If it wasn’t for the last minute, nothing would get done.”
Then there is the exception to these rules — someone like Lizzy Madden, a senior in public policy. She works on assignments that are not due for two weeks. She said, “I usually do other work that’s not as pressing instead of doing what I’m supposed to be doing.”
She explains that her method of focusing is to change her study location often. In the transition from high school to college, she realized that she needed to use resources that would help her work consistently. She said, “I found that going to office hours stopped me from procrastinating.”
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Development center recommends moving around for 15 minutes for each hour of work to increase efficiency. Students are affected by their physical locations, the people that surround them, and their state of mind. Often, students like Madden, who have conscious realizations on how to eliminate distractions and use resources wisely, are most productive, according to Academic Development’s Fast Facts on Procrastination.
Zeynep Koraltan, a sophomore business major, calls her friends and family. S.J. Tanzer and Fiona Ryder, sophomore vocal performance majors, spend time talking to friends. Others, like fifth-year senior physics major Josh Tepper, seek out stimulation from other sources. He says that when he’s not finding fulfillment in his work, he tries to find it in other places, such as the New York Times homepage or on Facebook.
The solution to procrastination might lie in combining these seemingly opposite ideas: working with other students to satisfy a need for social interaction, while moving closer to tasks that need to be completed. Peggy Orenstein, a writer and editor on women’s issues, explains that while the Internet allows a person to indulge in a “perpetual pursuit of little thoughts,” it does not lead them to any result.

This weekend marked the end of daylight saving time this year and granted students an extra hour of sleep. Statistics show that many people have trouble sleeping through the night, and that in some cases too much sleep is a factor in obesity. Here are more statistics on sleep:
Percentage of college students who wake up at least once during the night: 43
Percentage of obese people who sleep for nine hours or more: 26
Number of minutes it takes one-third of students to fall asleep: 30
Number of hours of sleep recommended each night for people aged 15 to 24: 8.4

16th annual food drive begins
This week, Staff Council will sponsor Carnegie Mellon’s 16th annual food drive. The food drive will benefit the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, which is a non-profit organization that collects, stores, and distributes food and household products to nearly 350 other charitable agencies including soup kitchens, food pantries, shelters, day care, and senior centers for low-income people and special care facilities.
Drop boxes and barrels will be placed around campus to accept all non-perishable items. Highly requested items include toilet paper and high-protein foods, including peanut butter, tuna, and soups that include meat.
On Wednesday, “One Day, One Can” will be held during Carnegie Mellon’s Benefits Fair in the University Center. Participants are asked to bring a non-perishable food item to the Food Drive table.
The Cans Across the Cut event will take place from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Nov. 11 at the Fence. The goal is to create a line of canned goods down the Cut, from the Fence to Forbes Avenue. Individuals or teams can participate after registering at www.cmu.edu/staff-council/committees/food-drive/cans-cut.html .
Tartan Spirit Day will be held Saturday. Students are encouraged to show their Tartan pride by bringing a non-perishable food item to the Food Drive table during the football game.
Prof. helps make iPhone App
Jibbigo LLC, a startup company launched by Alex Waibel, professor of computer science and language technologies at Carnegie Mellon, has developed an iPhone application that turns the iPhone into a translating device. 
The app, which runs on the new iPhone 3GS, will translate both English speech to Spanish and Spanish speech to English.
The Jibbigo app can recognize over 40,000 spoken words. Users simply say small sentences or phrases into the iPhone and the application will respond with an audible translation. The Jibbigo application functions as a general translator, but is also especially useful to both international travelers and medical doctors. One unique aspect of the application is that it does not require a wireless connection to function.
“Jibbigo’s software runs on the iPhone itself, so it doesn’t need to be connected to the Web to access a distant server,” Waibel said. 
“That’s important for travelers and especially for humanitarian aid workers who venture beyond the big cities. It’s in those areas where wireless hotspots are few and far between — if they exist at all — that Jibbigo might be needed the most.”

I recently informed two of my friends, who have been holed up living under a rock studying for Experimental Bio-Organic Molecular Chemistry or something, that they were planning to tax us college students for being college students. I asked them what they thought.
My friends, who have the unearthly ability to insert information in their heads without sleeping, said that maybe now was not the best time to have an intelligent debate; they were exhausted and had been thinking a bit too hard about molecular biophysics to think about the fact that we might be getting screwed. I insisted we have this conversation.
After clearing our heads, we decided that we were strongly opposed to the 1 percent tax on our tuition. Our main complaint was that the reasoning for the tax was not legitimate. We definitely didn’t see ourselves as “free riders,” supposedly benefiting from the city’s infrastructure and offerings at no cost.
“We bring the city so much commerce!” my friend, whom we shall call Ronald Weasley, exclaimed. We then discussed how the colleges in the area attract so many students, thereby bringing along a fortune’s worth in “edutainment” spending, including the army of sleepy children willing to pay $4.50 for a double-shot latte. It was all a big conspiracy! They work us hard for this very purpose!
I pointed out that we do get nice benefits, like the cheap fries at Fuel and Fuddle at a ridiculous time at night. Half-off deserves credit for being totally on the ball for designing itself to benefit college students, unlike the tax, which imposes a punishment for being an undergraduate and ironically penniless.
This then led me to think that if they’re calling us free riders and end up taxing us for riding a little too freely in the Carnegie Mellon bubble that is basically composed of going to class and back (wild!), we should get more benefits for officially being the city’s residents. 
We should get beyond half-off and get three-quarters-off. We should get a giant elevated walkway that runs the length of Forbes for when water pipes burst. We should get free pierogies and ketchup. I want a bouquet of flowers every time I land at the airport. Each student should get a Segway for when the buses don’t run on time. Every time I walk into Crepes Parisiennes or Lulu’s I should get a proverbial pat-on-the-back for being an awesome citizen and supporting the city’s locally-owned eateries, maybe even a free topping on a crepe.
Hell, if I’m paying a 1 percent tuition tax, I expect not only extravagant benefits, but a feel-good high from contributing to the city all the time.
If they’re going to tax us, they’d better watch out: We’re going to free ride a lot harder.

Overweight people may soon be adding more than their pounds to their daily consumption — a Senate bill passed last week could soon have them paying more for their health insurance. The health reform bill would allow employers and private insurers to charge overweight people more money than people of healthy weights for their health care coverage.
The reasoning for the Senate bill is two-fold. First, overweight people are more likely to develop expensive health problems for the insurer, such as heart disease and diabetes, which can be directly caused by weight gain. According to the CDC, the list of more vulnerable diseases numbers at least 30. Second, in a country where two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, there would be encouragement for these at-risk people to reduce weight gain by eating less or exercising.
Clearly, something needs to be done in a country with a majority of the population overweight. The bill presents a wellness initiative; however, this is not the answer — for several reasons. Some people are genetically prone to larger weights, and thus find it harder to lose weight. These people could then continue to be penalized despite their best efforts to lose the weight. The same could apply to people living at or below the poverty line. When fast food is all that people can afford, weight gain is very likely, and monetarily penalizing these people for such an effect would only worsen their poverty state. The bill’s protection for such circumstances comes in its barring of incentive programs that are “overly burdensome,” “highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease,” or “a subterfuge for discriminating based on a health factor,” according to a slate.com article. The vague terminology of these promises, however, lacks clearly enforceable situations.
An even more controversial component of the bill is the allocation of actual U.S. tax dollars to Medicaid and Medicare incentive programs to improve healthy habits. Each year, $15 million and $100 million would be appropriated to Medicare and Medicaid, respectively, to promote monetary incentive programs for those who demonstrate changes in such areas as smoking, cholesterol control, and weight reduction. The health reform bill promises to rigorously measure these changes and outcomes. With tax dollars at stake, however, and no regulatory agency or committee clearly set up to monitor these programs, the current conditions are not enough. When this much tax money is being reallocated in the midst of an economic recession, the conditions for incentive rewards must be clearly outlined and monitored so as to most efficiently use this money that could perhaps be used in another area of the economy that is struggling.
All matters considered, the most effective form of weight reduction for America’s vast overweight population should come not from government regulations or appropriations, but rather, from education. The statistics available on population obesity back up this idea that education lies at the crux of the problem. The United States features an adult population in which 67 percent of people are overweight, and 34 percent of this group is obese. For the rest of the population under 20 years old, however, the results are even more troubling: Children aged 2–5, 6–11, and 12–19 have respective chances of 11, 15, and 18 percent of being overweight. This means that children are not only growing up in a population of overweight adults, but that too many of them are being prematurely immersed into their own culture of over-consumption. Both parents and children need to be educated on what defines healthy food, as well as the importance of physical exercise in a healthy diet.
According to current projections, if childhood obesity continues to increase at its current rate, at least half of the U.S. population will be obese by the year 2050, according to a 2007 government study. The problem with this staggering increase is a resultant rise in serious health problems and allocation of resources to manage this population. Some nutritionist experts and media sources have even begun to call childhood obesity an epidemic.
The Senate health reform bill does not address education or childhood obesity at all, and includes only a meager, vague attempt at confronting adult obesity. To change the state of obesity in the United States, we need more. We need public education movements and requirements related to obesity and beginning in the primary years. Government regulation can definitely add to the effectiveness of obesity reduction. Its legislation, however, must be better thought-out and defined than the bill the Senate passed last week.

Is your child not a “Baby Mozart” or “Baby Shakespeare?” Don’t worry, Disney will refund you the full price of any of the “Baby Einstein” videos that didn’t turn your child into a genius — though there is no return policy for the number of hours wasted staring at the television screen.
Disney’s “Baby Einstein” videos reached a peak in popularity in the last few years. A New York Times article references a 2003 study that found that a third of all American babies from 6 months to 2 years old had viewed at least one of these videos. The counterintuitive part, however, is that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no time in front of the television at all for children under two. Perhaps this, combined with the fact that the videos were not found to increase levels of intelligence in children, is why Disney was so willing to refund the retail price of any of the videos.
The discovery that comes along with the refund is more important than the refund itself — putting a  young child in front of a television will not make them smarter. I have seen many advertisements that have tried to take teaching young children out of the hands of the parents. I grew up during the “Hooked on Phonics” craze, where the minute a child showed any difficulty reading, the parents would rush out to buy the “Hooked on Phonics” kit that guaranteed such wonderful results. While I’m sure it did work in many cases, I would also bet that parents working with their children would’ve attained the same results.
I don’t have a problem with technology being used in education. I do most of my research for classes on the Internet. But I do have a problem with technology being used to replace what could and should be face-to-face interaction. How did parents miss the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation regarding television time and instead choose to believe the educational claims made by a video that consists of little more than bright colors and puppets?
Parents need to reevaluate their involvement in the lives of their young children. Instead of focusing on their intelligence levels before they have even uttered a single word, parents should focus on spending time with their children. Having high ambitions for your children and wanting them to be the next Mozart or Shakespeare is good, but teaching them that they can learn through experience and not educational videos is even better.

Chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, pain, recurrence — cancer.
But when two new words, “spontaneous disappearance,” were added to this list of cancer vocabulary, I was surprised. Yet a New York Times article describes just that — cancers which simply disappear, all on their own, without any treatment.
The Times article describes a significant study that analyzed data from screening tests for breast and prostate cancers. In certain cases, the screening tests detected small tumors, which would actually reduce in size over the years, and, in certain cases of breast cancer, disappear completely. The article goes on to report cases of various cancers in which the patients showed up for surgical removal of the tumor, but the surgeons found nothing but scar tissue, indicating the presence of a past tumor that had since disappeared.
The idea of having something like cancer just vanish seemed incredulous at first, and as I read the article, I had a million questions running through my head. How does something this serendipitous happen? How can the body suddenly find the ability to take care of this tumor when it clearly could not handle it before? I scanned the article trying to look for answers to my questions, and although many questions were left unanswered, the article did mention a few possibilities in this direction.
The article suggested spontaneous reversion of the mutant cells to their original condition. Another interesting possibility that the article presented was that a variety of factors, including the behavior of cells surrounding a tumor, the hormone level in cancer patients, and the immune system of the patients, can affect the way a tumor grows. In fact, the article quotes a doctor saying, “[Tumors need the cooperation of] the whole organism.” Although I don’t quite believe that by simply “thinking” away cancer, the tumor will disappear, it could mean that a positive attitude on the part of the patient can contribute to the reduction of the tumor.
The implications of this discovery are tremendous. If there are certain factors that cause tumors to simply disappear, it could mean that one day expensive and painful chemotherapy will not be needed. If things like a positive attitude, a boost in one’s immune system, and different hormone levels really do contribute to the shrinking of tumors, we may have found an easy way to deal with a problem that has been plaguing us for a long time. Cancer research has been going on for years now and we really haven’t seen any breakthroughs.
If scientists move forward with this new discovery, we might get the breakthrough that we’ve been looking for.
Although we’re far from solving the cancer puzzle, this discovery presents a new foundation on which subsequent cancer research can be built. I can only hope that this vein of research continues in the future, and that the exciting discoveries that have been found so far lead to more.

In the past eight days, incumbent mayor and mayoral candidate Luke Ravenstahl has bailed on events organized by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon in which he could have reached out to local university students just days before he runs for reelection.
On Sunday, Oct. 25, Ravenstahl did not show up for a planned debate with the two other candidates, Franco Dok Harris and Kevin Acklin. Later in the week, Ravenstahl pulled out of a forum organized by Carnegie Mellon Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola, saying he never committed to attending.
It seems like Ravenstahl is suggesting that he will attend these planned forums to the point of exciting those who are planning on attending his forums or lectures, perhaps thinking that awareness of his presence in the race alone should be enough to secure their votes. In both the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon instances, Ravenstahl’s campaign manager, Paul McKrell, claimed the mayor never completely confirmed that he would attend either event. In the case of Ravenstahl’s absence at the University of Pittsburgh, committee member Whitney McNamara even said she had been in contact with the Ravenstahl campaign a few days before the scheduled forum and that he had not cancelled — indicating the mayor still planned to be there.
Issuing dubious statements like the Carnegie Mellon event had “never been confirmed,” as McKrell argues, rather than firmly committing or skipping out on an event for precise reasons, indicates that Ravenstahl might be just as flaky if reelected as mayor. It is primarily the responsibility of the candidates to make their platforms available and their presences felt by the citizens who will be voting for them. When students at the two most prominent universities in the city reach out to the candidates and organize forums for the candidates to speak — and not even have to debate, in the event organized by Carnegie Mellon — it is embarrassing for both sides for the candidates to not even show up.
Pittsburgh is on the brink of coming back. We have robots, we have medicine, and we have education. Citizens are excited, and grassroots movements are happening around the city — which Ravenstahl should have been witnessing in his current term as mayor. Shouldn’t the mayoral candidates — especially the incumbent — be as excited as the citizens they are theoretically hoping to represent?
We hope Ravenstahl will step it up in his final day of campaigning before tomorrow’s election. The people of Pittsburgh deserve a representative who can communicate with them, and be open to criticism or questions about his campaign and actions.

Sometimes, age old advice changes. If you think back to when you got your first credit card you likely had someone telling you three things: Only use the card in emergencies, don’t use the card too much because that’s how you get in trouble, and always, always, pay your bill on time.
Leave it to the current state of the economy for credit card companies to realize they don’t make nearly as much money as they’d like on people who follow the above advice. Their best customers are those that they haven’t figured out how to squeeze as much profit out of. And what better way to increase their profit margins, than to add additional fees for people who behave as above.
Proposed fees for not using the card, spending too little on the card, and paying your bills on time might be coming down to consumers shortly. That is, if the government doesn’t stop them from what seems to be a ploy to just make credit cards more expensive to everyone now that they have become commonplace. 
If these fees were to become reality, we think it would probably be a good time to just go back to using debit cards, or scary as this sounds to a college community that doesn’t understand anything that isn’t digital:cash.
What a revolution that would be, switching back to the exchange of money that most directly financially benefits the consumer and the seller, in cutting out the middle man that just sends numbers over the wire. The money they would lose in credit card fees alone is outrageous, but also gone would be their lucrative profiles of consumer spending habits that they can no longer “share” with their “partners.”
Yet many would prefer not to lose the convenience of the fast transaction, and so it’s not likely that credit cards are going to stop being used anytime soon. So credit card companies, let’s rethink this idea. Find a different way to improve your bottom line. We realize times are tough, but pity on any sort of financial institution is a bit hard to muster.

A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article announced the closing of the Barnes & Noble store on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill by the end of the year. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokesperson for the company, called it “a business decision,” which, of course, explains absolutely nothing.
This leaves a major pedestrian shopping area without a traditional bookstore, though further down Murray is a used bookstore.
In April, 247wallst.com included Borders on a list of 12 companies to disappear by 2010. The pressures from online booksellers like Amazon, as well as the new e-book readers available, were cited as reasons the company was dropping in earnings.
For traditional book advocates, this news spells T-R-O-U-B-L-E.
The Amazon Kindle and Sony Reader represent a major shift in the publishing industry. No longer are publishers bound to wait for printers, and no longer must they waste valuable money shipping books.
But what of those who will miss the tactile experience of flipping through pages, the smell of paper as it ages? Perhaps some would call them old-fashioned, but even among the first-years who grew up with the Internet ubiquitous there are some who enjoy reading a physical book.
More consumers, however, are turning toward the Internet to purchase their books. Shifting into the new economy, Barnes & Noble is closing smaller stores and even introducing its own e-reader — the Nook.
Some of us will miss the experience of walking into a bookstore, browsing the section for a title or cover that pops out at us, and reading enough of the first few pages to determine if it’s worth a read.
But this ever-shrinking population of consumers is being outpaced by the voluminous crowds shirking the terrifying outside world in favor of the ease of online shopping.
As the world turns, the pages stop turning.

The Student Government Executive Branch is always looking for ways to tailor our initiatives to Carnegie Mellon students in the hope that it will lead to a better college experience for everyone. We are in the process of redefining the Tartan Rewards Program so that it is better suited for Carnegie Mellon students and covers all aspects of the CMU experience.
Not only will the program reward students who support Carnegie Mellon athletics, it will also start to reward students for attending any event on campus that they ordinarily wouldn’t attend. By encouraging students to get out of their bubbles, the Tartan Rewards Program will facilitate students’ taking advantage of everything that CMU has to offer.
After using multiple athletic events as trial runs for the program, we are ready to expand the Tartan Rewards Program to new arenas. 
The new program will continue to cover athletic events, and will also expand to service-oriented events, academic development events like the University Lecture Series, professional and career development events, and, finally, student performances.
Starting now, we invite all organizations to apply to be a part of the Tartan Rewards Program. Being a part of the Tartan Rewards Program will be beneficial to your organization, and will help allow it to reach its full potential by exposing as many students as possible to your events, via the rewards incentive. 
As we have stated previously, students who attend Tartan Reward events are entered into an ongoing yearlong raffle for prizes that include $50 gift cards, MP3 players, a flat-screen TV, etc. The more Tartan Reward events you attend, the more likely you are to win one of the rewards.
When your organization is a part of the Tartan Rewards Program, not only will you be able to advertise for your events yourself, but Student Government will also simultaneously promote your event, which will increase student awareness of the wide range of activities on campus.
We believe this revamping of the Tartan Rewards Program will lead to greater school pride and more success for campus organizations. If you or your organization is interested in becoming a part of the Tartan Rewards Program, please contact us at stugov.cmu@gmail.com.
