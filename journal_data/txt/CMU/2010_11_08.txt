The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team finished its fall 2010 season this Sunday with a heart-breaker. The Tartans suffered a loss to the Emory University Eagles 2–1 with an overtime penalty kick to finish their season 2–5 in the University Athletic Association and 8–8 overall.
The Tartans started out strong by scoring the first goal before 23 minutes had passed. This was senior Alice Mayfield’s first goal of the season; she was assisted by junior Nicole Bayley. The Eagles fired up and tied the game with a goal of their own by Melanie Levy only six minutes later. At this point, the game tightened and both the Tartans and the Eagles stepped up their defenses.
At halftime the game was still in a deadlock. Both teams took the field even more determined than before. The second half was a constant tradeoff between strong offense and defense. Starting on offense were the Emory Eagles, who took the first shot on goal of the half but missed. The Tartans quickly returned the shot but to no avail, and the rest of the half continued in this manner. At the end of the half, the Eagles had outshot the Tartans seven to five. 
The game continued into overtime. This time, the Tartans came out strong when junior Elsa Wu took the first shot on goal within the first 30 seconds; however, the shot was blocked by the Eagles' goalie. Less than a minute later, the Eagles returned the shot and missed wide. A foul was called on the Tartans two minutes into the overtime and resulted in a penalty kick for the Eagles. The Eagles were able to take advantage of the penalty and convert it into the game-winning goal.
On a brighter note, the Tartans showed tremendous improvement from last season and are on an upward trend.

The anticipated Homecoming game was a disappointment for the football team, which lost a tough game to University Athletic Association (UAA) foe the University of Chicago. Carnegie Mellon’s Gesling Stadium was buzzing on Saturday, full of alumni and students celebrating Homecoming weekend. The day was highlighted with free food, a chili cook-off, and activities in Wiegand Gym. Unfortunately, the Tartan football team couldn’t keep up with the Maroons of Chicago on Saturday, losing 61–22 in front of a packed crowd. Carnegie Mellon had won three out of its last four match-ups with Chicago, but was overpowered by the passing game of the Maroons, who totaled 419 yards passing on the day. The loss drops the Tartans to 4–5 on the season and 0–2 in UAA play.
The Tartans opened up the game with a touchdown by sophomore Jake Nardone, but Chicago quickly jumped ahead to a 21–7 lead in the first quarter, and the Tartans could never erase the difference. 
Carnegie Mellon stayed with Chicago in the second quarter, keeping the spread at 14 points, as the score was 34–20 going into the half. Unfortunately for the Tartans, Chicago sophomore Dee Brizzolara ran back junior Tartan Pat Garrett’s second-half opening kick off for a touchdown, and there was no looking back for the Maroons. The Tartans managed to get two points back after senior Richie Pattison blocked Chicago’s point-after-touchdown attempt and sophomore Luke Sharked returned it for a score, but Carnegie Mellon couldn’t get back on the scoreboard after that. Chicago scored a total of 27 points in the second half, and Carnegie Mellon’s offense couldn’t overtake the Maroons’ lead. Chicago’s passing attack was led by quarterback Marshall Oium, who had 410 yards passing and six touchdowns, and wide receiver Brizzolara, who had 235 yards receiving and three touchdowns on only eight receptions. 
Tartan junior Ray Johnson said about Chicago’s offense, “Defensively we had trouble containing their passing game. We couldn’t force turnovers and gave up some big plays.”
Even in the loss, the Tartans’ running game was consistent as usual. Senior Justin Pratt continued his great season, running for 107 yards and one touchdown on the day. With that effort, Pratt now has 1,399 rushing yards for his career, 13th in school history. Sophomore Jake Nardone also had a solid day for Carnegie Mellon, recording 91 rushing yards and a touchdown. 
Junior running back Chris Garcia was the only other Tartan to score, as he had a rushing touchdown in the first half. The Tartans’ strong run game wasn’t enough on Saturday, however, as Chicago’s offense more than doubled Carnegie Mellon in total yards.
Carnegie Mellon’s defense was led by seniors Brandon Vantassel and Mike Shedlosky and junior Ray Johnson. Vantassel and Johnson had seven tackles each, and Shedlosky recorded five. With those five tackles, Shedlosky moved himself into 14th place in all-time tackles in Carnegie Mellon football history.
The Tartans aim to recover from Saturday’s loss this upcoming weekend. Carnegie Mellon football has had 35 consecutive seasons with a final record at .500 or better, and the team looks to make it 36 seasons with a win against Case Western Reserve University this Saturday, in their final game of the season. 
Junior cornerback Dan Miller is looking to keep the streak alive and finish the season strong. “The streak is always in the back of our minds, but at this point we are more concerned about finishing the season on the right foot with a win. The best thing we can do after a tough loss like today is to come out fighting next week,” he said.
The Tartans hit the road this week and will play Case Western Reserve this Saturday.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team will host its third annual Hour of Power this Tuesday at 5 p.m. in the UC. The Hour of Power is in its fifth year running at Carleton College, the original site of the fundraiser. It is held in the honor of Carleton swimmer Ted Mullin, who passed away in the fall of 2006 from sarcoma, a kind of cancer. This year, the Tartans' swimming team has created an additional event for the public this Sunday, separate from the initial swim team's hour. It costs $15 to participate, swimmers of all ability levels are welcome, and the price includes a free Hour of Power T-shirt.
The swimming team is very passionate about this event and wants to get as many people to participate as possible. The number of schools participating has grown every year. The Tartans have been raising money by selling commemorative T-shirts for $10, and the team has increased its donation amount each year.
“We started this charity two years ago, and each year we have increased our donations collected. We have already surpassed out donations collected from last year and are excited to reach our goal of $1,000 this year,” junior swim team member Jen Sung said. “We organized a new Hour of Power event for the general public so more people can support our cause.”
The funds raised by this event will go toward the University of Chicago Medical Center’s pediatric sarcoma research efforts. The Ted Mullin Fund, started by Carleton College, was able to support the center's recruitment of Stephen X. Skapek, an expert in the area of sarcoma research and treatment. Skapek and his team are working toward developing treatment strategies that will be effective on the cancer cells that continue to proliferate after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 
The event will be an hour-long leave-it-in-the-pool practice. All participants will divide into teams of five or six and be swimming continuous relays of 50 yards at maximum effort, using any stroke. Optimally, all participating schools begin and end the Hour of Power at the same time. The swimmers participating know that thousands of other people are speeding through the water for the same cause all across the nation. This enhances the inspiration and spirit of the event as participants complete their workouts.
Registration is still open, and fees are due by Nov. 14. Forms can be directed to Kaitlan Ahrens ([SLANT12]kahrens@andrew.cmu.edu[SLANT12]).

The Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team placed sixth overall in the University Athletic Association Championship last weekend at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, bringing the team's record to 12–22 overall and 3–8 in the UAA.
To start the tournament, the Tartans fell 3–0 to No. 1 Washington University (who finished third in the tournament) 25–12, 25–9, and 25–13. Senior Aislinn McCloskey and junior Maddie Rosnick anchored the offense with a total of four kills each, while first-year Emily Wright chalked up 16 assists. On the defensive end of play, senior Cameron Griffin totaled a hard-fought 12 digs.
Later that day, the team lost 3–1 to No. 15 New York University, winning the first set 25–19 before falling 25–18, 25–12, and 25–20 to the hard-nosed Violets. McCloskey once again directed the court with 15 kills and six block assists, while first-year Senna Parsa and senior Caroline Size totaled 11 and nine kills, respectively. The Tartans fought hard to stay strong defensively, as Griffin led with 19 digs, first-year Ali Nichols had 10 digs, and Rosnick accumulated six block assists. Wright totaled 37 assists overall.
The tide turned for the Tartans on Saturday, as they brought in a commanding 3–0 victory over Brandeis University (25–20, 25–20, 25–17) that earned them a spot in the fifth-place match. Parsa had 16 kills, one block solo, and three block assists, while McCloskey accumulated 11 kills. Rosnick had eight kills, while Wright dominated both offensively and defensively, tallying 40 assists and nine digs. Griffin led the defense once again with 17 digs (teammate Nichols also picked up nine), while first-year Olivia Mora dominated at the net with two block solos and five block assists.
In the fifth-place game, Carnegie Mellon faced No. 23 University of Chicago but fell 3–1 (sets 25–12, 21–25, 25–20, 25–15). McCloskey and Parsa had 11 kills each as Wright had 36 assists. Griffin had 24 digs, while Rosnick had four block assists.

After a season filled with many ups and downs, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team was able to pull off another victory in its last game of the regular season. The Tartans convincingly defeated the Eagles of Emory University in what proved to be a very one-sided match. The game was a must-win for the Tartans, who needed to beat the No. 12 Emory University in order to have any chance of making to this year’s NCAA Division III tournament. Carnegie Mellon did exactly that.
An unexpected injury put junior midfielder Carmen Minella out of this weekend’s action, joining sophomores John Crawshaw and Alex Abedian on the sideline. This put the burden on the first-year duo of Chris Wysocki and Matt Sarett to step up and have a strong game in the depleted Tartans’ midfield. The Eagles found themselves on their heels for much of the first half, with Emory goalie Trenton Spindler having to parry away three shots. The Tartans were able to unravel their visiting opponents’ defense halfway through the first half, as quick ball movement and a precise service from junior Kyle Young set up first-year forward Max Tassano for his seventh goal of the season. Minutes later, Wysocki unleashed a dipping shot that went just over the bar. The Tartans continued to press but were only able to maintain the one-goal advantage at half. A rather quiet Emory side early in the game was able to pull it together in the second half, giving the Tartans a bit of a scare after hitting the post. Despite the spark in the Eagles’ play, the Tartans were able to maintain their shape and get another goal, with first-year Joey Paladino notching his sixth of the season. The Tartans went on to make the conference upset, winning the game with a final score of 2–0.
Carnegie Mellon will now anxiously wait for the announcement of the NCAA Division III Men’s Soccer Tournament bracket, which will be unveiled today at 2 p.m. The Cardinal and Grey might have to settle for playing the lesser ECAC Tournament in thepostseason, but Sunday’s victory along with a solid overall record will boost the Tartans’ chances of making it to the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back years.

While most fall teams are winding down their seasons or preparing for UAAs, one Carnegie Mellon athletics team is making headway into its season. The Tartan Ultimate Frisbee Team — “Mr. Yuk” — has been sailing past competition and exceeding expectations the past few weeks at the Fall Brawl and Skylander X tournaments. The Ultimate team, composed of returning members and new blood alike, hopes that its intense conditioning and lineup depth will give it an edge over other teams at sectionals this year.
“We are returning a very core group of players who are looking to outperform the fifth-place finish at sectionals last year to make it to regionals for the first time in five years,” Assistant Captain Adam Knowlton said.
Mr. Yuk started its season with a 20-team tournament in Columbus, Ohio, taking ninth place and beating its initial seed of 15. After a run of four back-to-back games, the Tartans came away 2–2 with a win over Ohio State B, with a score of 13–5, and Kenyon College in a nail-biter that ended 14–13. In their final game, the Tartans took off a five-point chip from the University of Pittsburgh, a team consistently ranked in the top 10. On the second day of play, Mr. Yuk started off with a loss to Ohio State Alumni, but rebounded by topping Miami of Ohio and the University of Toledo 15–5 and 15–11, respectively. The Tartans also took the opportunity to work out kinks in their strategies and practice working as a unit in actual competitive play.
Mr. Yuk hit the road again a few weeks later, this time traveling to Edinboro, Pa. to compete in the Skylander X tournament. The Tartans took down Denison University, University of Virginia B, and University of Pennsylvania A with relative ease, dropping only 12 points in three games. After bypassing Penn State Behrend and Grove City University Alumni the next day, the Tartans faced the strong team and eventual tournament champions Edinboro University Alumni, losing 9–7 in overtime. This close loss to one of the best-perceived teams in the country is a good indicator to Mr. Yuk of where the team currently stands strength-wise.
“We are hoping to round out our fall with a strong performance at our most competitive tournament until we reach the spring season,” Knowlton said, reflecting on the past couple of weeks. 
“Up until this point, we have been pretty injury-plagued, making our strong fall performance even more satisfying. We are getting a couple of guys back for this tournament, so we are hoping to show an even stronger field a better and more polished team, having had two weeks to refine our offense and solidify our main defense.”
Mr. Yuk will travel to Poolesville, Md. to compete in the Tartans’ final tournament of the season, the Colonial Ultimate Festival, on Nov. 13–14.

Now that we’ve entered the month of November, many of us are anticipating the famous Bowl Championship Games (BCS) that will be starting in about a month. Unfortunately, many of us are anticipating that the system will mess up and pick the wrong teams to play for the National Championship, as well. For those of you who don’t know, over the course of the college football season, teams are ranked throughout the year using a mix of sportswriters’ opinions along with multiple computer rankings that crunch all the possible numbers of the season to rank the “best” teams. For the past decade or so, this system has come under massive scrutiny because the system oftentimes does not pick the best teams and places too much emphasis on opinion. Teams from the big conferences are cut more slack because they have a tougher schedule, so there have been countless times when undefeated teams are ranked No. 3 or No. 4 in the polls even though the teams ranked ahead of them have one loss. At the end of the year, those undefeated teams are denied a chance to call themselves national champions.
This year seems to be no different. There will be four or possibly five teams in contention to play for the big game, which includes the undefeated Boise State Broncos and the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. Both of these teams went undefeated last year, and actually played each other in a Bowl Game that wasn’t a national championship. It looks like much of the same this year, as they have consistently been ranked anywhere from No. 3 to No. 6 despite not losing a game this year. Currently only two teams stand in the way of these two, except these two teams play in major conferences unlike Boise and TCU. The Oregon Ducks, who play in the Pac-10 conference with well-known names like USC and Stanford, are currently undefeated and ranked No. 1. The Auburn Tigers, who play in the powerhouse Southeastern Conference or SEC, are also undefeated with some very impressive wins this year.
Let’s take a look at these four teams’ respective seasons. Oregon has gone relatively unchallenged this year, beating top-10 team Stanford at home and also beating then-ranked USC on the road. Beating Stanford is a huge win, although Oregon playing at home is a ridiculous advantage, in any college sport. Oregon’s win over USC now looks mediocre because USC has lost three games already this year and has the possibility of losing more. Oregon does have one more huge game on the schedule, when they play No. 13 Arizona at home at the end of November. If they win that game, they will have a great argument to make the national championship game, and rightfully so.
Auburn has a great résumé this year, as they have beaten three top-25 teams in LSU, South Carolina, and Arkansas. All of these teams have stayed in the top 25 for most of the year, and none have losses that prove that they aren’t for real. With wins over three top-25 teams along with a date with powerhouse Alabama later on this season, Auburn would also have a strong argument that they should make the title game, especially if they beat Alabama.
Now, onto Boise State, who began the season ranked No. 3 and has sat at that spot ever since. They have beaten two top-25 teams — Virginia Tech and Oregon State, but Oregon State has dropped out of the top 25, while Virginia Tech has looked shaky all year. Even with a weak schedule, Boise State is considered by everyone to be one of the best in college football. They too deserve a shot at the championship.
Last but not least, the TCU Horned Frogs have enjoyed a relatively easy season so far. They only had two top-25 teams on their schedule, one being the overrated Oregon State (mentioned above) and the other being the Utah Utes, another mid-major team that is looking for respect. Going into yesterday’s game against Utah, the Utes were ranked No. 6 while TCU was ranked No. 4. Everyone expected a great game, but TCU dominated from the opening kickoff to the final whistle, a game that TCU won by a score of 47–7. A 40-point beat-down of a top-10 team? How can they not be championship contenders?
So we have four undefeated teams, and four national championship contenders. How can the BCS pick two of these teams to play in the big game? No matter who gets chosen, the other two schools will most definitely complain, because each one of these teams has a championship résumé. 
I’m tired of hearing the same story every year. College football needs a playoff right away. College basketball enamors America for one month of the year because of a tournament format. 
Why can’t football do the same thing? College sports are sport in its purest form: a team whose only motivation is to win it all for each other and one’s school. The BCS is all about making money from these “marquee” bowl games. It’s time for the BCS to think about the amount of money they would make from a month known only for college football.

After the San Francisco Giants and Texas Rangers clinched their respective pennants and punched their tickets to the World Series, the scales appeared tipped in the Rangers’ favor. While the Giants had managed to eke their way by Atlanta in the Division Series and then Philadelphia in the Championship Series, the Rangers had essentially pounded their way past the pitching of the Rays and Yankees, jumping on every opportunity they were given to come through in the clutch. The Rangers’ army of pitchers included veteran postseason stud Cliff Lee, brought onboard at the trading deadline for just this purpose, and Colby Lewis, who quickly earned his own “stud” title after dominating the Yankees twice in the Championship Series. The Giants’ pitching corps was led by Tim Lincecum, who after a seesaw regular season had been dominant in the postseason so far, and Matt Cain, who had allowed no earned runs through his first three postseason starts; the Giants also had rookie Madison Bumgarner, who had performed well enough up to that point when called upon, and Jonathan “Ollie Perez” Sanchez, who despite having great stuff at times could not stay consistent to save his life (read: postseason).
The Rangers clearly had the superior hitters going into it. They seemed to have the superior battle-tested pitchers as well, with their staff having convincingly shut down the Yankees, but one couldn’t just chalk the series up as Rangers hitters and Rangers pitchers v. Giants, so Rangers hitters v. Giants pitchers it was.
But a World Series is just as much won on great pitching as it is lost on bad pitching. The Giants, who had won only one postseason game by more than one run and hadn't scored more than six in a game so far, jumped on Cliff Lee in Game 1 to win 11–7. They then toppled the Texas bullpen in Game 2 to win 9–0, sending a message that they were going to take every opportunity afforded to them — every bad pitch, every error, every walk — and make the Rangers pay. The series headed to Texas with the Rangers hitters hoping that some home cooking could bring back the spark that had driven them through their first seven postseason wins but had left them high and dry in the World Series thus far.
The first World Series game played in Arlington was all the Rangers had hoped it’d be, with owner and Rangers great Nolan Ryan being one of the people throwing out the first pitch, and after much pregame fanfare, a 4–2 Rangers victory. Colby Lewis had once again come through for Texas, and although the runs came from an unlikely source in first baseman Mitch Moreland, the Rangers took what they could get to head into Game Four looking to tie up the Series at two games apiece and, hopefully, take all three games in their home park to head back to San Francisco with a lead in the series.
The Giants’ Bumgarner, though, lived up to the surprising amount of hype that surrounded him all postseason with what can safely be called the performance of his life. The 21-year-old rookie threw eight beautifully scoreless innings, burying the lifeless Texas bats on merely three hits before closer Brian Wilson slammed the coffin on a 4–0 Texas loss. The Giants then wrapped up their first World Championship in 56 years with a 3–1 victory in Game 5, taking advantage of Cliff Lee’s one mistake — a fat pitch that World Series MVP Edgar Renteria sent into the stands for a three-run homer.
Going into the World Series, it was hard not to pick Texas after that team’s offensive performances in its earlier postseason series. But fans forgot that to get to the World Series, the Giants had already shut down a powerhouse Phillies lineup, including holding first baseman Ryan Howard to no home runs and no RBIs the entire series. It was that grit and that ability to take advantage of opportunities that ultimately drove the Giants to this World Championship and, if their core is kept intact, many more in the future.

When one develops a passion for a sport, a parent's advice is usually, "Keep at it." The Tartans' Anya Rosen has been keeping at it for 15 years now as she completes her final year at Carnegie Mellon as a fine arts major and goalie for the women's soccer team.
"I started playing soccer when I was six or seven, but I didn't start seriously playing goalkeeper until I was in seventh grade," the senior from La Cañada, Calif., explained. "In middle school, the coaches noticed that I liked falling a lot, and they thought it would be better for me to be in the goal because you can fall there more than on the field. I was good [at goalie], so that was where I stayed.
"I like being aggressive; I don't know what it was about the falling, the giving all your effort in one fell swoop instead of little by little, but ... exerting that intense maximum amount of energy in that one moment was what I wanted to do," Rosen said.
Carnegie Mellon was a top college choice for Rosen not only because of its reputation as a great arts school, but because she liked knowing that the soccer team was interested in her and wanted her to play. Rosen will graduate in May with a degree in fine arts, and her concentration and passion is painting. She aspires to have a career as an artist and is applying to residency programs in America — in locations including New York and California — as well as in locations around the world, including Canada, Japan, and Argentina. Rosen said that, while she isn't fluent in any foreign languages, she knows some Spanish and spoke Japanese as a child. She lived in Japan while she was about six months to two years old.
Rosen and the rest of the women's soccer team, which finished their season 8–8 with an overtime loss to Emory on Sunday, began the year with a new head coach in Yon Struble. Rosen believes that the family-driven philosophy that Struble brings to the team is essential to the growth and success of the team in the coming years. She also values that Struble is a former goalkeeper himself, and Rosen says she feels that every day she learns something new from him.
As passionate as Rosen is for the sport of soccer as a student athlete, she doesn't envision herself continuing to play much once she leaves Carnegie Mellon. "I don't know how involved I'm going to be," she said. "With soccer, a lot of it is that I have a love for this intense competition. I'm sure I'll play with my friends, but especially being a goalkeeper, [rec league games] are not as exciting as practice, which is what I enjoy so much about soccer: playing, jumping around, being involved, and getting better every day."

Every month we pay for electricity. The bill we receive usually tells us two things: How much money we owe and how much power we’ve consumed. We know very little beyond those two things about our energy-consuming behavior for that month. For anyone trying to reduce his or her energy consumption, not knowing how to reduce electricity usage can hinder his or her strategy. However, researchers at Carnegie Mellon are currently developing a system that may be able to tell you how much energy each appliance in your home is consuming at any given time.
Mario Berges, an assistant professor in the civil and environmental engineering department, began his research by helping construct a system to monitor electricity usage in various buildings on the university’s campus. Berges and his colleagues initially implemented meters that would measure the amount of power going through individual circuits. Circuits regulate the power going through many different outlets that may be located in different rooms. By turning every electric appliance on and off, Berges’ group was able to identify what the electric signal for each individual appliance looked like, creating an “electrical signature” for that appliance.
The problems with the setup, however, were that it was expensive, involved a lot of labor, and was not able to track changes in what was plugged in. For example, the electric signal from a specific outlet might be identified as “computer,” but if the computer were to be removed from that outlet and replaced with a lamp, the system could not make the correction by itself. Berges and his colleagues then began thinking of simpler, smarter, and less-intrusive monitoring systems.
“There’s a whole research area around the idea of taking non-intrusive measurements, which means taking measurements outside of the house [using the home’s electric meter]. From those measurements, you can infer what each appliance is doing based on how they consume the power,” Berges said.
The idea involved a technique known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), which involved measuring the total electrical power usage of an entire building and deducing which appliances contributed that total power consumption using various communication and information technologies. This technique would be simpler and cheaper than installing monitoring systems on every circuit or outlet, but would need to be “trained”, or given information about the appliances in your house.
In a study that was recently published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, Berges and colleagues proposed that the “training” of the system should happen when an electrician comes to your house to perform an energy audit in which the useage of your house’s electricity is evaluated.
“While you’re receiving an energy audit, you should be at the same time training the system, with the added benefit that you get all the [electrical] signatures there and you can leave the NILM in place, and it will collect the same data that that guy would collect in one day, but continuously,” Berges said. A prototype NILM system was tested in the study, and was found to correctly identify the power consumption of many household appliances, but had some trouble with appliances that were not present during the “training.”
Of course, there are several improvements that need to be made to this system. Even though an energy audit makes the “training” much easier, it still involves labor for the customer, which may deter interest. Also, there are some appliances on the market that do not have clear electrical signatures. They may have several different power levels that they cycle through, rather than one stable electric signal that is easy to detect by the NILM.
This research is a step in the right direction for providing useful energy-consuming information, and it also offers opportunities for other types of studies to be performed. The existence of this data could offer insight into topics like domestic human behavior or efficiencies of various household products. 
Berges said, “There are many doors that open up, and it’s not only for consumers.”

New LED Incapacitators (LEDIs) that have been developed almost seem like a precursor to lightsabers in that both use light as a weapon. However, there is one very important difference between the two. LEDIs have been designed especially to be non-lethal weapons for subduing people, while any self-respecting Star Wars fan knows about the amount of harm a lightsaber can do. LEDIs have been developed in California by Intelligent Optical Systems, and rhe technology involved has impressed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security so much that the company received a million-dollar grant from the department.
LEDIs are designed to confuse people enough by pulsing LED lights in different frequencies, intensities, and patterns to stop them from running away from law enforcement officers, according to www.howthingswork.com. This does not cause any physical harm, but will cause disorientation and, in some cases, nausea. The weapon is designed for use by border patrol and national guard personnel, according to www.guardian.co.uk.
The LEDIs have several advantages over other weapons designed to fulfill the same task. For example, Tasers and other stun guns can also disorient people, but they require the shooter to be close to the person being subdued. Also, these machines can trigger heart attacks in people with weak hearts, and they are capable of causing great amounts of pain. Lasers can also be shone into people’s eyes to stop them from moving, but this can cause permanent tissue damage to the eyes, and it also requires the ability to aim well from a distance. LEDIs do not cause lasting harm, and only need to be aimed near the subject’s location.
LEDIs work by taking advantage of limitations the brain has in processing information. When light is shone onto a person’s retina, the part of the eye that detects light, information is sent to the brain. However, LEDIs pulse light at a speed faster than the brain can process. This overflow of information can incapacitate a person for minutes after the light has stopped flashing.
Another deterrent that uses light is called “strobing,” where a strobe light is used to confuse people. LEDIs function in a manner closest to this alternative, but LED lights are usually much more durable and power efficient than the lights used as strobe lights. In LEDIs, the basic mode of operation is that these LED lights just blink on and off in a variety of colors very rapidly. This ends up confusing the target without injuring him or her. For all of these reasons, the finished version of the LEDI is being eagerly anticipated by many.
A second phase of development of the LEDI will be tested by volunteers at Penn State University, according to www.gizmag.com. One goal of Intelligent Optical Systems is to reduce the size of the current LEDI model to make it more portable.
For the electronics enthusiast, there are online tutorials available that provide simple step-by-step instructions on how to create a homemade LEDI. The homemade version isn’t as powerful or as sophisticated as the weapon that might eventually be used by law enforcement officers. All this circuit really needs is a few LED lights and a small microprocessor to control when the lights come on and off, and the finished payoff is a bunch of blinking lights that might induce a slight headache if stared at for long enough. One such guide can be found at www.ladyada.net/make/bedazzler/make.html.
The LEDI are only one of many new ideas on the market that are trying to make weapons less permanently damaging and more humane. Nonlethal innovations to weapons like LEDIs are favorable, as they will allow law enforcement officers to be able to subdue criminals without causing physical injury.

“Keep out of reach of children” is most often the first warning that appears on the labels of painkillers. Painkillers, or analgesics, are drugs that block the pain receptors in your body from sending neurotransmitters, or pain signals, to your brain. These analgesics range from mild over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen — the most common ingredient in Tylenol and other pain medications — to the extremely potent, with examples being morphine or hydrocodone. Too high of a dosage or improper usage of these drugs can cause serious side effects or even death.
Pain is a natural reaction the body has when part of its tissue is damaged. When this occurs, a process of signal transmission from the initial pain receptors to the brain begins, which is called nociception. First, the pain receptors of the damaged tissue release a series of chemicals such as serotonin, histamine, and potassium that act as chemical messengers from the pain site to the brain, according to www.uic.edu. When released, these neurotransmitters travel to the spinal cord and up to the brain, where they are then interpreted as pain and prompt the physical feeling of discomfort.
Painkillers are classified into two different types: non-narcotics and narcotics. Non-narcotic medication includes over-the-counter forms such as asprin and Tylenol, with the active ingredients ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Side effects of non-narcotics tend to be mild and do not cause brain-alterating states, like their narcotic counterparts. Narcotics, on the other hand, are extremely dangerous and can have serious side effects due to the breaking of the blood-brain barrier when consumed. This means that the active chemicals in the painkillers can enter the brain. When this barrier is broken, the narcotics have a direct impact on the central nervous system and can cause mood and behavioral changes, according to www.webmd.com.
One class of narcotic is opiates. Opiates are natural alkaloids taken from the resin of poppy seeds and are the base for well-known painkillers such as morphine, heroin, and, of course, opium. Since this class of drug breaks the blood-brain barrier, the drug itself travels to your brain directly and activates the part of your brain responsible for feeling pleasure. This causes a sudden release of dopamine and endorphins which can cause a “high,” or a relaxed state. An article on www.teens.drugabuse.gov states that these drugs don’t block the natural opioid receptors in our body, but rather alter the brain’s perception of pain by blocking neurotransmissions from ever reaching the brain.
An opioid is the general term for the chemical that is harvested from a poppy flower, with the finished product of opium being the root drug for today’s medications. This class of drug can include opiate narcotics, but also includes synthetically created drugs that mimic the chemicals found in opium poppy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) states on www.drugabuse.gov/researchreports that opioids work by binding to opioid receptors throughout our body. These receptors are generally found in our brain and spinal cord, which are components of the central nervous system. Receptors can also be found in the gastrointestinal tract. When opioids are ingested, they bind to these receptors and prevent pain signals from reaching the brain. According to arthritis.about.com, besides raising pain tolerance and hindering the brain’s perception of pain, opioids are extremely effective pain relievers, and in some cases, can cause euphoria. However, the NIDA reports that opioids are one of three most commonly abused prescription medications. Although effective, opioids should be taken with caution.

Throughout the years, Pittsburgh’s Andy Warhol Museum, located by the riverfront in East Allegheny, has dazzled visitors with a vast array of year-round and traveling exhibits. Last month, the museum proudly debuted its newest addition dedicated to the blonde bombshell and sex sensation Marilyn Monroe.
The Marilyn Monroe: Life as a Legend exhibit, located on the fourth and seventh floors of the Andy Warhol Museum, features a collection of Monroe prints created by Warhol himself, some of the most famous publicity pictures and magazine covers featuring Monroe throughout the years, and a collection of Monroe interpretations created by other artists.
In the main gallery on the seventh floor, visitors are immersed in Monroe culture. The first biographical info panel describes Monroe as being transformed from a “naive and shy” girl to a “sparkling and vivacious” superstar. This evolution is apparent as visitors journey through two floors of mixed media documenting the life of one of Hollywood’s household names.
From more risqué photographs, such photographer Tom Kelly’s glossy nudes entitled “Marilyn Monroe’s Poses #1-4”, to classy advertisement campaigns, including Ed Feingersh’s “Marilyn Monroe and Chanel #5” taken in 1953, museum guests are given a glimpse into every decade of Monroe’s life and fame. Among the unfamiliar photos, there are several recognizable shots including, for example, a screen shot from The Seven Year Itch, where Monroe is standing over a subway grate when a train passes by and the wind blows up her white dress.
Throughout her life, Monroe was repeatedly described as a sex symbol. Though she had conservative photos taken for her acting and singing careers, she also dabbled in the provocative and lustful pin-up shots that drove men wild. Douglas Kirkland’s series, titled One Night with Marilyn, features her wearing nothing but a bedsheet. 
The gallery isn’t just all about photography, either; over the loudspeakers throughout the seventh floor, guests can hear Monroe belt the lyrics to some of her hit songs, including a recording from her 1953 performance of “Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend,” which was featured in the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Visitors can also hear Monroe’s famous rendition of “Happy Birthday, Mr. President,” sung in 1962 to President John F. Kennedy.
On the walls throughout the gallery, some of Monroe’s most famous quotes are painted in bright red. Over a series of photos taken of Monroe in the earlier years before her iconic fame, the wall reads, “Real beauty and femininity are ageless and can’t be contrived. Glamour can be manufactured.” In glass display boxes throughout the gallery, visitors can see Monroe on the cover of various magazines like Glamour and Life, as well as the front pages of several newspapers. Gossip articles look into the icon’s music and movie careers and her various affairs and romances. One newspaper even claims in its headline to have “Photos From Her Last Day of Life.”
Perhaps even more fascinating than the story of Monroe’s iconic life is Warhol’s assumed obsession with the deceased celebrity. In the side gallery on the seventh floor, Warhol’s fascination comes to life. Growing up in the golden age of Hollywood, Warhol was always fascinated by fame, and he began collecting autographed photos of his favorite actresses and actors while still in elementary school. The descriptive panels in the gallery tell visitors how Warhol eventually amassed thousands of magazines and publicity photos devoted to his favorite celebrity subjects. In the gallery, Warhol’s collection of photographs of Monroe tiles the walls. Though he had collected over 120 photographs of the icon before her death, it wasn’t until her suicide in 1962 that Warhol chose to feature Monroe in his work. 
Amid the walls of photographs hangs Andy Warhol’s 1967 “Marilyn Prints”, a series of 10 large, brightly colored portraits based off of a publicity photograph of the actress taken by Gene Korman for the film Niagara. While Warhol never painted the actress before her death, these portraits were featured in the artist’s first solo exhibition at the Stable Gallery in New York City during November 1962.     
In the center of the seventh-floor gallery, behind a glass case, is a booklet of 38 elongated octagons. Each of the pages features a detailed look at the drafts of the “Marilyn Prints”. In the next room, are two gigantic paintings by Antonio de Felipe. One is directly inspired by Roy Lichtenstein’s comic book-like pop art style, while the other places Monroe atop a backdrop of tropically-colored flowers.
In her time, Monroe captivated the public with her beauty and grace. This exhibit allows visitors to return to the ’50s and watch as the young starlet transforms herself from a shy, small-town girl into a household name.

The fourth annual Bhangra in the Burgh competition was one of the most exciting shows since the creation of the competition. Master of ceremonies and social and decision sciences junior Suraj Baxi kept the audience entertained, and Carnegie Mellon’s own bhangra team performed at the end of the show.
As usual, the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall was packed for the show, with tickets having sold out that morning. The Bhangra in the Burgh staff members wanted to make this show an experience, and they certainly pulled it off. There was a VIP section where guests received a small blue gift bag that included a Ferrero Rocher chocolate, a thank-you card, a Bhangra in the Burgh pen, and even a coupon for a free water bottle and samosa during the intermission.
As the crowd filled in the seats before the show began, The Originals, Carnegie Mellon’s oldest all-male a cappella singing group, founded in 1996, performed. Then the MC came out — or to be more accurate, the MC’s evil twin (Baxi with glasses and an Indian accent). Apparently Baxi was taped to his chair back in his dorm room — a video explained — and the audience laughed as the evil twin ran off stage to avoid Baxi’s threats.
Then came the seriously epic opening credits. A video of past performances paired with a loud hip hop/bhangra fusion beat left the audience roaring for the show to begin.
Baxi, freed from captivity, came on stage with a crew in tow, throwing Bhangra in the Burgh T-shirts out to the audience. After a welcome and a few jokes, Drexel University’s team took the stage. Along with the dance members, the team also came equipped with a dhol — a traditional drum used while dancing bhangra. Dressed in red, green, blue, and yellow, Drexel started off the show with a lot of energy.
After two performances, Carnegie Mellon was able to exhibit some of its own talent. The Dancers’ Symposium Company took the stage to give the audience a contemporary dance performance with an intriguing storyline.
Next up was the First Class Bhangra team “Pittsburgh born, Pittsburgh bred” and the self-proclaimed “hometown Bhangra team.” This troupe of all males danced around the stage in black, brown, and orange. It was the first team to incorporate tricks with its props, but the performers also looked exhausted by the end of their routine, holding up letters that spelled out “Pittsburgh” and spinning Terrible Towels above their heads.
The Rutgers University team had a Jersey Shore-inspired team video before its performance and started off strong, parading across the entire stage in white, purple, orange, and blue. There was no dhol player, but the team did have a chimta — another traditional instrument that looks like a long, flat folded piece of metal strip with pairs of small metal jingles. In the middle of the routine, a dancer came on stage dressed very oddly for the competition, wearing a black T-shirt, black Adidas sweats, and a huge blue mask — complete with huge orb eyes that lit up—and huge screen ears. This team even managed to include props with blankets and a table while some of the women played tambourines or danced with little vases. The dancers ended their routine with a waving Rutgers flag.
The University of Pittsburgh was up for an exhibition performance as well, presenting its PantheRaas team. This type of dance style was originally performed by men, using a pair of wooden sticks called dandia. The Pitt team had men and women on stage, although some women were made up to be men, all dressed in orange and blue with silver and red accents. The performance was beautiful and a nice change of pace from the competition.
Up next was the DC Bhangra Crew. This all-female team was a crowd pleaser with its performance and choice of songs. As “Whip My Hair” and other recognizable contemporary singles played under the Bhangra beat, the women brought props as well: Blankets, fans, and jars appeared along with the song “How Low Can You Go.”
After such a riveting performance, the intermission commenced as samosas and water awaited audience members in the hallway.
The show resumed with an exhibition performance from Deewane, Carnegie Mellon’s South Asian all-male a cappella group. After a rendition of “Airplanes,” the group broke out into a crowd favorite: “Mundian To Bach Ke,” the song that Jay-Z rapped over in 2003. With  beatboxing and harmonies, Deewane came with its own rap, “This ain’t no Roc-A-Fella, we’re singing a cappella.”
Virginia Commonwealth University performed next, bringing out two MCs with microphones. VCU was the first team to use the strobe lights in the middle of the routine as opposed to just the beginning.
After Carnegie Mellon’s Tanah dance team performed, the winner of the competition was announced.
VCU managed to win over the judges and took home the title of first place, as well as bragging rights until the next Bhangra in the Burgh.

AB Comedy and the Alumni Association put on a show for the ages last Thursday with music, laughter, and fun for the whole family — well, at least those over the age of 18. The event, titled “LMAO: Laughter, Music, & Other Stuff with Brian Posehn”, kicked off with a performance from the winning band of Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Battle of the Bands, Julia McGinley. The group started off with a cover of Coldplay’s “Lost” before hitting what seemed to be its strongest piece of the night, a cover of B.o.B’s “Nothin’ on You.” 
Up next was a rather recent addition to the set list, St. Louis-based comedian Jeremy Essig. A graduate of Wake Forest University and recent graduate school dropout, the 32-year-old Essig described himself as over-educated and under-employed. Still, the man has been keeping busy, performing over 200 shows per year and developing a loyal following since he first began performing at open-mic nights during graduate school in early 2000. 
During his act, Essig made fun of his long college stints — he put his master’s degree from the University of Missouri on hold for much of the decade while pursuing a place in the comedy scene. Of his decision to recently drop out of graduate school, where he was studying journalism, he said, “Yeah, journalism and comedy, just find me an industry that’s dying and I’ll jump right in.” 
The comedian also joked about his decision to remain in a college town following graduation, admitting that he lived above fraternity brothers for quite some time. “It got to the point where I was the guy banging on the door telling them to turn that shit down.” And worse, he hurt his arm while doing it. “That’s when you know you’re too old,” he noted. 
Essig turned in a very funny performance while hitting topics that were relevant to the audience of mostly college kids. To hear more about the man who St. Louis Magazine dubs a “comic to watch,” tune in to the Bob and Tom show on XM/Sirius Radio, where he is a regular DJ, or pick up one of his three comedy albums. 
After his performance, Essig introduced the man of the hour, Brian Posehn. Posehn isn’t just known for his stand up comedy, however. He has appeared in a multitude of TV shows and movies, such as The Devil’s Rejects, Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer, and Super High Me.
Currently, Posehn is starring in the television show The Sarah Silverman Program. In the beginning of his act, he told the audience that he would love to hang out with the crowd after the show, but asked members to please not talk to him if they only thought it would help them get Sarah Silverman to sleep with them. He said, “It doesn’t work that way.” 
Before getting into his scripted material, which the new father of a baby girl told us would be filled with jokes about farts and his wang, he warned the crowd to “take off your thinking caps because it’s about to get ****ing stupid in here.” And, of course, he joked about his own appearance, saying, “If I wasn’t paid to be here, security would run me off as a guy who just talked about his penis a lot with a bunch of college students.” 
During Posehn’s act, he did indeed talk about his wiener a lot, but that wasn’t all. He touched on all sorts of subjects that were near and dear to college students, such as farts, babies, marijuana, cats, sex, zombie attacks, and masturbation. 
One of the anecdotes he told of his life in Los Angeles, a city he hates, was about valets. He talked about how his wife farted in their car right before a valet was about to park the car for them, and her excuse was that “he’ll just think it was you.” Posehn agreed wholeheartedly, saying, “I look like I’m made of farts. Like a bunch of farts got together and put on a man costume for a day to become some sort of fart man—or fart elemental, for you Dungeons and Dragons players in the audience.” 
Posehn referred to his appearance constantly throughout the act. While he was willing to call himself several disparaging names, he didn’t, however, want any sympathy from the audience, saying, “I know what I put out to the world. My mirror works.” 
One of the most hilarious parts of his act was when Posehn told the audience about his plan for the upcoming zombie apocalypse. He said he would “take to the streets, with my son in a babybjorn right here [on his chest], holding a samurai sword with a baseball bat attached, and my wife in a babybjorn on my back holding two shotguns.” While that would admittedly be a badass way to attack the zombie horde, he said, due to his poor physical shape, he’d quickly tire out and his brains would be eaten soon afterward. 
Posehn put on a spectacularly hilarious show for everyone who attended. To hear more of Posehn, pick up his recently released sophomore comedy album titled, appropriately, Fart and Weiner Jokes.

The Rocky Horror Show has been known for its risqué content — and none of that was absent from Scotch’n’Soda’s Homecoming weekend performance. With many characters in only their underclothes, a “sweet transvestite,” and sex scenes, the show truly lived up to its reputation. 
Last Friday’s show opened to a packed house, and, as with many of Scotch’n’Soda’s previous shows, this one encouraged audience participation, asking audience members to call back — yell something funny — at any time during the show as long as it didn’t interrupt the actors’ lines. Callbacks are traditional to the performance of Rocky Horror, as is throwing food and other things at the stage during the performance. Scotch’n’Soda, however, requested that the audience avoid throwing food and drink and stick to throwing toilet paper instead.
The plot of Rocky Horror is weak. An innocent couple, Brad and Janet (played by first-year music major Sean Salamon and sophomore biological sciences major Diane Koeller), get caught in the middle of a forest in the dead of the night and decide to approach a nearby castle to find a telephone. This, as most stories go, is a terrible idea. The castle is inhabited by Frank-n-Furter (first-year computer science major Matthew Alsup), a transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania, and his minions, who take Brad and Janet on the ride of their lives.
The lack of a strong plot was made up for by hilarious callbacks from Scotch’n’Soda cast members, who lined the back and sides of McConomy Auditorium. The audience was encouraged to join in with their own callbacks, with suggestions to shout “asshole” and “slut” whenever Brad and Janet were referred to by their full names. Although at times the callbacks were hard to understand because the voices were not in unison, they still added a dynamic angle to the show. Some hilarious instances of callbacks were when questions were shouted in the pauses between the actors’ lines. This made it seem like the actors were answering the questions when they spoke next. (“Who farted?” “I did.” “Describe Justin Bieber!” “A weakling.”)
Audience members also added their own interjections that improved the experience, such as “That’s my roommate!” referring to the actress playing Janet while Janet and Frank-n-Furter acted out a sex scene. 
The audience also jointly participated in many instances. When the show’s famous “Time Warp” number was played, all the audience members got to their feet and started jumping to the left, stepping to the right, and doing pelvic thrusts. And when Brad sang the slow number “Once in a While,” audience members waved their lit-up cell phones in the air — at which a Scotch’n’Soda member yelled, “You were all supposed to switch off your cell phones!” at the end and caused everyone to crack up.
The show boasted some good performances, especially Alsup, who did a terrific job as a transvestite. The music was good, but the voices, unfortunately, didn’t live up to the usual Scotch’n’Soda performances. 
All in all, the performance of Rocky Horror was enjoyable for newcomers and veterans alike.

The weather may be getting colder, but visitors to the Benedum Center can prepare to melt. Originally based on James A. Michener’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book Tales of the South Pacific, the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific is now playing in Pittsburgh. First performed in 1949, the play’s revival proves that the musical is as timeless as ever. As in any great story, the musical seamlessly explores deeper messages amid a background of laughter, light-heartedness, and love, creating one enchanting evening for audience members.
Conducting the largest orchestra of any touring show, Carnegie Mellon alumnus Larry Goldberg directs the sweeping musical numbers, setting the stage for the production. As he begins to conduct, the lights darken and the prologue introduces the audience to the time — World War II — and the place — the South Pacific.
A regiment of the United States Navy has been stationed on an island in order to aid in the war effort against the Japanese. Lieutenant Joseph Cable (played by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Anderson Davis) arrives on the island, following instructions to solicit the help of a French plantation owner, Emile de Becque (played by David Pittsinger), who used to own property on a nearby Japanese-held island. Cable needs de Becque’s knowledge of the island in order to successfully infiltrate it and gain intelligence on Japanese ship movements. 
As Cable attempts to convince de Becque to come with him, two love stories emerge. Navy nurse Nellie Forbush (played by Carmen Cusack) falls in love with Emile de Becque. A small-town girl from Little Rock, Ark., she complements the worldly and somewhat jaded de Becque. Their voices also join together beautifully, particularly highlighted when they sing the duet “Some Enchanted Evening.”
Lieutenant Cable falls in love with a young native islander named Liat (played by Sumie Maeda). His longing for her is illustrated in “Younger than Springtime.” However, for both couples, the war is not the primary obstacle to their relationships. Prejudice and racism are what truly hold the pairs apart. The song “You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught” touches upon the problems of racism in society with pertinent lyrics like, “You’ve got to be taught/To hate and fear/You’ve got to be taught/From year to year.”
During the intermission, audience members could not hold back their adoration for the performance. Audience member Pam Wigely raved that it was “Fabulous! Amazing! A real credit to the Carnegie Mellon alumni.” Wigely grew up with the show, and for her it was “a joy to see it back.” 
Small details are what really suck the audience into the story. In a scene that takes place on Thanksgiving, the nurses wear turkey feathers cut out of Life magazine pages. During a pause in the festivities, Nellie reflects for a moment on what she’s thankful for. For an audience watching the show in the 1940s or the present, the sentiment still strikes a chord.
South Pacific will continue to be relevant because its themes are timeless. In the face of war and social problems, the characters must show resilience and face what is to come. With its sincerity, humor, and depth, South Pacific will make you feel “as high as a kite in July” and ache to journey to the mysterious Bali Ha’i.
South Pacific is part of the PNC Broadway Across America-Pittsburgh 2010/2011 series. To stay updated on the latest events at the Benedum Center, visit www.pgharts.org/events. For more information on the production, visit www.SouthPacificOnTour.com.

Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino first met while attending the Pratt Institute, a private art college in Brooklyn. They gained an online following through MySpace and Facebook, and in 2006 released their debut album, self-titled Matt & Kim. Then they got to work in Vermont in the house where Johnson grew up and recorded Grand, which they released in 2009. Their music video for their single “Lessons Learned,” off Grand, in which the duo strips nude in Time Square, won the Breakthrough Video award at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. 
Take the pop-like, fun, catchy songs from Grand, add a little sugar and spice, clean it up a bit, and you get Matt & Kim’s new album, Sidewalks. For this album, the duo tried something new, working with a producer, namely Ben Allen, who has worked with Animal Collective, Gnarls Barkley, and Christina Aguilera. What resulted was music that is a little different from Matt & Kim’s usual. 
The duo released its first single, “Cameras,” on Aug. 31, a perfect close to summer. Ever present is Johnson’s sass and quip, evidenced by the lyrics that sometimes don’t make sense. What’s missing is the messy, sporadic melodies that were essential to Grand. Instead, there is a presence of Southern hip-hop beats, which make the song more rhythmic and dependable. This sound is not necessarily bad or good, just new, and it’s a new that seems to be — as evidenced by the rest of the album — here to stay.
The three best songs on the album are arguably the first three, although it’s hard to pick favorites when most of the songs are so great. The first track,”Block After Block,” has some of the same qualities as the third track, “Cameras”— a similar beat and the same catchy pump. “AM/FM Sound” is just plain catchy, with its cutesy lyrics and bouncy chorus of “Oh-ey-oh-ey-oh”s. Like any pop song, it’s hard not to sing along, and even harder to get it out of your head. 
“Good for Great” is another track with the same repetitive quality. The song mixes synth with orchestral swells, and Schifino adds her voice, resulting in a great song about experiencing life to the fullest. With lyrics like “Leave good for great” and “So many books that I didn’t read, but there’s so much air I chose to breathe,” it’s hard not to feel inspired. 
Matt & Kim also try their hand at a slower piece in “Northeast,” which uses sleigh bells to emphasize the bittersweet tribute to home and youthful times. The song is a nice surprise amidst the pop and beat-heavy tunes. 
Matt & Kim are usually known for their high-energy, do-it-yourself sound — part messy and part amateur — that appeals to fans. None of those qualities are missing in this new album. Well, not exactly. Instead, Allen stepped in and polished them up, making their music a little more musician-y and a little less gritty punk. The sound is not a bad one, although some fans might disagree, but it leaves the band caught between its old ridiculousness and a new trying-too-hard, borderline-safe production. The pop sounds have mass appeal, and no doubt Matt & Kim will gain many new fans with this album, but if they’re not careful, they’ll lose old ones in the process.

Think about the sound a slab of marble makes when it slaps a stone floor; the thud of a granite rock falling onto concrete; the boom a second after lightning strikes 1,000 feet away. Now think not of the sound, but of the feeling it gives you: the jolt under the breastbone; the tingling in your fingers and toes; the shaking under your ribs, your body resonating to the deep thrum of an impact. The flat crash of marble against stone, the dry crack of granite on concrete, and the slamming of close thunder are not sounds, but vibrations. When they pass away, my molecules will never align in quite the same way again because of their passage. I feel internally changed by them. This is the feel of culture shock.
The feeling of culture shock is not related to the shock I feel when I jerk back upon touching a live wire. Culture shock is not my disorienting realization that I haven’t been threatened by a cloud in a week and that I am the one who needs to learn the language and dress differently. It is my internal experience of massive change: I am changing in how I see the world. To me, culture shock is the sneaking suspicion that I will never be the same because of what I now know. The sound of thunder is not it rolling around me, but rolling through me.
Hospice for a budgie
I was happily ensconced in my first day after the end of classes, 30 hours before I left Doha, watching a Supernatural marathon, when I got a phone call from a friend: “I need your advice. I found a bird on the grass, and I think its wing is broken, and I was wondering what you thought we should do.” By the word “grass” I was out the door of my room, shuffling my shoes off my shoe-rack and across the white tile floor, throwing together a bird rescue kit, cell phone pressed to my shoulder. I collected a terrycloth, an apron, the birds’ nest I had found on the lawn during finals, and my wallet, keys, and cell phone. I found the cluster of Carnegie Mellon women in the lee of our building, crouching around a cardboard box.
They were trying feed to cooked rice to a fluffy white bird with smudges of blue on his crest. I reached into his box, having checked him superficially for sores or parasites that could make me sick. I checked his eyes and vents and feet, cradling him loosely. When a sudden gust of wind ripped over us, he straightened his whole tiny body in my palm, leaned into the wind, and flapped up. We froze, watched him, and scrambled up as a group. I shucked my floppy shoes and bolted barefoot over the pink sandstone courtyard.
He swerved like a white paper airplane, larger in flight than on the ground. He tried to land on a palm tree in a rose bed, bounced off, and landed in the bushes. I waded in, my diaphanous mid-length skirt clenched in a fist. I saw his white body dangling from two toes on the bottom branch of a thorn bush.
Because we are Carnegie Mellon women, once we got the now safely boxed bird into the Carnegie Mellon-Qatar building, we found a computer to do research. He was a white budgie; his blue highlights probably came from the dyes traders use to turn drab parrots colorful in the souq here. We had a decision to make: We knew that most rescued birds will die. My job, as a person who could do so, was to give it a place where it could die in peace, unpursued by cats and unbaked by the merciless Doha sun. We divvied up the jobs — I would take him for the night; another woman would buy budgie food; another would take him the nest day if he survived.
We decided to name him, to give him a personality to come home to if he made it back from halfway to bird heaven. After some more computer time, we settled on Thanh, which means “color of the sky” in Vietnamese. It has been overcast in Doha this week, the sky a constant smudgy white with streaks of blue. It reminded us of him.
I spent my last night in Doha doing hospice care for a budgie, because in my family, we take care of stray things. I remember a dove my mom and brother and I watched smash into a bank building’s window months after the divorce when we were quite small. No one, in Qatar or the U.S., is willing to take an injured bird; no shelter, no agency. They have no value to anyone in charge. But, even with two of us in tow, Mom found a box for the injured dove and kept it in her room until it died of its injuries. Sitting on my couch, I peeked at Thanh twice an hour, checking his bedding for spilled water or a lack of seeds. I felt connected lines running through me, from my childhood and to the home I was scheduled to leave, return ticket unbought but yearned for. 
Thanh died at about 12:30 a.m. that morning. I waited an hour to be sure, then snuck him outside and buried him under a fragrant flowering bush in the garden between the women’s and men’s dorms. I am never sure where my burial rituals come from, but I wound him in white tissues and brightly-colored sewing thread. RIP Thanh.

For most university students, deadlines are the bane of academic existence. So Jonny Paterson, a graduate student in creative enterprise, expected shock when he gave the lowdown on the newest film festival to hit Carnegie Mellon’s campus.  
“Forty-eight hours,” he announced, spreading his hands over a pile of publicity leaflets. “Students will be given a prompt and 48 hours to create a film.”  
Inspired by independent films made by students in the past, Paterson and five other students created the Doubleshoot film festival to give students the opportunity to create equally inspiring work through a contest. The founding group of Doubleshoot is a production team called Think and Make, which includes graduate business student James Wong as the executive director, creative enterprise student Samantha Decker as the creative director, Hilaree Caldwell as the development director, Neil Lobo as the finance director, and Fei Li as the communications director.  
Paterson especially stressed the accessibility of the contest. “It’s seriously open to everyone,” he said. “You register in teams, and of course one member of that team has to be a CMU student. But really, any major or discipline is welcome to participate. You don’t even need any experience.”  
Teams should be composed of five to 10 members and can register online for a fee. Carnegie Mellon’s diverse student body is ideal for assembling the perfect production team, which should include students interested in directing, writing, acting, and, of course, filming.  
“Some editing experience is handy, of course,” Paterson said, “but people shouldn’t feel like access to all this expensive equipment is necessary. Digital cameras are fine, even iPhones.”  
Once teams register, they will meet at 5 p.m. on Nov. 12 to receive a prompt and rough guidelines. Then, these teams will be turned loose to work movie magic in 48 hours. The films should be roughly three to five minutes long, and they have to be physically turned in at 5 p.m. the following Sunday, Nov. 14.  
However, the festival doesn’t end at the close of 48 hours. A panel composed of “industry experts” in Pittsburgh will judge the entries, and on Nov. 20, all entries will be screened at the Future Tenant Theater in the Cultural District. The public is welcome to see the finished products.  
Paterson explained the contest’s short time period by saying that he and the board were hoping that the act of adding pressure would affect the competing teams. “Certain people work extremely well under pressure, and you want to think that’s gonna inspire people to work off the cuff. [The 48 hour] model works quite well because, if you give people too much time to do this, you won’t get the same kind of creative process that you do under pressure.”
Creative minds under pressure are bound to produce innovative material. Paterson shared what he personally wants to see as a result of the competition: “I would love to see a huge diversity. You’re gonna have these freshmen, seniors, master’s students, all working together, everybody doing something different. When you have groups with so many different talents and interests, that’s where really original ideas are going to come through.” 
The winning entry will receive $100 in cash and Think and Make Productions will cover the cost to submit the top two films to South by Southwest’s 2011 film festival. Whether you plan on entering or attending the screening, don’t miss this unique opportunity to take part in the creative community present at Carnegie Mellon. 
To enter the Doubleshoot 48-Hour Filmfest, register your team online at Think and Make Productions’ site at www.heinz.cmu.edu/student-activities/student-life/student-organizations/thinkmake/index.aspx.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m in a pretty long-term relationship with my boyfriend (six weeks!), but I’m starting to get bored. Do you have any advice on how I can make things more interesting, you know, in bed?
Sincerely,
Newly Bedded
Dear Newly Bedded,
Whoa, this isn’t that kind of advice column. If you want advice about that, you should probably ask your boyfriend. Anyway, if you think your relationship is too boring, you should try doing more fun things with one another than just hanging out in your dorm room with a sock on the door. I cannot stress enough the importance of dating instead of just “hanging out.” Start by going out for dinner every week, and then branch out to more adventurous dates. Check out the art and/or natural history museum for something nearby or the Mattress Factory if you feel like taking your chances on the bus system.
I know this may seem like impossible advice for some kids at Carnegie Mellon to follow (“There’s a world outside my laptop?”), but trust me, you two will be having more fun in no time. Also, as you get to know one another better, you might find yourself less bored overall.   Or it could turn out that he’s just boring.
Hope he’s at least mildly interesting,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I think I’m the funniest one of all my friends, but none of them think my jokes are any good! I’ve started to notice that when I tell a knee-slapper, I’m the only one who’s laughing. How can I be funnier?
Sincerely, **
**The Funny One
Dear Funny One,
Telling jokes isn’t about entertaining an audience; it’s about entertaining yourself! If you’re the only one laughing after you tell a joke, you’re not doing anything wrong. That being said, if you want to be more generally hilarious and appeal to a larger crowd, try learning a variety of established hilarious jokes. Stick with material you copy straight from the pros. Quoting movie lines and comedy sketches never gets old. Ever. 
Also, you should try pointing out flaws in people in a hilarious way. If your friend got a bad haircut, make a joke about it! They know their new ’do is a joke; I assume they own a mirror. Their laugh is guaranteed! Once you have a solid base, you need a joke that becomes your signature, that you tell over and over. I know one about a penguin that never fails, but it’s your job to find your own.
Also, whoopee cushions are hilarious,
Patrick Hoskins

Fish Tank
Thursday, Nov. 11
7:30 10 12:30
Fish Tank is a 2009 British drama which depicts how 15-year-old Mia’s life changes after her mom brings home a new boyfriend. The movie has received solid reviews for its portrayal of a damaged home life that’s all too familiar to some people. Or is Fish Tank about how a group of friends set up a video camera in front of a goldfish tank for two hours and called it a movie? Well, you’ll just have to go and find out for yourself. Fun fact: Katie Jarvis, the actress playing Mia, had no previous acting experience, but was cast after a casting assistant saw her arguing with her boyfriend in a railway station.
TBA
Friday Nov. 12

One of the stickiest Carnegie Mellon traditions is back again this semesters and students couldn’t be happier. If you don’t already know, TBA, short for “To Be Announced,” is when AB shows a pornographic film of its choosing at McConomy in place of a regular non-pornographic film. It’s fun for the whole 18-and-over family. Watching a naughty film with their friends is one of the rites of passage that Carnegie Mellon students must go through at some point during their time here. We’ve all done it, and now it’s your turn to sit down in McConomy and stare at various genitalia for an hour and a half like the rest of us.
Death at a Funeral
Saturday, Nov. 13
8 10 12
This film, not the recent Chris Rock American version, is the original British version where chaos reigns over a family after the death of the patriarch. Specifically, chaos reigns at the funeral of said patriarch, where secrets upon secrets are unearthed by some surprising characters. Of course, hilarity ensues because this is indeed a comedy, and a fairly original one at that. With disaster after disaster continuing to pile up, one can’t possibly think this family will make it to the eulogy. The ensemble British cast may be lost on us Americans, as well as some of the more dry humor, but this is still a superbly silly film you will enjoy.
The Room
Sunday, Nov. 14
7
AB Films partners with AB Lectures to present a special screening of the black comedy The Room along with a Q & A session with the writer, director, and star, Tommy Wiseau, immediately following the movie. Consistently referred to as “the Citizen Kane of bad movies,” The Room follows the life of Johnny, a banker who is desperately in love with his fiancé, Lisa. However, his life takes a turn for the worse as he uncovers horrid truths about those around him and wonders if he can ever trust again. Fun fact: The Room is sold as an interactive experience, so feel free to yell things at the screen and mess around while in the theater.

The department of modern languages announced a new master’s degree in applied second language acquisition. As one of only two graduate degrees offered by the department of modern languages, according to its website, the master’s in applied second language acquisition (MA in applied SLA) “draws on strengths of the department of modern languages at Carnegie Mellon.”
The year-long program is oriented towards preparing students for careers teaching second languages. According to the website, the program is aimed towards both U.S. and international students and highlights “second-language acquisition, cultural studies, pedagogy, and technology-enhanced learning.” The MA in applied SLA is a professionally oriented degree, which will allow graduates to pursue employment at the secondary or university level. Candidates should intend to teach one of the five languages that the program offers: English as a second language, French, German, Chinese, or Japanese. 
According to Christopher Jones, the director of the MA in applied SLA program, Carnegie Mellon’s program distinguishes itself by requiring “greater language proficiency at the beginning of our degree than the MAT [master’s of art in teaching] programs and certifying bodies require at the end.” 
The curriculum emphasizes strength in language. The program of study shown on the modern languages website states that students whose language skills are not up to par are expected to take a summer immersion semester prior to the initial fall semester. Candidates who intend to teach in a second language are required to take an oral proficiency interview during the application process.
One goal of the new program is to stress, according to the website, “content courses” rather than the courses required for teaching certification, which tend to burden master’s of art in teaching programs.
“Perhaps its differentiating characteristic,” Jones claimed, “is the amount of mentoring students will receive.” Mentorship begins the first semester of the program and continues into the second semester. In the second semester, the students are placed with a regular faculty member, and they work in a course led by that faculty member. Students are also required to participate in classroom exercises. This includes observation of experienced teachers, short interventions in classroom instruction and primary responsibility for the planning and delivery of an extended period of undergraduate instruction. Since only five to 10 students are expected to be admitted to the MA in SLA program annually, these mentoring experiences are possible. 
This, in essence, is the goal of the program. “It is hoped that the students will establish a reputation for linguistic and content excellence,” Jones said, “rather than the more common record of completion of formal requirement courses associated with the certification process.” 
Carnegie Mellon seems to be the place to make that happen. Richie Stuver, a first-year in H&SS who is currently studying Japanese, said, “The modern languages program delves deeper than other supplemental language instruction by providing a means of exploring language through access and understanding of culture.” 
The program was developed, in part, to include the strength of the faculty within the department of modern languages who specialize in areas not included in the Ph.D. program. 
Specialties incorporated into the MA of applied SLA include cultural studies, language pedagogy, and technology-enhanced learning. “Based on the technological resources available at Carnegie Mellon, we should be well equipped to produce teachers who are innovative and progressive in the classroom,” said Andrea Pickel, a first-year in the Carnegie Institute of Technology who is also studying Chinese.
At this point, the success of the program remains to be seen. The first class of master’s in applied second language acquisition students will arrive in the fall of 2011. However, if the hopes of the department are anything to go on, the candidates will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of the classroom.

Carnegie Mellon held a reception in Tartans Pavilion to honor Kenneth B. Dunn, who will be stepping down as dean of the Tepper School of Business at the end of the semester.  This decision has not been an easy one for Dunn, as he has held a series of meetings at the business school to personally share with faculty, students, and staff the reasoning behind his decision and his insights on the future of the school.
“It’s been an honor to be dean of this special school within this special university,” Dunn said. “It’s an honor to be a dean of any great business school, but this one is very, very special.”
In addition to Dunn, Provost Mark Kamlet, President Jared Cohon, Pamela Dunn, Professor of Finance Chester Spatt, and David Tepper also spoke at the event, commending Dunn’s hard work and resulting successes while at the school.
“Ken has not only been an outstanding dean of the Tepper School, but I would go so far as to say he has been a seminal dean,” Kamlet said.  “Dean Ken Dunn brought to the Tepper School a unique combination of having been a very successful academic — important for being able to lead the faculty; having a very good sense of Carnegie Mellon, which is where he spent his academic career — important for being an effective manager and leader within Carnegie Mellon, and a career with great success in the world of finance and the private sector — important for knowing the real needs of business, and bringing that to the curricula of the school.” 
Cohon agreed, commenting that Dunn “has been a successful dean by any measure,” and further stating that “the school has improved every way possible.”
Dunn first joined the Carnegie Mellon community as a professor of financial economics in 1979. “The strength of Ken’s vision can also be appreciated for his academic work,” Spatt said. “A core aspect of this was his work was mortgages, and Ken was thinking about mortgages more than three decades before the financial crisis.” Cohon pointed out, “One of the things that’s important for a dean is to hold the respect of the faculty.… Ken started his career as a faculty member, so he came here with that respect.”
In 1987, Dunn went into the private sector to work at the investment firm Miller, Anderson & Sherrerd, which became Morgan Stanley after its aquisition in 1996. In 2002, Dunn retired as managing director at Morgan Stanley to return to Carnegie Mellon as dean of the Tepper School, then called the Graduate School of Industrial Administration.  
“It’s been the hardest job I’ve ever had, but it’s also been the best and most rewarding job I’ve ever had, and I wonder If it could’ve been the best and most rewarding if it wasn’t the hardest,” Dunn said. “It was that challenge that made it really great to be here.”
“When we talked to Ken about him coming back, he needed no convincing,” said Cohon. “He basically said ‘I’m coming back to raise money for GSIA,’ and raise money he did.”   
Dunn is probably most well known for facilitating the $55 million naming gift from Tepper, the largest gift in the history of Carnegie Mellon. However, students and faculty remember Dunn for much more than his help in securing the financial gift. His success as dean can also be seen in a series of statistics recently released in a university press release- the number of endowed professorships held by Tepper School faculty increased by more than 40 percent and the school’s admission test scores have seen significant gains, with an increase of 44 points in the average GMAT score since 2001.
“He was really, really an inspiring professor for me.  One of those guys that people sometimes talk about when they talk about a teacher who changed their lives,” said Tepper, who, as an MBA student, had Dunn as a professor. “I describe Ken as more as a Moses…. Moses who has brought us to the promised land…. But Moses’ job is done when he got to the promised land. Ken, you’re not getting off the hook that easy.”
“As Ken’s deanship comes to a conclusion, he remains hard at work on the work of the school so to speak for the possibility of a new physical home for the school,” said Kamlet. “Under his deanship the school achieved a forward momentum upon which a new dean will be able to build.”
Dunn admits it’s an ambitious prospect, particularly after the recent building addition to the Tepper School, but he remains confident.  “I remember people telling me ‘Ken, you look at the world through rose-colored glasses.’  Well, now everyone is wearing the same glasses,” said Dunn. “We have tremendous momentum, and I’m confident that this momentum will continue because we are now wearing the same glasses.”
A search committee is currently in the process of finding a successor to Dunn. Spatt is chairing the committee, which consists of several prominent Tepper faculty. 
After resigning, Dunn and his wife, Pamela, plan to move to New York to be closer to their children, Amy and Brett Dunn. “We’ve rented an apartment on 72nd and Broadway,”  Dunn said. “We’ll be close to Amy and close to Brett … and we’ll be [closer] to our grandson and our granddaughter, who we are expecting in late December.”

Last Friday, Steve Forbes, the chairman and CEO of Forbes Media, came to Carnegie Mellon to provide an analysis of the recent midterm elections. Forbes, who was a Republican presidential candidate in 1996 and 2000, shared his perspective on the elections, the economy, and health care with the Carnegie Mellon community. 
The speech and subsequent Q & A were moderated by Carnegie Mellon president Jared L. Cohon. 
Forbes called the midterm elections more than a change of power. “Not only did the GOP take the House,” he said, “but [they] reduced the Democratic strength to levels not seen since the early 1930s.…It was a reaction, I think, to the overreach of the current administration. More than the overreach, I think we’re at a time when Americans are examining again, ‘What is the role of government in this country?’ ” 
He cited overreach as the distinction between government and “big, obese government.” “The two pieces of legislation on health care and financial reform were disturbing — not just in terms of the size, but in the way the language was deliberately written,” Forbes said. “Vague language gives enormous latitude and power to regulators in Washington, which is one reason why this recovery has been the weakest — in American history — from a severe recession.”
In regards to health care, Forbes said that the American people want more health care, but the demand is not seen as an opportunity. “If people want more cars, Detroit would be very happy to supply them,” Forbes said. “Why is this demand for health care seen as a disaster instead of a growth opportunity?”
Forbes said that the U.S. should have health care systems for low-income people similar to the food programs in the U.S. “Food’s more basic than health. Yet if people have trouble getting food in this country, we don’t have the government taking over the farms.… people can get anything from food stamps to food banks to help out. Why can’t we do the same thing with health care?” He said that there were ways this could be provided at a state level and then applied at the national level. “Productivity, innovation, less cost, and safety nets. We did it with food and we can do it with health care. But the government can’t do it.”
After speaking, Forbes took questions on several topics, including cutting federal spending, the negative campaigning in the midterms, and the trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries. 
Kiron Skinner, organizer of the event and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics, said via e-mail that Forbes “presented his conservative perspective in a highly accessible manner. While not everyone agreed with him, many said his reasoning was coherent and clear.” She added, “These activities enhance the conversation at Carnegie Mellon about politics, culture, markets, and technology — all main components of globalization.”
Speaking after the event, Sanjeev Baidyaroy, a senior history major who describes himself as often more Democratic than not, said, “I think he has the right to brag at this point. It was what I’d expect of Steve Forbes. But I found his comments to be witty and often funny.”
“He’s a very bright and well-informed person with a lot of strong opinions, and I was very pleased that so many students and faculty and people from the community were here,” Cohon said of Forbes afterwards. “It’s just too bad we didn’t have more time for him.”

IndiaEdu is a new Carnegie Mellon student organization that was formed this semester to take innovative steps toward ending educational inequity in India. Its founders aim to supplement the curriculum of underprivileged grade schools in Indian slums with videos of age-appropriate lessons taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty. IndiaEdu’s other main goal is to provide Indian schools with the technology that is necessary for presenting the learning modules. 
According to the website of Teach for India — the Indian equivalent of Teach for America — currently 40 percent of India's population is illiterate, and “more than one in three children who begin primary school will drop out before reaching fifth grade.” 
“Education is how you bring up a generation that shapes the future of a country,” said Abeer Agrawal, a junior electrical and computer engineering major and vice president of IndiaEdu. “Schools in India don’t have enough teachers and don’t have enough money to teach people properly, so we hope to just make some small contribution and help a few people.”
The Carnegie Mellon students in IndiaEdu have chosen to help two particular grade schools in Malad, Mumbai: Umedbhai Patel English School and Divine Child High School. According to [SLANT12]www.indiaedu.tk[SLANT12], the Umedbhai Patel English School hosts approximately 500 students in kindergarten through 10th grade in four classrooms. While the schools cannot currently afford computers with Internet access, IndiaEdu is taking steps to provide them with such amenities. “We want to take care of their IT requirements. They don’t have enough computers. They have no Internet,” said IndiaEdu President Dhruv Swaroop, a junior in mechanical engineering. 
Physics professor Kunal Ghosh advises the budding student organization. Ghosh is the faculty advisor to many organizations, but he said he has had a lot of involvement with IndiaEdu because it is so new. “I’m their cheerleader,” Ghosh said. “Ten years down the road they will know that they tried to improve the lives of others. This will be remembered as a worthwhile experience at CMU.”
To date, the IndiaEdu students have recorded one presentation on the characteristics of light, intended for middle school-aged students and given by Carnegie Mellon professor of physics Leonard Kisslinger. The organization hopes to spur increased participation so that faculty from across campus can share their passions with the students in India and throughout the world.  
“Some kids in remote India will remember this. These strangers wanted to help them. That will be transformative for them, also,” Ghosh said.
Before learning modules recorded on campus can reach students in India and elsewhere, however, Swaroop explained there are several intermediate steps that must be taken. In addition to the basic video editing process, subtitles and captions must be added to each of the videos. “Once we get the content up, anyone can view it because it’s all electronic. I hope that by the time I graduate, enough people would have heard about it, in India and elsewhere, that we would have a system working where professors can record videos for us and they go online instantaneously,” Swaroop said. 
Despite challenges with technology that they will undoubtedly face, Ghosh believes that the IndiaEdu students’ efforts will be worthwhile. “No matter how busy we are, student or faculty, we must find a little niche in life to serve unselfishly, even complete strangers.... We have been blessed to have been given an opportunity to serve our world.” 
Abeer Agrawal is a junior staffwriter for The Tartan.

Engineers receive grant to assist injured soldiers
Carnegie Mellon’s Bone Tissue Engineering Center director Jeffrey O. Hollinger and professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewski have received a $2.9 million, three-year grant from the Department of Defense. 
The grant was given for the pair’s recent research into helping the injured, specifically wounded soldiers. Hollinger and Matyjaszewski’s research explores the prevention of bone nodules, which form at the site of amputations and make it difficult for affected individuals to wear prosthetic limbs. 
When a limb is amputated, regardless of whether it is done by a doctor through surgery or through more violent means such as an explosion, bone can sometimes form within the soft tissue of the injury. 
“This grant will help us prevent heterotopic ossification at the amputation stumps of military troops wounded in combat. Our work is critical as amputations increase with the current surge in Afghanistan,” Hollinger said in a university press release.  
According to U.S. Army reports, amputations among wounded soldiers increased more than 60 percent, from 47 in 2009 to 77 through Sept. 23 of this year. The main cause of U.S. soldier amputations is injury from contact with improvised explosive devices that are planted on the ground or along roads in combat areas.
Schnitzer develops clean, affordable energy in Haiti
A second-year Ph.D. student in Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy, Daniel Schnitzer, was recently recognized for his attempts to bring clean and affordable energy to post-earthquake Haiti. Schnitzer is the co-founder and executive director of EarthSpark International, which was recently recognized for its efforts by former President Bill Clinton’s Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). The CGI empowers global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to some of the world’s largest issues. 
“We are working with local partners and the Haitian government to build electricity access from the bottom up, starting with direct sale of solar lamps and energy-efficient stoves to communities in rural Haiti by establishing clean energy stores,” Schnitzer said in a university press release. “There is acute energy poverty throughout the country, and that problem was only magnified by the January 2010 earthquake.” 
EarthSpark International www.earthsparkinternational.org, has been operating a store in the town of Les Anglais since 2008, providing the citizens of Les Anglais, which has a population of 25,000, with affordable and clean energy through partner organizations.

“Almost Something from Nothing”: Richard D. McCullough
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Richard D. McCullough, the vice president for research at Carnegie Mellon and the Thomas Lord professor of chemistry, will speak of his journey from a community college to a postdoctoral degree from Columbia and the decisions that shaped his career. Most recently, in July 2007, Carnegie Mellon appointed McCullough as the vice president for research, where he will encourage interdisciplinary and cross-college research as well as technological growth. Previously, McCullough served as the dean of the Mellon College of Science after roles as a professor of chemistry and the head of the chemistry department in 1998. His education consists of a B.S. from the University of Texas at Dallas and a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University. He was also a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University. 
Besides his position as the vice president of research, McCullough is also a world-renowned expert in printable electronics and the discoverer of regioregular polythiophenes. This discovery helped to create plastic solar cells and plastic transistors.

Identities in Conflict: The Recognition of Migrants, How Exceptional is New York as an Immigrant City?
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing 
(Baker Hall 136A)
Nancy Foner is the Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the Hunter College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and will discuss New York as a key to immigrant histories. She wrote in the lecture abstract that “New York’s remarkable ethnic and racial diversity, its immigrant history, and institutions have combined to make it a receiving city that, in many ways, is like no other in the United States.” 
The lecture will highlight how immigration has affected the social construction of race and ethnicity in New York. Specifically, Foner claims that immigration has changed intergroup relations to a particular “New York way.”

Last Tuesday was Election Day, and across campus, as well as across the nation, individuals were encouraged to utilize their rights as a citizen to vote. Recently there has been a strong push for students to get involved in the process, as the 18- to 25-year-old age range has historically been the category with the lowest numbers heading to the polls. Here are some numbers regarding the results of this year’s elections:
Votes cast for the the position of Pa. governor in the 2010 election: 3,921,978
Votes cast for a Pa. seat in the U.S. Senate in the 2010 election: 3,911,729
Republicans seated in the U.S. Senate: 46
Democrats seated in the U.S. Senate: 52
Independents seated in the U.S. Senate: 2

As Google grew as a company and expanded its products and services, it was inevitable that it would begin targeting businesses and encouraging them to adopt the Internet giant’s application suite, known as Google Apps. For many businesses, this model makes a lot of sense, and the Google Apps platform has seen success. However, Google is not satisfied with just the business world. It wants a piece of (read: all of) the government pie as well. To that effect, Google spoke with the Department of the Interior (DOI) about replacing its 13 separate e-mail and computing platforms with a unified platform — built by Google, of course.
After these conversations, the DOI issued a request for quotation (RFQ) and a supporting document called a Limited Source Justification (LSJ) for e-mail and collaboration services, specifying that Microsoft’s Business Productivity Online Suite-Federal (BPOS-Federal) be the only solution proposed. Normally, this would not be allowed in an RFQ, as it limits possible products. However, the DOI circumvented this restriction by doing market research and proving that, in its opinion, no other product on the market met all of the requirements for the proposal. In such a case, the LSJ describes this process and establishes that the specified source or sources are the only ones that will be considered.
In this case, the LSJ specified only the BPOS-Federal software, and Google took issue with this. According to the lawsuit filed by Google, both the parent company — Google — and its licensed reseller — Onix Networking Corporation (a co-plaintiff on the lawsuit) — filed the appropriate protests concerning the RFQ, as well as a second licensed reseller who does not appear on the lawsuit. In the suit, Google provides a significant amount of background information and accuses the DOI of violating the Competition in Contracting Act in submitting the RFQ with the LSJ. This is the act that normally forces RFQs not to specify a product.
At first, it may seem that Google’s lawsuit is on weak legal ground. After all, according to the lawsuit, the DOI designated the BPOS-Federal software as “the official standard for messaging and collaboration services,” effective July 15. However, the LSJ attests that the source determination was made in accordance with the department’s internal information technology standardization manual. Upon further inspection of the supporting documents, more inconsistencies arise. For example, the DOI requests that the proposed solution complies with the Federal Information Systems Management Act. However, BPOS-Federal does not comply with this requirement — but Google Apps does. In addition, Google attests that it proved that Google Apps meets the requirements for the RFQ. In fact, the DOI stated that Google Apps was not out of the running and would be given a fair shake in the procurement process. Obviously, this was not the case, as the DOI excluded Google Apps during the procurement process by requiring BPOS-Federal software.
It is unclear whether Google Apps is the best solution to the DOI’s request for comment, but that is largely inconsequential in this case. Rather, the important details are that the DOI eliminated Google Apps without proper consideration in the contract, effectively pre-selecting Microsoft’s software suite despite its provable inferiorities to Google’s offering. Such an action is not only illegal, but also bad for the government and for taxpayers. If the DOI is found guilty, it calls into question the selection process for every government contract with a Limited Source Justification.

In Pennsylvania’s Senate race last Tuesday, Republican Pat Toomey defeated Democrat Joe Sestak by a narrow margin — under 100,000 votes. This race was much closer than it first appeared, but it could have been even tighter. 
Sestak’s campaign targeted college voters, typically a reliable demographic for liberal Democrats, at least in attitude. They are less so in turnout, as Tuesday’s election showed. This important voting bloc could have made a difference in the Pennsylvania Senate race, but they didn’t. This apathy is disappointing and dangerous. If candidates feel that college students are not a worthwhile demographic to target, they will focus on the interests of other groups.
When the votes were counted, Toomey beat Sestak 51 to 49 percent. Yet among college-age voters — the 18–24 age group — exit polls showed a 60–40 split for Sestak over Toomey. 
In the 2008 election, high turnout of college voters was credited in part for Barack Obama’s victory. This was particularly evident in Pennsylvania’s Centre County, the location of Pennsylvania State University. In 2008, 75,000 votes were cast for president, and Obama won with 55 percent of the vote. In Tuesday’s election, though, only 45,000 votes were cast. Toomey won the county by a margin of 2.5 percent.
There are a few possible explanations for this enormous change in electoral results. One is that the population of Centre County dropped precipitously in the two years between elections. This seems unlikely. Also unlikely is that the county demographics went through a major change. The most reasonable explanation is that fewer Democrats turned out this year than in 2008, particularly compared to the Republican turnout. And given that about 40,000 Penn State students are residents of Centre County, we think it is clear that low college voter turnout led to Centre’s swing to the right. 
With Pennsylvania’s large college student population, this group could have had a persuasive voice in public debate and in the election. Instead, it merely reinforced the unfortunate stereotype that college students are apathetic about their government.

In a mass e-mail, University Registrar John Papinchak announced last Tuesday that fall classes for next academic year will begin on Aug. 29, 2011, one week before Labor Day.
We would think that such a decision would be entirely reasonable and wholly unremarkable: The Monday before Labor Day is, as Papinchak wrote, the university’s “traditional start date.” However, last week’s announcement was only made after an extended period of feedback-gathering. The university’s original proposal for the 2011–12 academic calendar, circulated last May, had set the beginning of fall classes a week earlier, on Aug. 22, 2011, and was expected to have been approved in June. Since then, the schedule has been discussed by groups all across campus, ranging from student government assemblies to the Faculty Senate and the Associate Deans’ Council. And even though the university’s official start date has finally been set for next year, Papinchak indicated that another committee will be convened to further consider calendar “options” before any start date for the following two years is ratified.
Though we are not sure what other options the Carnegie Mellon administration has in mind, we do know that this decision should not require extensive committee discussion.
We realize that a later start to classes in August leads to a later end to final exams in December, in some years causing the final exams to stretch perilously close to year-end holidays. But we also know that the Gregorian calendar — the method most of the world has settled on for reckoning dates — is consistent. Since Labor Day is always the first Monday in September, that means that Carnegie Mellon’s usual start date will always fall between Aug. 25 and Aug. 31, and the last day of fall classes will normally fall between Dec. 5 and Dec. 11. If it is not desirable to have classes in session as late as Dec. 11, the fall start and end dates can simply be moved up a week in the appropriate years — as was in fact done in 2009 and 1998, the last two times a Dec. 11 schedule would have occurred. Indeed, with only seven standard start dates and seven standard end dates, Carnegie Mellon must only ever develop seven standard academic calendars. Determining the fall class schedule for any given year should be as simple as asking someone in Enrollment Services to pull out and reprint the appropriate version. Classes in 2005 began on Monday, Aug. 29, as will classes in 2011, and as should classes in 2016. The schedule that was advanced by one week in 1998 and 2009 can already be confirmed for use again in 2015.
While we appreciate the campus reaching out to students for feedback, we think that this issue has become more contentious than it needs to be. In the case of the academic calendar, a formulaic approach is the best choice.

I 
I 
I 
I 
I <3 Hamas.
Universities have historically been hotbeds for political activism and breeding grounds for spirited protests and demonstrations. Not so much at Carnegie Mellon University. Like almost every other Carnegie Mellon student, I have, many times, been lulled into a world comprised solely of homework, tests, and deadlines, with little or no interjection of passionate college students actively engaging me in their fight for or against some issue. I was rudely awakened from this apathetic, dream-like state after reading an advertisement for an event titled “I <3 Hamas, and Other Things I’m Afraid to Tell You,” hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine and the University of Pittsburgh on Sunday, Oct. 24.
The premise of the show was apparently to showcase the experience of a Palestinian-American woman, Jennifer Jajeh. Instead, what could have been an interesting story of a unique experience was given a title that should be offensive to the entire University of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh community, “I <3 Hamas.”
How could the University of Pittsburgh fund a program that proclaims its love for an internationally recognized terrorist organization? I had to see it for myself. “I <3 Hamas” by any other name would have smelled a little sweeter. In addition to the proposed one-woman show, “I <3 Hamas” became a setting where it was perfectly acceptable to demonize and delegitimize the State of Israel while supporting a known terrorist organization.
To add to the shock of my sudden reawakening to the world of protests, propaganda, and solidarity, I was informed that The Pitt News had refused to print the included statements by StandWithUS Emerson Fellow Samantha Vinokor, which detail the opinions and feelings of those students more inclined to democracy, human rights, and coexistence:
“Hamas is a terrorist organization that currently controls the Gaza Strip. After Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, Hamas began to use the territory as a launching pad to send rockets into Israel, with over 8,000 rockets falling in range of Israeli cities.... Hamas terrorists have been documented using Palestinian children as human shields to guard militants.... Hamas is currently holding captive an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit, who was abducted on June 25, 2006, and [Hamas] has violated international law and the Geneva Convention by refusing to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Shalit.
“The Hamas Charter, which is the governing doctrine of the group, uses as a source The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an anti-Semitic document also quoted by Adolf Hitler. It calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, a democratic nation and one of America’s strongest and closest allies. It calls for jihad, or martyrdom of its adherents. It is an anti-Semitic document, and says that the Day of Judgment will not come until the Muslims fight and kill the Jews. Jennifer Jajeh, the performer of this play, advocates on her blog for a ‘one-state solution.’ She falsely accuses Israel of being a colonizing nation and of occupation and ethnic cleansing. She also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against the State of Israel.
“As you may be able to tell, I don’t <3 Hamas. What I do <3 is the University of Pittsburgh, an institution at which I am proud to be a student. That is why I was so disheartened to find out that the Allocations Committee of the Student Government Board allocated $2,524.42 to this event. Knowing what we do about the group named in the title, this is not something that I feel student money should be going to support.”
By facilitating a program that, by nature of its title, is offensive, and by refusing to print an ad that illustrated why it was offensive to anyone who stands for peace, democracy, and human rights and against terror, martyrdom, and the use of human shields, the University of Pittsburgh and The Pitt News showed an inexcusable bias that should be immediately understood and equalized. I am proud to say that, even in the depths of our apathy here at Carnegie Mellon, we still seem to know right from wrong.

Shellacking: “2. A beating or thrashing, a ‘pasting,’ a defeat. Slang.” So says the Oxford English Dictionary. Yes, it is this slang — this varnish-influenced term — that has brought forth a deluge of press headlines describing President Barack Obama’s performance in the recent midterm elections. 
Of course, Obama was not actually running for any office, but in a speech he blamed himself for the Democrats’ “shellacking” in the recent polls. Of course, though they did maintain their control of the Senate, and the Democrats also have a president who continues to push serious legislation through a fractured Congress, the recent elections have been admitted even by Obama as a decisive defeat.
But what really is this defeat? Maybe it isn’t the seats lost or the shifting of the House from blue to red. As Obama said to 60 Minutes: “I think that, over the course of two years, we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that leadership isn’t just legislation. That it’s a matter of persuading people. And giving them confidence and bringing them together. And setting a tone.” 
So this is his new tone: not just pushing legislation, but actually selling it. Something we should have expected Obama — the known man of words, philosopher president, best-selling author, and famed orator — to be able to do. He should be able to offer confident leadership to back up his legislation. So, in light of his recent embarrassment, now he is going to set a tone.
That tone: shellacking. Obama has applied resin to his speech, a layer so thick the BBC’s News Magazine has run a piece describing what a shellacking actually is. But in his midterm campaigning and his conversations post-“defeat,” he has begun to address the populace that must continue to believe in him. 
Through this most recent trial, regardless of his continued effort to do what is right for the country and for future generations of Americans, he must again compel us to support him, through his actions and through his words.
Patrick Gage Kelley (pkelley@) is a contributing editor for The Tartan. He is not sure if he is a shellacker or a shellackee.

When I first came to Carnegie Mellon, all I wanted to do was make friends while playing a fun sport that would keep me in shape. The men’s Ultimate Frisbee team here has done that for me and so much more. If you’ve never seen or played Ultimate yourself, you are missing out on one of the most electrifying sports around today. Guys on our team push their bodies beyond physical limits on a daily basis. In my opinion, we practice and train harder than most other athletic teams here. 
Did you know that Carnegie Mellon men’s Ultimate is the only team that competes at a Division I level at this university? It’s true. Over my three-plus years playing for this school, I have competed with teams from the Universities of Pittsburgh and Tennessee, Penn State, Ohio State, and countless others. We travel as far away as Georgia for tournaments from September through April. Our rapidly expanding program holds practices year round that everyone on campus is welcome to attend. 
Carnegie Mellon men’s Ultimate, which affectionately goes by the name “Mr. Yuk,” has existed since 1975. Since then, the team has grown substantially, especially in the last decade, during which we have at least doubled in size. We have added a B team to provide ample playing time for students who arrive here still thinking a "hammer" is just something you pound nails with. (Hint: It’s also an overhand throw.)  
If you have recently come to know — before this article, that is — that Carnegie Mellon has an Ultimate team, it was probably due to the fact that we tabled outside Doherty and in the UC and screamed for the campus community in general to “like” a jersey design we submitted on Facebook in order to win free jerseys. While I regret to say we did not win, with the help of the campus community and friends of Mr. Yuk Ultimate we did come in second to win a prize of $250 off a jersey order and half off all shorts we want to order. I would like to thank the Carnegie Mellon community for their part and encourage other organizations to follow similar opportunities when they are available.  
This is not strictly an advertisement for our organization. While I would love for everyone at this school to join our squad, since I’m sure there are a bunch of sick athletes not currently playing, that’s not feasible. I ask instead that you remember that there are plenty of sports at this and other schools outside of the standard varsity realm that are perfect arenas for simply making friends, staying in shape, and providing you with limitless amounts of fun. Try one; you may like what you find.

Captain, Mr. Yuk Ultimate

This year, there were no alumni reunions as a part of the activities for Homecoming. Instead the reunions have been moved to Spring Carnival, and we’re happy that they have been. Alumni — especially recent alumni — don’t typically come back for Homecoming; they come back for Carnival. Carnival is one of the most unique events at Carnegie Mellon and certainly one of the most memorable for its students. In fact, many reunions were already held during Carnival. This switch will help both consolidate the planning efforts of the staff and make for a more cohesive reunion across various generations.
This change, however, leaves the question of what Homecoming at Carnegie Mellon should be. At many other universities, Homecoming centers on a football game. We can all agree that football is not a large part of the culture here, so there seems to be no reason to center our event on it. If last week’s “A Person’s Opinion” is any indication, students most look forward to the chili cook-off of any Homecoming event. 
That said, we believe that Homecoming is an important Carnegie Mellon event and one of the few events that stands out during the fall semester. However, we think Homecoming should cater to our specific school culture and not a more general college standard. 
Some steps have already been taken to make Homecoming reflect Carnegie Mellon’s unique environment. We think the chili cook-off, the Scotch’n’Soda show, and Bhangra in the Burgh are great steps toward developing such a Carnegie Mellon tradition. We are happy to see the university create events that express our unique aspects instead of trying to fit us into a more typical college image. We look forward to seeing how Homecoming changes in the coming years.

This letter is in response to the Nov. 1 editorial titled “Hunt Library lighting changes campus image, needed student feedback.”
Carnegie Mellon architecture students Grace Ding, Fatima Kanchwala, and Arthur Notaro worked with their professor Cindy Limauro to design the new lighting for the exterior of Hunt Library. Like the lighting for the Pausch Bridge, the Hunt lighting uses green, energy-saving, and cost-effective LED technology and will be programmable, with the display changing as desired. In the larger project the students created, the façade lighting costs are covered by savings from greener solutions for interior Hunt lighting. Relighting the interior of Hunt is not yet funded.
The Libraries’ Student Advisory Council was consulted and does support this new initiative. Its members include Aaron Gross, Patrick Kelley, D.J. Schuldt, Jake Flittner, Jarrett Adams, Ben Guterman, Corinne Walters, Erica Spiritos, Arthur Notaro, Sam Faller, and Zach Cohen. I am sure that they would be willing to host any larger-scale student feedback event at which the lighting team could discuss its ideas and demonstrate programming options.
The Libraries’ SAC sponsored a 1,000-cupcake birthday party for Hunt Library last week. Almost 300 students signed and wrote comments to the Hunt family to thank them for the building. The Libraries will be having a thank-you dinner for the Hunts on the evening of Nov. 20 in the Maggie Murph Café. While the cafe will be closed, the building will remain open for Saturday night studiers. Perhaps those students and others will want to join the dinner guests in seeing the Hunt exterior lit for the first time at 7 p.m. A few students have been invited to the dinner, and I’m sure the Hunt family would enjoy having others join in a “hurrah for Hunt” cheer as the lighting comes on.
Please contact one of us, or any member of the Student Advisory Council, if you have further comments about the Hunt lighting project, the Hunt birthday, or other library issues. The Libraries are important to students and are attentive to student feedback.

This week we decided to turn the tables on our readers. So we asked, if you could ask people any question, what would it be?

Your advice is golden, and people should pay attention to everything you do. All this and so much more is true about you. Well, at least until next week, when you don't have a clue about anything.
Skittles are the only candies that taste like a scientific phenomenon. Please do not go out licking things in chemistry labs trying to see what new slogan you can create.
Just knowing their screen name, power level, rank, or which vegetable they just planted in their virtual farm doesn’t make you friends.
If you want to seem hip, tight, with it, swell, down, off the chain, radical, or if you're looking to rock out with your cock out, then all you need to do is never use one of these words or phrases ever again.
If you were one of the Seven Dwarfs, guess which one you would be.
There are many things that are difficult about going to school here. Chewing appropriately should not be one of them.
With all of the layers you will be wearing this winter, make sure to designate one pocket for all of your belongings. There is nothing worse than having your phone ring while trying to find your ID card and holding up the line at Entropy.
Take next week to improve your portfolio in order to make your application for TMZ's summer internship stronger. If you really want to be the best paparazzo you can be, find people on campus doing things that can be entertainingly skewed.
You’re different and ironically cool, so why not create your own reality show? Something like a college version of The Real World mixed with Iron Chef and The Amazing Race. I trust that you’re smart enough to hash out the details.
All will be answered if you just listen. Cut yourself off from anything with a battery or power supply, and just sit and listen. The truth will come.
Others can't, but I sure can. I just wanted to let you know I know. Oh boy, do I know.
In case of a natural disaster, head to Wean. Its fallout-shelter-like qualities will save you from anything, even mile-high snow or nuclear attacks by aliens. It is up to you, however, to stock up on canned food and bring your own surge protector.
