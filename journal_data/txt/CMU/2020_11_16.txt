A COVID-19 vaccine has been found to be 90 percent effective in a clinical trial of 43,538 participants, we learned in an announcement on Monday, Nov. 9. While its true efficacy will be revealed with time, the vaccine brings renewed hope that there could be a successful vaccine to combat COVID-19.
The announcement came from Pfizer and BioNTech, the former being a pharmaceutical company, the latter a biotechnology company focused on cancer immunotherapy development. Half of the participants in the joint study received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, while the other half received placebos. The group that received the COVID-19 vaccine had 90% fewer cases of COVID-19 compared to the group that received placebos.
This news came as a pleasant surprise to the scientific community, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that they "would expect that a COVID-19 vaccine would prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50 percent of people who are vaccinated." This is because of section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which states that the FDA Commissioner can allow unapproved use of medical products in emergency situations when there are no viable alternatives, named the Emergency Use Authority (EUA). EUA is a power that has been especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has also been used to approve of products such as remdesivir, an antiviral shown to be effective against COVID-19, and non-medical face masks earlier this year. 
Pfizer and BioNTech say they expect to be applying for EUA by the third week of November, when they expect at least half of their patients to have completed observation for their second dose of the vaccine. With a 90 percent efficacy rate, this new vaccine certainly meets the threshold to be used under EUA.
However, the vaccine is still fairly new and the last phase of the study is still ongoing, so it is possible that Pfizer and BioNTech may release new data, for better or worse, in the coming weeks. If it is successful, the distribution of the vaccine could be tricky as well, since the vaccine must be stored at cold temperatures, leading hospitals and local governments to frantically buy freezers to store the vaccine.
There is also uncertainty over whether the general public will trust it enough to take it, exacerbated by the presence of anti-vaccination sentiment in the U.S. According to a study released in September by the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of U.S. adults say they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated at this time.
The scientific community might also push back as well, as other companies and research groups are also competing to roll out COVID-19 vaccines. Some argue that the vaccine will perform differently in the real world, arguing that the effectiveness may wane over time and vulnerable populations that were not studied may not be protected.
Despite these lingering questions, the development of this vaccine has invigorated discussion in the scientific community. There is much that is still up in the air, but if the potential issues resolve, it is possible that this vaccine will be an option in hospitals in the future.

What could be conceptualized by Booker’s plot structure of ‘rags to riches,’ Hillbilly Elegy is the life story of J.D. Vance’s climb out of poverty and the abandonment of his hillbilly roots for the stability of upper-class life. His memoir was published in 2016 and has been the subject of acclaim and controversy. The goals of his book are stated in the introduction to display the “family and culture in crisis." The culture being Appalachian, spanning Appalachia, from upper New York to Georgia. This memoir sold many copies and it was published just after the victory of President Trump, who, (it was said at the time), won due to votes from the Appalachians. People grasped at straws to understand how such a seeming impossibility could become a thoroughly unfathomed reality. To Vance’s credit, the book has remained popular even though those who originally sought an answer may have remained unsatiated in that respect, but have come away with something much more valuable.  Even Netflix finally jumped and created an adaptation for 2020. Some Appalachians identify a lot with this book, others believe it is a distasteful portrait and reduction of the region into ‘Hillbillies,’ furthering the already associated image that the rest of America holds. 
Much of Vance’s story is very touching. Throughout his narrative arc, readers were able to see him gradually accept the lackluster and difficult parts of his life attached to his Appalachia. Vance’s relationship with his supportive, pseudo-parents in the form of his sister, Lindsay, and his grandparents saved him and brought him towards writing his memoir. The more difficult parts of his childhood centered around his nuclear family relations. His mother had substance abuse problems that left Vance and his sister continually looking to their grandparents for stability. According to Cumberland Heights Organization, in a report about the Opioid epidemic in Appalachia, overdose mortality rates in people aged 25-44 are 70% higher than in the rest of the United States. The Cumberland Heights Organization consolidated data from a peer-reviewed report about drug abuse in Appalachia titled, “Communicating About Opioids in Appalachia: Challenges, Opportunities and Best Practices,” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). Substance abuse particularly with Opioids were a common occurrence in Appalachia. Appalachian states such as West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio were and are seen as hubs of drugs, instability, and deceivingly pleasant scenery. 
With the help of his grandparents and sister, he was able to pull himself out of dark places and hopelessness. Appalachia is not an inspiring place; the Appalachian way was clear cut for Vance — either get a girl pregnant in his teenage years and/or become addicted to vices. His mother and her downward spiral made Vance question that destiny. Was it preordained or a choice? All around Vance, there were low hanging Hillbilly fruits. His grandparents and their small victories in moving from Kentucky to Ohio and their rise to working-class heroes became Vance’s answer.  Vance worked hard in school, even though he faltered at times. He was accepted into Ohio State University but postponed his studies to serve the United States in the Marines. The Marines provided him with structure, consistent stability, and discipline — all things that his homeland Appalachia was not facilitating, except in interjections with Mamaw and Papaw. He excelled at Ohio State University, even as he balanced working two jobs. After he graduated, he was accepted into Yale Law school. This was the paragon of education and elitism. 
At Yale, Vance struggled to conform in social ways — he still upheld his Appalachian informal style, much to his chagrin at interviews with law firms. After meeting and marrying the woman of his dreams, he dealt with the withdrawals of not only being separated from his Hillbilly culture and the transplanting of himself into elitist America, but also rejecting large parts of his roots. His anger, impulsivity, and scorn at the faintest disregard or disrespect was de rigueur in Appalachia, but civility and decorum were the attributes of success. Yet, he triumphed at Yale and went on to find a lucrative career, a stable marriage, and two dogs. His very own American dream. Owning pets was a subtle proof of excess – having enough to support other beings. His mother, the tragedies and elegies of Appalachia, and his moments of weakness served to propel him. They served as a constant reminder of what he did not want to be, of what he wanted to be better than.
Throughout this memoir, Vance relies on the stereotypes of the people of Appalachia. He remarks on their laziness, roughness, incivility, and their lack of adaptation to the rest of America and its conception of success and modernity. While Vance feels that he has a first-hand perspective of the various States in Appalachia, in which he has lived in and experienced, his overall determination of the culture and its bleak future as well as its character is biased and dangerous. He expresses that his people don't need help from the government; the problem is with them, and it needs to be solved by them. He speaks for a large section of the United States. While this is a memoir and it may be gauche to critique it, he attempts to further this memoir by analyzing and trying to represent and speak for a whole region. He does not have a nuanced argument or conclusion. Not only is his vision distorted by the massive changes in his life, but he also does not give proper historical context when it comes to the history and complexity of this region and truly why it is the way it is. 
This evaluation of his “culture in crisis” places a degree of cynicism in an otherwise touching story about his grapples with adversity. If you grow up amid people who succumb to the worst parts of themselves and their circumstances, perhaps in substance abuse and/or apathy, how does someone build a different life? Vance did not build a mansion out of chewed out and rotted blocks — he found Yale logo-ed Legos. J.D. Vance wants to be commemorated as the ultimate rejection of his Hillbilly fate, the life of poverty and conformity: a nonconformist hope to the masses. While Vance’s story of grit and resilience may be inspiring, its attempt to reinforce the elusive but seemingly accessible American Dream is overshadowed by his inextricable bias in the past and present. It is an oversimplification of Appalachian conditions, and ultimately it reflects his cynicism wrapped in hubris. His memoir raises an ethical question about whether or not authors have an obligation to be objective in telling their tale that includes others. For some proud Appalachians, this could be an extremely offensive book. While complete objectivity may not have been completely possible, searching for the truth and separating biased conclusions born out of self-hating regional identity would have been a better start. The book remains valuable despite it, not because of it.

18 Carnegie Mellon students caught COVID-19 in an off-campus cluster of cases that the administration is calling the “largest cluster identified among students to date.” In an interview with The Tartan, Daryl Weinert, Chief of Staff and Vice President for Strategic Initiatives and campus COVID-19 Coordinator, said that the cluster was centered around two households, and friends associated with those holdholds. Of these 18 positive and probable cases, which were not all symptomatic, one student was exposed to campus. 
Weinert said that the cluster is “a bit worrisome” for the university, but not enough that it warrants a shift away from current university preventative measures. “We had seen a few clusters, but they weren’t anywhere near the size of this one,” he said. “But luckily, a cluster in and of itself, particularly because it was an off-campus cluster, doesn’t really change our approach on campus.” Weinert did mention that this cluster might change the university’s approach to communications, to make sure that people are “well informed about good, healthy practices.”
The cluster didn’t come as a huge surprise to university leadership, who’ve been tracking cases, clusters, and community spread throughout the pandemic, because of the rising number of cases across the county and country. “While I’m very proud of what CMU has done for campus, and I think we’ve done, relatively speaking, quite well, we’re not immune to what’s happening in our surrounding community, or frankly, in the entire country,” Weinert said. 
At social events like Halloween and election night gathering, Weinert said, “I think many people gathered together and maybe weren’t as careful as they should have been. Those things end up manifesting themselves in rising case loads, and that’s what we’re seeing.”  Weinert says that, “we are a victim of what happens in our region, as safe as or structured as we are on campus.” 
Weinert says that at the end of the day, there’s not much that Carnegie Mellon policies can do to combat community spread when it happens off-campus. “The best thing we can do is to continue to urge our community members, be they faculty, staff, or students, [as well as] their extended friends and family networks, to continue vigilance and best practices,” he said. "There’s a lot that we can do as an institution to create a safe environment, but there’s just a lot that’s on individuals to exhibit good behavior.”
So if you were thinking of going to a party this weekend, in short, Weinert says, “don’t.”
“I was a college student once, I get it, [partying] is a fun part of the experience,” Weinert said. While he emphasized that missing out on social interactions can be painful, Weinert urged students to realize that “these next few months are going to be rough” if things continue as they are. “We’ve persevered through 7 or 8 months of this crap, it’s not fun, [but] if we can hang on for a couple more months, there are some hopeful things on the horizon,” Weinert said, mentioning vaccine progress and testing capabilities.
For students that live in off-campus group housing, like the two households that made up the recent cluster, Weinert recommends that social interactions of the whole group should be minimized. “When you do interact with the outside world, make sure you’re wearing a facial covering, stay distant from people, exhibiting all the best practices, because anything you bring back, you have to assume that your housemates are going to get it,” he said, adding, “when you’re living in a home together, it’s really hard to avoid that.”
“As harsh as it seems,” Weinert said, for “any optional, outside of your own household social events, just try and avoid them. I don’t think there’s any way around it.”
Generally, Weinert said that he’s been “really proud of our community” in their persistence against the spread of COVID-19. Weinert is somewhat optimistic that the campus’ continued efforts, alongside other developments, will curb the spread of the virus. “I think we all just have to really hunker down,” Weinert said, asking in a final plea that the campus community "hang on” for the next few months.

At a small workshop in Georgia, an aspiring lawyer named Eli Whitney worked for several months on a new machine. He tweaked and prototyped until he got it to function just the way he wanted. Finally successful, Whitney wrote to his father, “One man and a horse will do more [with this new machine] than fifty men with the old machines.” He had invented the cotton gin. The year was 1794. 
Designer Tim Brown in his TEDGlobal 2009 talk ‘Designers — Think Big’ discusses how the design profession needs to shift away from incremental thinking. He fears that designers nowadays focus on inconsequential improvements, aesthetics, iteration, and trends. Brown even cites himself as an example. Early in his career, he designed new models of a fax machine and an oven, both of which became obsolete soon after. Brown’s argument is that designers need to pay attention to the bigger picture, the kind of design that impacts millions of lives and creates entirely new systems. As someone who is interested in design for good, Brown’s TED Talk immediately lured me in. 
I soon realized that Brown is advocating for disruptive innovation. He believes that it would serve the greater good by creating better products. Disruption today is readily sought after in many fields, including product design and engineering. In the tech industry, for example, disrupters are idolized as geniuses; think of the reverence (or ‘priesthood’ as Brown puts it) bestowed upon founders like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, who revolutionized computing and transportation. Consider the desires of tech investors who constantly hunt for ‘unicorns’, which are startup companies so disruptive that they redefine industries. 
However, I think disruptive innovation has a complex history that contradicts Brown’s argument. And we only need to look through America’s past to uncover it. Beginning in 18th century America, to be called an innovator was not a compliment. Professor of History at Harvard University Jill Lepore argues that innovation in that time meant “novelty for novelty’s sake.” Innovators typically made inventions that either failed to function or served no purpose in society. 
This changed in the 19th century, thanks to industrialization. Railroads, telegraphs, typewriters, steam engines, even photography, all revolutionized life. As a response to these inventions, our understanding of progress adopted a technological undertone for the first time. Improvement in American society correlated with the improvement of its technologies. Prolific inventors, such as Thomas Edison, centered functionality in their work and became successful as a result. A worthwhile 19th-century invention was one that benefited society and moved America into the new age. In his talk, Brown himself says good design must be “desirable.” 
In a sudden reversal, the early 20th century muddled America’s relationship with technological progress. The two World Wars were catastrophes made possible, in part, by technological advances like the tank, the machine gun, the jet fighter, and the nuclear bomb. These disruptive technologies gave society the ability to destroy itself. Consequently, a disillusioned America saw innovation as something that could progress too far. 
The 80s and 90s saw the advent of personal computing and the internet. These technologies restructured American society and made disruptive innovation the norm. America became a society interested in fast-paced electronic change. This blind progress led us to our current predicament, where technology companies like Facebook and Google have accumulated so much data and influence without a clear sense of their social responsibility with it. 
At the Second Continental Congress of 1775, the Founding Fathers met to define the nation’s constitution. Due to a lack of consensus about slavery, they decided to shelve the topic. Professor Lepore contextualizes this decision, recalling that slavery was in a steady decline at that time — many who were present at the Continental Congress believed it could not last for much longer — so the Founding Fathers felt it was not worthwhile to debate it. However, 20 years later, slavery’s decline was suddenly reversed by a single invention: the cotton gin. Whitney’s device radicalized cotton production and enabled plantations to rapidly increase their output. As a result, plantation owners invested in more slave labor, preserving the institution. Slavery thrived and expanded throughout the southern United States for another 70 years, thanks to this one disruptive, new machine. Brown believes that disruptive innovation always leads to societal improvement, yet history shows us that isn’t always the case.

On Nov. 12, President Jahanian, Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, and Provost James Garrett received a letter signed by hundreds of Carnegie Mellon students and student organizations regarding Institute of Politics and Strategy (IPS) Senior Fellow Richard Grenell. In the letter, students reminded Jahanian of his Aug. 20 communication regarding Richard Grenell, in which he stated that Grenell would be held to typical university ethics standards during his appointment. In their Nov. 12 letter, the students amply documented statements and actions by Grenell since his appointment that seemed to challenge or even to violate those standards. In concluding their letter, the students clearly and directly called upon Jahanian to honor his previous statement, and to clarify and defend university ethical and academic standards, asking: “Do you consider these actions and statements to be in concert with our university values and ethics?”
Jahanian’s Nov. 18 response, while thanking students for what he calls their “passion,” seems not to have recognized the reasoning behind their letter. He redirected away from questions about the university and its standards, and away from Carnegie Mellon's publicly stated commitment to defend those standards in this matter. Instead, he responded with an impassioned statement on the freedom of speech, in which he referenced the First Amendment (which, it should be remembered, protects against government infringement on the exercise of religion, public assembly, and the freedom of speech). Carnegie Mellon's own “Code of Business Ethics and Conduct” (“Code”) was mentioned only once, late in Jahanian’s statement, and only in the context of a generic expectation that that code would be upheld, without any consideration of whether specific actions or statements by Grenell might have violated the letter or spirit of that code.
Let’s imagine a different approach to this difficult issue, focused on a single one of the many episodes documented in the students’ Nov. 12 letter (I do not address here, for instance, Grenell’s anti-Chinese statements, which are also worthy of consideration). On Nov. 2, the day before the presidential election, Grenell recirculated over Twitter a photograph of a maskless Joe Biden from a pre-pandemic (Nov. 2019) issue of Vogue magazine—though with caption and date information removed. Grenell offered the photograph as evidence of Biden’s hypocrisy on the issue of mask-wearing and public health. One day before the election, this tweet went out to Grenell’s more than 600,000 followers, and was re-forwarded tens of thousands of times thereafter, including by one talk radio host with several million followers. As voters — including those who had read the deceptive tweet — prepared to go to the polls, Grenell was contacted by multiple correspondents about this error. Initially, he responded not by correcting or admitting his action, but by attacking those who pointed it out. Eventually, he removed the post from his Twitter account, but presumably only once its benefit, in the context of the Nov. 3 election, was realized, and in any case without ever publicly acknowledging his misuse of the photograph in question.
It is patently evident that Grenell’s action constitutes lying. But it was worse than just a lie; it also involved the deliberate falsification and circulation of a document in the public record. As such, this action is egregious, particularly when considered in the context of an academic community that is fundamentally committed to the proper discovery, use, and dissemination of evidence. A situation somewhat like this one is anticipated in the very opening lines of Carnegie Mellon's Code, which expresses an expectation that all members of the university community — whether faculty, staff or students — engage in the “responsible conduct of research,” and prohibits those members from “engaging in research misconduct, including fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in proposing, performing or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.”
Of course, Grenell’s tweets do not qualify as academic research. It is worth noting, though, that the Code uses the term “research” rather than “academic research,” inviting broader application. In general usage, the term “research” refers to a finding of fact for purposes of dissemination, particularly when such findings are produced by someone with specific training that lends their findings weight in the public realm. In Grenell’s case, his background as a former director of national intelligence is certainly relevant. Considered in these terms the Nov. 2 tweet — more than just a lie — also might be considered akin to a research violation, as an expert’s act of “fabrication” or “falsification” in the finding of facts and in their “reporting” in the public realm.
To be clear: I am not making the argument that Grenell should be subject to punitive action under the Code, of the kind that might be called for in the context of the falsification of academic research results. What I am proposing is that a consideration of Grenell’s action in terms of the Code could have provided an opportunity to identify the ways his action may have violated the spirit of the Code and the standards of an academic community. It could have provided an opportunity to reflect on the core ideals of our community, and about the continued importance of evidence, ethics, and truth for the university, even in a time of “post-truth” and “alternative facts” in public discourse. But Jahanian did not take those opportunities to clarify the values and standards of Carnegie Mellon as an academic community. Instead, he delivered a statement to students about the importance of free speech: something of which, I imagine, they were already keenly aware.
I wish that Jahanian’s statement had addressed centrally the Code and Carnegie Mellon’s academic and community standards and values in his Nov. 18 statement. I worry that in failing to stand up for our community’s particular commitment to ethics and truth, those values start to seem like domain-specific concerns — about the proper procedures or methods to follow in footnoting sources or reporting the results of laboratory experiments, rather than all-encompassing concerns about who we are, and who we can or should be, as members of a university community.
I care deeply about free speech, and I am a staunch defender of its importance both at Carnegie Mellon and in society. I agree with, and indeed take as given, much that Jahanian says in his statement about the importance of free speech. But I fear that in his Nov. 18 statement, Jahanian has turned away from students’ very direct and very important queries about the core ethical values of our university, and in so doing has left those values diminished.
