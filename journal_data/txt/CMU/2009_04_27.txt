The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team returned from Atlanta, Ga. yesterday after claiming its first ever University Athletic Association (UAA) team championship hosted by Emory University. The Tartans finished with a two-day total of 626 (305–321), just ahead of the nationally ranked host on the par-71 Royal Lakes Golf and Country Club links. 
In the 22 years of UAA history, only nine Tartans have received first-team honors, with junior Christopher Lee and first-year Michael Cheng claiming the most recent spots.
After two days of competition, Lee won the title of UAA individual champion, posting a score of 145 (73–72). Lee is the third Tartan in four years to win the UAA individual championship. Lee’s performance secured a place on the All-UAA first team.  
Cheng tied for fifth place with a score of 157 (81–76) and senior Joshua Chen tied for 11th place with a score of 160 (78–82). Cheng was also honored, earning a spot on the UAA-second team.  
Two other Tartans contributed to the overall team score as first-year Terrence Einhorn shot 164 (74–90) and senior Alex Timmons finished with a score of 179 (88–89).
The Tartan golfers were not the only members of the team who earned awards this weekend. Head Coach Rich Erdelyi and Assistant Coach Joe Rudman were named the UAA Coaching Staff of the Year.

The women’s tennis team competed at the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships  hosted by Brandeis University this past weekend. The Tartans, ranked third in Division III, blew out Case Western Reserve University 9–0 in the quarterfinals and Washington University in St. Louis 8–1 in the semifinals. However, the Tartans couldn’t keep their dominance going on the final day, as fourth-ranked Emory University pulled off the upset 5–4 to win their 22nd consecutive UAA title.
Against Case Western Reserve, the Tartans came out strong, overpowering the Spartans to a sweep of the doubles matches. The team of sophomore Kelly Hart and first-year Courtney Chin put on an especially strong showing, leading the way with an 8–0 shutout of Case Western Reserve’s Jennifer Clever and Emily Hoffman. In singles, the Tartans dropped only three games total among all six individuals, with Hart, Chin, sophomore Jennifer Chui, and first-year Cze-Ja Tam all shutting out their opponents 6–0, 6–0. The 9–0 victory was the Tartans’ eighth shutout victory of the season.
In the semifinals, the Tartans took on 14th-ranked Wash. U. Hart and Chin once more put up a strong showing, defeating the Bears’ Jaclyn Bild and Elise Sambol 8–2 to blaze the trail for a 2–1 advantage heading into the singles matches. Hart defeated her opponent 6–3, 6–3, before Tam’s 6–2, 6–2 victory and Chui’s 6–4, 7–5 win. First-years Laura Chen and Amanda Wu also posted good matches, with Chen emerging victorious and Wu playing to a tie. The victory put the team’s record at 19–1 and set the stage for Sunday’s matchup with Emory.
The Tartans had defeated Emory at the Indoor National Championships earlier this year, but could not pull off another win this time at finals. While the team of Chui and Wu won their doubles match 8–2, the Eagles’ Zahra Dawson and Lorne McManigle shut out Chin and Hart 8–0 to set up a 2–1 advantage for Emory going into the singles matches. The Tartans put up a good fight in singles, with victories in straight sets from Chen and Chin, but Emory won three singles matches and the championships 5–4.
“Even though we lost to Emory, it was a good experience for NCAAs,” Wu said. “I didn’t play the way I wanted to in singles, but I know we can get them at Nationals.”
The team will play in the NCAA Regionals May 8.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams fought through the stifling heat during the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships held at Gesling Stadium this past weekend. The two-day event ended with Washington University in St. Louis coming away on top in both the men’s and women’s divisions.
The Tartans’ men’s track team finished second overall, but after the first day of events they held the number one position with 80 points. On Saturday, junior James Hulley took first place in the shot put with a distance of 15.62 meters. His distance set a school record and qualified him for the NCAA championships. Senior Chris Fornataro also scored points for the Tartans, finishing fourth in the shot put with a distance of 13.41 meters.
The Tartans continued to control the throwing events, sweeping the hammer throw with first-year Anthony Hernandez winning the event with a distance of 48.75 meters. Fornataro finished second with a 47.89-meter throw, and Hulley took third with a throw of 46.91 meters.
The Tartans also earned points from junior Chris Bridgman after he placed second in the pole vault, clearing a height of 4.44 meters. Senior Ryan Anderson added the final points of the day for the Tartans with a first-place finish in the 3000-meter steeplechase with a time of 9:22.57, setting a Gesling Stadium track record.
The women finished in sixth place overall, but were very competitive both days of the event. The 4x800-meter relay team was the highlight of Saturday’s events, setting a school record with a time of 9:39.82. First-year Luci Laffitte, junior Diane Mattingly, sophomore Laura McKee, and sophomore Courtney Baker ran the Tartans to a second-place finish. Junior Crystal LeePow qualified for the finals of the 400-meter hurdles with a preliminary time of 1:09.06.
While the women’s team did not achieve the results they would have liked, the weekend was still a success. Attending her third UAA championhsips, junior Timi Abimbola said she “enjoy[s] the healthy competition. We compete with these schools twice a year, so it’s fun to watch the other runners grow and improve over time.”
The finals of the UAA championship were held on Sunday, and once again the relays were the highlight of the women’s team. In the last event of the day, the 4x400-meter relay team placed third with a time of 4:04.26, breaking another Carnegie Mellon record. The 4x400 relay team was made up of Baker, LeePow, Laffitte, and Mattingly.
On the men’s side, sophomore Pat O’Brien scored points in the triple and high jumps. O’Brien finished third in the high jump, clearing 1.89 meters, and seventh in the triple jump. While O’Brien did not qualify for the NCAA championships, he was happy with the season.
“It was overall a good season. I fought through some injuries, but I’m happy I was able to come out this weekend and score some points for the glory of Carnegie,” he said after the meet on Sunday.
The Tartans’ next meet is at Allegheny College on Friday, May 8.

As a past varsity soccer player and current club lacrosse member, not to mention a self-declared intramural enthusiast and buggy pusher for Fringe, senior Alyssa Siefert has experienced the gamut of Carnegie Mellon athletics.
Each situation has been a rewarding one for Siefert, particularly because of the opportunities to meet new people and form close personal bonds. Siefert cites these friendships as a great outlet to be social and escape from the academics that tend to dictate the life of a college student, and notes that they will be sure to last by being developed through the love of the game. 
Siefert found that the similarities between playing a varsity and a club sport lie in the diverse groups of athletes brought together under a common goal, with varying levels of independence at each level, since the club lacrosse team does not have a formal head coach. 
Siefert is currently the President of Carnegie Mellon women’s club lacrosse team in her last semester at Carnegie Mellon. She notes the positive atmosphere of support and collaboration that she has found by participating in athletics throughout her college career.
Siefert will be graduating in May with a degree in chemical and biomedical engineering and a minor in professional writing. 
While taking on her academic coursework, Siefert is also a teaching assistant for the biomedical engineering laboratory and is involved in research in determining the biocompatibility of novel biomaterials at the Bone Tissue Engineering Center, not to mention helping to edit one of her professor’s textbook drafts. 
Next year, she will start graduate school at Yale University to attain her Ph.D. in biomedical engineering. Siefert plans to focus on tissue engineering and targeted drug delivery, all the while hoping that the cast of Gossip Girl, one of her favorite television shows, will be shooting in New Haven, Conn. when she is there. 
Before she begins the next step in her academic career, however, Siefert is excited for a sun-filled summer. She will be trekking across Europe with her co-captain on the lacrosse team, Gloria Liu, and enjoying a cruise with her family, taking advantage of the time to travel and visit as many of her friends as possible.
While living life as a Carnegie Mellon student, Siefert has accrued some favorite places in Pittsburgh that she feels everyone should take the chance to experience. Walnut and Ellsworth streets in Shadyside are home some of Siefert’s preferred establishments, such as Kards Unlimited for shopping, Pamela’s for breakfast, Bites and Brews for pizza, and Mercurio’s for gelato.
“Browsing through Williams-Sonoma and determining how to outfit my future dream kitchen is a favorite hobby of mine,” she added. She and her friends are taking the opportunity to partake in potluck dinner parties to practice their own cooking skills.

Vince Lombardi once said, “What you’ve got to have is faith and discipline when you’re not yet a winner.” But the majority of us are already winners.
Enrolled in an outstanding university and on our way to bright and promising futures, many Carnegie Mellon students feel a sense of accomplishment. At the same time, we all have something in common. We always seem to be reaching for more: adding classes to already overloaded schedules, joining every organization that exists, and volunteering in non-existent spare time. 
So is Lombardi talking to us? Well... yes. Anyone can strive for more. Anyone can reach higher. And everyone needs that faith and discipline in order to accomplish these goals.
What is it about goals that has teachers, parents, and the “Coach of the Century” preaching? If one examines interviews and quotes by famous leaders and successful characters in history, one will find that each of them credits determination for achieving goals as the key to success. 
Goal setting not only helps a person reach a target, but also may increase the person’s confidence and self-esteem. A person may also bring a friend into his or her plans, thereby increasing the dedication and reward simultaneously. 
It can be as easy as telling your best friend you would like to run together in the Great Race at the start of the next school year, and some people find that having a set deadline or event to culminate the hard work they put in is very motivating and rewarding. Goals can be very specific (“Drop one minute on my one-mile run time”) or general (“Run at least three times a week”), but one thing is for sure: They work. 
Studies show that there is a definite relationship between setting goals and being successful. So don’t just think about it, make a resolution to accomplish the things on your to-do list, and you may just be one step closer to success.
There are so many ways to set goals for yourself. Some people find that writing them down and displaying them in a location that is commonly seen is very inspiring. Others find that a photo can represent what they would like to accomplish, such as the common poster of a muscular man that can be found in a weightlifter’s room. Many people wear a bracelet or necklace to remind them of their plans for the future, and this tangible object is a constant reminder to stay strong and motivated. Any of these techniques can work for a number of people; the key is finding what works for you.
Whatever you choose, there are some common suggestions that seem to help the majority of goal-setters. Mindtools.com has plenty of advice for people seeking to pinpoint what they would like to accomplish, such as making goals positive, precise, realistic, and rewarding. 
It is also commonly found that by taking small measurements to track progress, one can adjust his or her plans accordingly and work toward goals more efficiently. One example of this is obviously weight loss, which can be measured not only by the number on the scale, but also by looseness of clothing, BMI, blood pressure, or ease of exercise. 
Athletes know goal-setting very well. Swimmers, runners, and cyclists are all examples of athletes who measure their progress numerically. Team players can sometimes sense an increase in skill level or comfort during their sports. No matter how it is done, keeping a journal or mental log of your small successes can be a window into how close you are is to achieving that desired goal. 
Everybody knows that person who comes back in August after summer with a brand new look or more outgoing personality. Chances are that this person decided to make a change and set goals over break. 
We are all growing up, we are all becoming our destinies, and it is all in our own hands. So go for it. If you’ve always drooled over those people at the beach with rock-hard abs, work toward making yourself one of them. If you’ve been dying to play on the lacrosse team ever since you arrived at school, hone your skills over the summer months and impress the team in the fall. 
The harder you work, the greater the results, and setting goals for yourself can turn the seemingly impossible into reality. 
Learn that new sport, or work on those thighs. Either way, you will feel happy and confident once you hear the reactions from your friends after months of not seeing the new you. 
Try it. Your body will thank you later.

Remember The Mighty Ducks, that heartfelt story about a hotshot lawyer forced to coach the worst peewee hockey team in the league for community service, which was then winds up winning the championship?
Carnegie Mellon has its own version of a group that sticks together through thick and thin, in which loyalty triumphs over all obstacles. Ice hockey was the first intercollegiate sport at Carnegie Mellon, with the first game played against Yale University in 1908. The team received its charter from the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Hockey Association in 1971, and has since been a team built on character, perseverance, and passion.
Dedication certainly does not fall short, as sophomore Ryan Ralston said, “From first-year skaters to 15-plus-year veterans, every player has made the commitment to improve the team in any way they can. Strong leaders stepped up to teach rookies what is necessary to win, such as the exemplary effort made by captain [and senior] Chris Faught. I can recall a particular time when he was speaking to a less experienced teammate who was worried that he had not had enough training. Chris responded by saying, ‘Training is nothing. The will is everything. The will to act.’ The team followed suit and clinched a victory in that game.”
Along with the desire to achieve, the team has quite a sense of humor. When asked about victory, sophomore Jimmy Harvey responded, “We won four games because I was flexing in the penalty box and scaring the other team.”
Of course, strategy in hockey is straightforward. The team often jokes about how crazy one needs to be in order to play ice hockey with flying pucks, missing teeth, and ice fights. The sport is typically associated with Canadians and mullets, so sophomore Zach Pierce suggested the Tartans recruit more of the stereotypical hockey players to enhance the team’s spirit and potentially bring a new dimension to the Carnegie Mellon squad.
Despite all the joking around, the Ice Tartans thrive on playing well. They were only one point away from the playoffs this season, and it is only going to get better with the rising stars on the team. So come out next season to cheer on the new and improved version of Coach Bombay’s revered squad, and experience the sport that has nonstop spontaneous, unpredictable action. As first-year Ephraim Hathaway remarked, “Remember what CIT stands for — no, not Carnegie Tech — but Carnegie Mellon Ice Tartans.”

April 15 marked the 62nd anniversary of the most monumental event in baseball, and perhaps all of sports history. It was on that date in 1947 that the Brooklyn Dodgers’ starting lineup included one Jackie Robinson as first baseman. Robinson became the first African-American to play for a Major League team that day, completing his journey that had started two years prior from the Negro Leagues to the Majors.
Robinson’s accomplishment was celebrated all throughout baseball on Wednesday as every player on every team was asked to wear Robinson’s number 42 on their uniform rather than their usual number. Number 42 was retired all throughout baseball in 1997 in honor of the 50th anniversary of Robinson’s feat, although players currently wearing the number were allowed to keep it. The only active player still wearing 42 is the Yankees’ Mariano Rivera.
Robinson’s journey to the big leagues was nowhere near a cakewalk. After a successful college athletic career and a stint in the U.S. military, Robinson was asked to play for the Negro League’s Kansas City Monarchs. His play with the Monarchs sparked interest in a few Major League teams, most importantly the Brooklyn Dodgers, along with their general manager, Branch Rickey. After heavily scouting Robinson, he offered him a contract, and in 1946 spring training, Jackie Robinson became the first black man in Minor League history. Robinson played for the Dodgers’ AAA Minor League team, the Montreal Royals, that year, but encountered much hostility for his color, and at one point the team was forced to cancel a Southern exhibition game stint. Despite it all, Robinson led the league that year in batting average, blazing the trail for his Major League debut.
Jackie’s major league career led the way for the integration of many hotels and restaurants that the Dodgers stayed at that year, allowing Robinson to stay with his teammates in otherwise segregated establishments. Racism faced him everywhere he turned, but Robinson took the challenges with great poise, demonstrating the demeanor Rickey had looked for when he told Robinson that he didn’t want a black player who was afraid to fight back, but one “with guts enough not to fight back.” An example for us all, Robinson did just that.
The first tale I ever heard about Jackie Robinson and the challenges he faced was about a game in Cincinnati in which the abuse from the fans was especially harsh. The Dodgers’ shortstop, Pee Wee Reese, walked across the field to first base and put his arm around Robinson to show his support. The gesture is probably the most well-known story in all of baseball, and showed a selflessness and courage we could all learn from.
The Jackie Robinson tale is one that truly revolutionized not only baseball, but the history of the entire United States. Where we would be now without Jackie is something I’d rather not consider, and the game would not have been the same without the other black players who followed Robinson, including Satchel Paige, Larry Doby, Roy Campanella, Maury Wills, and — later — Rickey Henderson. And you can’t forget that the top two home run hitters of all time — Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds — would never have played were it not for Jackie Robinson. So next time April 15 rolls around, don’t forget to take a moment to honor one of the greatest players and pioneers of all time.

Mellon Institute Auditorium filled up once again this year with people ranging from high school students to college professors in order to hear Edward W. “Rocky” Kolb speak at this year’s Buhl Lecture. The Buhl Lecture, presented this year on April 21, is held annually at Carnegie Mellon to enhance both a scientific and non-scientific audience’s knowledge of recent physics discoveries. 
This was Kolb’s second appearance at the Buhl Lecture. He first gave the Buhl Lecture in 1997, before dark matter was discovered. He was invited back by popular demand and gave a speech called “Mysteries of the Dark Universe.”
In his lecture, he said, “As we began the 21st century, two cosmic mysteries came to existence: dark matter and dark energy.”
He explained that dark matter is whatever is holding the galaxy together and dark energy is the property of empty space that drives galaxies apart. He then talked about the big-bang theory, from which scientists base the beginning of the universe. 
Kolb added humor to the lecture, stating that the big-bang theory is not only an outstanding theory, but it is also a very popular television show. He went on to say that although it was thought to be nothing more than a theory, CBS has just officially validated The Big Bang Theory.
As a cosmologist, Kolb asks a simple question: “What is the universe made of?” The answer, however, is surprisingly complicated. In his lecture, Kolb noted that 95 percent of the universe is missing. He explained that, of the universe as a whole, “all the elements except hydrogen and helium only make up 0.025 percent of total mass energy,” and jokingly said, “thus proving that chemistry is not important.”
He went on to give a background of the history of discoveries about the universe.
“Throughout history, every civilization has had cosmology play a role in society,” Kolb said. In the early Newtonian theory, scientists believed that space and time remained fixed. Newton’s theory was, however, proven to be incorrect when Einstein revolutionized cosmology by discovering that “space and time are relative and can be curved, warped, and bent.” Through Einstein’s modified theory of gravity, cosmology became a science.
Kolb explained that Einstein developed 10 equations for this theory with the “left side equal to curvature and expansion of space and the right side equal to matter and radiation distributed through space.” Kolb emphasized that gravity is related to geometry, and that this forms the basis of Einstein’s theories of cosmology. 
However, Einstein thought that the universe was stabilized and stationary, so he generated the cosmological constant in his equations, which Kolb referred to as a “fudge constant,” because they were adjusted to fit this stationary universe. 
Then along came Edward Hubble, who created the Hubble Space Telescope, which determined that space is actually expanding (contrary to what Einstein believed).
Kolb stated that with such an expanding universe, there has to be more matter holding the universe together than what people can see in stars, and he called it dark matter. Dark matter is difficult to describe because it is essentially nothing. However, Kolb explained, nothing can actually be described as several aspects. “Nothing” matters (it counts toward the expansion of space), “nothing” is something (you cannot remove everything from space because quantum uncertainty cannot be removed), and “nothing” changes (dark matter is changing).
Kolb said that “Every atom in the body made of hydrogen or helium is ultimately made from a star.” An interesting thing he mentioned in his lecture is that “as we look out in space, we’re looking back in time ... the farther out we look, the farther back in time we go, but there is a limit.”
Kolb concluded the lecture by saying, “The universe emerged from a state of high temperature and density 14 billion years ago, and is expanding and cooling, evolving and dynamic ... the universe evolved from a simple, formless fog.”
He wrapped up the lecture by quoting Einstein: “The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.”
David Stone, a junior physics major, was attending the Buhl Lecture for the third year. He said, “I like coming to these lectures because they sometimes present new findings. Although [Kolb] summarized the findings from the past 10 years, I felt like he made it very presentable to the general audience and was very enlightening.”
Kolb is currently the department chair and Arthur Holly Compton Distinguished Service Professor of Astronomy at the University of Chicago. He is also a member of the Enrico Fermi Institute and Kavli Institute of Cosmological Physics, also at the University of Chicago.

Nearly 25,000 Americans suffer from Huntington’s disease, so they cannot control their own actions and are unable to make their own decisions. The statistics for the disease, as reported in an article in The New York Times, also show that nearly 75,000 people carry the mutant gene responsible for the disease and are largely unaware of having the disease until its symptoms start showing up, which is usually around middle age. The symptoms of this genetic disorder are due to the wasting of neurons, or loss of nerve cells, in the brain.
The disease is named after the American physicist George Huntington, who first described it in 1872. Sometimes, the disease is also called Huntington’s chorea because in Greek, the word chorea means “dance,” and dance describes the jerky, involuntary, and uncontrolled movements that characterize the disease. The disease is a neurodegenerative disease in which the cells of the brain and spinal cord are lost. 
These cells have different functions that include controlling movements, making decisions, and processing sensory information.
Huntington’s disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the Huntington gene. In this disorder, the length of the Huntington gene exceeds its normal range. 
The Huntington gene normally consists of a sequence with repeats of multiple units of three bases — CAG. This is a trinucleotide repeat representing the amino acid glutamine. The resultant chain with the repeats is called a polyglutamine or polyQ tract. A chain with more than 36 glutamines results in Huntington’s disease because, in this case, the rate of decay of medium spiny neurons, which are cells in the brain that are responsible for controlling body movements, increases. 
If a person has a faulty gene for this disease, there is a 50 percent chance that their offspring will have the defect as well. But, if the offspring does not inherit the disease, it cannot be passed on to future generations. Children rarely develop the symptoms of the disease. When the symptoms do develop in young people, though, they suffer severely and their symptoms progress very quickly. The disease is classified as juvenile Huntington’s disease in this case.
The initial signs of Huntington’s disease are decreased cognitive abilities and personality changes. People suffering may show signs of depression or get irritated or angry. It may also become hard for them to answer questions and make decisions. They may not remember important information and may become forgetful. The patient is usually unaware of the changes due to the disease and may notice them quite late, often after family and friends become aware of these changes.
The physical signs of this genetic disorder include clumsiness, mild balancing problems, and involuntary facial movements, like grimacing. As the disease progresses, the whole body may exhibit sudden jerky, involuntary movements with severe balancing problems. It becomes very hard for the person to coordinate his or her movements and to shift his or her gaze without moving the head. The suffering person may have slurred speech and swallowing problems. Often, these physical problems are accompanied by dementia.
The severity of the disease in young people can be explained by the fact that their symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson’s disease and include tremors, slow movements, and muscle rigidity. As described on Mayoclinic.com, those who acquire the disease very early in their lifetimes may even have seizures. These symptoms develop slowly over a long period of time. The degree of nerve waste, or nerve cell loss, determines the severity of the symptoms. Usually, the patient succumbs to the disease 10 to 30 years after the first signs show up. But it may progress faster in severe cases.
There is no satisfactory cure to stop or prevent Huntington’s chorea, but some treatments help control the symptoms. Tranquilizers and antipsychotic drugs help in controlling the involuntary movements, any violent outbursts, and possible hallucinations, but these medications may also result in side effects like additional stiffness and rigidity or sedation. Speech and physical therapy may help control the problems of impaired speech and keep muscles flexible and strong, respectively. Occupational therapy may help the suffering person cope with concentration and memory problems.
There is continuous research going on to find a treatment to slow the progress of Huntington’s disease. According to an article on CNN.com, the combination of certain cancer and AIDS drugs has resulted in the halting of Huntington’s disease in a model system of fruit flies. However, these drugs have not been tested on humans yet and it may be a while before a conclusive therapy for this disease is devised.

In the 1800s, events called “nitrous oxide capers” were held during carnivals or medical shows. During these capers, people were given small doses of nitrous oxide and would end up laughing hysterically and, acting in a very amusing manner until the effects of the gas diminished. Although such recreational use of the gas would be termed as substance abuse today, this anecdote, reported in an article on the website of the University of Bristol, showcases the very interesting effects of nitrous oxide, better known as laughing gas. Discovered in 1775 by Joseph Priestly, nitrous oxide soon became popular for its rather entertaining effects on people. Priestly first synthesized the gas by heating ammonium nitrate over iron filings. This produced the gas nitrous peroxide, which, when passed over water, produced nitrous oxide. The uses of the gas remained largely unknown until British chemist Humphrey Davy administered nitrous oxide on himself. Davy realized that apart from the ability to produce involuntary laughter, the gas also had the effect of dulling pain and physiological sensations. He also coined the term “laughing gas” for nitrous oxide after observing the effects it had on people.
The website www.historyhouse.com explains that Davy, who had been a surgical assistant for some time, realized the potentially positive use of nitrous oxide for surgeries. However, it took nearly 40 years after Davy’s first discovery before nitrous oxide could be formally used as an anesthetic in surgeries. Nitrous oxide is used as an anesthetic even today, and is safer than the traditionally used anesthetic, chloroform. Although the gas does have some beneficial uses, it also has many toxic side effects, and overdoses of the gas can be fatal, causing permanent brain and spinal cord damage. Many substance abuse cases of nitrous oxide have resulted in death, which is why many states in the United States have special laws regarding nitrous oxide sale and possession. Considering these interesting properties of the gas, it is hard not to wonder why the gas causes the effects it does. However, the working of the gas is still largely unclear. An article in Nature Medicine suggests that the mechanism of nitrous oxide may be linked to the N-methyld-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain. NMDA receptors are commonly activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate and are also ion channels, the activation of which causes positively charged ions to move across the cell membrane of neurons. NMDA receptors, thus, help in relaying messages across the neurons in the brain. The research presented in Nature Medicine shows that nitrous oxide may be a possible NMDA receptor antagonist, meaning that it inhibits the activity of the receptors. 
This inhibition prevents the formation of ionic currents that NMDA receptor activation normally produces and results in a number of side effects. The neurotoxic effects produced by nitrous oxide are very similar to those produced by other NMDA antagonists, further supporting this theory.
As of now, anesthetics employing nitrous oxide are mixed with less toxic gases like oxygen, or with chemicals that counteract the toxic effects of the gas. Dentists mostly use nitrous oxide as an anesthetic today. 
A study reported by ScienceDaily states that the effects of nitrous oxide as an anesthetic can be boosted by hypnotism. In a study conducted by University College London, subjects under the influence of 25 percent nitrous oxide experience a boost in imaginative capabilities. 
From these results, the researchers concluded that patients would become more relaxed if spoken to in soft voices. Thus, patients would become sedated faster by nitrous oxide if spoken to in soft, hypnotic voices.

Scientists create Rydberg molecule
A Rydberg molecule, named after Johannes Rydberg, is created by a bond between two atoms involving an electron that is a great distance from its nucleus. One of the two atoms in the Rydberg molecule is a Rydberg atom, which means it has one electron in its outermost shell, with which another, normal atom can interact. 
This hypothetical molecule was created for the first time this year, using a super-cooled system to move rubidium atoms closer and closer together.
This was based on the Bose-Einstein condensate. A laser was used to excite the “Rydberg electron” in order to move it to its outermost shell; when a normal rubidium atom and a Rydberg atom moved to a distance of 100 nanometers, a Rydberg molecule was formed. 
The molecule lasted for only 18 microseconds, but opened up a new world of possibilities for quantum physics and atomic theories.

Pollution helps plants absorb CO2 
Recent findings published in the journal Nature indicate that plants are able to absorb carbon dioxide more efficiently from polluted air than from cleaner air. 
Clouds and atmospheric particles scatter the sunlight, enabling plants in the shade to also absorb sunlight and thus allowing photosynthesis to take place more efficiently.
In the study, scientists studied carbon storage by plants in the period from 1960 to 1999 and found that it increased by 10 percent due to the effects of atmospheric pollution.

Researchers create tough spider silk
Silk from spiders is stronger and lighter than ordinary silk, but scientists have now added small amounts of metal to the spider silk, making it three times as strong as what it was before. This new material could be used for making extremely strong textiles to produce such materials as artificial bones and tendons.
The silk was created by adding small amounts of zinc, titanium, or aluminum to the silk, making it more resistant to breakage and damage. The scientists added the metals using a technique called atomic layer deposition.
The research was carried out in Germany and was published in the journal Science.

Scientists convert CO2 to methanol
Researchers from the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology in Singapore have come up with a novel method by which carbon dioxide can be converted to methanol under very mild conditions. 
The reaction is catalyzed by an N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst and makes it possible to create methanol using carbon dioxide from air. Unlike previously used catalysts, the carbene catalyst is not sensitive to oxygen, allowing the reaction to proceed with carbon dioxide from the air.
Scientists hope that this new research will help find ways to create other carbon compounds from the carbon dioxide in air, thus establishing an environmentally friendly mechanism for the formation of carbon compounds.

Scientists develop malaria vaccine
Bioengineers have developed a new vaccine against malaria from parasite–containing extracts derived from mosquitoes. The scientists have been breeding mosquitoes in a sterile environment and allowing them to feed on blood that has been infected by the malaria-causing parasite. The insects are then irradiated and the parasites are extracted from them and used to create the vaccine.
The FDA has approved the newly synthesized vaccine for clinical trials. The Maryland-based firm that has developed the vaccine claims that it is different from already existing vaccines as it is made up of the entire parasite and not just parts of it. Clinical trials for the vaccine are scheduled to begin in May.

Vein grafts help dialysis patients
Researchers have grown the first vein grafts made up entirely of the patients’ cells and believe that these can help kidney dialysis patients. The grafts were made as a part of a long-term study of 10 kidney dialysis patients. The grafts were made by tissue engineering techniques and were grown over a period of six months.
Traditionally, dialysis patients have their blood filtered through a plastic tube, but this has a high rate of failure. Segments of veins from the patient’s body can be used to create a vein graft, but it is usually hard to find suitable segments from the body to do so. Using this new technique, however, vein grafts can be constructed from the cells of the patient and segments of existing veins are not needed.

Swine flu spreads in the Southwest
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that a less common strain of swine flu has been affecting people in the Southwest, but it has not caused any deaths so far. Out of the seven infected, five were from California. Doctors are still unsure of the cause of the flu, as none of the patients had any contact with pigs. These cases are of special concern as the swine flu has caused 61 deaths in Mexico.
The strain of the flu was unusual, as it contained gene segments from North American swine and bird flu strains, segments from human flu strains, and segments from Eurasian swine flu strains. Swine flus are not known to affect humans and, although there have been a few cases since 2005, all affected since then had been in close contact with pigs.

Weight gain in teens harms the heart 
The results of a new study published in the journal Diabetes suggest that adults who gained a lot of weight in their teenage years are more susceptible to heart disease. This is mainly because teens tend to accumulate deep abdominal fat, which increases the risk of heart disease later in life.
Swedish researchers conducted the study on 612 men between the ages of 18 and 24 years. They found out that those patients whose body mass index increased in their teens tended to have more fat around the organs in their abdomen. This abdominal fat has been linked to Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

Crêpes Parisiennes is not a restaurant, nor it is a café or a bistro: It is a crêperie. 
With one crêperie in Shadyside and another one close to Carnegie Mellon on Craig Street, Crêpes Parisiennes serves up crêpes, paninis, espresso, French tea, and pastries to the local community, and Carnegie Mellon students are regular customers at both locations.
But what is not common knowledge is that the start of this crêperie is actually closer to Carnegie Mellon than its Craig Street location. 
David Handler, the co-owner of Crêpes Parisiennes, discovered his love for crêpes soon after he graduated from high school. In the late 1980s, he spent a semester in the American University at Paris, and while he was there, he noticed that crêpes were on menus everywhere, but there was no place that sold crêpes in Pittsburgh. 
Later, after working as a photographer around Europe, including five years in Paris’s fashion industry, Handler moved back to the United States and started Crêpes Parisiennes. In 1998, Handler, along with his wife Shannon Reilly, moved back to Pittsburgh and started to sell crêpes from a cart on Margaret Morrison Street, between Posner Hall and Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. 
Handler bought his first crêpe iron with the support of Reilly, who was his girlfriend then. It was right here at Carnegie Mellon that Handler first started making fresh crêpes from the cart and endured the outdoor Pittsburgh weather through its various moods.
Handler said that “through rain, sleet, snow, I was out there with my umbrella making crêpes. It was like camping every day.” Selling French crêpes seemed to be the right thing to do at that time, and the international community at Carnegie Mellon welcomed Handler’s crêpes. Later, in 2000, Handler was able to expand his business from a camping crêperie to a more permanent settlement. He bought a coffee shop that was going out of business on Filbert Street, right off Walnut Street, in Shadyside.
There, Handler worked hard to modify the coffee shop into a charming crêperie. He was even down on the ground fixing the floor. As the crêperie was being furnished, Handler guarded the crêpe iron in the Shadyside creperie while Reilly left her job as a cancer researcher to camp out at the crêperie cart on Margaret Morrison Street. Later, they closed down the cart and began to work full-time at the Shadyside location.
With the support of the Pittsburgh community, Crêpes Parisiennes opened a new location, the now-familiar haunt on Craig Street, in 2006. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without [Carnegie Mellon]. They recognized that I was doing something. [Carnegie Mellon] faculty, students, and staff supported me and turned my dream into my reality,” Handler said. So, when he was looking for a new location, Handler considered the building on Craig Street due to its proximity to the Carnegie Mellon campus. Crêpes Parisiennes was coming closer to Carnegie Mellon, the place where Handler first started selling his crêpes. At the Craig Street location, Crêpes Parisiennes added paninis and fresh baked goods to its menu, but the star of the show is still the crêpe. 
Crêpes Parisiennes serves a wide variety of crêpes, ranging from savory ones like smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème frâiche ($7.75), to dessert crêpes like the sweet maple syrup crêpe ($4.25). Every crêpe is made from the same batter, consisting of a mix of white and buckwheat flour. Handler uses the American ploy of mixing white and buckwheat flour, a method different from the one used in Paris, where white flour is normally used for savory crêpes and buckwheat flour for sweet ones. 
Because of his love for crêpes, Handler makes sure he uses quality ingredients, and respects the integrity of each ingredient. The white flour is from a Minnesotan family-owned farm that has been growing wheat and milling flour for over 150 years, and the buckwheat flour is from an organic farm in Pennsylvania. At Crêpes Parisiennes, the crêpe batter not only carries a delicious, clean flavor, but also comes with a history.
At the top of the best-seller list of sweet crêpes is the crêpe with Nutella, ($4.75, or  $1 more to add banana). Because of this, it is no surprise that there is an entire wall of Nutella stacked up along the bar at the Shadyside crêperie. Customers can also pick a crêpe with plain chocolate, but this brings up the hard decision of picking between dark French chocolate with 64 percent cacao or Belgian white chocolate. Handler uses chocolate coins directly from the package, as he wants to let the richness of his high-quality, and hard-to-find, ingredients show through. The low heat from the crêpe iron melts the delectable chocolate as the crêpe is made, and there is no added cream or butter to distract the customer’s taste buds from the goodness of the chocolate.
To cut the sweetness of the dessert crêpe, customers can add berries to any of the establishment’s sweet selections for just $1.25, and with summer around the corner, strawberry,the establishment’s blueberry, and apricot preserves ($4.25), are also available as add-ons. Handler imports these gem-colored preserves from Austria and proudly asserts that there is no added corn syrup in any of the fruit preserves, as corn syrup tends to disturb the natural taste and consistency that each fruit bears. 
On the savory side, smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème frâiche is among the top sellers. The smokiness of the blushed Icelandic salmon, as well as its ocean taste, is highlighted by the bark-colored crêpe. Savory crêpes can be paired up with a choice of savory sauce: soytang, béchamel (a white sauce made by adding milk to roux, a mixture of flour and butter), crème frâiche (a sour cream), or garlic olive oil. All the savory crêpes come with a small garden salad along with mandarin oranges and homemade champagne vinaigrette.
Handler personally prefers champagne vinegar to red wine or balsamic vinegar. 
“I like [the salad dressing] a little bit tart, a little bit acidic, and that is good for your digestion too,” he said. The champagne vinegar used at Crêpes Parisiennes, Handler said, is vinegar from the city of Reims, a city in the northeastern Champagne-Ardenne region of France. On the other hand, the term champagne normally refers to the sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France, locally within the Champagne-Ardenne region.
“The champagne vinaigrette came on the first day we opened up in Shadyside,” Handler said. The same vinaigrette is mixed every day, and the touch of sectioned oranges in the salad adds a fresh, sweet flavor to the bitter of the green leaves. This green salad is a little mid-summer garden to be enjoyed all year long.
Reilly adds her touch to the menu, too, with her homemade scones. Reilly, who normally flips crêpes at the Craig Street crêperie, bakes these scones that are meant to be eaten with tea, and as luck will have it, Crêpes Parisiennes imports a special type of tea, Mariage Frères, that is adored by tea lovers.
Mariage Frères is considered by many avid tea drinkers to be the best teahouse in the world, consistently producing high-quality French tea. As told by the Mariage Frères website, the history of Mariage Frères can be traced back to 1660 when King Louis XIV of France and the French India Company commissioned Nicolas Mariage to sign a trading agreement with the Shah of Persia. Since then, the family traded spice, tea, and other colonial goods from the East to Europe. Later, in 1845, the Mariage family set up the Mariage Frères Tea Company, trading as far as China and Sri Lanka. 
At first glance, what is the most noticeable is that the Mariage Frères tea bag is made out of muslin cloth and not paper. This is mainly because paper leaves a distinct papery taste. While other varieties of tea have sharper fragrances and tend to taste more acidic, Mariage Frères tea has a soft, velvety aroma and a true tea flavor. At Crêpes Parisiennes, a cup of French tea will set you back $2.00.
Apart from French tea, Crêpes Parisiennes also brews café au lait, a French espresso with steamed milk and light froth for $2.50. Chocolat chaud, a rich and dark form of hot chocolate, is available for coffee abstainers. Handler proudly announces that their hot chocolate was voted the best in the city. 
“There’s no syrup. We melt chocolate. We put cocoa and melted chocolate and milk and, you know, secret stuff,” he said. 
Because of the proximity of the Craig Street location to the Carnegie Mellon campus, Handler sees a very mixed crowd at his crêperie. “It’s like the UN in here sometimes....” he said. “I appreciate the nationalities.” Here at Crêpes Parisiennes, French food takes on an American twist, plays with Dutch chocolate, and is adorned with Austrian fruit preserves. 
Next time you step into Crêpes Parisiennes to savor a crêpe, take a moment to remember the journey that the meal has been through before it is set down in its final form; warm on your plate.

While warming up, the mood was mellow. The band was jamming as the lights and sound swirled around. Last Thursday in Rangos Hall, the Activities Board and Uplift Promotions partnered with the Arts Greenhouse to sponsor a fundraising concert called “Rebirth.” The Arts Greenhouse is an outreach program run through the Center for the Arts in Society (CAS) at Carnegie Mellon.
Students showed up early and were sent to Skibo Café while waiting for the sound check to be over. At the café, Sean McMillan, a.k.a. DJ YS, a junior social and decision sciences major, was spinning on one turntable. As president of the CMU Turntable Crew, he is quite adept on the Technics — a popular brand of turntables — and although one was malfunctioning, he made do. Amos Levy, a.k.a. DJ Thermos, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, serves as the outreach program coordinator in CAS. He founded the CMU Turntable Crew in 2004 with other another alumnus, John Wang, a.k.a. TSoul. When asked about the legacy he left behind, McMillan is ready to respond. “Amos is a brave dude, one of the few people trying to turn his passion into a profession,” he said.
Back in Rangos, the band Formula 412 fixed some feedback issues, while some b-boys — boys devoted to hip-hop culture — practiced over the heavy bass of the beat. Intelligent lighting was installed above the massive speakers on opposite ends of the stage, and the drummer was quite dexterous on his set. After the sound check was complete, Luqman Abdul-Salaam, the coordinator of the music education program at the Arts Greenhouse, introduced the crowd to Jasiri X, the first special guest of the evening. A Pittsburgh native, Jasiri X had an especially poignant song dedicated to Debra Lee, the CEO of BET Networks. He also noted that the black fist is the “universal symbol for rebellion” and encouraged members of the crowd to “put [your] fist[s] up and beat down hatred.” Luqman came on stage after Jasiri X’s performance and performed the next act. A professional poet, recording artist, spoken-word specialist, and community activist, he leads the semester-long series of supporting workshops on hip-hop at Arts Greenhouse, a program that fosters the creativity of teens from Pittsburgh’s Hill District through music education. Students are allowed open studio time on Saturday afternoon, where they receive free instruction in workshops and classes. Using the pre-production equipment, they make beats and record a compilation CD under the supervision of J. Armstead Brown, professional beatmaker and bandleader of Eviction Notice.
Formula 412, a band native to Pittsburgh, followed, consisting of six members: one DJ, a keyboardist, an electric guitarist and bassist, a drummer, and a vocalist. The band started its show with a go-go-inspired beat, singing “The police see us as targets/that’s why we heartless.” The vocalist had some clever lines, including “We been gents and ladies since the ’80s.” Playing rousing and roaring riffs on the guitar in their first few songs, they all switched instruments on a track called “Loot Crative,” while the vocalist delivered smooth verses and rough refrains. They ripped their set, performing with fervor and intensity.
Next came Queen GodIs, a featured female singer and lyricist from Brooklyn, N.Y. Her clever use of words wowed the crowd when she explained, “I sent Lucifer to Hell because he thought he was the hottest.” She was the only artist who stepped off the stage, performing among the people, creating a personal atmosphere and intimate setting with just the crowd and her microphone. She seemed to have this internal glow, and the audience was attracted to her like a moth to a flame. 
Finally, Invincible took the stage. A female MC from Detroit, this girl exposed the horrible housing conditions and corruption in her city with a visual projection behind her, portraying some impactful images of foreclosed homes, abandoned lots, and bulldozed buildings. She also showed personal footage from a trip to Israel, where refugees had been sequestered to settlements and shacks. She wanted to “show how our struggles are connected,” and “that the people united will never be defeated.” Her rhymes expressed her frustration with the “cookie-cutter condominiums” contractors construct in her community and that if they are not stopped, there will be “nothing left between us and homelessness.” Invincible’s social message did not drown out her natural skills, and on the last song she pulled words from the crowd and freestyled like the famous rapper Supernatural, known for taking random items out of an audience and rhyming about them. Invincible’s message was one of hip-hop and hope, and the title of her last song empowered the crowd, “When You Feel Like Giving Up, Keep Going.”
After Invincible’s set, Queen GodIs emerged from the crowd and the two old friends began an impromptu collaboration with a beat boxer, meshing melodies, emceeing, and mouth-music together in an impressive display of harmony. Afterward, Levy made some final comments. “All the artists gave exceptional performances and I appreciate everyone who came out to support,” he said.
This event brought some amazing socially conscious artists to Pittsburgh. “CMU needs to have a lot more events like this. Advertising for this event alone exposed some people to their first dose of hip-hop. This is an element we are missing, and it creates [a] great social and collaborative atmosphere for students,” Derrick Walker, a senior electrical and computer engineering major and co-founder of Uplift Records, said. Paradise, a hip-hop legend from the controversially Afrocentric and militant group X Clan, spoke about some other elements as well. “All the elements of true hip-hop were here: rapping, DJing, and b-boying. It is refreshing to see so many intelligent, energetic, and beautiful young people of all colors come together for the true purpose of hip-hop: peace, love, unity, and having fun,” he said, quoting verbatim lyrics from DJ Afrika Bambaataa’s song “Peace, Love, Unity, and Having fun.”

Last Tuesday, Wean Commons in the University Center was flooded with people trying to catch a glimpse of traditional Thai dances or grab a bit of Thai food. Carnegie Mellon’s Thai Student Association, which goes by “CMU Siam,” as the acronym “TSA” has already been claimed by the Taiwanese Student Association, gave the Carnegie Mellon community an opportunity to partake in different aspects of Thai culture. The Thai Culture Night and Food Festival helped introduce the campus community to Thai cuisine, crafts, dance, and costumes.
The president of CMU Siam, Prie Wungcharoen, a junior social and decision sciences major, asserted that the main reason the group was having this event was to spread Thai culture. The event featured diverse parts of Thai customs, beginning with a performance of traditional Thai dance. Dance is an integral part of the culture in Thailand and varies according to the region of the country it originated in. 
At the culture night, hired dancers performed dances from all these different regions: northern, north eastern, and southern, as well as a sword dance. The performance was vibrant and entertaining, and it gave the audience a glimpse of Thai tribal culture.
CMU Siam catered Thai food from the popular Thai restaurant Bangkok Balcony, in Squirrel Hill, and perhaps it was the news of this that drew the majority of the crowd. The spread included well-known dishes like Thai green curry — with the option of having it with chicken or vegetables — and pad thai — with a similar option of shrimp or vegetables — along with other mouth-watering choices like stir-fried chicken and basil, tofu penang, and fried chicken with corn. 
Members of CMU Siam had also prepared some of the smaller eats themselves, and they roasted skewered pieces of chicken for the popular chicken satay on the spot. They had also made Thai iced tea and the dessert, a sweet dish called bua loy, which is basically Thai rice balls in coconut milk.  
More often than not, cultural events like these have great turnouts because the organization members themselves form a majority of the crowd. In this case, according to Pavitra Athakitkarnka, a junior biological sciences and modern languages double major, the Thai population at Carnegie Mellon is pretty small, so the crowd was basically non-Thai, as “most of us are serving food!”
Visitors were also given the opportunity to create a piece of traditional Thai craft at a table set up near the food. With clear handouts detailing instructions, and a great spread of craft materials, people were able to make colorful toy fish, called pla ta pien — pla is the Thai word for fish, which symbolizes strength and growth in Thai culture. 
There was also a photo booth set up, in which people could wear traditional Thai costumes and get photos taken. 
“I think people enjoyed [the event]; it was quite a success,” Wungcharoen said. “We really managed to put our name out there.” The event really did seem to catch attention and was able to give the Carnegie Mellon community a very informative and enjoyable, if brief, view of Thailand.

Imagine living in a world defined by politics, where everything you eat, every event you go to, and even your parents’ jobs revolve around the current political state of the world. 
Pretty insane, right?
Saïd Sayrafiezadeh’s debut memoir, When Skateboards Will be Free, is such a tale. Sayrafiezadeh chronicles his life as the son of a couple deeply involved with the Socialist Workers Party, a group dedicated to the publishing of magazines, informing onlookers about what is going on in the world from an extreme leftist standpoint. His father left his mother in order to spread the word about the Party across the country, and then later across the world. 
While for the most part Sayrafiezadeh’s memoirs are loosely interconnected, the reader can’t help but empathize with the narrator as he switches seamlessly from relating how he used to steal things at his mother’s behest as a way of rebelling against capitalism to his current life as a graphic designer for Martha Stewart products. His stories are certainly comedic, and are retold by a narrator who can still channel and sympathize with his younger self without falling prey to its delusions.
For most of the book, though, while new events are being brought to light in Sayrafiezadeh’s life, one gets the sense that everything has been mentioned before. It is possible to argue that one could get almost as equal a scope of the book by reading the first few chapters as by reading it in its entirety. Sayrafiezadeh conveys the feeling early on of a perplexed, somewhat wistful adult looking back on his younger years and wondering what happened. 
Since he was a young child, politics had long been a part of Sayrafiezadeh’s life. His mother and father regularly attended meetings of the Socialist Workers Party, and Sayrafiezadeh would often accompany his mother as she attempted to sell copies of the party magazine, The Militant, to passersby on the busy Pittsburgh streets.
The memoir almost seems to be more of a record of his mother’s life than his own at times, as their lives are so closely intertwined. Having been left by her husband as he journeys around the Middle East to campaign for socialism, Sayrafiezadeh’s mother, Martha Harris, finds herself deserted by her two older children as well as they begin to mature and grow out of her increasingly political lifestyle. With Sayrafiezadeh the only child remaining, she pins her revolutionary hopes on him, toting him along to meetings, forums, and social events with comrades. 
Through the book, Harris begins a slow descent into depression. At first willing herself to be strong after being abandoned by her husband for his politics, she remains married to the man for 30 years, but keeps the telephone off its receiver so that no calls can come through at night, the time when Sayrafiezadeh’s father would call from Iran. Later, Sayrafiezadeh begins to suspect that his mother has been hiding letters addressed to him from his father and saving them in her dresser drawer. His father, meanwhile, on his occasional visits to the United States, addresses Sayrafiezadeh as more of an acquaintance than a son, often trying to get him to subscribe to socialist magazines.
As the years wear on, the fervor that Harris instilled in Sayrafiezadeh begins to die out. Eventually, an adult Sayrafiezadeh finds himself in a conversation with his significant other, Karen, in which he is unable to define what exactly socialism is. This marks a turning point for Sayrafiezadeh, as he then begins to justify his beliefs for himself, breaking from the party line. Harris, however, finds herself more and more removed, both from her husband and, by association, from the Socialist Workers Party. At the suggestion of her therapist, she sends in her letter of resignation, and lapses into depression, overdosing on her medication in an attempt to end her misery.
While the book’s overall tenor may not vary from cover to cover, the experiences highlighted within provide a fresh perspective on the depth to which politics can rule a life. When Skateboards Will be Free is again just as much a story about Sayrafiezadeh as it is about his mother, and the two lives interwoven provide a stark commentary on how politics can influence and shape a life, and how very strange and unfulfilled that life can become.

“Vale, Vale, Vale.” I heard this word countless times every day while studying abroad last summer in Málaga, Spain. It is a word with many meanings including “okay,” “I understand,” and “well,” and is quite possibly the most popular phrase among the Spaniards.
When in Spain, the response to everything is “vale” and life is never stressful. In Málaga, it was commonplace to wake up at 11 a.m. on a weekday and see an apartment building bustling as if people had no jobs to go off to. I would often see the same people every weekday, including the hombre desnudo, or naked man, who would wake up and go out to his balcony to stretch at the same time each day as if he had no cares in the world. To add to the relaxed atmosphere, I watched this apartment building each weekday morning from my Spanish poetry class held in none other than a hotel’s pool house. While in Málaga, this poetry class was my only academic commitment. Five days each week, I, along with five other students and my professor would gather in the pool house and discuss 19th century romantic poetry and how it related to our lives and to society at that time. The class was the opposite of stressful, and I am positive that every student received an A and the full nine units for it. For our final, we convinced our professor to allow us to write an ode to the hombre desnudo we saw in class each day — in perfect poetic form, of course.
Throughout my time in Málaga, I was able to experience life at the southernmost tip of Spain, surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea and only 90 miles from Africa. The sun was stronger than I had ever experienced and a day in the sun without any sun block was like a kiss of death. The strength of the sun prompted shopping streets to be lined with large translucent sheets hung above the building tops to protect pedestrians from the violent rays. The beaches were the areas of the most intense sunlight and also the areas where women felt quite comfortable topless. Topless beaches were the norm on the Southern coast. Never before had I seen women so comfortable running through the sand, swimming, and eating chicken bones, all the while topless — sometimes even a mother with her 12-year-old daughter. As Americans, we were identifiable by our usual habit of wearing full bikinis. This is not to say that we did not try out the norm for one day on our trip — even then, however, we still stood out as Americans who could not stop giggling as we walked toward the sea to go swimming and reflect on our attempt at cultural immersion.
Málaga was not only home to topless beaches, but also to the origins of flamenco dancing, a Spanish tradition made famous by flamenco dresses, mariachi costumes, and castanets — the clappers used by the dancers. Seeing flamenco in Málaga was like being transported into another world where men and women traveled in West Side Story-style clumps, yet danced in the most rhythmic and beautiful ways imaginable. The costumes were equally magnificent and only added to the scene. At the end of the show, the most attractive male dancer of the group shook our hands and we couldn’t have been more excited. He had dark, flowing hair, the body of a dancer, and had been dancing solo for the last 10 minutes of the show.
The looks of the flamenco dancer, however, were nothing compared to the Spanish fútbol, or soccer team, who played in the finals and then won the Eurocup, all while I was staying in Málaga. My hotel was located in Torremolinos, a small province of Málaga. For each game, the people of Torremolinos gathered at a few outdoor restaurants in the town’s central square. It was there in that square that I realized just how much the Spaniards value their fútbol. The game was watched with so much intensity that the waiters and waitresses essentially stopped serving food — only the occasional alcoholic beverage, another favorite of the Spaniards. The wait staff and everyone there were wearing bright red Spanish national jerseys and sitting there without one made it hard not to feel like an outsider. My friends and I learned after the semifinals that to really fit in, we needed to get those jerseys and up our enthusiasm a thousand times over. For the finals, we were prepared — adorned in jerseys, we got to the square early, had horns, and cheered our hearts out. When Spain won the final game against Germany, the crowd erupted. My friends and I joined the festivities in jumping into the town fountain then going out to the local karaoke bar, El Open Arms, and wandering through the streets with the beaming crowd. 
There were many more little things about Spanish culture that took us Americans by surprise. When my girlfriends and I took a trip to see the new summer hit Sexo en Nueva York, or Sex and the City, we learned that movie theaters had assigned seating and that popcorn with butter was a foreign concept — salt was the major preference. Whenever we would ask the wait staff in a restaurant for jugo, or juice, they would not understand — and we soon learned that juice was actually called zumo, a word none of us had ever heard of. The Spaniards were also strangers to virgin alcoholic drinks. When one of my friends asked for a virgin strawberry daiquri, the waiter looked at her in confusion and just said “daiquri?” and brought her the alcoholic form.
Male Spaniards were all very friendly, and when going out at night as an American girl, it was quite easy to find a salsa partner. Their friendliness was sometimes so much that it necessitated interference from friends.
My time in Málaga was the best time of my life. While I miss all the attractive men, the delicious sangria, and the soccer pride, what I miss the most is the atmosphere in Spain and the willingness of the people like the hombre desnudo to live their lives how they please or, as they would say, “Que pasa, pasa.”

Duplicity is an interesting movie combination of Mr. & Mrs. Smith and Ocean’s Eleven. The film, directed by Tony Gilroys, stars Closer co-stars Julia Roberts and Clive Owen, who act as corporate spies working a double life. The film received lukewarm reviews — a 66 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a B from Entertainment Weekly.
Duplicity begins in Dubai at a party at an Embassy where Claire Stenwick (Roberts) seduces Ray Koval (Owen), takes him back to his hotel room, drugs him, steals his Egyptian air defense codes, and leaves without a second thought. When they meet again, five years later, Koval confronts Stenwick about the humiliation from that night and they both reveal that they are former government agents. Koval had enjoyed a 12-year tenure with MI6 as a British government spy, while Stenwick worked as a CIA agent. They’ve both taken similar career paths since then, and are currently working at pharmaceutical companies, Koval at Equikrom and Stenwick at Burkett and Randle.
These two companies are always at each other’s throats, trying to become the first company to launch the next big product. The men running these companies are Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) — who runs Burke and Randle and claims he is on the verge of releasing a revolutionary new creation that has been successfully kept a secret all this time — and Richard Garsik (Paul Giamatti) — who runs Equikrom and is well aware of Tully’s “Project Sampson.”
Meanwhile, in Rome, Koval and Stenwick rekindle their romance and seem to be falling in love with each other. The problem is that they think too much alike and Koval never forgets the night that he was Stenwick’s one-night stand, leading to a large trust issue between the two. Nevertheless, the duo decides to double-cross both their unsuspecting bosses by stealing the secret formula from Burke and Randle and selling it to a Swiss company for $40 million. Then they hope to live luxuriously and retire for the rest of their lives. This scheme, however, is not as easy as they had imagined.
The plot thickens as the stakes rise, the tactics get dirtier, and Koval and Stenwick find themselves having to keep not only one step ahead of their bosses, but also one step ahead of each other. Through a number of twists in the plot — like when other co-workers start to suspect something — and the lack of trust in Koval and Stenwick’s romantic entanglement, the movie rises to its surprising ending when exactly who got played is finally divulged.
The movie is categorized as a romantic comedy spy-thriller. However, because there were so many twists and then counter-twists in the plot, it is difficult to keep up with the storyline. Also, because the timeline jumps from year to year, it is hard to recognize exactly when something is happening.
Roberts and Owen have incredible dialogue when they read each others’ spy minds and question the foundation of their relationship. They also engage in some steamy love scenes that give the movie a James Bond-esque feel. Roberts, at 41, took on a role that she had experienced a little in Ocean’s Twelve, but she was all in all a fantastic match for Owen as they trotted the globe in this espionage cat-and-mouse game.
The movie, though, lacked a solid storyline that would have brought all the characters into place. The problem was that it didn’t capture the audience’s attention for the entire duration. There were some parts when something intriguing and new would come up, but because of the lack of attention from before, it’s hard to understand how this new incident fits into the puzzle. Those who enjoy keeping up with the storyline in order to guess what’s going to ultimately happen are going to have a tough time trying to predict this one.
Overall, Koval and Stenwick do learn an important lesson: No matter what happens, they can’t cheat love.

If you have a passion and you find joy in everything you do, then you would understand The Soloist. 
The movie stars Jamie Foxx playing a homeless man, Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr., who is devoted to playing music. 
Not only was Foxx’s physical character extremely believable, but his mental state was one that only a great actor could capture. He led the audience to believe that his mind was somewhere else, in another world. 
Foxx’s costar, Robert Downey Jr., also played his role as the Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez very well. He started out as a man just looking for a story, but what he found was something much more interesting. 
He saw a life that once was: a person who was capable of achieving great talent and had still held on to it even as the world around him changed. He found a person who could put his love for music above all and compromise it for no one. He accidentally found Nathaniel playing his two-string violin in front of a Beethoven statue. 
The audience soon learns that Nathaniel was once a student at Juilliard for his brilliant musical talent. At this point, the story becomes more interesting. Steve writes his article about Nathaniel, but things don’t just stop there. 
The publication of the piece brings recognition to Nathaniel and people take an interest in his story. An old woman with arthritis who can no longer play her cello donates it to Nathaniel, and the audience finds out that the cello was Nathaniel’s original love. 
From then on, Nathaniel and Steve are constantly together. Steve puts their differences in economic status aside and does something for Nathaniel that no one has done in a long time: he gives him friendship. Throughout the movie, the two build a relationship based on lies. 
Although Nathaniel begins to trust Steve, or Mr. Lopez as he calls him, Steve considers Nathaniel to be a schizophrenic and wants to help him out of his current situation. After Nathaniel realizes that this is how his newfound friend thinks of him, their relationship changes drastically. This twist in the plot seems inevitable, as the story is too good to be true up to this point. 
The audience watches Nathaniel become self-conscious and, through his reflections of his past, they watch how he became what he is today. Steve’s transformation from a journalist to a friend is also clearly depicted.
This movie takes the audiences through the tragedies and triumphs in Nathaniel’s life and displays them from three different perspectives: Steve’s, Nathaniel’s, and an outsider’s. The viewer is given a chance to glance into the mind of a musical genius. 
In the movie, Nathaniel is referred to by a professor at Juilliard as “the most gifted kid” he has ever met, and with this film, viewers get to meet that person and see his transition over the years.
Based on a true story, The Soloist has the power to capture the heart of everyone who watches it, demanding everyone’s attention and bringing audiences to see a perspective other than their own. 
Nathaniel’s wild outfits and crazy style, as well as his distinct personality that stands out throughout the film, remind audience members that they cannot change people and they should accept friends for who they are. It begs the audience to look beyond a person’s appearance and actually consider who a person might be or might have been before his or her current situation. 
The film evokes a lot of thought and reminds all people to look at their own lives and not compare them to the lives of others. While some people may seem to be in a worse situation, they might be happy right where they are. Perhaps that’s what’s best for them.

Dear Joe,
I have been fortunate enough in my time at Carnegie Mellon to room with a fellow toast enthusiast. We both love toast, and split a $200 toaster that makes outrageously great toast. The problem is that we’re both seniors, and moving in separate ways come next fall. So who takes the toaster?
—Toasty in Tech Street
Dear Toasty,
Two words: toast off. Whoever said that competition is bad for friendship is obviously just a loser. The toast off is the only way that there will be no bitter feelings about whoever retains the toaster.
So what exactly is a toast off? Well, to be honest, I don’t know, either, but I’m willing to wing it. Have a toast-making competition. Each competitor takes a half loaf of Wonder bread and some Nutella, peanut butter, and jam. Make some toast, and have an audience judge the winner based off of expertise, taste, timeliness, and precision. The competitor with the most points will be crowned Toastmaster, and won’t even have to give a public speech afterward. Oh yeah, he also gets the toaster.
You may be thinking of more practical solutions, such as paying half for the machine, or even just giving it away. If you like saltine crackers, C-SPAN, and Coldplay, then go right ahead. However, if you have any sense of adventure, than you’ll know that this is an opportunity that you simply cannot miss. And yes, I’ll gladly judge your toast.
Cheers! 
— Joe
Dear Joe,
Every time I look at the calendar, I get a little more nervous about graduating from Carnegie Mellon. Life is good here. I have close friends, fun classes, and lots of memories that I don’t want to leave. How do I get over this?
—Melancholy in Morewood
Dear Melancholy,
Even with my unmatched advice prowess, I don’t have too much to offer in this matter. We all have to move on from here, and while some are clicking their heels over getting out, most of us are a little bit nervous about the future. In terms of what you can do, I have one idea. Try to follow in the footsteps of the mildly funny, geriatric film The Bucket List. So, before you kick the Tartan bucket, make sure you did all those things you wanted to do when you were a freshman. Ride the Pittsburgh funicular, visit the Warhol museum, and eat O fries until you bleed cholesterol.
And your bucket list includes social deeds, too. Make up with that jerk who aggravated you in class all year. Hit on that bartender you’ve had a thing for. If you can get though your to-do list, then you can grab your degree with no regrets.
It’s time for bigger and better things, Melancholy. Besides, do you really think you can survive another year of campus food?
With apologies to Jack Nicholson, 
—Joe

I’m down on one knee. My fingers are knotted in your tricolor cables. It’s dark, save for the flickering of tiny red and green bulbs — your eyes? You have hundreds of them. So lovely.
You’re promiscuous. Talking to thousands, okay, hundreds, okay, tens of others at once. But I don’t care. You always get me there.
I could get stranded inside of you and never leave. If true love is fascination sustained — what we’ve got is true. I could spend every hour of every day cataloging your thousandths, like a microbiologist naming each of his lover’s cells. Single by single, seven inch by seven inch, anthology by anthology; I could parcel out my days in an archivist’s reverie.
Blemishes? I don’t see them. At least, I don’t see them as such. The handmade “Don’t Touch This — No, Really.” signs duct-taped to variegated pieces of equipment? They’re Sharpie-drawn birthmarks — they define, not deface, you.
Although so much of you is metal and circuits and cloudy arc-tangents of pizza grease, you’re still untouchable. This is the key to your allure. I can clutch a microphone, feel the buzz of an amplifier, match my fingerprints to the grooves in the acetate grain, but the magic is in your ceaseless invisible waves. Invisible waves!
You’re stacked. Not that size matters. It’s more like the impression of size. You’re Borges’ infinite library housing trysts straight from  Marquez. Yes, that was me curled on the floor, the import Boredom’s pressing clutched to my chest, blog chatter lipsticked onto my lower belly.
Yes, it’s me, right here, right now, proposing that we marry. Zombo will officiate. We’ll have no shortage of DJs. We can spend long nights together, like two peas in a podcast, and when I’m old and decrepit and you’re old and beta-versioned out of relevance, we’ll Montague and Capulet it, radio-style, needles through ourselves, until we’re spinning, spinning, spinning, 33 and 1/3 times a minute, and a delicious howling unspools into the post-collegiate night.

The Margaret Morrison School is treated to a surprise dance coordinated by the school’s administrators. The event will be held in the school gym. Upon hearing the news, a girl stated that she and her friends “screamed with delight.” The class apparently deserved it, as a teacher claimed, “Let the children enjoy themselves. They do not have much fun.”

According to a Winston ad, “Archimedes makes another great discovery.... it’s what’s up front that counts!” By up front, Winston means the front of the cigarette, which contains tobacco that has been “selected for flavor and mildness.” What isn’t included is “Archimedes’ Principle: Part II.” This law basically states that a cigarette placed in a pitcher of beer roughly displaces the amount of one Cool (or Kool) unit.

In the “A Person’s Opinion” article, the question “What are your plans for the summer?” is asked. Responses range from “interning” to “looking forward to the sunshine, and getting a job at home.” Faced with the fact that for the first time in years, the article looks legitimate, the author decides to ask the clock outside of Doherty Hall. Its response: “I’ll be counting down the seconds until the fall semester!” We can only pray that whoever wrote this was immediately suspended from writing indefinitely.

A study is carried out to see whether students approve of +/- grading. The results showed that 68 percent of students were against the grading, while the other 32 percent said that they were for changing the grade. Unfortunately, the poll did not use the extended system of polling, which includes viewpoints like approving minus and disapproving plus.

Three Pittsburgh mayoral candidates aired their platforms on campus this week at the Mayoral Candidates Forum in McConomy Auditorium. The town hall-style debate between Democratic primary candidates Patrick Dowd and Carmen Robinson, which concluded with remarks from independent challenger Franco “Dok” Harris, took place Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.
Current Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl, who faces Dowd and Robinson in the May 19 primary election, was not in attendance. Debate moderator Vince Sims, of WPXI-TV, announced that Ravenstahl had been invited to the debate, but that his campaign said the mayor had another commitment.
The mayor’s absence was conspicuous at many points during the main portion of the forum, as Dowd and Robinson took turns refuting his policies. In her opening remarks, Robinson criticized Ravenstahl’s announced $1 million surplus, countering that “he doesn’t tell you that we have looming debt due ... that will cut into that by 200 percent.” Dowd, in turn, attacked the mayor with, “What we need is leadership. We do not have it and we need it.”
Speaking in response to a mix of prepared questions from Sims and open questions from the audience collected via notecards, Robinson and Dowd addressed such topics as the city’s population loss, crime rate, public transportation, and proposed merger with Allegheny County.
Robinson, an attorney and 15-year veteran of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, sketched out her platform on a series of neighborhood-based initiatives designed to reduce violent crime and promote small businesses. 
“Violence is a preventable illness, and we need to get to the core,” she said. Robinson proposed the funding of new neighborhood recreation centers, community gardens and farms, and a reallocation of tax abatements to new businesses in the city’s neighborhoods rather than downtown.
“We’re constantly using our middle-class dollars on big-tent tactics,” she said. “Only a few neighborhoods are getting fed with our current leadership.”
Dowd, who on the Pittsburgh City Council currently represents a district of neighborhoods north of campus stretching from the Strip and Bloomfield to Highland Park, advocated a city government “that’s not for sale.” He supports an increased collaboration between the city's administration and the Pittsburgh Board of Education, of which he was previously a member. He also pointed to his own experiences as a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh in addressing city housing.
“We were able as grad students to buy a house in the city of Pittsburgh,” he said, before proposing a plan to sell city-owned vacant homes “for very small dollars” to young people on conditions that they would live in the houses for a certain length of time.
Though the candidates often came across as united in criticism of the Ravenstahl administration, a difference between the two first emerged in the matter of the police force. Calling for stricter enforcement of traffic laws in connection with neighborhood walkability and bikeability, Dowd said that the city currently lacks a sufficient traffic division. 
“That’s the one thing I can say that we do well,” Robinson shot back.
Public transportation also turned into a sticking point, with Dowd first speaking in favor of the Port Authority’s North Shore Connector — a 1.2-mile extension to the downtown subway system — and saying that it could provide the opportunity to construct a direct link to Pittsburgh International Airport. Robinson, referring to the project as the “tunnel to nowhere,” questioned its worth and said her transit solution would be to subcontract certain services of the Port Authority out to private businesses.
A final disagreement between Robinson and Dowd concerned a proposed merger between the city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. Robinson said she was the only candidate who was against it, although she said she would support a consolidation of some services to increase combined purchasing power, for example.
“If you played Sim County,” responded Dowd, “you would not win if you had 131 municipal school systems.”
In keeping with the university setting of the debate, Sims asked the candidates a number of questions about how each would keep young people in Pittsburgh or why they would want to live here.
Robinson said she was considering creating a Department of Neighborhoods and would appoint young people to it. She also proposed extending the current Pittsburgh Promise scholarship program to middle school students. 
“Young adults ... are certainly our future,” she said. “I know that sounds corny, but in terms of tax dollars you really, really are.”
Dowd emphasized attracting more venture capital to the area and connecting young entrepreneurs to legal and other experts who can help them set up businesses. He also pushed for an increase in younger workers among the city’s administration, starting from internships and continuing into new waves of full-time workers. 
“It’s a great place to work and we need your help,” he said. 
“They could use a few good engineers,” Robinson added.
At the end of the two-person debate, Harris, a 29-year-old independent candidate, spoke for three minutes on his own platform for mayor. In his view, young people want to come to Pittsburgh, but the city doesn’t offer them a way to stay. He outlined a platform based in “strategic” entrepreneurship, focusing primarily on technology companies and new neighborhood businesses.
“Why have we not had that Google or that Yahoo or that next young company?” he asked.
Harris is a 2008 graduate of a joint MBA/J.D. program between Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business and the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Law.
The Mayoral Candidates Forum was organized by the Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Project, in partnership with the Urban League Young Professionals of Pittsburgh, Leadership Pittsburgh, the Young Republicans of Allegheny County, the Pittsburgh City Paper, and Carnegie Mellon’s student government.

The administration of Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole has come to an end as they pass the torch of student leadership and service on to Rotimi Abimbola and Adam Klein.
When Itkowitz and Godbole reflect on their tenure, there are many accomplishments to highlight.
“We ran on the platform of programs to unite our campus,” Itkowitz said. 
“The first was Football Frenzy, which encouraged students to attend home games and support our teams. The second was the creation of the Loop Bus, a shuttle that runs from campus to the South Side, Station Square, and downtown. We had 760 students in the first five weekends and recorded 100 riders per night. Finally, our safety and dining task forces collaborated with undergrads and graduates, using surveys as a benchmark to report progress.”
Godbole elaborated, saying, “We presented this to the administration and they really took it to heart. They opened the Maggie Murph Cafe to 24 hours, making changes to pedestrian safety and meal plans. There’s some things we need to maintain throughout this year. For example, we took [surveys] in Student Senate; 64 percent said the transportation fee needs to be increased for services.”
Godbole suggested that “Rotimi and Adam could work on Football Frenzy and maybe extend it to basketball and non-athletic events.”
“The President’s Cabinet, which serves as an advisory group to [President Jared] Cohon, is able to do a lot more than we could have done ourselves,” Itkowitz said. “We also built relationships with Pitt, lobbying on their campus and in Qatar, where Rotimi has been pretty active.”
“There are a few things that we can improve,” Godbole said. 
“There is a lot of diversity, but not everyone collaborates where they should.”
Itkowitz agreed. “Students have a lot of pride in the individual, but not in CMU as a whole. Things like Football Frenzy and the Loop Bus will get students excited about the city and be a good opportunity to meet people.”
Durng their tenure, the two wanted to take the two first steps in their platform in seven major areas. 
Godbole felt that their goal was accomplished, and Itkowitz agreed, saying, “I feel satisfied that we more than accomplished what our platform proposed.”
Although Itkowitz admitted there were some things left unfinished, like the plaid crosswalk and perimeter flags, he said, “At least those ideas were planted, and Rotimi and Adam will make them grow and see them come to fruition.”
Godbole discussed some difficulties in learning her role and the policies surrounding the job. 
Itkowitz added, “I learned them and it was a really good experience. After doing this for four years, though, sometimes you run out of fresh ideas.” Some of the bigger challenges included working with the administration and organizing Homecoming. 
He said members of the administration were “really easy to work with. After convincing them about the Loop Bus, they were incredibly supportive of Football Frenzy. During Homecoming, more than 20 students were on the committee for B There, a campaign run through the alumni office to raise a billion dollars. Organizing the ESPN game, dance, and the Fence -- it was a task getting all these variables in place,” Itkowitz said.
Godbole gave some advice to the future student body leaders. “Nothing’s impossible, really. This is a campus where if you’re passionate about initiative, the support is there,” she said. 
Itkowitz commented about the campus as well, calling it “unique because CMU is not averse to change. We did more events and programs that had a direct impact on students. I am confident that Timi and Adam will continue to expand the CMU experience in their platform.”
The Student Senate elected an executive committee on Thursday night.  “As representatives for the students, administrative leaders will be looking to Timi and Adam for student responses,” Itkowitz said. “This combination of student government and student organizations will be a nice mix.”

The recent string of thefts and robberies both on campus and throughout the Oakland area has resulted in heightened awareness and a flood of security alerts and cautionary messages in every student’s inbox.
According to an e-mail distributed by Carnegie Mellon on April 15, three Carnegie Mellon students were the victims of two armed robbers in two separate incidents. The thefts occurred shortly after midnight within half an hour of each other and, in both cases, the robbers brandished a handgun. The first theft occurred in front of the Central Catholic High School and the second at the corner of Fifth and South Neville. A third robbery reported on April 24, again around midnight, described a similar encounter with two individuals carrying a handgun, this time on Schenley Drive.
Students are advised to take any safety precautions necessary and are especially warned against walking alone late at night. Erica Tang, a junior chemistry major and a resident assistant in Fairfax Apartments, stated that she tries to avoid this particular situation whenever possible and advises that after dark, off-campus residents “walk down Craig Street since it’s the best-lit route and the [University Police] headquarters are located there.”
The situation is being carefully monitored, not only by police, but by the housefellows and resident assistants in the Oakland apartments. 
“As the events have been unfolding, we’ve been reminding our residents and re-informing them about the shuttles,” Gabe Herman, a sophomore economics and H&SS interdisciplinary major and resident assistant in the Fairfax annex, said. Herman particularly recommended the use of the shuttle and escort service, as well as “campus programs, such as SafeWalk, when coming home late.”
The recent armed robberies as well as the frequent thefts of wallets, cell phones, and small electronics seen earlier in the semester has been closely followed by campus and city police. Campus Chief of Police Tom Ogden noted in an e-mail sent out on April 14 that although “a number of arrests have been made, the number of thefts continues to grow, as has been the case nationwide due to the difficult economic times we are experiencing.” 
Tang agreed with Ogden’s observation, stating that “with unemployment rates being as high as they are, it's no wonder that some people are trying to get money by other means.” 
An e-mail this past Saturday, April 25, confirmed that two loaded guns had been found by a contractor of the University “in a locker located in a room on campus typically used by employees of the contractor.” The guns were later secured by University Police. 
Despite this discovery and other headway made in the investigation, no final arrests in the recent armed robbery crimes have been made and students are asked to remain vigilant. Ogden expressed his belief that by working together as a community, we can “restore the trusting environment that we deserve.”

In 2009, entering the real world for college graduates might not be the world they initially envisioned for themselves. As plan A falters, plans B, C, and D are starting to look increasingly appealing. 
Four years in college is no longer the norm for college students, as career advisors and counselors are purporting the advantages and necessities of more time in college.
Lisa Dickter, the interim director of the Career Center at Carnegie Mellon and a CIT career consultant for biomedical, chemical, civil, and mechanical engineers, said, “ ‘Do what you love and the money will follow’ now means that depending on your major and what you want to do, you may need to work a long time to get to where you want to be.”
While most students think sending out five to 10 job or internship applications is adequate and 15 is more than enough, the Career Center actually suggests sending out 50 to 100.
Josh Kresge, a junior in the  Tepper School of Business, said that some of the companies he interviewed with had hired 20 applicants in the past but were limited to only one or two this year. 
Consequently, graduate school applications are on the rise. The Tennessee Journalist acknowledged that it is scary for college graduates to think of themselves as “on their own and potentially jobless, and many would rather have the stress of class work than the stress of paying their own bills in this economy.” 
The Journalist reported that graduate school applications are increasing by 10 to 20 percent this year at many institutions.
“At first I really wanted to get a job,” said Ashley Finkel, a senior decision science major. “I looked for months, had multiple interviews, but unfortunately, because of the economic situation ... all of those opportunities fell through. At that point, everyone I spoke to told me that going back to school would be my best bet right now.”
Dickter said, “The bad economy does funny things to students. It can limit you in terms of your choices.... It makes students look at their options a little more carefully. You may not have as many choices as you would have in a good economy, yet some still want to hold out for their dream job.”
“I thought there would be more lucrative job offers, but oh well,” Finkel said. 
“Luckily for me, Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College offers a graduate degree that fits my interests perfectly and I am now fortunate enough to be able to attend graduate school there for the next two years.”
The Millennial Generation, those born between 1980 and 2000, are known for having exceptionally high expectations for themselves, their future, and those around them. 
Rich Milgram, the CEO of Beyond.com, commented, “The Millennial generation is ambitious, confident, goal-oriented, and typically not shy about exercising their independence.... In today’s economy, it’s important that new grads remain realistic, patient and flexible in their job search and not be afraid to lean on their parents, who have experienced multiple economic downturns, for old-fashioned career advice.”
R.F. Culbertson, a professor of entrepreneurship in Tepper, said, “Often I tend to look at generations in terms of behavior, and the 1980s generation is an interesting group.
“What preceded them was extremely hurried behavior, so it’s not uncommon to see the pendulum swing to the other extreme — come back to the nest, live in security and accumulate stuff — and then learn to fly all over again.”
In addition to graduate school, many students are becoming entrepreneurs.
Culbertson said that “there’s the theory out there that people will start their own businesses because they’re unemployed.
“And yes, necessity is the mother of invention; however, we’re finding that the ultimate decision may lie along the lines of personal control, personal wants, and personal decision-making, meaning most people realize that entrepreneurs are fairly high up on the risk/reward curve....”
Culbertson pointed out the dangers, and sometimes benefits, of being an entrepreneur, that “they take more risks and therefore their returns, if they win, are greater. What we’re seeing from this generation, and this was prior to the recession/depression, is that control over your life, having a life, and the ability to make and execute your own decisions, because you’ve seen others make them that were flawed, is often more important than money itself.”
Experience, Inc., the nation’s leading provider of career services for college students and alumni, recently announced results from its 2009 Economic Impact Survey.
The survey found that the Millennials’ confidence level about the economy is significantly higher than the general population’s confidence.
Whether one lands a job, opts for graduate school, or decides to become an entrepreneur, everyone agrees that preparation is the key to success. 
Dickter noted that “the people at the Carnegie Mellon Career Center are experts and want to give students as many resources as possible.
“We will talk to them and motivate them so they can do what they love.”

One of Carnegie Mellon’s largest and most successful media organizations celebrates not one, but two anniversaries this year. While many students may have noticed WRCT’s recent 35th anniversary party at the Shadow Lounge, this year WRCT celebrates 60 years at the forefront of college radio stations.
Started in 1949 as a small project in Porter Hall by the electrical engineering department, the ancestor of WRCT lived the first 25 years of its life as a small AM outfit, heard only on campus. Then, in March of 1974, some time after receiving its current call letters, WRCT hit the FM airwaves for the first time.
Over the past 35 years, WRCT has grown into one of the most powerful college radio stations in the country, broadcasting at 1750 watts, with a listening radius of up to 17 miles. (The University of Pittsburgh’s radio station, WPTS, broadcasts at 16 watts.)
The station’s power and roots in electrical engineering are what attracted Larry Berger, the long-time host of Saturday Light Brigade, an early Saturday morning children’s show on WRCT.
Berger, a Carnegie Mellon graduate from chemical engineering and engineering and public policy, had already been in radio for seven years with free-standing Pittsburgh station WYEP before he stepped onto campus and made up his mind that he was not going to join WRCT. Seeing the station, however, promptly caused him to reconsider.
“First and foremost, the technical plans, design, engineering, and equipment [were] all really, really strong for live interviews, remote broadcast, and music playing,” said Berger. “[WRCT was] always on the cutting-edge of having the right equipment [for] great radio.”
After years of hosting the popular Saturday Light Brigade on WYEP, Berger and the show’s board of directors decided in November 2002 to change the show’s affiliation to WRCT.
“We asked: How [could we] best serve the community? By aligning ourselves with an organization that is very interested with education and technology and the interfacing of both of those things with the community,” Berger said.
Shows like Berger’s are possible because, unlike the majority of college stations, WRCT is entirely student-run and produces nearly all of its own content. It allows anybody — not just Carnegie Mellon students — to host radio shows.
According to Alex Smith, current training director, past general manager of WRCT, and master’s student of logic, computation, and methodology, these idiosyncrasies are part of what has allowed WRCT to gain such a strong following in the Pittsburgh community and pursue a creative track that other stations cannot keep pace with.
With the sole responsibility for its creative content, WRCT has talk shows in three different languages, music directors for 15 different genres, and nearly 40 diverse programs.
“We play it if it is good and you can’t hear it anywhere else in Pittsburgh. If other stations are playing it, then we don’t anymore,” Smith said. “Our goal is exposing people to stuff they will like if they give it a chance.”
According to Smith, the station does not play top-40 hits, which is not hard, considering the nearly 70,000-item vinyl and CD collection the station has tucked quietly into a crevice in the basement of the University Center. 
This library has inspired more than its fair share of students.
“You come in to do a show being interested in a genre and leave being into music,” Smith said.
This was certainly true for DJ Jason Toyger, a 1996 professional writing alum and current editor of the School of Computer Science publication The Link. 
Toyger joined WRCT after his graduation in 2001 following a brief stint in professional radio.
Toyger’s show began as a free-form rock and roll program, which he admits seemed like the quintessential college radio program at the time. 
In typical WRCT fashion, however, Toyger didn’t want to be doing what everyone else was doing and began increasingly attracting the high-energy, over-the-top radio of the 1950s and ’60s.
“I didn’t want to be playing what they were calling ‘oldies,’ ” said Toyger, who plays bands like The Ronettes, The Coconut Coolouts, and The Kinks on his show, Radio 9. 
“There was no reason to imitate commercial radio, but the stuff I started imitating was 40 or 50 years old.”
Toyger is part of WRCT’s alumni and community support base, which, according to Smith and Toyger, is part of the reason WRCT has such a distinct sense of its history and culture. 
Berger agrees.
“In 2003, I returned to the same culture that was there in the 1980s — the same goals and service values,” Berger said, who lauds WRCT for its commitment to serving the community of Pittsburgh. “Being a jukebox is not good enough. Creating something no one else can create — live when possible, local when possible — is the best possible use of radio.”
According to Smith, the future of the station, like that of so many media outlets, is tied to the pressures of emerging new media. While WRCT already streams its content live over the Web, it must now turn an eye toward creating podcasts and other technologies that will allow it to reach its audience. Smith doesn’t think the technological leap will cause the station to lose any of its character.
“We’re committed to underrepresented music,” Smith said. “People here are into radio for the love of the game.”

Carnegie Mellon’s strengths of music, computer science, and technology will be combined to offer new joint degrees next year. 
The bachelor of science in music and technology and the master’s of science in music and technology will be based in the Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music while involving professors from the School of Computer Science and the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
While this new combination of arts and sciences may at first seem strange, junior electrical and computer engineering major Stelios Melachrinoudis explained, “Now with the inclusion of ECE courses into the curriculum, it gives students something to associate many of the audio concepts with.
“For example, there are plug-ins that can design digital low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters with various quality factors and gains with tremendous ease. Someone who doesn’t have the necessary background will already ask, ‘what is a gain and what is a quality factor?’ 
“By adding ECE courses into the curriculum, students will then say ‘oh, that’s where this concept came from’ and realize why certain parameters were incorporated in the first place.
“In other words, it evokes the idea, ‘we had to start from somewhere, and this is where’ — you cannot go back that much further.”
Undergraduate and graduate students pursing one of these new degrees next year will explore new ways of performing, composing, presenting, and archiving music. 
Like their peers enrolled in most other programs at Carnegie Mellon, science in music and technology students will receive help from a team of academic advisers in course planning and achieving professional goals. 
The degree programs will also culminate in a research-based capstone project.
Dominic Mazoni, who created the music editing program Audacity as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, praised this new program, saying, “Carnegie Mellon should always be on the forefront of technological integration ... I am glad to see that they are finally seeing the benefits of an understanding of both music and technology.” 
“By studying music and technology together, it gives the student a deeper appreciation of what digital music is all about and why software makes it more convenient to create it and otherwise manipulate it,” added Melachrinoudis. 
“Before sequencing and editing programs were available, editing was done using analog tape. To do even one edit, you had to record a segment on tape, mark where the edit had to be made, then record another segment on another part of the tape, mark the edit, cut it at the edit points, and splice it together using editing tape. 
“The equivalent in software — Cut-And-Paste, Ctrl X, then Ctrl V at the point you want. And edit points? You could put cue markers in software that could easily be remembered.”
Although stereotypes may not imply that music majors are interested in engineering, Melachrinoudis argued, “One thing that we cannot forget about technology is that it makes certain operations easier. As operations get easier, people will overuse technology to the point where they become indolent, and their creativity takes a toll.
“To put it in a simple analogy, what did you learn first: how to add two numbers or how to use a calculator to do that same thing for you? First you learned the basics of addition, and then you realized that human capacity can only allow for a few of them at a time of a certain magnitude, so then you learned how to use calculators and then computers, both of which are adding machines at their core.
“With this in mind, far too many producers are learning the ‘calculator’ approach to audio without knowing the basics, leading to the all-too-common syndrome of songs that sound the same by the same producer and a lack of creativity and skills.”
Derrick Walker, senior electrical and computer engineering student, was excited for the additional majors “because our school allows students to push boundaries and encourages interdisciplinary projects.
“I wish these majors were available for me when I was a freshman because I definitely see the advantages of studying music technology, especially with the amount of creativity that flows through the school of music. Mainstream music needs something new, so hopefully music and tech students will add something of substance to the music scene.”
Melachrinoudis believes that “as soon as people in the audio and music industry realize this, I think the demand for these degrees will rise to the point where there will be no room for the amateur. 
“There are many technological advances that have been made in the entertainment industry, and regardless of the economic downturn, it is still flourishing; thus it will need highly skilled professionals to meet the demand.”

[BOLD]Up ‘til Dawn raises donation funds[BOLD]
Last Friday in the Skibo Gym, Up ‘til Dawn celebrated the end of its year-long letter-writing campaign for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. 
The hospital is located in Memphis, Tenn., and was founded by the late entertainer Danny Thomas. 
He began raising money for the creation of St. Jude’s in the 1950s, and the hospital has continued to sustain its annual operation with all costs covered from donations.
It is currently the world’s leading research center for children’s cancer, and the hospital treats children from across the U.S. and around the world at no cost to the families.
Participants in the Up ‘til Dawn campaign wrote letters to friends and family requesting donations to the research hospital.
Admission to the event was free for all guests who had already written letters for the campaign, and all other guests were asked to donate $5 to the cause, as well as bring five addresses of family and friends for the letter-writing campaign.
Events at the celebration included a hypnotist, an inflatable boxing ring, a live DJ, live dance performances by Dancers’ Symposium, henna tattoos, a caricaturist, and several video game competitions. 
There was also a volleyball tournament, a four-square competition, cupcakes, mocktails, carnival food, and smoothies made by Carnegie Mellon’s Peer Health Advocates.
[BOLD]Students voice opinions online[BOLD]
A group of Carnegie Mellon students have created a new online forum to serve as a central and convenient outlet on (tartanforum.com) [www.tartanforum.com]
Students will be able to speak out about their opinions through this  project for Decision Analysis and Decision Support Systems (DADSS).
Tartanforum is an online community designed for students to post any concerns that they have about the Carnegie Mellon campus. 
The forum is designed to help the student government and administration become more aware of changes that students want to see on and around campus. 
Students can give their thoughts about a great variety of different subjects — anything from general academics to Pittsburgh activities to campus events to things like philanthropy and community service. 
This online website is a brand new resource for the whole Carnegie Mellon student body to touch base in one place and finally be honest and vocal. 
For further information, join the Facebook group, and be sure to check out the website: (tartanforum.com) [www.tartanforum.com].

Maybe I’m just out of the loop.
I prefer my $25 flip phone to an iPhone and favor grabbing a coffee with my friends to fake-talking with them online.
My latest technological question mark? Twitter.
Twitter is a website on which users, using pseudonyms, can upload constant updates about what they’re doing and thinking — think of it as a glorified Facebook status. According to its description on twitter.com, Twitter is a “modern antidote to information overload.” But doesn’t the creation of a site that perpetuates a pressure to stay in constant communication with the people in one’s life in fact push this information overload to the extreme?
Now I just may not be very tech-savvy, but I don’t use one of these pseudonyms. I’m just Jessica. But the more users who join Twitter, the more chances that the site’s lexicon is likely to pour out into the real world, in the same way that too many instant messager-users say “lol” in face-to-face interactions. If “at” — or worse, “at-symbol,” is added as a prefix to every interaction, as it is in replies on Twitter, everyone is going to seemingly suffer from a significant stutter. 
A constant news feed is just too much. What am I supposed to get out of seeing self-proclaimed gossip queen Perez Hilton compliment a fellow celebrity’s T-shirt on his Twitter page, or even seeing my friend’s post that she is waiting for take-out? Sweet?
I don’t mean to perpetuate a Big Brother theory. While I’m sure the government does have some sort of magical power to monitor the Twitter pages of Demi Moore and Miley Cyrus, let’s just call the likelihood of doing so low. Save for celebrities, I don’t even think most users’ friends read every post. So then, for whom are users posting? Is it just pleasing to read one’s own posts, the same way it can seems fun to update one’s interests and favorite quotes on Facebook? This much narcissism cannot be healthy for the planet.
I just don’t want to know what other people are doing every minute of the day. Sometimes we just need anonymity. When I trip and fall on the uneven sidewalk behind Hunt Library at 3 a.m., I take it as a blessing that all of the well-rested humans are asleep. That tumble — and the resulting scratches all over my laptop — don’t need to be public. How soon until we all feel obligated to report everything we do?
Now, I’m all for more forms of procrastination. I find that I care about who has recently been tagged in photos just around the time I have a 10-page paper due the next day. But Twitter is more than just procrastination: People are updating their pages on the go, which means they’re avoiding doing things in the physical world in favor of the virtual one. A friend of mine posted that he forgot his credit card and couldn’t buy lunch — on Twitter. Buddy, if you need 10 bucks, just call (not me, but someone with money).
Also, the format of Twitter does nothing to ensure the legitimacy of the updates. Rather than giving people an all-access pass to people's thoughts and actions, Twitter is just an interface from which people can alter their real identities. If Jessica in the real world and jessica on Twitter were to diverge into two distinct individuals, Twitter wouldn’t be the online interface allowing users to provide basic updates; it would be a social networking site introducing the two’s friends and family members.
This online news feed cannot replace face-to-face interaction. But if it’s going to, it must be at least on a much more cleverly designed interface. Organizing one’s thoughts in 140 characters reduces one’s ideas and actions to mere items in a list, the runoff of which is dismissively pushed onto cataloged pages. If one is making the efforts to publish their step-by-step thoughts and actions in the Twitter world, those publications shouldn’t be so easily replaced — and replicable.

Though I had intended my last Op/Ed in The Tartan to be a congratulatory note to Sí Señor for adopting a spotty yet delicious vegetarian menu of seitan and tofurky, Friday’s message to the campus community eschewing the screening of pornographic films by the Activities Board provided me with something that is  more substantial to discuss.
I have grown used to the official communiques about how much money the university does not have anymore, and I think it is excellent that President Jared L. Cohon decided to be so transparent. But Friday’s campus-wide e-mail was not about transparency, or an emergency, or even a pressing issue. After having been here for four years, I don’t care anymore that the Activities Board shows pornography twice a year. Maybe I thought it was a scandal once, but now I don’t think it’s scandalous, or heinous, or offensive. I don’t really think about it at all. Sadly, after being here for 104 years, the administration cannot, as I have, just get over it.
Once upon a time, I was in a tough spot at The Tartan when a writer and I could not decide whether to go to CNN with a story that happened here at school that could have been potentially damaging to the Obama campaign and, while there were no bare breasts involved, may also have cast a bad light on the school.
At the time, we were given a surprising message: The directors of Media and Government Relations, though I am sure they would have preferred I just let the whole thing drop, both told me they were confident in the ability of students to make decisions. They didn’t know me well at the time, so their confidence was not in my reputation, but in the respect they shared for all students.
When it comes to the specter of pornography, I can empathize with Student Affairs’ situation: With the recent debacle over the University of Maryland’s nearly getting their state funding cut, the chair of the Activities Board’s going on record with the Post-Gazette, and what I am sure was a slew of scathing e-mails, it probably seemed like a good idea to clarify to everyone that it was not a school-sanctioned or -financed event. It wasn’t.
The message the entire campus community got from the interim dean was not the same as the empowering one that I got from the administration a year ago. Student Affairs, in an attempt to distance themselves from their students instead of support them, essentially threw its hands in the air and said, “We told them not to. It’s not our fault!”
The ill-conceived message took on the condescending tone of a parent apologizing that their child has just knocked down a pyramid of cereal boxes at the grocery store. The correspondence that we received said that “while university policy supports freedom of expression, the university strongly objects to showing such films.” It is dismaying that the university community did not receive exactly the opposite message, stating that while they do not support showing pornography, they do support freedom of expression and the decision-making capabilities of students.
It’s not a question of semantics, it is one of priorities. Especially in Student Affairs, students should be number one. Everything else should be number two: unequivocally, and regardless of internal or external pressure. It seems that Student Affairs decided not to prohibit the pornography because they are hindered by the university’s commitment to freedom of expression, not because they are motivated by it. In the face of mounting pressure, there should not have been an apology, but a defense: not of porn, but of students, and of their ability to make independent decisions.
The chair of the Activities Board defended the porn screening in the Post-Gazette as something absurd and light-hearted, and that is certainly true, but the decision to show porn is also supported by historical precedent that has developed into part of the campus’s student culture. It is a visible demonstration by the student body that Carnegie Mellon’s students have the freedom and will to defy social norms in visible and substantive ways. We are not told what to do or what to watch.
Decentralization is one of the cornerstones of Carnegie Mellon’s administrative culture, and has manifested itself in Student Affairs as a supportive but hands-off approach to student organization advising. This commitment to quasi-laissez-faire advising has generated acts of genius and complete failure within student organizations, but is a trait that makes us unique and progressive. The interim dean’s message confirmed that instead of embracing the consequences of supporting a culture of student independence, which is of immeasurable value in ensuring healthy student leadership development, the university will move to cover its tracks when things go wrong by calling student organizations out in front of their all of their peers.

In the not-too-distant past, I joined the Facebook group “I picked a major I like, and one day will be living in a box” and laughed a little to myself about how clever it was.
Well, who’s laughing now?
Evidently no one, as my unemployed peers will tell you. The year 2009 may be the worst on record to graduate from college in and join the rapidly shrinking workforce, if you want your workplace to be someplace that isn’t a 7-Eleven. The Carnegie Mellon Career Center sent me a follow-up e-mail asking me to fill out the panic attack-inducing “Post-Graduation Survey” when I politely but non-verbally declined to do it the first time. Two e-mails to force me to check a box signifying that “I am unemployed and seeking employment.”
Thanks, Career Center, for making me feel like shit.
Add to that the downsizing and, in some cases, profound disappearance of mainstream media. A share of New York Times stock costs less than the price of the Sunday paper ($3.25). “Newspaper” is on its way to becoming something of an antiquated term. Ten years down the road, after we tell our children that the word “blog” is actually the shortened version of the original “weblog” and that “e-mail” once stood for “electronic mail,” we will inform them that the news they are reading off a screen was once printed on actual paper that you could hold in your hands.
Oh God. I hope I don’t have kids 10 years from now.
All I’m saying is, anyone smart who was planning to be a writer knows they should now think about planning to be something else. Not because the world is no longer in need of writers, because it is — news may show up on a screen after a few clicks and not stuffed into a plastic bag and left on your doorstep every morning, but it still needs to be written by someone, and there are as many, if not more, opportunities for you to be that person. You can start your own blog or contribute to someone else’s. You can submit articles to be published on sites like the infamous Huffington Post and Salon.com.
Hold on — you want to get paid money for that? Sorry, no can do.
Unfortunately, there are so many fledgling writers out there (and even non-fledgling writers, as veteran reporters from the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and The Baltimore Sun, to name a few, have been thrust from their offices with floor-to-ceiling windows to cubicles at a temp agency, or more commonly, their own kitchen tables, staring at their laptops, wondering if they have the stamina to make a podcast) who will pitch and write stories to be posted on news sites for free that writers who want their living situation to include walls and a roof can be hard-pressed to find gigs that actually pay. And by pay, I mean not in the form of “experience,” “exposure,” and “a flexible work schedule and the ability to work from home” — all choice phrases used by publications who solicit this kind of voluntary slave labor.
Ah, the luxuries that unemployment provides. I’m only being 50 percent facetious here. The other day I was having a networking-related phone call with a lovely young woman who does communications work in the non-profit sector. She was trying to sell me on doing AmeriCorps — our country’s in-house version of the Peace Corps — by reminding me that I’d be living under the poverty line and therefore eligible for food stamps.
Seriously?
But while I’m on the topic of getting paid under the table — so far under that it’s hard to tell if the money’s actually there or not in all that blackness — I’d like to take a minute to grouse about my most despicable frenemy, which is the unpaid internship. I have to hand it to the man who came up with the idea of this college-sized version of slavery, especially when its employers offer “college credit” instead of cold hard cash. (Certified check would also be fine.) At Carnegie Mellon, at least, this is completely unfeasible. The university’s policy requires that a student be enrolled at the time in which he or she earns the credit, meaning that the student would have to pay the university the price of one unit of credit (about $1000) to be eligible for said college credit. A thousand bucks for the privilege of working for free as the designated “doer of tasks that no one else wants to do”? No thanks. This person is at this very moment touching his or her fingertips together and laughing haughtily in his (or her) corner office somewhere in Midtown Manhattan. That’s the other thing. New York is expensive. Don’t move there, even if you really, really, really think you can find a rent-controlled apartment in Williamsburg.
Despite the bitter cynicism displayed here, which is the direct result of scrolling through what felt like thousands of job listings for which I am completely unqualified (which, for the record, is any position whose title includes the words “director,” “manager,” or “senior” and does not include the words “assistant,” “associate,” or “entry-level”) just prior to writing this article, I am here to tell you — graduating writers, artists, and anyone majoring in something that could reside in the liberal arts category and/or does not teach you programming or how to build something — it’s not all that bad. You’re young, cheap to insure, and have “flexible” salary requirements. You know how to work a computer and you may even know HTML well enough to create a website that looks like it’s from 1997, like I do. Now pack up your stuff, move back in with Mom and Dad, take those GREs, and start applying to grad schools.
Or, alternatively, grit your teeth and get ready to give up soy lattes and trashy magazines for what you really love, which in my case is words. Now, excuse me while I update my blog.

You may have recently noticed some frazzled professors. Upon inquiry, I learned that the application for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Challenge Grants in Health and Science Research was due April 27. The grant, I was told by one professor, was like “an extended final exam on acid to be churned out like elaborate manufactured car parts and evaluated by your former colleagues that you once made fun of for looking dorky in a lab coat but now unabashedly suck up to.” Sounds like a beating.
In all seriousness, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 designated $200 million for the 2009–2010 fiscal year to fund “scientifically meritorious applications.” The act, in addition to the enormous amount of money pumped into research sectors, is a literal and symbolic reversal of former President Bush’s backward policies.
Scientists around the nation are extremely grateful — albeit a bit stressed — for the influx of resources, as NIH funding has been nearly flat for the past five years. The money allocated for the Challenge Grants is equivalent to 35 percent of its annual budget, and the NIH promises to make the most “effective, transparent, and immediate use” of this money.
In addition to the Recovery Act, in early March, President Obama overturned a 2001 order signed by Bush on the ban on embryonic stem cell research. Previously, the NIH was barred from funding further research on embryonic stem cells, save the 60 cultures that already were in existence at the time.
In the big picture, the new policies implemented under Obama are symbols that the United States was, is, and will be a leader in scientific research. Some members of the Republican party, such as the group of six moderate GOP Congressmen who urged Obama to overturn current stem cell policy, should be applauded. More progressive, albeit vaguely idealistic, stances on the 2008 GOP platform concerning research, along with former First Lady Nancy Reagan’s public commendation of the overturn, are also important milestones in bipartisan efforts in working toward a common cause in advancing understanding of humanity.
However, there are opinion barriers holding us back as a society. For example, House Minority Leader John Boehner believes that “advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C.” Scientific research aimed at advancing human understanding through research methods, clinical trials, and biomedical and behavioral health is an immensely important aspect of a leading superpower and an integral part of a flourishing, innovative society. Government funding should not be the constraining factor to thriving ideas; it should be the base on which the best minds in science can rely on to test hypotheses and to support new innovations.
For these recent events, Obama and his supporters should be commended for thinking beyond outdated rules and for supporting the betterment of society at large. It is my hope for those who oppose these measures or the idea behind these measures that they reconsider the importance of scientific research in an increasingly innovative world.

At the close of every year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and general community at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to Student Dormitory Council (SDC) for ending top competitor Pi Kappa Alpha’s (PiKA’s) seven-year winning streak in Buggy and for setting a new course record of 2:03.30. Following the course records set last year, more spectators came out to the races, and more are sure to come next year following this year’s upset on the part of an independent organization. 
A thorn to University Health Services and Healthy Campus 2010 for continuing their possibly well-intentioned but badly planned giant poster-based campaign to rid the campus of any soul who wants to light up. We couldn’t even enforce the old policy, and the new policy looks like a difficult connect-the-dots puzzle.
A thistle to Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole for campaigning on an incredibly ambitious platform and largely sticking to it this year as Student Body President and Vice-President. Their efforts have brought large numbers of new fans to Tartans sport events, and Jared and Pooja themselves have been active in a multitude of on-campus events despite their own busy schedules and behind-the-scenes work running student government.
A thorn to Pittsburgh burglars and armed robbers. The East Campus Garage is meant to be safe, and the things in our cars are meant to stay in our cars. We don’t appreciate armed robbery. It’s scary. So please stop bothering Carnegie Mellon students, or else we will pick up this campus and move it to somewhere warmer (Qatar?).
A thistle to Hunt Library and the Maggie Murph Cafe for staying open through the night during the school week. We know we’re not the only ones who need a caffeine fix and crave those bagels at 4 in the morning.
A thorn to the AIG executives who spent more money than The Tartan makes in four years on a weekend trip to an extremely exclusive resort  in California. That said, we will accept bailout money for spa trips. 
A thistle to the Get In Line Games, Evil Genius Designs, and cmuTV for representing the cutting-edge technology innovated and elaborated upon at Carnegie Mellon by presenting multiple interactive games at Carnival, as well as the Jumbotron used to watch the Buggy races during Sweepstakes. More people were able to watch more of the races from a single spot on the course, encouraging more spectatorship and interest in Buggy and thus the rest of Carnival.
A thistle to the university for its B There capital campaign. While the economy might not be in the best shape for a private university to earn some extra money, the school addressed the very practical issue of increasing our disproportionately low endowment through creative, cohesive marketing efforts and inviting alumni to schmooze together in a sweet tent complete with music, drinking, and fireworks.
And with that, a thistle to President Jared Cohon for encouraging and maintaining more transparency between the administration and the student body than we’ve seen during our tenures at Carnegie Mellon. In these tough economic times, it would be too easy to hole up and quietly, quickly reduce expenditures, but President Cohon has been communicative and has encouraged feedback from all of us as to how to take the university into the coming years in a responsible manner.
A thorn to the B There stickers. They were clever for a day, and then they were just everywhere. While we suppose that is how advertising works, we are scared of coming back to campus in the fall and having every last inch of concrete covered in stickers for every frat, club, and guy on campus with 20 bucks.
A thistle to Facebook for being responsive to its users. After a change in their terms of use was made that would potentially keep and publicize users’ personal information, Facebookers united and told the company how this displeased them — by posting on the social networking site itself, to boot. Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of Facebook’s head honchos buckled down and quickly returned the terms of use to their original version, putting their users’ concerns first.
A thorn to Westridge Investment for making a difficult economic situation that much more complicated. We aren’t going to blame the administration; they couldn’t have known that a teddy bear would steal 49 million of our dollars. The economy is bad, and we need that money for financial aid. Now give it back.
A thistle to the Pittsburgh Steelers for being the best football team in the world and for making us proud to say we live in Sixburgh. Also, kudos to Mayor Luke for briefly changing his name to Steelerstahl, showing what a significant part of the city’s culture this sports team truly is.
A thorn to Carnegie Mellon’s wireless Internet being so flaky this year. Oh, and the electricity too. Can we keep the campus turned on? Thanks.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon Housing and Dining for selecting a new on-campus food service provider with a focus on student input. After all, we’re the ones eating the personal pizzas and french fries — shouldn’t we be able to have a say in how, and by whom, they’re prepared?
A thorn to the Heinz College for not keeping its faculty in line. Making drunk driving a hobby and  offering extra-super-bonus-credits for the low, low price of who knows what is not characteristic of the award-winning, grant-writing faculty we expect here at Carnegie Mellon. We wish you a better, less... interesting 2010.
A thistle to the committee heading up the search for a new dean of Student Affairs following Dean Church’s departure last year. We agree that it’s important to look for potential leaders that come from outside of the established university community, and are still hoping for someone as involved and knowledgeable as the former dean.
A thorn to the restraints on “Walking to the Sky.” Who are you, Carnegie Mellon administration? To be scared of the vibrations we are creating across campus, to be afraid of our harmonic motion, to break our will, suspending us with cables to concrete anchors? We will continue to work toward our dreams of walking up that giant pole.
A thistle to the city of Pittsburgh for being ahead of the game looking to elevate Pittsburgh to the level of other health-conscious, contemporary urban centers by aiming to ban smoking in restaurants and other public venues before the rest of the state. To remind the nation that we’ve evolved past our days as the Iron City, and are as progressive as the sustainability center of Portland, we must be as clean and current as it as well.
A thorn to Juicy Campus for shutting down because of a bad economy. Dear JC: We miss you and totally saw someone doing something we can’t write here but want to post anonymously so that everyone can laugh at them. Come back. Love, The EB.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon-Qatar for completing its new building in accordance with new design standards and a nod to the hopeful expansion of the campus’s small 150-person student body. Next up: The Fence for our sister campus. We’re thinking something electronic.
A thorn to the people who painted the tree next to the Fence. Did that tree ever paint you or pour paint into your lungs? Trees breathe through their bark — they need it to not be covered with your gang symbols and love. So keep it off the tree.

Hey Tartans,
With the school year coming to an end, this was a week of reflection and transition for Student Government. The Undergraduate Student Senate closed its 2008–2009 session, and I’d like to congratulate the body on a successful and visible year. Next year’s Senate Executive Committee was also established, chaired by current H&SS sophomore Aaron Gross. I’m confident that he will do an excellent job in that role because of his sound experience as a member of the Finance Committee last term. The Graduate Student Assembly will remain in its current form, as its board elections occur on a calendar-year basis. GSA president Patrick Kelley has done a good job of working with undergraduate students thus far, and I hope to see collaboration between Senate and GSA continue to develop next year.
When Pooja and I decided to run for Student Body Vice-President and President, we ran on a platform focused on initiatives that would unite students and increase campus pride. Through programs like Fall 2008 Football Fever, Safety and Dining task forces, and StuGov Loop Bus, I’m hopeful that we’ve been successful. After four years, I realize that the problem really isn’t a lack of spirit on our campus. Students have a ton of spirit around the activities that they are involved with, yet we have a hard time connecting that to the university at large. My hope is that Student Government can continue to offer programs that foster a sense of community on campus.
As we look forward to next year, there are a number of challenges that remain for Student Government, the largest being how to remain visible and connected. I think that Timi and Adam have a great plan in place, particularly surrounding an increased use of web-based technology. Connectedness is a two-way street, however. I encourage all of you to provide the new executives with continued feedback and support in the same way that you have helped Pooja and me throughout our term.
Finally, I’d like to thank the Tartan staff, including Jessica Thurston and Heather Tomko, my editors, for their help. One last column plug: Next Wednesday, Student Government is sponsoring a Coffee and Conversations event in Warner Hall Conference Room East at 4:30 p.m., followed by the Pittsburgh Mayoral Debate at 6:30 p.m. in McConomy Auditorium. Congratulations Class of 2009!
