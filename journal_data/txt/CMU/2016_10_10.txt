The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team picked up two wins over the past week, improving their record to 9-1-1 on the year as they continue to steamroll opponents. The Tartans are still undefeated at home this season, and they demonstrated why against the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg on Tuesday evening.
Tuesday’s match got off to a quick start, and both teams came ready to play. The Tartans began the action with a shot on goal in first minute of the game, and although it sailed high of the goal, the Tartans had made a statement that they brought their A-game. Carnegie Mellon controlled the pace of the game during the first half, but the Bobcats did not stop fighting for the win. They had a few shots on goal of their own in the first half, but none could find the back of the net. The case was the same for the Tartans until the 38th minute when they got a free kick opportunity. Sophomore Anthony Gulli sent the free kick into the field, and it went straight to the center of the goal. As the ball neared the players, sophomore Michael Lin jumped in front of the pack and launched a quick shot over the opposing keeper’s head to put the Tartans up 1–0. The score would remain that way until later in the second half.
Gulli decided he wanted to be a part of both Tartan goals this game, and in the 71st minute he made it a reality. With a defender trailing close behind him, Gulli ran down a loose ball and made a quick touch pass to sophomore Zack Masciopinto. Masciopinto received the pass and instantly sent it to the goal. The ball flew into the back of the net, and Masciopinto’s fifth goal of the season gave the Tartans a comfortable 2–0 lead. That was the nail in the coffin for the Bobcats, but they didn’t give up completely. In the very last second of the game, a Bobcat player made a desperate attempt to break the shutout and was successful. Unfortunately for them, the Bobcats were out of time and the Tartans were victorious.
On Saturday, the Tartans traveled to New York University for University Athletic Association (UAA) play. The Tartans decisively defeated the host Violets by a score of 3–0, improving their record in UAA play to 1–0–1.
This game was unique in that all three scores came within four minutes of each other early in the second half. The game was a slow back and forth for the first half, but the action exploded right as the teams came out for the second half. At the very end of the 55th minute, Masciopinto jumped out in front of a large group of players fighting for the ball in front of the goal and sent it to the back of the net. The shot was too quick and too close to the net for the keeper to save, and the Tartans took a one-point lead. Masciopinto must have had a trick up his sleeve for this game, because he scored another goal 46 seconds after his first. Sophomore Philip Petrakian sent a pass across the front of the net and Masciopinto headed it to the back of the net, giving the Tartans a 2-0 lead in under a minute.
The Tartans refused to slow down, and continued to put shots on goal with a relentless offensive attack. The Violet goalkeeper made eight saves in the match, but it still wasn’t enough to hold the Tartans down. In the 59th minute, Petrakian took a shot that was saved the Violet goalkeeper, but it rebounded straight to junior Ryan Stinebaugh and he returned it to the net, this time succeeding and putting the Tartans up 3-0 with the final score of the game. Sophomore goalkeeper Alec Lam made two crucial saves in the waning minutes of the second half to hold on to the shutout and earn his fourth win in the net this season for the Tartans.
The Tartans go on the road again next week to take on the University of Rochester in another UAA competition on Friday, Oct. 14. The game is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m.

From the moment I was asked to join The Tartan’s first Fantasy Football league I made no pretenses about knowing what the heck was going on. My leaguemates said they needed one more person to make the league work, so I figured I’d make a team to help them out and then leave it to run by itself, accepting my losses with grace and a healthy side of not caring. And considering that when I went to make my team I couldn’t figure out how to do it and accidently ended up making two, keeping a safe distance seemed like the way to go. 
For a bit there the plan seemed to be working. My auto-picked, automatically named Teams Foley held their own, averaging around 100 points a week for the first three rounds. Then disaster struck in week four. Turns out you have to actually manage and change your teams in this game. Staring at a scoreboard where my team had 45 points less than the second worst loser, I decided it was time to make a change. 
Our beloved Layout Manager Zeke Rosenberg and Assistant Sports Editor Ian Tanaya took it upon themselves to help me on my quest of figuring out what in the world was going on. The first step was teaching me that there is a site where we can actually view and control our teams. Imagine! Then it was time to take it to the next level and teach me how to move people on and off the bench. There are a lot of letters that I’m still trying to decipher, but it seems that you want to bench people who have red letters next to them and replace them with someone in the same position. 
I was starting to feel pretty confident that I could manage this team and quickly scale the league scoreboard until Rosenberg said, “You're also going to want to bench Tevin Coleman too. He has sickle cell anemia and the Falcons are playing in Denver this week.” My reaction was, “Wait, how am I supposed to know any of that.” In that moment, I gave up any hope of figuring this game out. 
There was, however, one thing I could do to improve my situation in the league. At the very least, I could change my team’s names to be more reflective of the situation. And so teams 'What is going on?' and 'How does this work?' were born. And while I have faith that we’ll do better next week with a bit of help from our friends (cough, Rosenberg, cough), I still have to pay my dues and report on our epic demise last week. And so, without further ado, here’s the weekly report.  
Plaidie Daddies over Dreamland Warriors 107–104
Our Online Editor India Price had a narrow victory over Tanaya’s Warriors. The two teams were a fairly even match, with over half of each team scoring in the double digits. Tayana saw some great performances his running backs LeSean McCoy of the Bills and Jordan Howard from the Bears, who earned 22 and 16 points respectively. In the end it didn’t matter, though, because Bengals’ wide receiver A.J. Green earned Price a crushing 33 points. Apparently Green has been a bit of a superstar this season, or so ESPN sports tells me. All I know is that between his points and a beautiful supporting act by Price’s other wide receiver, Broncos’ Emmanuel Sanders, there was really nothing Tanaya could do, but his Warriors fought hard anyway.
extremely dank team over Masshole Knickerbockers 137–110
Both of these teams put their best foot forward this week. Sports Editor Alex Wood’s team crushed it, with all of his players scoring in double digits. High flyers included Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., who pulled off an impressive 25 points and became the first player aged 37 or older with 100 receiving yards and a touchdown since Ricky Proehl in 2005, which was apparently a big deal or something, and Saints’ running back Mark Ingram, who earned Wood 21 points. Beresford made great use of her team this week, losing very few points on the bench, but again luck was not in her. 
Minaj and Co. over Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood 163–112
Now for the big scorer of the week. Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal had an admittedly impressive performance this week, and no one will let me forget it. As people keep mentioning, his wide receiver Julio Jones singlehandedly tied one of my whole teams with 48 points. Jones made history in our league for the most points scored by a single player and out in the real world by becoming the sixth player in history to record at least 300 receiving yards in a single contest. Courtesy of Wood I finally know what that means. Just because the deities of fantasy football like to be unfair, Tayal also had Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who scored 34 points. I was getting an angry rant all prepared until I saw that he was a Steelers player, so I guess I’ll let it go since he’s one of our boys. The most frustrating part is that Tayal didn’t even max out his potential, losing 15 points by benching running back Isaiah Crowell of the Browns in favor of Chiefs' running back Spencer Ware, who earned a limp 8 points. In the face of this onslaught, Operations Manager Jade Crockem didn’t really stand a chance. Still, she raked up a respectable 112 points with the help of quarterback Derek Carr of the Raiders, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot, and Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. Rumor has it that Elliot could end up being rookie of the year if he keeps up his pace.
Flaming Bears over McManus’s Anus 113–94
And now we have Rosenberg facing off against Publisher Sarah Gutekunst. These two get the award for losing the most points on the bench this week, which I’m a little bit pleased about since I assumed I’d be the one with that distinction. Rosenberg wasted the second highest scorer of the week, quarterback Matt Ryan of the Falcons, favoring the Redskins’ Kirk Cousins’ measly 17 points to Ryan’s 35. Gutekunst made her own blunders, leaving her top two scorers, Seahawk quarterback Russell Wilson and Raider wide receiver Michael Crabtree, on the bench. These aren’t the kinds of performances I’ve come to expect from football guru Gutekunst and my mentor Rosenberg. Hopefully they will both refocus in the coming weeks.
How does this work? over What is going on? 93–48
And, last and least, we get to my mess of a match up. I’d say that there should be rules against having to battle yourself, but I’m pretty sure there are rules against having two teams in the first place. My complete lack of commitment to this league finally caught up to me this week. To be fair the meager performance of How does this work? wasn’t completely my fault since all but one of my players never broke 15 points, but I lost 24 points through pure neglect when I didn’t substitute in wide receiver John Brown of the Cardinals for Bills wide receiver Sammy Watkins when he ended up on injury reserve at the start of the week due to a foot injury. I really don’t have anything to say about What is going on? With two of my players out with injuries and wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins of the Texans only managing to eek out one point in the whole week, it was an absolute mess. But never fear! I’ve taken a peek at the coming week’s scoreboard and, spoiler alert, I’m doing quite a bit better.

Five weeks have passed in the 2016 NFL season, and some are suggesting that the fall of professional football is imminent. Concerns first rose when the season opening game between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers drew in 8 percent fewer viewers than last year’s showdown between the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers and 6 percent fewer viewers than 2014’s opener between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers. Viewership figures did not improve. Throughout the first four weeks of the season, overall viewership was down 11 percent, and viewership among 18–49 year old people declined by 12 percent.
The NFL itself is apparently unconcerned by these numbers. “While our partners, like us, would have liked to see higher ratings, they remain confident in the NFL and unconcerned about a long-term issue,” NFL senior executives Brian Rolapp and Howard Katz said in a memo to team owners. They noted that over the last 15 years, ratings viewership has grown 27 percent and that football “continues to be far and away the most powerful programming on television and the best place for brands and advertisers.”
Rolapp and Katz attributed the decline in viewership to the “unprecedented interest in the Presidential election.” They pointed to a decline during the 2000 election between Republican nominee George W. Bush and Democratic nominee Al Gore as precedence for an election that drew away viewers from the NFL. Indeed, it does appear that this year’s contest between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump has garnered substantial attention among American TV viewers. Though Trump has protested the time of the first presidential debate for coinciding with a Monday Night Football game between the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints, the first presidential debate drew in 84 million viewers, surpassing the previous 80.6 million viewer record from the 1980 debate between Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter.
Evidently, the intensity of the current presidential election does explain some of the NFL’s viewership woes, but other trends seem to have some speculating whether or not this decline in viewership will be reversed. Some have cited the NFL’s uneven allowance of expression as a reason why some fans have stopped watching football games. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stands out among players protesting the National Anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The league itself seems to believe this is a good thing, claiming “that the perception of the NFL and its players is actually up in 2016.”
This may be true among the public at large; however, critics have been angered at the apparent approval of this show of support for a political movement while the league forbade the Dallas Cowboys from wearing a decal in support of the Dallas police department.
The league gave a good reason for this decision. "There are so many wonderful, wonderful causes, the league has to be careful," NFL executive vice president Stephen Jones said when he had been asked about the possibility of the Cowboys wearing the decal in games. "If you allow one, then what do you do about every team that has a great reason to have something on their helmets?” Nevertheless, there is a considerable number of people who view the NFL as taking sides in a political matter, and these people may be protesting by denying the NFL the viewership it needs to keep advertisers happy.
The two points of potential controversy I wrote about in an article from Jan. 24 remain sticking points for the NFL. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s handling of the Deflategate scandal stemming from the 2014 AFC Championship Game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Patriots has led many to question the fairness of the league’s disciplinary actions and appeal system. Though the NFL Game Operations Manual stipulated that altering the inflation of a football outside of regulations would incur a $25,000 fine, Goodell chose to make an example of the Patriots by suspending quarterback Tom Brady for four games, stripping the team of two draft picks, and fining the team $1 million. Though Goodell finally won at the U.S. Court of Appeals and Brady decided to serve his suspension, the damage has already been done to the credibility of the commissioner. In making a mountain out of a molehill and rejecting many scientists’ views regarding the matter, Goodell has turned off many who feel like drama off the field may make as much of an impact as the players on the field.
Further adding to the league’s viewership dilemma is the impact that player safety has had on rule changes and public perception. During the offseason, the NFL adjusted the starting point for drives after a touchback on a kickoff or punt from the 20-yard line to the 25-yard line. In an effort to minimize the possibility of injury during kickoffs and punts, the NFL has potentially only drawn the ire of fans who believe NFL leadership is changing the nature of the game away from being a contact sport. For those fans who want to see action, alternatives like hockey become more appealing, drawing viewership away from football. Furthermore, such a move really doesn’t do much to address the reality of player safety concerns; it may in fact give the aura to those concerned by the violence that the league is only paying lip service to this critical issue, negatively impacting the reputation of the league.
It’s still too early to tell whether this dip in viewership is a temporary result of the election cycle or a fundamental shift in viewership taste. As many statisticians would surmise, the small sample size of four weeks of football is not enough to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding the state of the game. It is worth monitoring to see whether or not football’s status as the top sport in the United States will change.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s cross country team hosted their home invitational in Schenley Park on Saturday, and won the 8k race for the fifth straight year.
    An unassociated runner crossed the finish line first, but the Tartan runners were the first of the NCAA affiliated runners to cross. The first runner to cross the line for the Tartans is also one of the youngest on the team: first-year Josh Kalapos finished the race in 26:48.7. His teammate, junior Jordan Safer, fell behind just before the end of the race and ended up taking second with a time of 26:48.9.
    The young runners for the Tartans showed up big in this race, as the third runner to finish for the Tartans, first-year Evan Yukevich, also took third place with a time of 26:52.4. As the runners continued to coast past the finish line, Carnegie Mellon jerseys were the only colors in sight. The fourth place runner in the race was also from Carnegie Mellon, and its no surprise that it was another first-year student. Stephen Law took the fourth place spot with a time of 26:9.6.
    Sophomore Kevin Cory rounded out the top finishers for the Tartans in the fifth place spot with a time of 27:03.0 and he ensured the Tartans held all of the first five places. First-year Liam Walsh wasn’t far behind though, and he finished eighth overall with a time of 27:19.6. Senior Steven Kool was the final Tartan to finish the race in the top 10 with a time of 27:25.5.
    One thing is for sure, when the Tartans run on their home turf they always dominate the competition. The Tartan runners should be proud after placing seven runners in the top 10, and they’ll look to improve on that in the next meet on Saturday, October 15 at the Inter-Regional Rumble hosted by Oberlin College.

Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team traveled to New York University on Saturday for a University Athletic Association (UAA) match. The Tartans were victorious by a score of 1–0, improving their UAA record to 1–1 and their overall record to 7–3–1.
Junior Haili Adams scored the only goal of the night for the Tartans. In the 52nd minute she shot from about 20 yards out and it went right past the keeper. This goal was her sixth of the season and was assisted by junior Sienna Stritter. First–year goalkeeper Mia Keyser had three saves in the match and earned her second career win. 
The Tartans will remain on the road, and their next match is against the University of Rochester on Friday, Oct. 14. The match is scheduled to start at 5 p.m.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon University women’s tennis team played two matches at home on Saturday, and easily took the win in both. The first match was against Oberlin College and was played at The Club for Sport and Health in Monroeville, PA due to inclement weather. The Tartans won by a scoreline of 8–1
In singles play against Oberlin, the Tartans only dropped one match. Senior Nicholle Torres won 3–6, 6–1, 11–9. Junior Cori Siddell took her set 6–1, 6–2. First–year Vinaya Rao swept her opponent 6–0, 6–0, while her classmate Courtney Ollis won immediately after her 6–4, 7–5. Junior Katie Lai rounded out the singles for the Tartans as she won 4–6, 6–2, 10–5.
The Tartans swept doubles play against Oberlin. The pair of Torres and Siddell played first and won 8–4. The sophomore pair of Marina Selenica and Jamie Vizelman played in the second doubles match and won 8–2, and the first–year pair of Rao and Ollis closed out the match with a close 8–6 victory.
The second match of the day moved to the Carnegie Mellon campus tennis courts, where the Tartans took on Christopher Newport University and swept them 9–0.
In singles, Selenica finished first with a score of 6–4, 6–0. Vizelman was next from the third position with set scores of 6–1, 6–2. In the fifth position, Ollis won her set 6–3, 6–3. Sidell was next to win with scores of 6–1, 6–4, and Torres won shortly after, 6–3, 6–4. Rao was the last to finish her singles match with scores of 7–5, 6–1.
In doubles play, the pair of Rao and Ollis finished first and won 8–2. Next to finish were sophomore Minami Makino and Vizelman, who won 8–4. Torres and Siddell won the final match of the day, 8–6.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team traveled to Washington, PA on Saturday for a close game against President’s Athletic Conference (PAC) opponent Washington and Jefferson College. The Tartans fought hard but ended up falling to the Presidents 55–52 in double overtime. This loss moves the Tartans to 2–3 on the season.
Carnegie Mellon was forced to kick a field goal in the double overtime period and made it, but could not stop the Presidents’ offense and they went on to complete a short pass for the game–winning touchdown. 
Sophomore quarterback Alex Cline led the passing attack for the Tartans with 285 passing yards and three touchdowns while junior running back Sam Benger led the team on the ground as usual with 160 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Junior wide receiver John Prather had the best performance of his career with 177 receiving yards and a touchdown.
Defensively, the Tartans were led by the core pair of junior linebackers Stanley Bikulege and Kyle Brittain. Brittain had 10 tackles while Bikulege had nine. Each of them had a sack, and seniors Malcolm Guya and Brian Khoury also contributed one sack each. Khoury now holds Carnegie Mellon’s all–time sack record at 25.
Next week, the Tartans travel to Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania to try and redeem this week’s loss. The game is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 15 at 7 p.m.

Prospective students applying to the School of Computer Science for the  Fall 2017 semester will now be able to select computational biology as a major. Previously under the jurisdiction of the Mellon College of Science, the computational biology major complements the computational biology department’s master’s and Ph.D. programs. According to the university news report that announced the introduction of this major, the redesigned curriculum aims to provide students with strong foundations in the natural sciences and highlight certain features of computer science that are relevant to biological studies. 
Given the growth in the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries, along with the increasing demand for professionals that can better apply computational approaches to problems in the natural sciences, this new curriculum aims to prepare students for those lucrative, in-demand positions. The curriculum entails four subject cores: math/statistics, biology, computer science, and computational biology. It has a significant overlap with a typical pre-med curriculum, which allows students to venture into healthcare professions as well as biomedical research. Furthermore, this major allows students to choose to obtain a Ph.D. in computational biology to deal with higher-order questions faster than they would with only a computer science degree or only a degree in biology. The students will be exposed to techniques in problem solving such as machine learning, data analysis, and computational modeling, as well as to the biological foundations. 
The aim of this program, according to Robert F. Murphy, head of the computational biology department, is to “provide a curriculum designed to train students to tackle the biomedical problems of the next century through rigorous training in both computer science and biology.” He said, “The program provides a path for students interested in biology to pursue it within one of the leading computer science institutions in the world. An important goal in designing the curriculum was to retain the outstanding grounding in computer science associated with the [computer science] major while making room for additional coursework.”
Phillip Compeau, an assistant teaching professor in the computational biology department will be the Program Director for the incoming computational biology majors next fall.
Quoted in a news report by the computational biology department, Andrew Moore, the Dean of the School of Computer Science, said “Computer science increasingly is driving the research agendas in any number of disciplines, including biomedical research. That’s why it’s especially important for a degree program in computational biology to be within our school, providing the computational perspective for which we are famous.” It is expected to reinvent the current major. This new undergraduate major derives from the computer science major, which is currently the only undergraduate major offered by the School of Computer Science, and was established in 1989, and from the computational biology graduate major in the Mellon College of Science, which was established in 1987.

“But, if you make it to the Junior Olympics for riflery there’s an all-you-can-eat ice cream bar at the training center.”
I’ve been around the sport of precision riflery since the age of ten, when my sister first convinced me to join the sport in pursuit of the all-you-can-eat ice cream bar found at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
When the words rifle, gun, and shooting are heard together more often than not they are associated with negative images — I’d like to explain how the sport of precision riflery actually works. Precision riflery is a sport that is run on a national scale by organizations like USA Shooting (the governing Olympic organization in the United States) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association in every state of the United States — these organizations help run matches for junior and collegiate competitors all the way through senior level members.  Disciplines differ for competitors, though, as one can compete in air rifle or small-bore rifle.
On a junior member level, participants compete in year-round matches that culminate in the Junior Olympic Regional Competitions in December. If shooters do well they can go to the Junior Olympics. 
Frequently in the sport, collegiate-age contenders move on to the Olympics through qualifications. This year the United States sent fourteen people to the Olympics for air gun, small-bore, and shotgun. 
In particular, 19-year-old Virginia Thrasher, a first-year at West Virginia University, won gold in air rifle. Standard indoor precision riflery matches for juniors consist of using .22 caliber long barrel rifles to shoot at targets 50 feet away. Competitors stand behind a designated firing line where a match director (referee) dictates timing and position for the match. There are three positions in the sport: prone, standing, and kneeling. In prone position the competitor lays on a mat on the ground, on their elbows and has the rifle attached using a sling to his upper arm. In standing position, the competitor is upright and at a right angle to the firing line and holds the gun at shoulder height. In kneeling position, the competitor sits on one ankle and props the other knee up, using it to support the weight of the rifle as it points down range. 
Additionally, a sitting position may be added during particular outdoor matches or unique indoor matches.
In a basic three-position match each competitor shoots prone, standing, and kneeling once for twenty shots and then changes position. Variations of the positions can occur, though. For example, long outdoor prone matches are very common among new shooters as well as popular among seniors. On the Olympic level, the gold medal winner scores in the upper 590 range to win overall. This year, Thrasher scored a 599 out of 600, winning gold for America.
“What’s most attractive of rifle is the mental side of the sport,” said Thrasher in an NBC Olympics article. “Anyone can go and hit a 10, it’s not that hard. To go and shoot 10 after 10 after 10 in a big event is very hard. You have to have a mastery of the mental side, controlling your emotions, following your process and not thinking of the outcome.” Equipment for the sport is also very important. Participants wear heavy, stiff suits that restrict motion because when concentrating on a target 50 feet away, limiting movement is the key to accuracy. With a center of the bullseye the size of a period in 12-point font, everything counts. Additionally, specialized hats, gloves, and shooting shoes are worn. 
Some athletes learn to slow their heart rates down the point where they can take shots in between beats so that when looking through their sites their heart rate does not make their site picture change.
Precision riflery is a sport that requires intense concentration and training, but is professionally recognized on a global scale.

In April, Donald Trump suggested that the election might be rigged in favor of his opponent — Hillary Clinton. Surroundng this scare were reports of Russians hacking, albeit unsuccessfully, into Arizona and Illinois’ voter registration systems. While most of these claims are just hearsay, it is important to consider the security of the data of the voting process especially now, that we are moving to electronic systems. 
Most of the problems surrounding electronic voting machines are the problems surrounding any electronic machine such as password-guessing, equipment malfunction, software errors and machine tampering to name a few. Current voting system machines use Windows XP or older, for which Microsoft hasn’t released a security patch availible to the public since early 2014. Not only is this a usability issue, this is also a security problem. Hackers with malicious intent can easily break into an outdated system and tamper with the data, and hence the votes. 
Also, machines that are connected using a Wi-Fi network could be accessed without authorization by tapping into the communication channel. This method is quite similar to riding on public Wi-Fi to hack the computers connected to it. Another method, as mentioned in a report by CNN Money, is to acquire the voter access card that some machines use to identify the voter and tamper with that. In a demonstration by Symantec to CNN Money, a small, portable machine was used to hack into and physically reprogram the card, to allow it to cast multiple votes or votes of only one kind. 
Besides tampering with votes, malicious hackers can influence the election process by deleting, changing or adding voter records, cyber bullying employees setting up the election and modifying data on campaign websites. 
Furthermore, the lack of recounts that are actually meaningful and can reassure the public of the counting process the way recounting paper ballots does, in the case of doubts is also a concern while making a switch to electronic voting machines. Thus, though switching to electronic voting machines is a change for the best, it brings its own set of problems, which is why it is important to pass safety regulations and place electronic voting machines in the category of critical infrastructure that includes banks, power grids, hospitals etc. New policies that enforce strict security parameters will help reinstate public faith in the election system.

The storm water tanks installed under the Mall, which is the lawn located between Hamerschlag Hall and the College of Fine Arts lawn, aims to help reduce flooding in that area during severe storms by collecting storm water runoff from existing downspouts and catch basins near Doherty, Wean, Baker, and Porter halls. 
As reported in The Piper, an official publication by the Internal Communications Department at Carnegie Mellon University, this collection system is comprised of four concrete and waterproof sectioned tanks; each of them being 80 feet in length, 16 feet in width, and 10 feet in height. Collectively, these tanks, which are 416 sq. meters in surface area, can store up to 275,000 gallons of water. The water collected can be reused for the campus chilled water cooling systems, and excess water will be diverted to the city storm water system which is situated downstream of campus buildings, which eventually drains into the Allegheny River, according to Facilities Management Services and Campus Design and Facility Development.
The area of the Mall, which is low-lying, was severely flooded during the major storms in 2004, 2009, and 2011. The Mall Stormwater Management Project is a major sustainability effort the university has conducted to manage stormwater in a way that is constructive for both the campus and the city. A construction crew began excavating the Mall in early May and the site was completely restored in mid-August. The huge dig process, involving a 550-ton crane, was completed in June.
According to Stormwater Report, because of its hilly terrain, generally poor soil quality, and growing land development, stormwater management is one of the major concerns in southwestern Pennsylvania. Generally, Pittsburgh faces a high flood risk throughout the year. Not only does this excess storm water log the municipal systems and create health, economic, and environmental challenges, it also violates the Environmental Protection Agency’s federal Clean Water Act. According to an article by Environment at CMU, the website for environment and sustainability efforts, Pittsburgh’s frequent rainfall as well as melting snow also causes this problem. The article states that “untreated sewage streams into waterways, overflows from manholes or backs up into homeowners’ basements.” In fact, stormwater runoff is the United States’ most common cause of water pollution.
According to Environment at CMU, Carnegie Mellon University has suffered millions of dollars from damage caused by stormwater in the recent years, and has adopted many practices to prevent stormwater damage. For instance, the Purnell Center has a 10,000-gallon stormwater cistern installed on the roof to slow down the flow of storm water. In the Gates Hillman Complex, there is a 10,000-gallon tank that collects rain water and supplies the water for toilets. 
In the Morewood Gardens parking lot, there is a dry well installed for run-off that empties into a vegetative swale and a concrete dam. The Cohon Center has a 6,000-gallon water collection tank that is used for flushing toilets and for irrigation. In addition, Carnegie Mellon University has many buildings with Green Roofs, which refers to roofs that are living or vegetated.
According to Facilities Management Services and Campus Design and Facility Development, the storm water tanks installed under the Mall have the capacity to store rain from a 500-year event with empty tanks. As of the beginning of the semester, the project has been completed and moves the campus closer to the idea of sustainability, reusing the resources already around us.

Human infant brain flexibility attributed to neuron movement
A human infant’s brain remains malleable for a few months after birth, and the mass migration of a large group of nerve cells may be the explanation. Before birth, most of the brain’s nerve cells, called neurons, move to the frontal lobe of the brain. As an infant interacts with the world around them, the neurons react and link together, forming circuits that are malleable. This newly discovered mass migration of neurons may explain why the circuits remain so malleable within the first few months.
“In the first six months, that’s kind of [infants’] critical period when they slowly develop their response to [their] environment. They start to engage with emotions,” says Eric Huang, a neuropathologist at the University of California, San Francisco and co-author of the study. “Our results provide a cellular basis for postnatal human brain development and how cognition might be developed.”
When examining slices of postmortem infant brains under an electron microscope, the researchers found a group of cells making migration proteins. To confirm this, they tagged the cells with a virus containing a glowing protein and observed the neurons’ migration through the brain. The research was published in Science.

Hurricane Matthew travels Caribbean to coastal U.S.
Hurricane Matthew, which began as a tropical cyclone and transformed into the first Category 5 Atlantic hurricane since 2007, is now making its way up the southeast coast of the United States. Hurricane Matthew originated on Sept. 22 from a tropical wave off Africa and developed into a tropical storm a week later. 
On Sept. 29, it became classified as a hurricane, reaching peak strength as a Category 5 the next day. The hurricane made landfall in Haiti and Cuba on Oct. 4 as a Category 4 hurricane.
The storm has killed hundreds of people in the Caribbean Islands, including Haiti, Jamaica, The Bahamas, Cuba, and Dominican Republic. Hurricane Matthew made landfall near Florida on Oct. 7. So far, at least six people in Florida have died, with over 2 million urged to evacuate. The storm is currently making landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane after having passed through Florida and Georgia. Serious concerns include flooding. “It’s not just about the beaches. It’s (also) inland where we can have loss of life,” said North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory during a Saturday morning news conference. As of Sunday morning, the death toll in North Carolina has risen to seven.

Gecko’s adhesive pads hold key to rapid evolution
Researchers lead by Timothy Higham, an associate professor of biology at the University of California, Riverside, have studied a species of gecko that may explain where a gecko’s adhesive toe and finger pads evolved from. The researchers were examining a genus of dwarf gecko when they came across Gonatodes humeralis in South America. They found that the gecko had microscopic hairs, called setae, underneath its toes, giving it the ability to cling to smooth surfaces, unlike other Gonatodes geckos that rely on complex toe structure.
“In the lab, this gecko can climb smooth vertical surfaces using its incipient adhesive system,” Higham said. This is made possible through the attractive van der Waals forces between the setae and the surface. “The relatively simple adhesive system of the G. humeralis is indicative that slight modifications in form can dramatically influence functional outcomes and the ecological niches that can be exploited.” The research also indicates that the adhesiveness of geckos occurred gradually, suggesting that subtle morphological changes can result in rapid evolution. 
The results of the study were published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

Theory that ancient Earth warmed through methane incorrect
About a billion years ago, our sun was 10-15 percent dimmer than it is today — not enough to warm a planet for the microscopic bacteria developing in the ocean. Atmospheric scientists believed it was the greenhouse gas methane, which traps heat 34 times better than carbon dioxide, that kept enough heat trapped in the atmosphere to keep oceans liquid instead of freezing over.
However, a new modeling study from the Alternative Earths team of the NASA Astrobiology Institute has a different idea. “A proper accounting of biogeochemical cycles in the oceans reveals that methane has a much more powerful foe than oxygen,” said Stephanie Olson, a member of the Alternative Earths team and lead author of the new study. “You can’t get significant methane out of the ocean once there is sulfate.” It is hypothesized that sulfate first appeared after oxygen was introduced into the atmosphere, triggering oxidative weathering of rocks. Sulfate not only limits the production of methane, but it also destroys it directly. Now scientists must revisit what gas could have the same effect.
The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

New, prehistoric shark related to Megaladon found
Scientists have discovered a new species of prehistoric shark that poses more questions than it answers in regards to relating prehistoric sharks to modern ones. This shark is presumed to be over 20 million years old and believed to have grown 12 feet in length, which is still smaller than our own great white shark.The shark, called Megalolamna paradoxodon, is a descendent of Megalodon, an ancient shark that grew to around 60 feet. However, 45 million years separate the two, leaving a large gap of time in the fossilization record. 
Scientists have found fossilized teeth of Paradoxodon on the east and west coast of North America, the coast of Japan, and in South America. Although the fossilized teeth bare some resemblance to the teeth of modern sharks, such as the salmon shark, the relationship is unlikely. Scientists have determined that Paradoxodon belongs to the Otodus genus of sharks. Megalodon had previously been classified in the Carcharocles genus, but this is the first concrete evidence to suggest this might not be the case.
The findings were published in the journal Historical Biology.

Facebook Messenger app gets encryption
One of Facebook’s distinguishing features is its private messaging app, Facebook Messenger. Recently, Facebook has introduced “Secret Conversation” to all 900 million Facebook Messenger users. Although messages were already secure, Secret Conversation ensures that messages can be encrypted from one device to another, with not even Facebook or law enforcement and intelligence agencies monitoring them.
When a user first receives an encrypted conversation on Facebook Messeger, a description states, “Your messages are already secure, but secret conversations are encrypted from one device to another. You can choose to make these messages disappear, and you can still report conversations even after a short time after the messages have disappeared.”
Facebook Messenger is only one of the most recent apps utilizing encryption to increase the security of messages while also mandating that the new layer of encryption must be mannually enabled for each conversation; others include WhatsApp and the Signal app.

Musician, composer, and singer, Bjork has the art world around her finger. You’ve probably seen the infamous swan dress she wore to the Academy Awards in 2001, or heard the rumor that Iceland gave her a private island to thank her for her cultural contributions. Her path to stardom started at the humble age of 12. In an interview with the Polar Music Prize, Bjork described the routine of her 30-minute walk to school through the winding hills of Iceland, singing all the way. Bjork was also the frontwoman for celebrated Icelandic punk band the Sugarcubes, before embarking as a solo artist in 1992.
In tandem with her ninth album released in 2015, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) produced a retrospective of Bjork’s work. Addressing a question never explored at this scale: “how do you put music on the walls of a museum?” the MoMA turned to Bjork’s archive of film, costumes, visuals, and objects to fill the galleries. Collaborating with directors Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze, and designers like Iris van Herpen, each of Bjork’s music videos functions as a diorama, pulling you deeper into the world she shapes through her lyrics. Interested in pushing the relationship between music, visuals and technology even farther, MoMA commissioned two music videos from Vulnicura directed by Andrew Thomas Huang of Black Lake. Perhaps the most haunting and vulnerable song on the album is Stonemilker, shot in 360-degree virtual reality. Vulnicura documents the heartache of her separation from her partner of thirteen years, and fellow artist, Matthew Barney. Footnotes in the album book mark the chronology of their breakup. In Stonemilker, surrounded by the vast rocky terrain of Iceland, Bjork looks straight into the camera singing, “a juxtaposition in fate/ find our mutual coordinates… show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect” Her asymmetrical florescent yellow dress accentuates her motions as she waves her arms. A juxtaposition that can be seen in many of her songs, Bjork’s performance has a strength and whimsical presence as she sings a declaration of heartache.
Themes like the power, vastness of nature, heightened emotions, technology, and exploration of the human psyche remain constant in Bjork’s work. As we further embark into the digital age, technology is not only a tool, but a necessity to participate in contemporary culture and industry. In an interview with Creative Review, Bjork discussed her connection to technology as a maker, “I feel it is important that the artist helps define it and mold it. Because who else is going to put humanity and soul into it?” Bjork is not defining this on her own though. Collaborating with writers, software developers, artists, designers, and musicians, Bjork released a multimedia interactive music app that allows you to explore her 2011 album, Biophilia in 3D space through videos, games, essays, and interfaces that allow you to create your own mixes from instruments used in each of the songs. It is now being used in public middle school education across Iceland and other parts of Scandinavia.
Her eclectic sound influenced by dance, electronic, pop, classical, and avant-garde music isn’t for everyone, but the relevance and power of her voice holds a lot of weight in shaping the path of contemporary music and interdisciplinary art. Regardless, anyone can appreciate the artistry of the costumes, visuals, and videos that frame her songs. Bjork addresses how we understand ourselves and our roles in a global and information-saturated society suspended in complexities of natural and digital environments to a degree I haven’t seen any other artist do.

On Friday evening, hundreds of staff, students, and community members packed into the College of Fine Arts (CFA) theaters to hear musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony play. The audience did not pay a cent for the nearing-on-two hours of entertainment. And the musicians, despite looking and playing their best, were not paid for their efforts.
Negotiations for a renewed three year contract between the musicians and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Inc. (PSO) Management began in February, extended two weeks beyond contract renewal, and continued for another two weeks with federal negotiators until the musicians' strike began Friday, Sept. 30. Management will not budge from their final offer of a dramatically-reduced salary, modified retirement plans, and reduced orchestra personnel.
These cuts, if accepted, would be devastating to the future of the Pittsburgh Symphony. As one of the ten best symphonies in the country, respected and acclaimed worldwide, the group boasts some of the best musicians. The dramatic drop in salary would put the PSO's pay on par with symphonies of much less caliber. With these cuts, "we would not be able to recruit and retain the same types of musicians that we have now," Micah Howard, chair of the Pittsburgh Symphony Musicians Committee, says in a press release with TribLIVE. This pay drop would not only discourage newcomers from joining, but would also drive top talent to other orchestras.
Management seems adamant on these changes, however. All concerts have been canceled until Oct. 27. On Tuesday, management released a statement declaring its intent to hire out other musicians in the community to replace the orchestra, in an effort to bring music to its patrons. Members of the community recognize this as a scare tactic. "Pittsburgh's community [of musicians] is so tight," Lisa Levinson said. "There's no way anyone is willing to walk through the picket lines." Levinson, a Pittsburgh native, has been a part of the music community since 1980 and has bought ticket subscriptions to PSO concerts for 35 years.
The musicians are not staying silent, however. Picketers in bright yellow "Musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony" T-shirts have swarmed Heinz Hall ever since the strike began, including members of the symphony, community members, and dozens of Carnegie Mellon students. The musicians have also been putting on free concerts and playing in the streets. A brass quartet serenaded passersby in front of downtown restaurants last weekend in lieu of the John Williams concert, and musicians also performed outside the Pittsburgh courthouse. On the PSO's annual day of giving, Tuesday, the musicians organized and put on 11 free concerts, making their own "Day of Music" thanking the community for their support.
The performance that should have taken place in Heinz Hall on Friday was dubbed "CMU night at the PSO" and is a standing tradition; School of Music students annually attend one show at the symphony en masse in celebration of our strong relationship. Nearly all private instrumental instructors are also members of the PSO, as well a large number of the chamber music coaches. The show at Heinz Hall was canceled, but the musicians, who believe that "the show must go on," organized the concert Friday night in Kresge Theatre, asking for students' help in publicizing the event to the greater Carnegie Mellon community.
The sisters of Sigma Alpha Iota stood in front of Doherty Hall on Wednesday, handing out flyers to all passersby. Music students set out a table in front of CFA on Friday afternoon, distributing yellow ribbon pins in support of the striking symphony members. And the result was astounding. Not only was Kresge Theater packed, but Alumni Concert Hall (ACH) was utilized as a second performance space. The audience in ACH overflowed the seats, utilizing the periphery aisles and back wall as standing and sitting room. The musicians performed two parallel concerts, staggered twenty minutes apart, to prevent turning audience members away. The concert featured string quartets and octets, an oboe quartet, a woodwind trio, and cello and bass quartets playing music spanning from Mozart to modern-day Piazzolla. Between pieces, the musicians introduced themselves; many attended Julliard and other schools of great musical prestige, and some gained doctorate degrees in music performance or left posts with other orchestras when they were offered positions here. All of the musicians, though, were happy to be part of the PSO, sharing amazing experiences of international tours and genuine gratitude for the opportunity to play with such talented colleagues. And the thanks were bestowed on the audience as well: "we just want to play for you and make you happy," explained Tatjana Mead Chamis, violist and MC for the night in ACH.
The show doesn't end here. The musicians held a free full-scale orchestra concert on Sunday afternoon, playing Dvorak's New World Symphony, Wagner's overture to Die Meistersinger, Telemann's Concerto for Two Violas, and a movement from Mozart's G Major Flute Concerto. The latter two pieces featured students from Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School as soloists.
On the program for Friday night's concert were a few pieces of Entartete Musik, which translates to "degenerate music." Like a large portion of artists in the World War II era, many Germanic composers and musicians were labeled as "degenerate" due to their heritage; they fled Germany, and performing their work was banned. Chamis describes that musical arts "skipped a generation" in Germany, Vienna, and other affected areas, as the fine musicians had been driven away.
If the PSO disbands, or the dramatic cuts proposed by management are forced upon them, such a diaspora is conceivable for music in Pittsburgh. The fates of the musicians will obviously be much different than those under the Third Reich, but Pittsburgh's top musical talent will move elsewhere. Not only will this affect the course and quality of the PSO, but this will send shock waves through the community. In Carnegie Mellon's School of Music, a large portion of the technical training that instrumentalists receive is from the musicians of the PSO, some of the best in the world. In the case of PSO's collapse, the quality of a Carnegie Mellon musical education will crumble.
Although we see overwhelming support of the musicians from the Pittsburgh community, the strike has not been resolved. To learn more about events held by PSO musicians in the future, how to support the musicians, or for more information please visit http://musiciansofthepso.org, or the Facebook page Musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

Psychedelic lights, cat statues sitting on laptops, naked mannequins spotted with polka dots: just some stuff you might find in an indie music video or Urban Outfitters, right? Well, yeah, but there are also three apartment-style buildings in Northside Pittsburgh filled with these kinds of things. Also known as The Mattress Factory, this is a contemporary art museum that is made up of three buildings that display works representing different cultures, social issues, and trends from all over the world. It was my first time visiting and I can easily say that this place is one of a kind. 
In the main building on 500 Sampsonia Way, I first walked into a room with lighting similar to that in Drake’s "Hotline Bling" music video. It eventually led me to the admission desk, where my friend Noni Tinglin-Jarrett, a first-year College of Engineering student, and I got a map of all the exhibits throughout the three buildings. We decided to work our way down from the fourth floor. Once we got up to the fourth floor, we started hearing the sounds of policemen. The noises were coming from a fairly new exhibit titled Active Denial System, by Christopher Meerdo. This displayed screens showing footage of active policemen and protests. Another notable piece on the floor, titled The Great Illusion, focused on the issue of Palestinians in Gaza and their desire for independence. It was created by Mohammed Musallam, and presents pages of Palestinian passports scattered on barbed wire fence, placed in the center and on the ceiling of the room. The fourth floor seemed to have followed the theme of social and global justice, and reminded visitors of a few of the many ongoing issues that people currently deal with around the world. 
As my friend and I continued our visit, we encountered two exhibits made in 1996 on the third floor that ended up being our favorites: "It’s all about ME, Not You" by Greer Lankton and "Infinity Dots Mirrored Room" by Yayoi Kusama. "It’s all about ME, Not You" displayed a bedroom filled with dolls and shrines crafted by Lankton, and was supposed to represent her life before she died from a drug overdose in 1996. There was one doll in particular, that was shown to be suffering from anorexia and drug addiction, with pill bottles scattered all over the bed the doll was lying on. I found this exhibit to be disturbing, yet incredibly fascinating. On the other hand, walking into the "Infinity Dots Mirrored Room" exhibit was a fun time overall. There were two mirrored rooms covered in polka dots: the first one had dimmed lighting which created a party-like atmosphere, and the second one had bright lights and mannequins to make it feel as though you were in a department store (covered in polka dots). Both exhibits were definitely unique and entertaining, so if you ever decide to visit the museum definitely stop by these displays. 
Aside from the many other interesting works found in the main building, the remaining two buildings of The Mattress Factory on 516 Sampsonia Way and 1414 Monterey St. had exhibits just as unique and exciting. The building on 516 Sampsonia Way was an entire exhibit in itself, titled “A Second Home.” It was essentially a home-turned-toy factory, where at every corner of the house there were wooden contraptions, carvings, and models. Seeing this exhibit certainly brought me back to my childhood. The building on 1414 Monterey St. had a similar structure to that of the main building, with many different exhibits displayed on each floor. A personal favorite of mine from this building was an exhibit from this year titled IRIS_SIRI by Kevin Clancy. This one explored the power of technology and its future influences on society. The room displayed a model of a hand continuously scrolling down an iPad screen, a glass box blowing away dollar bills, and cats sitting on top of laptops. Every piece in this exhibit was intriguing, but the theme was a bit concerning since it brought up the almost-limitless power technology can have over our world. 
What made my experience at The Mattress Factory so enjoyable was its unpredictability. No matter the exhibit, there was always some aspect that surprised me or taught me something new. The artwork in the museum makes visitors become more aware of certain topics, or allows them to literally see things that may not be as evident at first glance. If you’re looking for a museum experience that’s not only intellectually stimulating, but also makes you feel cool, then go visit The Mattress Factory.

Sometimes it feels like all there is to do or see lies between the Cathedral of Learning and Beeler. Craig and Walnut are good enough. Who needs to get on a bus that isn't a 61, 71, or 28X? This little region, dare I say "bubble," is safe and comfortable. But alas, there is life outside of Carnegie Mellon, and it's pretty damn cool. You might have to take a bus you've never ridden to a street you've never heard of, but it will be worth it.
Let's say for example, you take an inbound 54 from Craig and Winthrop to Liberty and 25th. You get off and it feels unsafe for a second. Abandoned-looking brick buildings, a big empty parking lot behind wide empty sidewalks, smoke pouring out of a stack. But then you locate the chrome bastion of the Pittsburgh Opera. You look around again and begin to notice smaller signs of life. This is the Strip District.
The heart of the Strip lies in just about a half square mile, from 16th to 25th between the Allegheny River and Liberty Ave. The other heart of the Strip is food.
Back when Pittsburgh thrived on manufacturing, the Strip was prime real estate — right on the river and the railroad. Giants like U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, and Heinz did their business on those streets, and they brought with them all the people who work there. Produce merchants, restaurants, and groceries stores opened up to feed all of the busy people walking through the streets. Today you can still walk those same streets and eat at one of the same spots, and even the newer spots are filled with an authenticity that makes them feel like they've been there just as long.
If you want the old world experience, there's Penn Mac, or Pennsylvania Macaroni Company. Back in 1902, the three Sunseri brothers, newly immigrated from a village in Sicily, started out manufacturing and selling pastas, and then the store grew to include all kinds of delicious Italian imports, like olive oil and cheese. The store is still in the Sunseri family, and, be sure to stop by if you get to the Strip before they close at 4:30, well-worth the trip, if only to ogle all the treats before going to dinner. Penn Mac itself is an experience.
Down a couple blocks is another specialty grocery store, Lotus Food Company, reflecting a more recent influx of people. Lotus is an incredible and expansive Chinese-run grocery store on Penn Ave. They have over 20 aisles of kitchenware, packaged foods, candies, spices, noodles, produce, seafood, and more. The store has an undeniable, yet unidentifiable, smell, a blend of anise and something I couldn't figure out. And even better than the smell is the budget. You'll never get vegetables at Giant Eagle for these prices. They even offer discounts if you show your student ID.
You can also go to Labad's Mediterranean Grocery for incredible gyros from a man with an incredible moustache, S&D Polish Deli to score some crispy, buttery pierogies, or Reyna Foods for their famous tortillas and tamales.
Even though the Strip is at its most lively in the late morning and early afternoon, there are some awesome dinner and drink spots.
For dinner I decided to splurge a little at Kaya, a part of the Big Burrito restaurant group. I got there at 7 p.m., a half hour too late to partake in the best happy hour in Pittsburgh: all single serving drinks are half off from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Friday! Regardless, I still indulged in a cocktail called Smoke and Ginger, which I highly recommend to tequila lovers and no one else. The smoky mezcal and spicy ginger liqueur are offset by hibiscus, lime, and orange bitters. Not to mention, the bright hibiscus pink is a really exciting drink color!
For dinner, I wanted to try more than one thing. I picked a small plate of bright citrus-y shrimp and scallop ceviche paired with a bowl of warm and creamy conch and corn chowder. I've never had conch before, but years of watching [ITAL]Top Chef[ITAL] have made me curious. Not only was it the perfect amount of food, but I felt like I was a block away from bright blue waves, home to tomorrow night's dinner! The next time I go back I've already decided on the fish tacos. And if you ever make your way to Kaya, ask to sit in Chas's section.
Other awesome dinner spots include: Bar Marco for a stellar selection of wines and cocktails with modern decor and cuisine, Penn Ave. Fish Company for high quality seafood dishes and affordable sushi like the Sexy Señorita or Lollipop rolls, or Smallman Galley, an incubator that features four different restaurants on a rotating basis.
If you're feeling some withdrawal from your comfort zone, Pamela's is there to serve up a tall stack of hotcakes. La Prima is there to roast, grind, and brew espresso to its normal level of perfection. Primanti Brothers is there to pervert the boundaries of a sandwich.
But in a neighborhood like the Strip, there are too many boundary-pushing options to settle for something you've already tried. While you're out of your Carnegie Mellon Bubble, do as many things as you can that feel weird to you. Stop and talk to a stranger. Walk down an empty alley and check out the graffiti. Try a food you've never tasted, or a food you've never heard of. Don't settle for what you know when what you don't know could be so much cooler.

It was a dark and stormy Friday night.  For any other event, the sudden evening rain would have been a nightmare.  But it perfectly fit the vibe that the Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh was looking for during their Nightmare on Hellsworth.
Sponsored by pro-LGBT non-profit organization Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh, gay bar Element, and iHeartRadio’s 96.1 KISS — Pittsburgh, Nightmare on Hellsworth kicked off October and the Halloween festivities with their free concert, featuring Zara Larsson, the Swedish singer behind “Never Forget You,” and The Brighton boys, a pop rock band from New Brighton, Pennsylvania.  In between sets, DJ Colt also provided music for the event and kept the crowd lively and entertained during the near torrential onslaught.
The rain, however, didn’t keep people of all ages from being decked out in their Halloween costumes.  Witches, zombies, princesses, and Cats in the Hat roamed the street during the event.  And when it wasn’t pouring, rock stars, the Joker, and the Belchers were also seen grabbing a bite to eat at one of the many bars and restaurants on the street, such as B&B Fired Up Goodness, 5801 Video Lounge and Café, The Elbow Room, Harris Grill, and Tipsy Cow.  Hostesses dressed as Maleficent and nefarious pirates also sold $5 beer at their restaurants, and food truck Bella Christie’s Sweet Boutique sold their delicious desserts at the event.  The sweet treats were not only a hit with the crowd, but also with the security guards and event staff.
Several organizations also set up promotional tents for the event.  Hair Pride offered hair spray for people at the event to use to style their own hair.  LuLaRoe also sold their comfy clothes at the event, selling their bright and colorful leggings, dresses, shirts, and cardigans that are great for any season.  Monster Vape also sold their “premium ejuice,” giving the opportunity for people to learn about vaping.  Sponsor iHeartRadio also set up their own tent and prize wheel, where you could win things from Pittsburgh-themed swag like lanyards and Pirates bottle openers to Taylor Swift 1989 knapsacks.  People of all ages explored the tents and businesses on Ellsworth Avenue, offering additional entertainment between sets and opening up a new market to businesses.
The Brighton Boys’s performance at Nightmare on Hellsworth brought even more liveliness to the rainy night, not afraid to have a great time and jam out with themselves and their fans.  The pop rock band played some of their original songs from their album Love Sentence and their EP MMXV as well as classics such as The Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go” and Foundations of Wayne’s “Stacy’s Mom” and even stayed after their performance to help set up the stage for Zara Larsson and interact with the crowd, bringing a rock and roll vibe to their music and to the energy of the crowd that reverberated throughout the night.
Zara Larsson’s performance was much anticipated throughout the night, and she did not disappoint, performing her instant hits “Never Forget You” and “Lush Life,” songs from her EP Uncover and her new single “Ain’t My Fault.”  Her energy brought out the best in the crowd throughout the rain and closed out the night on a high note and with a ton of energy.
Despite the rain, Nightmare on Hellsworth brought a ton of life and fright to the night, with people actually bonding and dancing through the rain.  The musical acts never failed to hype up the crowd through the storm, and seemed to bond with the crowd in the sudden appearance of the rain and the general good vibes that they wanted to keep up and bring out throughout the entire night.  And in the end, you could even say the Nightmare on Hellsworth felt a little bit like a dream.

Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. I don't feel pressured into buying the best Christmas gifts during Secret Santa and I don't have to explain to my Aunt Whatever-Her-Name-Is at Thanksgiving dinner why I don't have a boyfriend. It's just a time where you can dress up with your friends and buy a ton of really cheap candy on Nov. 1. Now I know what you're thinking. "Woah. Halloween? It's like Oct. 10?" I get it, it's early for Halloween advice. But this is Carnegie Mellon, remember? You close your eyes for two minutes and all of a sudden you've got am exam to study for and two diseases to cure by noon. So it's never too early to start planning. Plus, Target is already selling pumpkin-shaped candy corn, which officially ushers in the Halloween season. So without further ado, here are my Halloween 2016 costume tips.
Ditch the Store-Bought Costumes
If you haven't already, it's time to ditch the store-bought costumes. These costumes are cheaply made yet stupidly expensive. Plus, there are going to be hundreds of scream masks and pirate costumes, and nobody wants to run into themselves at a party. You don't need fancy sewing skills and you really don't even need to be crafty. There are plenty of tutorials online. Give it a try!
Think Outside the Box
There have already been a million and one superman costumes. The world has seen enough. And I know, Hotline Bling was great, but we've seen enough Drakes too. Get creative and think of something new! It's time to step your game up, people. I'm always the most impressed by costumes that I never thought of myself!
Wear a Costume, Not a Culture
While frantically searching for the perfect costume this year, it's going to be easy to get caught up in trying to imitate someone. But let's circumvent any tragically-portrayed Native American "costumes." And definitely try to avoid any "Sexy Geishas" or "Sexy Gypsies." It's best to dress up in a costume, not a culture. Trust me on this one.
Avoid Clowns
A solid go-to costume is usually a clown or, for those who prefer scarier options, killer clowns. But after the mass amounts of yet-to-be-explained clown sightings, it might be best to steer clear of clowns this Halloween. Unless you want to be Ronald McDonald, in which case I personally approve.
Coordinate with Your Friends
If you're having trouble coming up with a solo costume, grab your best friend and coordinate outfits! The number of two person costume options are literally endless. Think of all the iconic duos out there: Ash and Pikachu, Popeye and Olive, Bacon and Eggs, or my personal favorite, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The list goes on and on. And this is arguably the perfect time to nail one last Brangelina costume. Once you get a group together, your costume possibilities increase dramatically, so coordinate with your entire squad! A sure-fire group costume idea is dressing up as the cast of your favorite movie or TV show (cough, cough, Bob's Burgers). But feel free to get creative — I once saw a group of friends dress up as Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde, and chase their PacMan friend around. 
Oh, I almost forgot. No minions. And limit one Harley Quinn costume per friend group.

Dear Sarah,
All of my life doughnuts have been a part of my identity. Not only is fried dough a delight for the senses and the heart alike, it's also part of my geographical heritage.
I'm from Pennsylvania Dutch territory, and when the rest of the country is celebrating Mardi Gras with King Cake and beads, we gluttons stay busy stuffing our faces with fastnachts, or doughnuts fried in lard. A true German treat. The tradition goes that before the joy-sucking sadness of Lent, families would make these doughnuts on steroids in order to clean out the stock of lard and sugar.
In my lifetime, however, Fastnacht day has always just been an excuse to indulge in another local institution: Maple Donuts.
I can't even remember all the family and church gatherings I've attended to that have been flanked by Maple Donuts, sheathed in a crackly layer of sweet powdered sugar glaze, or filled to the gills with a tart seasonal jam. They also have excellent deals on day-olds that cannot be beat for a late-night craving.
So imagine my horror when, home for the summer, I begin to see Maple billboards cropping up with some dipshit Trump lookalike screaming "You're NOT fired, you brought Maple Donuts!" I thought maybe it was a silly joke. But no, in reality, the man who founded this seemingly-perfect enterprise is genuinely a very dedicated Trump supporter.
This has completely marred my relationship with the fried delicacies I once held so dear to my general midsection. I look at a doughnut, and all I can see is a glazed pile of poop. This time, Trump has gone too far.
I don't know how to reconcile such a deep inner-conflict. Please guide me, oh hungry one.
Dried Out Ugly Guy Has Negated Our Tremendous Sweets
Dear DOUGHNOTS,
This is indeed a very unfortunate spot that Maple has put you in. It breaks my heart to hear that a memory so good and pure should be drug through the mud in service of a businessman's personal interests, but that could be my catchphrase these days.
I think that, unfortunately, you can never go back to Maple Donuts. That man does not deserve a penny of your money, even if he makes a damn good doughnut. But that doesn't mean you have to stop eating doughnuts all together.
Take, for instance, Peace, Love & Little Donuts. The owner of one of the franchise locations openly holds very offensive views about homosexuals, which seems a little counter-intuitive to his theme of peace and love. But just as it is his first amendment right to express those beliefs on his personal social media accounts and blogs, it is your right to spend your dollar at the location in Oakland.
There may be no equivalent of Maple Donuts in your hometown, but hey, Dunkin Donuts isn't that bad, and they keep their nose out of politics. You may be eating a worse doughnut, but at least it doesn't benefit an openly terrible person.
This election season we've all had to emotionally break up with Trump supporters that we thought we loved: Aaron Carter, Hulk Hogan, Teresa Guidice, and even Peter Thiel. Cool people that used to be cool. But now we must shun them to make them feel the full consequences of their choices.
Sacrifice your doughnuts, not your principles.
Sarah

On Wednesday, Oct. 5, Campus Police closed off Tech Street and sections of Margaret Morrison Street to prepare for the arrival of Virginia legislator and Vice Presidential candidate Senator Tim Kaine. The event took place the following afternoon and was set up just outside of Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. The exterior of the building was scaled with patriotic banners and an American flag backdrop hung behind the podium along with the Clinton campaign’s slogan, “Stronger Together.”
Kaine was introduced by notable guest speakers such as Pennsylvania State Senator Jay Costa and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf. The politicians both emphasized the importance of voting and encouraged students to register to vote and to volunteer for the campaign. Governor Wolf remarked, “Democracy does not expect a lot of its citizens but the fundamentality of citizenship is to vote.” Pennsylvania is a major swing state in this election cycle, although it has voted with the Democratic nominee in every election since 1992. For an election that has proven to be surrounded by controversy and high stakes, securing Pennsylvania could be a significant victory for either of the candidates.
Once the Virginia senator took the stage, he began by denouncing Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Governor Mike Pence. He drew comparisons between the different visions of the two campaigns, specifically by juxtaposing the books published by the Democratic running mates and by Donald Trump. Kaine claimed that Trump’s book, which was originally titled “Crippled America,” was “fundamentally negative ... which shows what he really thinks about the United States.” He urged the audience to ponder the difference between what the two campaigns represented and to, “consider where the country is going.”
Besides criticizing the Republican ticket, Kaine spoke on several of the topics that were addressed during the Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday night, such as college affordability, immigration reform, women’s health, and taxes. Kaine, who has taken moderate stances on many constitutional issues, asserted during the Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday night that he is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. Kaine’s nomination as the vice presidential nominee on the Democratic ticket could have been a strategic move to secure votes from moderate voters, while Clinton focuses on securing votes from the mid-to-far-left population.
Kaine showed his moderate ideologies once again during the event on campus, when he was discussing Clinton’s policy objectives for women’s health. He assured that, “I’m proud of my faith, but I don’t think my job is to pass laws mandating that everybody follow the doctrines of my church.” He continued, “on these fundamental matters of reproduction and relationships and intimacy, why would we want a big government making these decisions?” Kaine also said that he and Clinton were determined to make it a priority to make college debt-free for American families, with free tuition at in-state levels for families with an annual income of less than $125,000. He also promoted comprehensive immigration reform as well as tax relief to middle class families and small businesses.
Furthermore, Kaine emphasized Carnegie Mellon’s significance in Pennsylvania and its role in creating the policies that he and Clinton hope to achieve in the White House. He reminded the audience that Pittsburgh is the center of American manufacturing, and that Carnegie Mellon University lays at the center of this, as the school has joined the National Network for Manufacturing Institution. He stated that, “the plan for economic growth and manufacturing goes hand in hand with Carnegie Mellon.”
The senator seemed optimistic about the quickly-approaching election day, and referred to himself as a, “rabbit’s foot for good luck,” joking that the reason Clinton picked him to be her running mate was due to him having never lost a political race. Kaine claimed, “I’m 8–0, and we’ll be 9–0 on November 8th.” Despite this seemingly confident attitude, he alleged he was adopting an underdog mentality and the importance of reminding himself that, “I am the underdog until they call me the winner.” Kaine said that his running mate embraced the same mentality, given that she is the first woman to ever be nominated as a presidential candidate in United States history.

On Thursday Oct. 5, a crowd of Pittsburgh community members and Carnegie Mellon students gathered in Margaret Morrison to hear Hiba Krisht’s talk, “Veils, Virginity, and (In)visibility: On Being a Woman in Hezbollah Culture.” A member of the society Ex-Muslims of North America, Krisht spoke of these issues in the context of personal experience.
The religion of Islam is divided into two sects — Shia and Sunni — that differ by belief in who is the true “caliph,” the successor of the prophet Muhammad. Krisht explained that specific cities in Lebanon are heavily dominated by Sunni Muslims and the same is equally true of Shia Muslims. The country isn’t geographically split in two, but the strong religious divide dictates the cultural expectations within each city.
In the beginning of the talk, a photograph of her from when she still lived with her family in Lebanon was projected above Krisht. In the photograph she stood in a hijab; across her torso she held a machine gun. Krisht explained that, from looking at the specific restrictions of her clothing, it’s obvious she was a Shia Muslim. The Shia sect of Islam has stricter expectations of women in covering their body. The only part of the face that may be showing is what’s necessary for functioning. For Krisht, this meant she had to constantly make sure her hair hadn’t slipped out of the scarf, and that the scarf was pinned to hide the jawbone and chin. The scarf had to be draped over her chest and the rest of her clothing had to be loose fitting, covering her arms and legs completely. To ensure that when lifting an arm their wrists do not show, Shia women wear fake sleeves on their forearms. 
In the Shia tradition, girls must wear the hijab from when they are nine lunar years of age; Krisht, like most girls, began wearing the hijab her last summer as an eight-year-old so that she didn’t have to make the transition during the school year. Krisht described that wearing a hijab is more than just a wardrobe addition — it’s adapting to a way of life. Girls are forced to adapt, to wear a hijab to protect their families’ honor; they are taught that their body is shameful and that it must be hidden from men. Being burdened with rigid expectations and beliefs at a prepubescent age doesn’t give girls the opportunity to consider an alternative or even to understand the messages they are being led to believe about their body.
Because of the inequality for women in Muslim culture, the policies surrounding women’s rights can be hard to believe given the societal norms that surround us. If a Muslim woman does not adhere to the Islamic doctrines, it is considered a dishonor to her family. It is acceptable in Muslim culture, even expected, that if a woman demonstrates rebellious behavior, she will be physically punished by her male family members. There are no laws in Lebanon to protect a woman from these crimes. In 2014, after much debate, a law was finally passed stating that “domestic violence” is illegal, but deliberately did not prohibit all violence against women.
It is legal for a man to rape his wife. If a man rapes a woman that is not his wife and is convicted of rape, he can fix his wrongdoing by proposing to his victim. This is because the crime is considered to be against the honor of the woman’s family, not against the woman or her body.
The government in Lebanon not only struggles with issues of human rights, they also often fail to provide necessities like electricity, and have done little to nothing in helping to rebuild the country after the damage from the civil war and the war with Israel. Because of this, in Shia regions like the one Hiba is from, the controlling power is Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim militant group in Lebanon that is the only source of resources in most of the country. Not only do Shia Muslims praise Hezbollah for the salvation they’ve provided, Lebanese Christians and people of many other religious minorities in Lebanon praise Hezbollah.
After growing up suppressed by this culture for eighteen years, Krisht decided she must escape. Unfortunately, Krisht quickly learned through a series of events that there was a lot she didn’t know. First, Krisht was denied access to leaving the country and before she could come up with any alternate plans, Hezbollah officers found her and brought her back to her family. Because her mother had filed a missing person’s report, they had to go to the Lebanese police station to resolve the issue. This is when Krisht learned that there were no laws to protect her from the violence of honor crimes and that she must go back to her family. The last and most disheartening realization was back at school, when she found out that no one in her community was aware of what had just happened — that it was possible other women around her had tried to escape or felt the same way, but had no chance to speak up, for fear of endangering their lives.
Krisht was trapped in Lebanon and she was left with one option, to devote herself to the religion; she realized that the more you adhere to the system, the more the system will provide for you. Krisht was also lucky enough to come from a family that was able to send her to a good university, so she went to the American University of Beirut. She studied philosophy and had to hide from her parents what “philosophy” really meant so that they’d allow her to study it. She didn’t go into great detail about how she escaped Lebanon to get to America, but she did say that it took multiple years of intricate planning to get here.
Now a member of the Ex-Muslims of North America, Krisht shares her opinions on these issues and works to provide a haven for women in Muslim culture whose voices are being silenced.
Her blog can be found on the website of the Ex-Muslims of North America page where she presents unique insight and discussion of Muslim culture. Her passion for these topics shines through in the convincing arguments she presents about Islam in the media. One example is her recent article on the false equivalence of burkinis and bikinis, resulting from the new law in France that bans burkinis as swimsuits. The article and others on similar topics can be found at exmna.org.
The event was organized by Carnegie Mellon’s Humanist League, which meets Thursdays at 4:30 p.m. in Wean 5302; their mantra is “Exploring life’s big questions, Bridging humanity’s differences, Promoting dialogue over dogma.”

A groundbreaking ceremony held last Tuesday marked the start of construction on a new building on campus dedicated to the College of Engineering and to a recent partnership between Carnegie Mellon University and ANSYS. The plans for the anticipated 30,000 square foot facility were made possible by a generous gift from ANSYS, a global company that leads in engineering simulation software and is based near Pittsburgh.
The new ANSYS building will be located near Hamerschlag Hall and will feature a simulation and collaboration lab and a spacious “maker facility” for undergraduate students to build full-scale projects. It will also contain conference rooms, training and lecture space, and offices.
In addition to the space provided, “students will have access to simulation tools and cutting-edge technologies for the hands-on work that is a hallmark of our CMU education,” remarked James Garrett, Dean of the College of Engineering, referring to the modern simulation software and expertise of industry professionals that would be provided by ANSYS.
“Think of a space where you don’t just learn about the academics of how to design something ... but a space where you can get great minds together and you can actually have people conceive products, … assemble them, [and] actually make them using … advanced manufacturing techniques,” said James Cashman, president and CEO of ANSYS.
The ANSYS building’s proximity to Hamerschlag Hall places it next door to the redesigned Hamerschlag MakerWing, which includes fabrication and machining facilities, maker spaces, labs, and collaboration areas, providing a seamless transition from making components to assembling them into larger systems.
“We are grateful to ANSYS for the important educational opportunity this brings to students across our campus,” said Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh. “Through a variety of CMU initiatives, we have seen firsthand that maker spaces help students think more creatively and take a hands-on approach to solving critical problems.”
The collaboration between ANSYS and Carnegie Mellon University was announced in June and emerged from a mutual aspiration to expand the education of engineering students to be better prepared for the workforce, a challenge in a field whose reliance on hands-on skill and experience makes it difficult to teach entirely in a classroom.
It was a partnership that made sense, utilizing the broad intersection of research expertise between two leaders in engineering, computer science, and simulation technologies. At the groundbreaking ceremony, Suresh divulged that he himself had worked on ANSYS simulation software in the past, and so was familiar with the company and their value.
The collaboration is expected to “touch diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, additive manufacturing, biomedical devices, sustainability of physical products and connected products,” according to the ANSYS website.
In addition, the advent of the new ANSYS building reflects a revolution in manufacturing methods and product innovation, referred to as Industry 4.0, that is “changing the way that products are designed and produced,” as described on the College of Engineering website. Traditional methods of developing products involved generating designs, then building and testing prototypes to identify design flaws, referred to as ‘build and break’ cycles. It was “costly, slow, and limiting to product innovation,” according to Cashman, since if a prototype didn’t work, an engineer could potentially have to start the process from scratch.
Industry 4.0, heralded as the fourth industrial revolution, incorporates the use of physics-based computational tools to digitally test and discard millions of alternative product designs and materials, without restriction, to pinpoint an optimal model for a product before a physical prototype is even built. The prototype becomes a final validation, rather than part of a long line of variants to test for flaws.
“Engineers can explore ideas as fast as they can imagine them, without being bogged down by the traditional process,” Garrett said. “This will eliminate barriers that keep new ideas from turning into actual products.”
In this way, the Carnegie Mellon–ANSYS partnership aims to incorporate a greater use of simulation tools into education in order to empower the next generation of engineers. Engineering simulation is currently mostly used by highly specialized experts, but promises vast improvements in innovation, energy efficiency, sustainability, and cost.
“By joining forces, ANSYS and Carnegie Mellon are investing in the future of engineering,” Cashman stated. “We will enable students and industry collaborators to create unprecedented levels of exploration and innovation by equipping all engineering students with the advanced tools and expertise they need.”
The multimillion dollar grant from ANSYS also provides for the endowment of an ANSYS Career Development Chair in Engineering. The Early Career Professorship will be awarded to a young faculty member conducting education and research in areas related to engineering simulation software.
The ANSYS building is projected to open in 2018. At the groundbreaking ceremony, Cashman gave a final remark on the broader impact he hoped the partnership and facility would produce. “This is just the foundation … that allows institutions like Carnegie Mellon and ANSYS and other industrial partners to come together and find new ways to collaborate on research, on teaching, such that when this generation of engineers come out, they’re even all the better prepared to be able to deal with the challenges that are only going to get more stark and more compelling over the years,” Cashman stated. “We’re very excited about this … it is a starting point. It is step one.”

On Friday night, musicians from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra gave a free concert in Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Fine Art. This is one of the series of free concerts the musicians have presented to the public since their strike to replace the cancelled concerts at Heinz Hall. Musicians from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra went on strike due to a recent labor dispute: they rejected management’s last, best, and final offer on Thursday night, Sept. 29, which was a proposal that they said would cut their salary by 15 percent, freeze their pensions, and reduce the size of the orchestra
According to the press release from Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s administration, the orchestra is going through an imminent financial struggle. While requesting pay cut from the musicians, they are also significantly reducing administrative expenses. According to them, their last, best, and final offer “would have ensured that the members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra remained well compensated,” while also maintaining other benefits. Also, according to the administration, they are not asking to get rid of musicians’ pensions, but rather to “allow all musicians who still have accounts in the old defined-benefit plan (DB) to retain what they’ve already earned and transition to the new defined-contribution (DC) plan.” In addition, they said they do not want to reduce the number of musicians, but to defer the hiring of three open positions. According to them, what they are trying to do is to “address fundamental financial issues that cannot be ignored any longer” by looking at every revenue source and every expense. The administrations say that they are unchanging to their commitment to artistic integrity and to world-class excellence, both musically and organizationally. Also, according to their press release, the administration says that they remain committed to reaching an agreement with the musicians, and that they are willing to negotiate with them.
According to the press release from the orchestra committee, “This dispute is really about saving Pittsburgh’s world-class orchestra, and we are very sorry that our management canceled a month’s concerts rather than return to negotiations.” In the interview The Tartan conducted with Micah Howard, the orchestra committee chair, and Jeremy Branson, the vice-chair of the committee, both of whom are also professors at Carnegie Mellon University, they say that these drastic cuts would destroy the orchestra as it is now; they would not be able to recruit and retain the very best musicians. According to them, they are also willing to negotiate, but since the management says they are only willing to negotiate if the musicians accept the drastic cuts, the musicians will not go back to the table “until they are ready to negotiate for a fair contract that addresses the artistic needs balanced out with the financial issues.” In their perspective, the management should come back to the table and tell the musicians what it takes to maintain artistic excellence of the orchestra, rather than focusing only on financial issues.
In fact, financial crisis and strike are not unique to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; orchestras around the country are dealing with similar issues. In 2013, the San Francisco Symphony went on strike after rejecting a contract proposal from the administration. And similar stories can be found throughout the country. In Minneapolis, strikes also led to large cancellations. The economic crisis in 2008 produced huge financial quandaries for orchestras in the country, which lead to the closure of the Honolulu, Syracuse, and Albuquerque symphonies. In April 2011, the Philadelphia Orchestra, which is one of the top orchestras in the country, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Some of these orchestras reorganized, and Philadelphia emerged from bankruptcy in July 2012 with a freeze in hiring, cut in the size of the orchestra, and a cut in pay for the remaining performers. According to the press release from Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s administration, “while a few organizations have begun to face these issues successfully, others have postponed fundamental change with short-term steps — admittedly, as the Pittsburgh Symphony did for many years.”
Carnegie Mellon University is closely related to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. According to Professor Howard, 22 Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra musicians teach at Carnegie Mellon University; thus the strike could negatively influence the school. According to him, if great musicians leave for other symphonies, then in addition to the suffering of the orchestra, the city, and the patrons, Carnegie Mellon University will lose many great teachers, which could harm Carnegie Mellon University’s music reputation and cause students to go elsewhere. However, on the bright side, one of the benefits of the strike, according to Professor Branson, is that music students in the university get to witness their professors fight for the organization, which is a knowledge beneficial for their future, although gained in a terrible way.
According to Branson, although the strike is not something we want to see, it is not a sign that classical music is dying, as some people say. As he said in the interview, in the past, an orchestra job was a part time job; the fact that there are right now many orchestras that didn’t exist fifty years ago and that there are numerous orchestra jobs now shows that there is a huge audience who supports classical music. According to Branson and Howard, in spite of the occasional labor disputes, Pittsburgh can and has sustained a great orchestra for the past 120 years, and will continue be able to do so in the future.

On Oct. 2, the eighth annual Donut Dash took place at Schenley Plaza in Oakland at 10 a.m. This event is hosted by the Greek organization Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) at Carnegie Mellon University to raise fund for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Over 1,300 participants signed up for the event prior to Sunday, and around 1,500 participants showed up to the event. Joey Pickens, a former member of Carnegie Mellon’s Men’s Track and Field team, won the competitive race.
The Donut Dash is a philanthropic event organized by students in the SAE fraternity. Participants may choose to partake in either the competitive race or the casual race; competitive runners run a two-mile course, stopping after the first mile to eat six donuts. This year, this event helped SAE to raise $175,760, by far the largest amount of funds raised through an event hosted by one single Greek organization in the nation. This record was previously held by Alpha Epsilon Pi of University of Missouri in 2015, when the fraternity raised $132,000 for American Cancer Society. “[The Donut Dash] is a part of the commitment to raise $500,000 over five years for a new ALS research center at The University of Pittsburgh,” Mike McCaffrey, a senior statistics major at Carnegie Mellon, said at the closing speech.
David Ott, a current member of Carnegie Mellon SAE and a senior Materials Science & Engineering and Biomedical Engineering major, organized The Donut Dash 2016 with McCaffrey. Ott has been actively participating in The Donut Dash since his first year at Carnegie Mellon. The first annual Donut Dash took place in 2009 on Carnegie Mellon campus. The goal was to raise $2,000 for The Children’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, because the national philanthropy of SAE was to support the Children’s Miracle Network. In 2012, Bob Dax, the alumni advisor of Carnegie Mellon’s SAE, was diagnosed with ALS. “That year, [SAE] revamped the event to support ALS,” said Ott, “we respect Bob very much, and he had always been a very dedicated member of the chapter.”
About $23,000 was raised in Donut Dash 2012. In 2015, the Donut Dash was moved from Carnegie Mellon campus to Schenley Plaza, and the fundraising goal was raised to $100,000.
The majority of the donations came from corporate sponsors and alumni donations. SAE also worked closely with organizations such as Live Like Lou, an organization run by Neal and Suzanne Alexander to support the family of ALS patients. Many volunteering organizations and sororities on Carnegie Mellon also participated in the preparation process as well as at the event. Students from service fraternities at the University of Pittsburgh also showed up to help organize the event. “We have been preparing for this event since our last Donut Dash,” said Ott, “and for us this is definitely the biggest event of the year.” As the heads of this event, Ott and McCaffrey were responsible for maintaining their cooperation with corporate sponsors and service organizations, while making sure the event gained special permission from the city of Pittsburgh. Most of the brothers of SAE showed up to help organize the event and they also worked with local police.
The races ended at 1:30 p.m, and were followed by a donut eating contest and a live music performance at Schenley Plaza.

Carnegie Mellon University students change the face of Pittsburgh culture
In recent years, Pittsburgh’s art and entertainment industry has been on the economic rise. This opened doors for creative specialists in Allegheny County, where thousands of jobs were created.
Pittsburgh’s entertainment and arts industry is widely driven by the Carnegie Mellon community. From those in Masters of Entertainment Industry Management, a joint program offered by the H. John Heinz III College and the College of Fine Arts (CFA), to those in Master of Arts Management (MAM), students take on projects offered by internships and apprenticeships. These opportunities place Carnegie Mellon University students on the front lines of Pittsburgh culture, allowing them to mold and create a new face for art and technology. 
Pittsburgh “is very much an artist’s community alongside an arts organization community,” Kathryn Keidmann, Assistant Dean of Arts & Entertainment, said in a university press release.
From the film resources to iconic art organizations, analysts, and cultural activities, Pittsburgh effortlessly blends the culture of art and technology.
School of Drama Produces The Playboy of the Western World
Oct. 3 was the School of Drama’s preview night for their production of  The Playboy of the Western World.This is the first production for the 2016–17 season.
Written by Irish playwright laureate John Millington Synge, this play suggests that sometimes we don’t completely know the true nature of our loved ones. This phenomenon is based off of Synge’s perception of his own life where he utilizes comedy to reveal the darker side of life.
Peter Cooke, head of the School of Drama, describes this play as being “bold, provocative, caring and human,” as “it holds a mirror up to the magic Ireland of the 1900s.”
Serving as a true representation of Ireland in the 1900s, this play was met with great opposition when it was first debuted in 1907. It was notoriously known to have caused riots because of its far-from-picturesque depiction of Ireland.
Carnegie Mellon’s The Playboy of the Western World runs from Oct. 6–15 in the Philip Chosky Theater.

Editor’s Note: Dominique Escandon is the Cabinet Writer of The Student Government.
The rising cost of education in America and, for our purposes, at Carnegie Mellon has left many students feeling increasingly unstable in their financial standing. Definitive measures can be taken to alleviate monetary stresses, such as applying for scholarships or reassessing budgets, but another frequently visited solution is on-campus employment.
Being a student worker was a need, not a choice, for me. My first year as a Desk Service Assistant was marked with bleary-eyed entrances at 8 a.m., having already been awake for five hours at that point to work a 4 to 8 a.m. “graveyard” shift which allowed me to earn a special $9/hr instead of $7.25/hr. While I was and am so grateful to have been able to work, I would have benefited from a more regular sleep schedule. However, I needed the extra pay in order to afford my necessities (textbooks, tuition, etc.), and didn’t want to sacrifice five hours under regular wage during my day when I could be using that time to attend extra credit lectures or study group meetings. This wasn’t an easy decision, and despite the fact that I would frequently take on more of these “graveyard” shifts for a bigger paycheck, I still struggle financially. I know I am not alone.
However, especially when compared to the respective minimum student wages at peer institutions with comparable endowments, such as Georgetown University (with an endowment of $1.53 billion and minimum wage set at $11/hr per D.C. law), we might feel like we are alone in how our university regards what a living wage within a college schedule really is. Thankfully, change is in the works. Notably, a significant push for raising the minimum wage came from Evan Wineland of the Information System Class of 2015. During his run for Student Body President, Evan identified increasing student wages as one of three main initiatives to his campaign. Shortly after the issue was brought to the main stage of the Carnegie Mellon community, the Division of Student Affairs (DoSA) raised their minimum wage to $7.75, effective this school year.
In matters pertaining to the main intention of this column, Student Government actively chooses to pay its workers above the DoSA standard, at $8.75/hr, and encourages other organizations to meet this goal. It’s so important to lead by example, and we choose this wage because we think it indicates a greater appreciation of the work being done under these jobs, and allows students to indulge in their work with less hesitation of if they can afford to do so.
Here is the main takeaway: individual students can produce incredible change. We live through the student experience, we confront its respective challenges and rewards every day, and most of us have ideas on what could be improved within student life at Carnegie Mellon. The importance of discussing the challenges we face, or the ideas we have lies in the school’s active reception of these issues and its precedent in reacting to suggestions. Why not try to speak about what you think would make Carnegie Mellon University better?

In the fall of 2015, Danny Meyer, CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group and founder of Shake Shack, announced his intention to eliminate tipping at all 13 of his New York restaurants by the end of this year, beginning with his spot inside the Museum of Modern Art, called Modern. The driving force behind this bold business move is the desire for equality within the restaurant. A restaurant depends on two groups of people for it to run successfully — service staff in the front, and food preparation staff in the back. Given this divide, American labor laws create an even wider gap between the front and back of house.
When Franklin D. Roosevelt penned the the New Deal in 1938, he left out a minimum wage for tipped workers. And in the nearly 80 years since, that minimum has slowly inched its way up to $2.13. This legislated divide essentially puts the onus on the customer — not the employer — to pay servers a living wage.
In successful restaurants like Meyer’s Modern, where the service is sure to be excellent and diners are wealthy enough to throw down a generous tip, servers can end up getting paid even more than their counterparts in the kitchen. Tension builds among hardworking cooks who get paid a set hourly wage that can’t compete. And for restaurants like Modern to fix this, it means fixing the income of the server to where it currently is, and raising the fixed income of cooks to equal servers’. This results in price hikes up to 40 percent.
Modern and others in the Union Square Hospitality Group have been successful with this effort because the clientele can afford to pay the higher menu prices. But the reality is, the vast majority of American servers are not white males working at fine dining institutions. They’re women working at chain spots like Applebee’s and Olive Garden where the model is affordability.
The price adjustments required to include service would cause the businesses to implode. In the majority of American restaurants, the switch to service charges is much dicier.
Tipping in America, though it may seem ingrained in our culture, is actually a relic borrowed from Europe centuries ago, but has since been outlawed with the help of labor unions. It first made its way to America in the 1850s and 60s, coming back with wealthy white travelers who wanted to show off their cultural know-how to seem more European. The American manifestation of that urge was that the only tipped workers were newly freed slaves following the Civil War. They were tipped so that no employer would have to be responsible for paying their wages, and the practice only served as one of many ways to hinder freed slaves’ integration into freedom. In fact, it was considered out-of-the-question to tip a white person, because it was a practice "reserved for 'Negroes.'"
Even though the practice may seem innocent today, it still serves a similar purpose of perpetuating a system that separates classes. And the racial element isn’t gone. According to The New York Times, “53 percent of tipped workers in New York State are minorities, and 21 percent live at or below the poverty line.”
The racial implications of the system are worsened exponentially by the gender issues: estimates from the Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) show that two-thirds of tipped workers are women, and 36 percent of those women are mothers. The statistics also show that tipped workers use 1.7 times the amount of food stamps of the rest of the workforce.The system of tipping openly disadvantages already disadvantaged populations, allowing employers to get away with not paying them living wages.
Tipping inherently creates two groups: the tipper and the tippee. The served and the server. And the person on the receiving end essentially becomes the server’s boss. Whether or not they go home with a day’s wage depends on the satisfaction of each and every boss that sits in their section that day. And for many of these women, satisfying a customer forces them to tolerate intolerable behavior.
In fact, the restaurant industry accounts for 37 percent, a plurality, of national sexual harassment claims, even though it only accounts for 7 percent of working women, according to 
ROC data. This nightmare is a reality for millions of women in America who need to make a decent living, both for themselves and for the families that depend on them.
On top of it all, wage theft is a huge problem in America. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute state legislators have recently trended toward passing bills that weaken labor standards across the board. 
Because of lax regulations, employers are able to get away with paying workers below minimum wage, withholding overtime compensation, denying breaks, and, of course, stolen tips. Restaurants are also legally responsible for making up the difference if a worker’s tip doesn’t close the gap between the tipped and national minimum wage, but they’re rarely held to this standard. Wage theft happens in several industries, but 10 percent of all wage theft claims come from restaurant workers. This may not even account for all cases, depending on an employee’s knowledge of their rights and financial ability to pursue the claim.
The system of tipping in America is broken. It doesn’t always work the way it should. The median annual income for a server only amounts to $19,250, and depending on how many people that income supports, it may not keep a family above the Federal Poverty Line. The solution, however, is not to outlaw tips. The average diner won’t like the higher menu prices, and the industry wouldn’t survive that shift.
But a $2.13 minimum wage for tipped workers is not acceptable. The government cannot continue to allow employers to rely on customers to pay their employees living wages. Tips should be supplemental to the income, and not the income itself. The workforce of tipped workers deserves to earn the same minimum wage as the rest of the nation. The two-tiered minimum wage system only serves to further economic, gender, and racial inequalities in America that have persisted for too long. 
Servers are an integral part of the American workforce, and they deserve wages that reflect the respect they earn every day.

Editor’s note: The Pragmatist’s Manifesto is a weekly column that encourages civil discussion about politics in the U.S. Find previous installments @ thetartan.org. 
Four weeks ago, I began my four-part series defending the two-party system. As we approach the election, I will discuss a few other related topics that very much need their own columns. To kick things off, we have a doozy this week – the Electoral College.
We mentioned the Electoral College often in our discussion about the two-party system, and it is one of the key parts of that system’s foundation. We will discuss this, why it’s good, why it’s bad, and how it might be changed to better reflect the results of the popular vote.
We hear a lot about the Electoral College during presidential contests, but perhaps some of you have forgotten what you learned about it in 11th grade government. It is established in Article II, Section I of the Constitution. 
The Founders set up the Electoral College as a way to prevent direct democracy. Essentially, people are selected in each state to represent the outcome of the election by casting their votes as electors. This is one of many reasons why we say “for the Republic,” in the Pledge of Allegiance and not “for the Democracy.” Except for Nebraska and Maine, the Electors vote in a winner-take-all system, so if someone wins more than 50 percent of a state’s votes, the gets 100 percent of the electoral votes.
This means that 538 people (representing the 435 Representatives, 100 Senators, and three votes for the District of Columbia) are selected to vote, 41 days after the November 8th election, to pick the President. That’s the only vote that matters. There is nothing in the Constitution prohibiting any elector from not voting for the person that the state’s electorate selected. This is called a “faithless elector” and it has happened dozens of times in our history.
In principle, each elector would equally represent a portion of the population. However, the Constitution mandates that each state is allotted three electoral votes and the rest are allotted for population. This means that small states that get three electoral votes, like some of those states in the middle that do not have many people (sorry Wyoming), are overrepresented next to states with larger populations like California, Texas, and New York.
One would think this means small states get more attention, but, sorry small states, they don’t. Neither do big states. Elections come down to ideologically-mixed states we lovingly call “swing states.” (If you are holding this paper, you are living in one.) Candidates nowadays can ignore the states they will win easily and focus their resources on the states that will push their electoral count over 270. Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa are the ones that typically decide which candidate has the edge in the electoral count.
This brings us to one of the main problems with the Electoral College: that someone can win with a minority of the popular vote. Most recently, George W. Bush beat Al Gore in the Electoral College in the 2000 election, even though he lost the popular vote.
This result has happened three other times in our history. In 1824 (deadlocked vote went to Congress), 1876, and 1888, presidential contests resulted in a candidate who lost the vote but won the election. That’s one incorrect result for every 14 elections. For such a consequential position, that is a staggering statistic. According to Business Insider, someone could win the Electoral College with just 22 percent of the popular vote. No, you didn’t misread that. It’s highly unlikely, but a candidate could win the election with 51 percent in only the states that are most overrepresented and no votes in the rest of the states.
Now, if you’re thoroughly upset at this point, I would like to step in with an unpopular counterargument just to make you even angrier. The Electoral College, although outdated and undemocratic, does typically ensure one thing: the winner is usually chosen by electors from all 50 states. It makes sense that the people running for president must appeal to people nationwide. Without the Electoral College, a candidate could appeal to a section of the population that is concentrated in one area and become president, ignoring the interests of the rest of the country.
Still, this does not outweigh the problems with the current system. This leads me to the final part of our discussion: reforms!
But how could we possibly reform such a system, you wonder? To begin with, there is one current proposed reform making its way across the country: The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, or NPVIC (it just rolls off the tongue, I know).
NPVIC is a nationwide pact between states that would award all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The NPVIC will go into effect nationwide if the number of states that have approved it reaches 270 electoral votes. 
Although this is a clever way to basically rid the country of the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote for president, the pact’s chances of success look grim. So far, 10 states and D.C. have signed on, making a hefty sum of 165 electoral votes.
Every single one of these states however, votes extremely Democratic in presidential contests. According to FiveThirtyEight, the 11 signers of the pact are in the group of 14 states that gave President Obama his largest margins of victory in the 2012 election.
As we have seen in previous discussions, Democrats have won the last five of six popular votes, meaning they would be far more willing to make this change. This does not bode well for bi-partisanship.
Still, Gallup polling shows that nationally, 62 percent of people support amending the Constitution in favor of a popular vote for president. Because the NPVIC may not have the easiest path to success, I would like to propose a different potential change to our electoral system that does not often get discussed. My approach would enhance the way our democracy works without having to pass a constitutional amendment: make the Electoral College proportional.
If each state awarded its electoral votes proportionally, we would see a much closer representation of how the country voted. Take, for example, the 2012 election. Obama beat Romney badly in the Electoral College — 332 to 206. While the electoral vote percentage shows a 62 percent to 38 percent rout, Obama beat Romney just 51.1 percent to 47.2 percent in the popular vote. 
Arthur Lieber, the Democratic nominee for Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District, imagines a world, imagines a world in which all of the states award proportionally. Obama would have beaten Romney just 276–264, a 51 percent to 49 percent margin that is far more representative of the actual margin of victory. It should be noted this hypothetical doesn’t account for third-party candidates, who could potentially also get electoral votes without having to be a spoiler party.
Still, this model is a clear middle ground. It doesn’t abolish the Electoral College, and it ensures the president will have more nationally-based support. Candidates would no longer be able to focus solely on swing states. Republicans would be motivated to campaign in bluer states, and Democrats would be motivated to campaign in redder ones. Unfortunately, to achieve my reform, all 50 states would have to agree to this radical change. So we will continue to dream.
As we’re stuck with the current Electoral College for the foreseeable future, swing states will continue to wield outsized importance. And that brings us back to you, dear reader. No matter who you vote for, your vote matters a great deal more in Pennsylvania than in another state that is more secure for either major candidate. 
Unless you’re already registered in another swing state, I would heavily encourage you to register or re-register to vote here. Tomorrow, Oct. 11, is your last day to register, so you’d better get moving.
If you need motivation, check out Bush’s margin of victory in Florida in 2000. Out of almost six million votes cast, Bush defeated Gore by 537. There are more people than that enrolled in the School of Computer Science.

Tomorrow Oct. 11 is the last day to register to vote in Pennsylvania. It’s imperative that everyone, regardless of party affiliation or political preference, is able to make their voice heard in the upcoming election.
Even if you don’t like any candidate running for a position, one of the choices will end up in office and will be representing you in the government. There are options beyond just the major parties and voting for the candidate that agrees most closely with you will make your opinion count.
Finally, one vote may be very unlikely to swing an election, but people failing to turn out to vote can and does change the outcomes of elections. Low voter turnout can not only change the outcome, but also hurts the legitimacy of the victor.
The mindset that a vote doesn’t matter spreads and can cause a lot more damage than just the loss of one vote. Data journalism site fivethirtyeight.com currently has the Pennsylvania Senate race close to a 50/50 tie. The race for attorney general, which often has dismal turnout, is considered a tossup by the magazine Governing. 
It’s important that everyone weighs in on these results so our representation best matches us.
Voters can register at booths set up around campus, in person at government buildings such as the DMV, or online at pavoterservices.com.

This past Wednesday, a judge in Montreal struck down a ban on pit bulls. The ban would have halted the adoption of pit bulls, and required current pit bull owners to obtain a $150 permit and muzzle their dogs outdoors, even in their own back yards, and require them to keep their dogs on a four foot leash in public. The owners themselves would also have to undergo criminal background checks. This ban on pit bulls is a result of the stigmatization of these amazing dogs and a violation of animal rights.
While many today perceive pit bulls as aggressive, uncontrollable dogs, this assumption could not be further from the truth. In fact, from 1900 until the 1980s, there was only one national news story that dealt with a pit bull attacking a human. This “attack” was man setting a pack of 26 dogs on a young woman. Many articles have arose in both the United States and Canada since the 1980s, but this has to do with the rise in dog fighting, and not pit bulls themselves.
In fact, the definition of pit bulls doesn’t define a singular breed. Rather, it refers to the American Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The misinformation on pit bulls doesn’t end here, it only begins. Many believe that pit bull aggression is genetic, but aggression in pit bulls is a product of their environment.
Pit bulls do have a genetic composition to be more aggressive to other dog breeds, though not to humans, but this aggression can be curtailed with responsible dog ownership. Pit bulls prior to the ‘80s were known as a devoted, caring breed.
This exact reasoning is what led to the initial suspension of the ban. While the ban was in response to the tragic death of a 55-year-old woman who was mauled by a dog that first responders described as a pit bull, it was rushed by legislators and clearly aimed specifically at pit bulls as a breed and not as the factors that turn dogs into dangers. The ban violates these animals’ rights, and treats them as monsters instead of the loving animals that they actually are.
Instead of banning pit bulls, legislators can focus their attention of advocating for responsible dog ownership. Pit bulls are far from being the only breed to show aggressive behavior, and awareness for responsible dog ownership will be far more beneficial than furthering the stigmatization of a loving, caring dog breed.

If there’s anything that these horribly splintered political parties of ours can agree on, it’s the value of human life. Black Lives Matter and Pro-Life protesters raise their signs because of one core, irrevocable conviction that spans any group: human life is precious, and we as a people and as a government have a duty to protect it.
Except, apparently, the lives of criminals. This is a glaring hypocrisy in American idealism: despite our professedly sacred values of the importance of human life, the death penalty continues to be supported and funded by the federal government. Texas alone has executed 538 people since 1976. Executions have decreased in recent years, but the inconsistency in our federal government’s values persists: capital punishment should be abolished, wholly and completely. Waiting for the states to get rid of this cruel practice one by one doesn’t reflect any decisive rejection by our country. As The New York Times  reported last week, “For the first time in almost half a century, support for the death penalty has dipped below 50 percent in the U.S.” Americans are realizing the hypocrisy.
It is still appalling, however, that 49 percent of Americans support capital punishment. Some may support it simply because they believe it to be too expensive to keep our worst criminals in prison for life, yet this process of legalized murder is so inefficient and lengthy that the cost of killing someone isn’t very different from the cost of keeping them in prison.
Others may support it as a deterrent to criminals from committing these atrocious crimes, for fear of receiving a death sentence. However, there remains no substantial proof of this — in fact, a group of criminologists at the University of Texas at Dallas conducted an extensive study in 2009 that concluded that there was “no empirical support for the argument that the existence or application of the death penalty deters prospective offenders from committing homicide.” Regardless of the data, it is doubtful that a criminal would hesitate to commit an offense in Pennsylvania, where the death penalty is legal, rather than in New York, where it is not.
Yet, although there is no visible reason for its continuation, the United States continues this archaic practice, in cheerful company with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. We, with our glittering international reputation, are also invariably used as the justification for the use of the death penalty in countries with poorer justice systems.
We, as Americans, pride ourselves on our high moral standard, the central values of the Constitution that differentiate us from other, less democratic, countries. One of the most essential convictions of the Constitution, however, is that against “cruel and unusual punishment.” This famously vague command has been debated in many contexts, but in this case it is definitive.
Once sentenced, the offender waits for roughly 15 years, through innumerable appeals that circulate and bounce back and forth in the legal system, before the actual execution. They are also usually sentenced to solitary confinement during this time, as opposed to other inmates in the prison. Regardless of the actual punishment, this wait for death, alone, for over a decade, is unarguably cruel and unusual.
The execution at the end is even more so, for despite the efforts to create a ‘humane’ death, there have been many horrible accidents. An unforgettably awful case is that of Clayton Lockett, in which the botched administration of drugs caused him to endure over 40 minutes of agony after sedation.
There are a lot of stories and statistics that can be cited about this issue, but the baseline is this: we, as a civilized nation, do not have the authority to end a human life. It is an accepted belief that life is precious and sacred, and despite the many atrocities that may have been committed, we do not have the moral authority to end it. 
It is hypocritical to condemn other countries, and our own citizens, for their executions, while participating in it ourselves.
While the government claims not have the authority to force state governments to end capital punishment, it can still declare a moratorium on the death penalty for federal crimes. As a country that unfailingly defends the value of life and dignity, this would be a powerful message to the rest of the world.

“It’s nothing — she’s a girl, and girls over-exaggerate their pain!”
One month later and I was committed to a wheelchair for the next five months.
Being overlooked by doctors as a result of their own personal biases can often leave their patients with serious untreated medical conditions. Misdiagnosis is the third leading cause of death in the United States — and certainly bias must play a role. I was lucky that it was only severe stress fractures in my feet that got neglected by an orthopedic surgeon, but for others, not being taken seriously by a doctor may be a matter of life and death. Such was the case with Elle Mayday, who, after complaining of lower back pain, was told simply to engage in exercises to strengthen her core. Fast forward after repeated encounters of not being evaluated seriously to her real diagnosis: stage III ovarian cancer. Had she not persisted for a thorough examination, she might well be dead.
Patients face doctor discrimination on multiple platforms — gender, race, weight, religious or political beliefs. In a recent national survey, 40 percent of doctors reported feeling bias towards patients due to different factors. However, 85 percent claimed that this bias did not affect the way they treated their patients. But are those who admit to bias really in a position to objectively evaluate whether or not it affects their practice? And what about those who don’t admit to their bias? Does that make it even worse?
If I hadn’t insisted that my feet hurt terribly and if I had gotten an MRI any later, the bones in my feet may have “shattered” completely and led to an even more complicated and difficult recovery. At the time of my injury I was on a soccer team and technically playing on two due to the shortage of players on the junior varsity team in my high school. I relayed that fact to the doctor during the first visit and it should have been taken into consideration as valid indicator that I might have gotten somehow injured.
Yet, because the X-rays did not show any sign of injury, I was told to merely “take it easy” and take ibuprofen if I experienced pain. I finally had an MRI taken upon my mother’s demanding it from the doctor, and when the surgeon examined it he sheepishly admitted “I did not believe you were in so much pain,” and ordered me to stay off my feet, scoot around the house on my derriere and knees, and not return to school until I had my wheelchair, an object I was glued to over the course of the next five months.
Expressing personal bias leads doctors to provide inferior care to patients with the same medical condition that would get much more attention and better treatment from a different doctor without the bias or someone aware of his or her own biases and able to overcome them. Often times, women get less medical attention than men and are dismissed as being too emotional and exaggerating their physical discomfort. A large part of me thinks that this is the result of a male dominated field, particularly when it leads to neglect as the result of perpetuating assumptions related to gender.
This disparity in care is also widespread among obese patients, who feel that their doctors fail to take them seriously, unwilling to look past the large numbers on the scale. Such was the experience with Patty Nece, who sought an orthopedist after increasing hip pain. Her doctor, without even properly examining her, provided her with an “obesity pain” diagnosis. Only later she discovered she had scoliosis, a condition unrelated to her obesity.
Doctors are human beings and, as is the case with humans in general, are not error-free, and their reasoning is subjected to emotional and psychological factors, skewing their objectivity. However, the nature of their work and the responsibility for protecting human life that rests on their shoulders puts them in a unique position of moral obligation to strive for high self-awareness.
It is ironic that someone who is a doctor — the person you trust to take care of your health — can turn you away by something as trivial as a difference in perspective or not take you seriously for the matter of a chromosome! Can one even call such a person a ‘professional?’ Have they even earned the title? While there is a new trend in helping doctors become more observant by taking art classes, as in the case of medical training at Temple University according to NPR’s BBC World Service, more training in self-awareness, a type of Gestalt-training established by Fritz Perls, who strived for teaching people to reach their core, sticking to the indisputable reality, and shedding their inhibitions and inferiority or superiority complexes, would result in more doctors being ready to admit their own limitations and seeing their patients through the lens of their medical knowledge rather than their personal opinions and hidden biases.
The doctors themselves and their reasoning are the tools of their work. So why is all the training technical? Where is the training or evaluation for interpersonal intelligence?
So I leave you with this — give me a break. There should be no fine script “terms and conditions” to taking care of someone’s life. The year is 2016 (further confirmation of this fact can be found on the front of this paper). We have the means, we have the technology, and the reason we don’t have the diagnosis is a matter of personal preference? In order to rule a condition out, you have to take it into account first and evaluate it before you can determine it not to be a possible factor or a diagnosis. It’s not a matter of pay, nor is it a matter of working overtime. It’s a matter of meeting the patient at a basic level of human-to-human respect and maintaining high moral standards.

Editor’s note: This new weekly series highlights stories of women mentioned in the media. 
On Monday, about 30,000 men and women flooded the streets of Warsaw, Poland filling Castle Square in protest against a proposed blanket abortion ban. They joined tens of thousands of people in ninety cities across Poland, dressed in black and holding signs, a high point of the protesting that had started two weeks before.
The bill in question, written by an organization called Stop Abortion, would have criminalized all abortions in Poland. Monday’s protests, however, caught the government off guard, and by Wednesday the politicians that had supported the ban, backed down.
The success of the protests are a major victory for pro-choice advocates in Poland. Even without the proposed ban, Poland has some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in Europe. Abortion is only permitted in the cases of severe fetal defects, a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or a serious threat to the mother’s life.
Of course, Poland is not the only country debating the legality of abortion. Abortion is a hot-button topic across the world, and an extremely controversial topic in American politics. Pro-life advocates seek to create anti-abortion legislation in order to reduce abortions, usually on ethical grounds.
Abortion bans, and even restrictive abortion policies like those in Poland, are often proposed with the aim to “save babies.” In fact, according to The Guardian, a member of the Polish parliament had, before the protests, denounced opponents of the ban as “fans of killing babies” who should be ashamed of themselves.
But abortion legislation should not be a question about the safety of the baby as much as it should be a question about the safety of the mother. Banning abortions does not actually reduce abortions. Women who seek abortions do not seek abortions because they are convenient; they seek them out of necessity and desperation. Banning abortion will not prevent women from getting abortions — it will prevent women from getting safe, legal abortions. It will force women in desperate situations to look for potentially harmful, illegal termination options.
Abortion bans also prevent a woman’s access to important prenatal medical procedures. Under Poland’s proposed ban, doctors would not have been allowed to administer amniotic fluid testing, or any other invasive procedures, because invasive prenatal procedures carry a minor risk of miscarriage. With the incredible advances in prenatal care, these procedures have been able to correct a variety of problems and provide a wealth of information about the child before birth. To limit the access that new parents and doctors have to these options is unnecessarily dangerous to both the mother and the child.
Furthermore, the decision to carry or terminate a pregnancy should not be left up to anyone besides the woman whose body is in question. There are inherent risks in abortion, as there are with any medical procedure, but there are also inherent risks in childbirth. No one should be able to tell a woman which risks she must take with her health or with her body.
Pro-choice advocates are not looking to encourage the death of infants. The 116,000 Polish protesters that stormed the cities were not protesting for their right to kill babies. Instead, they were looking to ensure that women have rights over their own bodies, access to safe medical prenatal care, and the option to safely and legally terminate a pregnancy if that is what is necessary.
When women have the right to choose, they have autonomy over their own lives and bodies. This autonomy is something worth fighting for, and something that should never be called into question.

In an attempt to address inclusion, the University of Michigan rolled out a decision last week allowing its students to choose their preferred designated pronoun. The selected pronoun will then become the student’s identifier in class rosters and among friends.
Before I dive deeper into the issue, for all the non-grammar fans who are reading this article, a designated pronoun is a pronoun that an individual chooses for himself so that others use this identifier to refer him (he, she, her, him, etc.). Its usage is fairly simple as your introduction. For example, ‘Hi, my name is X. My pronouns are she/her/hers and my major is Y.’ The University of Michigan has urged its students to use he, she, ze — a gender neutral pronoun — or any new self-created pronoun.
The issue of gender inclusion was brought to notice by a petition on Change.org titled, ‘Have the University of Michigan Put Student Pronouns on Class Rosters.’ The petition says that “trans students at the University of Michigan often find themselves facing threats to their mental and physical safety.” The seriousness of the matter can be well estimated by the fact that this petition was started last semester and presently has 796 supporters. The Pronoun Committee at the University of Michigan took the students’ grievances into consideration and gave infinite pronoun choices to the students.
The University believes that it is important to identify, respect and nurture all gender identities in order to promote a healthy community. The role of faculty is paramount to the effectiveness of this new policy and therefore, the university has requested its faculty to revise their rosters around mid-late October, thereby giving students the required time to select their names.
While you might have already started coming up with names for yourself and probably thinking that this is a great move by the University of Michigan, let us talk about what students at the University actually think.
The students are mocking this move!
They are claiming that this policy mocks the English language and is totally ridiculous — that allowing students to choose from an infinite number of pronouns is bizarre. According to many students at the University, the policy just creates complexity in terms of names and is more related to fiction than reality. Now before you brainstorm over ‘fiction,’ the term here refers to the silly pronouns that students are designating themselves with. Some of them are ‘Your Majesty,’ ‘Your Highness,’ ‘The Greatest of All Time’ and ‘Unicorn’. The policy has totally turned into a fun game for students, hashtag UMpronounchallenge on Twitter.
My reaction? I am confused! Are these not the students who demanded change in the first place? Or is it that the real ones who demanded change never really got time to act or use the policy because of the hyped drama that swooped in? Nobody knows!
But there is indeed something that I know.
First, the university did their best to serve the rights of all genders. Living in a nation that promotes gender equality, diversity, and inclusion, the best way in which one can contribute his part is by showing sincere efforts to the betterment of the society. 
The University of Michigan differentiated itself from other educational institutions by accommodating gender inclusion in its policy. Restricting the pronoun selection to only a few words would have been similar to boxing and tagging the [gender queers] to the gender binary system.
Second, the students, rather than mocking and coming up with silly names, could have been a catalyst to the change by supporting the policy. The relationship between the University and its students is mutual. Each has to take care of the other and foster the relation. Playing around with names and pronouns will not help the society fight for a better cause. Instead, respecting the University’s decision by letting those in need enter their own pronouns would have been helpful. The students who did not need it should not have used it to goof up with their names. 
If you check Twitter’s #UMpronounchallenge page, you would hardly find a serious talk around the topic. Students are teasing each other and enjoying the self-proclaimed names.
Students have even confused the titles with the pronouns and in response to this, a professor at the University replied back saying, “Call me an old-fashioned former English teacher, but titles are not pronouns."
The overall picture of the whole policy change is not very optimistic as it has turned into a mini-disaster. Let’s see how far this goes.
In 2015, The University of Tennessee-Knoxville suggested the use of pronouns for gender inclusion such as “ze, xe, xem, xyr, zirs and hirs,” but the suggestion was taken away soon due to the amount of resistance it suffered. Let us hope the that University of Michigan does not meet the same fate.
It is time to inspect our education system and make necessary reforms in the inclusion policy. As a nation that takes pride in diversity and inclusion, it becomes necessary to nurture all genders and promote them at the very basic level, i.e. education. Surprisingly, corporations in our country have better statistics over gender-inclusion than educational institutions. Is this worth pondering? 
Gender inclusiveness needs attention from around the country because this conversation is just getting louder, not quieter.
