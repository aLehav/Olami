In less than a week, two scandals hit the NFL, with both revealing the foundational corruption in the most popular sports league in America. On Tuesday, linebacker Reuben Foster was picked up by the Washington Redskins after being cut by the San Francisco 49ers following his arrest for first-degree misdemeanor domestic violence battery. On Friday, TMZ published a video of star running back Kareem Hunt hitting and kicking a woman in a hotel room. He was soon cut by the Kansas City Chiefs. Both these incidents have illuminated just how much the NFL hasn’t changed, and just how much it doesn’t care.
Foster has a history of domestic violence. In February, he was arrested for a charge of domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend. She later said she fabricated the claims, but she was the same victim of last week’s incident in Tampa Bay, when Foster was in town for the 49ers upcoming game. Washington’s quick pickup of Foster has been met with severe criticism, and I echo the same sentiments. What are they doing? According to the victim’s lawyer, the team didn’t even bother to contact her to ask about what happened, indicating what has become quite clear: they just don’t care. And the fact that an NFL team so openly shows just how little they care about domestic violence is chilling, and to be frank, sickening.
But the biggest domestic violence scandal to rock the NFL since the Ray Rice case in 2014 is what happened on Friday. Just like with Rice, TMZ obtained and published the video of Kareem Hunt from a February incident. The Chiefs cut him, but that is just doing the bare minimum. This is not a time to praise them, and there never should be. They had the police report since February and didn’t do anything. Who would want to part ways with a 23-year-old star running back in the middle of a Super Bowl run? The language in the team’s announcement is also quite disturbing, implying that they cut him for lying about the incident, and not his actual actions.
The teams in both cases are trying to wash off the stains on their hands, but the real issue here is with the NFL itself. Unfortunately, violent behavior against women is nothing new in football — it’s nothing new in society. But since 2014, when TMZ published a video of Rice beating his then-fiancé, the league has tried to put up airs of changing, of being different. They introduced a stricter domestic violence and assault policy, but it has proven to be insufficient and broken. The league, a multi-billion dollar institution, can’t seem to get access to an important video before TMZ does, or maybe the NFL just doesn’t care.
The NFL is a business, and when there are great, talented players doing amazing things, the league is producing a better product. When the product is better and money is rolling in, they are often forgiven; forgiven for past mistakes, for current ones, and for future ones. They get a fine or a slap on the wrist. They are suspended for a couple games, or fade from public knowledge. But that doesn’t mean the NFL has changed.
Yes, there are differences between the Rice and Hunt cases. Rice was initially charged and arrested for the initial crime while Hunt never was. There was evidence that the NFL saw the video of Rice, but did nothing about it until it was released to outcry and backlash. Even if the NFL hadn’t seen the Hunt video before Friday, as sources say, it is damning that TMZ is better at investigating the issues of NFL employees than the NFL.
The NFL carries international influence and clout. It’s connected to the richest people in the world. Its players and coaches are household names. For six months, they rule the news, the TV, the sports world, and the pop culture world. The NFL is such a behemoth that it believes it can withstand scandal, which it has. From the Rice case to the anthem-kneeling policy of the last two years, the NFL stands tall, because America just wants to watch football. Americans want to wear their colors and jerseys, get drunk with their friends, and enjoy three-and-a-half hours of fun and escape.
Sometimes I wonder why I still watch football. It’s an extremely violent sport. Most of my family and friends either don’t understand it or don’t care. It leads to brain damage and horrible physical injuries for players. But I grew up in Baltimore, a football town. Everyone watched the game on Sunday, purple was everywhere, and sometimes we’d get purple icing on our Dunkin’ Donuts. I watched the Ray Rice case unfold, but I also watched the Ravens win a Super Bowl. There’s nothing like the euphoric moment of watching and experiencing your team win. It’s pure joy, however fleeting. It’s silly, it’s trivial. But no matter how much our team breaks our hearts, no matter how many concussions we witness or how many domestic violence scandals pepper the headlines, football continues to roll along.
I love football. I think I always will. But weeks like these remind me that in the end, it’s just football. There are many more important things, like the victims of domestic violence and abuse. If the NFL continues to employ these offenders, the league is sending a message that victims don’t matter, that money is more important than their lives, that domestic violence isn’t serious. If the NFL does nothing, if it stands by and only acts for its public reputation and monetary interests, it sends the same message. If the NFL doesn’t change, then it will have one less viewer. And I don’t think I’m alone.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column *Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.*
Earlier this week, the NCAA released comically bad men’s college basketball power rankings (NET) using a new algorithm. Undefeated Ohio State University earned the number one spot after tough wins against the Samford Bulldogs, Cleveland State Vikings, and Fort Wayne Mastodons, and the 8–0 Loyola Marymount Lions are in the top 10 after their grueling schedule against Florida A&M, Central Connecticut State, and Bethesda University of the National Christian College Athletic Association, or NCCA. It all feels like a poorly written sketch for Key and Peele. However, renowned political analyst and sports statistician god Nate Silver, founder and editor-in-chief of statistics-driven website FiveThirtyEight, has come to every fan’s rescue again to tell us just how stupid the rankings truly are. Penalty Shouts sat down with Silver for a short interview about the rankings and what they mean.
First, Silver explained to me the intricacies of numerical ranking systems, specifically how they often feature the number one team as “the best” and the last team as “the worst.” Continuing, he explained that “more often than not, one plus one equals two, but in these rankings, the Ohio State University plus Loyola Marymount equals poo.” I thanked Silver for his original and insightful analysis and quietly left.
After our interview, Silver’s trigger fingers turned to Twitter, and he coherently and mathematically described and analyzed the issue with the NET rankings: “I think, philosophically, NET suffers from a ‘throw random crap at a wall and see what sticks’ problem, which is often characteristic of doo-doo head algorithm designers that care more about their paycheck than doing meaningful work for the only good thing left in the world: college basketball.”
While Silver’s use of excrement imagery colored his analysis in a peculiar, brown light, the core of it rings true. The new NET ratings are s---. There are a multitude of complications coming from the worst ranking system since Buzzfeed Listicles, and since the ranking’s release the NCAA has only doubled down on its confidence in the system, which it will use for the national tournament in March. The NCAA expects the ranking system to winnow out the bad teams by the end of the season, but the NCAA should be  prepared for a corporate takeover if the ranking proves to be as incompetent as the first iteration seems to indicate.

Welcome back to our Tartan Fantasy Football League recap! As it has been the norm this season, I will be recapping the action of our league in the past two weeks.
As the Sports Editor, it’s been extremely embarrassing to see Visual Editor Tracy Le, who at the start of the season didn’t know a quarterback from a cornerback and had never watched a football game before, perch at the top of our league standings. Oh well. But since this is our last recap of the year in The Tartan’s final issue of 2018, I want to express how amazing it has been being the Sports Editor this year. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished, and I’m excited for what comes next!
In Week 11, Le’s team futbol maintained its top spot in a high scoring affair over Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s team, who stayed in seventh place. In the most hotly contested matchup, Operations Manager Adam Tunnard’s team Slugs crept by News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz, winning by less than four points and moving up in the standings to fourth place.
The closest matchup of the week was between Publisher Caleb Miller’s team Last Manning Standing and Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123, which was decided by just 0.06 points. Miller’s team came out on top to continue his winning head-to-head streak against mmichelle123. And finally, Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team GOAT but Ironically defeated my team, Gin and Bear It. The loss doesn’t feel so bad because Sio is one of the few in the league who actually understands football and knows how to log onto her NFL.com account. Figures.
Week 12 saw most matchups ending up as expected, with one surprising upset. This caused some shakeups in the middle of the standings, but in the end, Le’s futbol remains in the lead going into the final weeks of the season, while Mattson’s newz remains in the cellar.
Last Manning Standing over TARTAN FANTASY, 134.98 to 112.00
This matchup between Miller’s second-ranked Last Manning Standing and Qian’s seventh-ranked TARTAN FANTASY ended as expected. Leading the way  to victory for Miller’s team was Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who had 189 receiving yards and a touchdown for 24.90 points. Not far behind were Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston with 22.88 points and Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette with 22.80 points.
Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY boasted some high performances, including the highest of either team, 35.70 from Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCafferty, who finished the week with 125 yards rushing, 112 receiving, one rushing touchdown, and one receiving touchdown. Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson put up 29.40 points and Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot added 20.30 points, but they made up a large majority of the team’s total points. None of the other four offensive players cracked four points, leading to TARTAN FANTASY’s downfall.
mmichelle123 over Slugs, 87.48 to 73.42
Madlansacay’s mmichelle123 bounced back from the previous week’s close loss to defeat Tunnard’s team Slugs. With the win, mmichelle123 moves up two spots to fourth place, while Slugs drops to fifth place.
Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins led Madlasacay’s mmichelle123 with 27.36 points from 342 yards through the air, 17 yards rushing, and three touchdowns. Other than Cousins, none of her other starters broke 20 points; Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz was her second highest scorer, with only 15.10 points, and one of her players didn’t score any points.
However, mmichelle123 racked up enough to beat Tunnard’s Slugs, which struggled with scoring as well. The team’s highest scoring player was Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon, who put up 18.60 points after rushing for 61 yards and two touchdowns. Two players were scoreless, including the Jaguars defense, while four others failed to score double-digit points.
GOAT but Ironically over newz, 123.92 to 86.86
Sio’s team GOAT but Ironically continues to improve, this week rising to third place after a strong win over Mattson’s newz.
After starting the season with three straight losses, Sio has definitely steered her team in the right direction. In Week 12, while the team didn’t have any standout performances, GOAT but Ironically’s starters all contributed. All but one offensive starter scored at over 13 points, and the Baltimore Ravens defense collected a whopping 18 points.
Mattson’s newz had some bright spots, including 26.20 points from New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley, who had 142 total yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers also had a good week, with 20.66 points from 259 passing yards and three touchdowns. But little production from anyone else hindered the team, including zero points from both the kicker and the defense.
futbol over Gin and Bear It, 112.04 to 68.50
Le’s futbol decided to run up the score on my team (not that that’s literally possible in fantasy football), beating my team by over 40 points. In the team’s fourth win in a row, Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb scored 24.80 points from 84 rushing years, 44 receiving yards, a rushing touchdown, and a receiving touchdown. Panthers quarterback Cam Newton put up 22.54 points from 256 passing yards, 63 rushing yards, and two touchdowns.
Not that futbol needed much to beat my team, Gin and Bear It. I missed the time to bench my quarterback, Jared Goff of the Los Angeles Rams who was on a bye, so I got zero points from the only position that has been reliable for my team. Usually consistent Steelers running back James Conner had a mediocre week, finishing with only 7.50 points, and Washington Redskins running back Adrian Peterson proved to be a bad pickup, as he scored only 4.40 points. At least I’m not in last place like I was earlier in the season — I’m perfectly content with sixth place.
So that’s it for our Tartan Fantasy Football League in 2018! Don’t worry, we’ll be back in Jan. 2019 with the final recap of what went down during the last weeks of the regular season, and then how the playoffs played out. I hope that by  the end of the season, Mattson will be able to name a tight end not named Rob Gronkowski, and Qian will know that “running back” is a two-word phrase.

The Pittsburgh Penguins were  unable to come up with any points for a second straight game on Saturday, as they lost to the Philadelphia Flyers by four goals to two. After a strong start that featured another Sidney Crosby goal, as well as Riley Sheahan’s second goal in three games, the Pens could not score in the third period, and the Flyers took home a decisive victory.
It was the third time since the start of November that the Pens have lost multiple games in a row. Since their last win, only two Penguins, Crosby and Sheahan, were able to put the puck into the back of the net. Last night seemed to be the same old problems, where the Pens continued to give up odd man breakaways, and the Flyers took advantage. It seems fair to say that if the Penguins, currently in sixth place in the metropolitan division, can’t flip the switch soon, then a few big names on the roster are going to find themselves on the trading block.
This month of November was atrocious for the Penguins. They’ve lost 10 games out of 14, and look generally disinterested in playing successfully. Three of those losses have been in overtime or a shootout, so they have managed to grab a few points along the way, even though it hasn’t been enough to change their bleak outlook. A lot of these games were lost in the third period, and they ended up as multiple goal losses on an empty netter by the other team. Some of this might be attributed to the Pens losing goaltender Matt Murray to injury and replacing him with two backups, Casey DeSmith and Tristan Jarry. Put a strong goaltender in net, and the Pens might take more of those to overtime and then to victory. November was a bad month, but with some roster shuffling, it could be an anomaly.
Jim Rutherford should be looking to trade away some of the Pens’ considerable forward depth to give the team any semblance of a defense, or perhaps a proven, veteran goaltender who can mentor Matt Murray, Casey DeSmith, and Tristan Jarry. Beyond Kris Letang, who also looked horrible last Saturday against the Flyers. Nobody on the Penguins’ defensive line has been able to do much of anything. I don’t think that we’re seeing the end of the Crosby and Malkin era, but the Pens need to build up their defense, or they will surely end up out of playoff contention. Since the beginning of the season there’s been a complete disregard for team defense, with the forwards lazily skating back for defensive help, as well as a lackluster forward attack after dumping the puck.
There are glimmers of hope, however. In the game against the Winnipeg Jets just last week, the Pens looked like a different team. They played hard on the boards and won loose puck battles. I’m not a fan of calling it a matter of effort, but it does really seem like the team is uninterested in playing more often than not. I still trust Mike Sullivan as head coach, but don’t be surprised if there’s a coaching change soon in the future. The Penguins are a team with a limited window for success, and while firing a head coach who has won two Stanley Cups in the last three years may not inspire success in future coaches, it might soon be the only move left to make to spark something in the team.

Dr. Barbara Shinn-Cunningham, director of Carnegie Mellon’s new neuroscience institute, spoke with The Tartan about the potential of neuroscience research on campus and beyond. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.
What is the current state of Carnegie Mellon’s neuroscience institute?
We’re doing organizational planning behind the scenes. We’ll be launching in the spring semester. We are going around and talking to various people at the university and in the Pittsburgh community about what we are about, and putting together websites and things like that, so that when we launch, we have a public space ready to go.
What sort of partnerships can we expect from the institute?
There are partnerships both within the university and then within the Pittsburgh area, and even more broadly. Within the university, I report to the dean of the Mellon College of Science as well as the dean of Dietrich. Within the institute, we have members in not only Mellon and Dietrich but also the School of Computer Science, the College of Engineering and even the College of Fine Arts. 
If you step back even further within the Pittsburgh area, the Institute will make sure the CNBC (Center for Neural Basis of Cognition) continues. It’s been around for a very long time, and supports cognitive neuroscience efforts that are collaborative between Pitt and CMU.
The institute is already reaching out to other partner institutions. We had two different visitors just this week, for instance, who are heading neuroscience institutes in China to talk about the potential for collaborations, and exchange of students and faculty.
Could you elaborate on the research that will take place? 
Right now there’s about 40 faculty, and their areas of research fall in three or four bins. There’s a bunch of people like me, who do human work, who study perception and the brain and neuroimaging. 
Then there’s a large effort within engineering and computer science; there are people who are doing development of devices to measure or even manipulate brain activity so if you have someone, for instance, with Parkinson’s, you can stimulate portions of the brain and alleviate the symptoms.
Another set of people, within engineering, are doing brain-computer interfaces, which has usually been applied to help people who have spinal cord injuries, and can’t move their bodies or portions of their bodies. 
There are a bunch of people in biology, they’re really looking at the brain at a cellular level. 
And then finally we have collaborators in machine learning and statistics who are helping unravel all the data that new techniques to measure brain activity are generating.
How are you going to incorporate cross-disciplinarity in the institute?
It’s really fun — one of the things that already happens naturally within CMU is collaboration across these different fields, so it’s very easy to come in as a director into CMU and just nurture what is already happening. For instance, the people who do brain-computer interface include people on the biology side who collaborate incredibly tightly with people from biomedical engineering and electrical and computer engineering. A lot of what my job is, in coming into this, is to make sure that those people who want to collaborate don’t have things standing in their way.
Another thing that we’re doing is holding small meetings of faculty who have more interest in talking about other ways we can build collaboration. We’ll be holding some meetings open to the public that are scientifically intense workshops, and we’ll be focusing them on areas where there’s already a lot of strength at CMU. We will also be bringing in some external speakers to interact with the great scientists we already have here.
You also mentioned technological approaches, such as machine learning and data-driven science. Do you believe these types of techniques are the future of the field?
I believe it’s a really important tool to help us understand the neural code in data that are being generated today. It used to be that people who are measuring from the brain would look at a single cell, and figure out how a single cell reacts to different inputs. From that they’d try and figure out what that single cell was encoding. Now, people are up to measuring thousands of units at a time, and that’s a tiny percentage of what’s going on in the brain. Trying to figure out from observing their firing pattern, for instance — what mental plan is being encoded at a particular instance — is a challenge. We need to have people in machine learning working hand in hand with neuroscientists to understand the kind of information likely to be meaningful in this data.
You mentioned different levels of complexity: from single cells to the whole brain. Do you find that integrating these different levels of complexity is a challenge?
Most scientists in academia tend to study one small problem — one sub-sub-subfield of some bigger field — and in neuroscience that’s especially true. There are people who work at the single unit level; there are people who work at the network level; there are people who work at the whole brain level. There are people who come at it from a behavioral standpoint and try and relate that to the brain. And all of these different levels are intricate and complicated and difficult to work on. What’s fun about CMU is people work across those scales pretty naturally, which is unusual.
What role do you believe the new neuroscience institute can play in the field of neuroscience as a whole?
CMU isn’t a huge university — if you look just across the street at Pitt, there are so many more people doing neuroscience than CMU will ever have. We can’t compete in sheer numbers, yet we are going to play a big role. All the things that CMU is known for in the external world are exactly the tools that neuroscience needs right now at this junction: technology and analysis and machine learning and data science and statistics. And that is why I’m excited to come to CMU.
I’m an electrical engineer by training, so I came at neuroscience from an information theory kind of viewpoint: what information is in the brain, at what moment, in what place. That kind of automatic analytic approach to understanding the data that comes from the brain is what I think the field needs, and what CMU can do uniquely.

“Extremism” is a word we sometimes throw around casually, using it to label any actions or beliefs that seem, well, extreme. Other popular phrases include “extremist ideology,” and “violent extremism.” 
When you hear the word “extremists” or “extremism,” what do you imagine? Probably something along the lines of ISIS or white nationalists, groups that are explicitly extremist. But these based on examples are insufficient because it becomes incredibly difficult to categorize extremism when we move away from the ends of the spectrum. 
How do we objectively define this nebulous term beyond  “I know it when I see it?”
That’s the problem that J.M. Berger, a postgraduate research student at Swansea University’s School of Law and research fellow at VOX-Pol, investigates, working a lot with homegrown terrorism and social media extremism to try and clarify this social phenomenon into a more objective framework. In a talk given this past Tuesday, Berger delved into his ideas on what distinguishes extremism in the 21st century.
Drawing upon historical analogues — such as Pope Innocent the Third, Hernan Cortez, and Edmund Ruffin — he created a definition for extremism based on social identity theory, which draws on in-group and out-group dynamics, where the in-group is the extremist group and the out-group is comprised of everyone else. He also defines the term “ideology” as a set of documents detailing how members of the in-group should interact with or treat members of the out-group. Thus, an extremist ideology is simply a set of rules on how extremists in an extremist in-group should treat those in the out-group. As Berger notes, because extremist groups are very concerned with their legitimacy, they take great caution in clearly defining the boundaries for their members.
With the foundation of social identity theory, extremism can be broken down into three key parts: identity, crisis, and solution. Each of these three components must exist in some form for extremist groups to form, and they progress sequentially.
The identity defines who is in the in-group and who is in the out-group, and this division follows from the very strict guidelines set forth by those in the in-group. There is also a level of nuance where the out-group is divided into the eligible and ineligible out-group, where the in-group appeals to the eligible out-group for recruits and supports. In the case of ISIS, the eligible out-group would include Muslim males, as there is a potential for recruitment among that population. 
Once the in-group and out-group are established, the in-group defines a kind of crisis that forces confrontation of the out-group. For example, a popular conspiracy theory for anti-Semites is the idea that Jewish people secretly control the world. These crisis narratives can range in severity from conspiracy — the idea that the out-group secretly controls outcomes for the in-group — all the way to apocalypse, where the out-group is seen as a threat to all of humanity.
The final piece is the solution, where extremist groups present a way to resolve the crisis. Solutions can range from non-violent harassment all the way to genocide, with the severity and extremeness increasing along the spectrum.
So why is it so important to reduce extremism to objective components? It opens up the possibility of combating extremism online with artificial intelligences rather than human monitoring.  A team of humans could never sort through all the hundreds of thousands of text posts and messages sent online every day. By training AIs to recognize the elements of extremism, we can monitor extremist dialogue before it becomes an issue. As Berger demonstrated later in his presentation, all of these abstract ideas can be reduced to concept maps and frameworks, which in turn can be fed to natural language processing systems and threat detection AIs who can do the heavy lifting.
After the talk, the audience raised some intriguing questions, such as if reactions to extremism can themselves be considered extreme. Another great question was whether or not the current administration has played a role in escalating extremism. Without naming any names, Berger explained that the current political rhetoric fulfills the identity and crisis portion of the extremism cycle — such as Trump categorizing immigrants as the out-group threat — without providing any solutions. When people are left to their own solutions, the results can be catastrophic.
This thought-provoking lecture explained how vague concepts can be reduced to functional definitions, so long as the definitions are carefully thought out and supported by legitimate evidence. As we move into an age where subjectivity is used frequently as a defense for hate, this approach is vital to the viability of our society. Only by identifying the harmful agents can we curtail their impact, and machines can help us achieve what manpower alone can not.

Last week, a controversy embroiled the internet that resulted in thousands of tweets, multiple articles, and a bitter feud between The Guardian and The Washington Post. The source of all this tension?
A really big cow.
Knickers, an Australian Holstein measuring six feet and four inches from hoof to shoulder and weighing over 3,000 pounds, captured the hearts and minds of internet users everywhere when a photo of him surrounded by a herd of smaller cattle went viral. Commenters on Twitter dubbed him “big cow,” praising Knickers for the heroic nature of his enormous stature. Before the day was out, his newfound fame had already garnered the attention of many mainstream media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times. 
Writers at both papers were at pains to temper the fervent passion of many social media users. Knickers, the Times noted, is not technically a cow (a female with one or more calves) but a steer — a bull castrated at birth. And as Jason Bittel pointed out in the Post, Holstein cattle tend to grow a lot larger than the Wagyu cows Knickers is standing beside in the viral photo.
But as other commentators were quick to argue, neither point really detracts from the fact of his sheer size. Knickers nearly matches the height of the tallest Holstein steer ever recorded, and stands over eight inches taller than the average height for his breed. At 3,000 pounds, he weighs more than double the amount of even his heaviest peers.
What’s even more unusual about Knickers is his age. Steers raised for meat production are usually slaughtered between the ages of two and three. Knickers is seven years old, which may help to explain his massive size. But even as a young cow, Knickers was too large to fit in the farm equipment required to process his carcass.
“We have a high turnover of cattle,” Knickers’ owner, Geoff Pearson, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in October. “He was lucky enough to stay behind.”
Steers of Knickers’ age and size might have been more common in the past. The first cattle imported to Australia in the 1800s were not raised for meat but for work: oxen used to till and cultivate soil. Without a visit to slaughterhouse ensuring their premature demise, these animals could end up living for anywhere from 10 to 20 years. 
Cattle grown for this purpose are exceedingly rare on modern farms. Not only can tractor-mounted cultivators turn over soil at an exponentially higher rate than oxen ever could, tilling itself has fallen out of favor as new herbicide resistant plants make chemical weed-killers an easier and more desirable alternative.
Even without a career in plowing to fall back on, Knickers has managed to find work on the farm, leading and coaching other cattle around their enclosure.
“Whenever he wants to get up and start walking there's a trail of hundreds of cattle following him,” Pearson told the ABC. 
This is what Knickers is doing in the picture that brought him well-deserved internet fame: towering over the herd of smaller brown cattle congregated around him. While it’s a far cry from tilling the soil, Knickers’s position as a cattle wrangler does bear more similarity to his plow-pulling ancestors than it does to his dinner-destined contemporaries.
The same is true of his social media stardom. While fascination with pictures of large cows may seem like a uniquely internet-based phenomenon, enormous cattle actually have a rich history as portrait subjects. In the 19th century, the rise of selective breeding brought with it a rise of larger and larger cows. Farmers aspired to raise bigger cattle as status symbols, and would commission artists to create paintings of them and their cows standing together. 
One especially notable portrait depicts the Durham Ox, an English steer weighing about 2,600 pounds. Like Knickers, the Durham Ox lived longer than one destined for the grisly fate of the average steer. When he was finally put down after suffering a hip injury that refused to heal, the ox was exactly 11 years old.
That Knickers, a seven year old steer, has already grown to be 400 pounds heavier than the Durham Ox at its death speaks to the sweeping changes brought about by factory farming. The high demand for beef, combined with advances in genetics, have allowed the average steer to become as large as some of the biggest cattle in recorded human history. In fact, cows today are so big, some ranchers are becoming concerned.
“More and more of our commercial customers say they’re concerned about their cows getting too big,” Kevin Schulz, a cattle breeder, told Hereford World in 2010. “They want to lower cow maintenance costs.”
Perhaps some ranchers are anxious that their cows, like Knickers, may grow too big to slaughter. A more practical concern is efficiency: larger cows require more resources to keep healthy. As cattle feed becomes more expensive, many farmers seem worried that the emphasis on bigger and bigger cattle is hurting their bottom line.
But even if proponents of smaller cattle fail to convince the majority of breeders, really big cows like Knickers will remain an anomaly. Most steers will simply never grow old enough for us to appreciate their enormity. 
So large animal enthusiasts: enjoy Knickers while he lasts. And hope that someday, somewhere, another big cow will find its way into the spotlight, and into our hearts.

For better or for worse, Chinese geneticist He Jiankui may have just opened the Pandora’s box of gene-editing.
He, a researcher based in Shenzhen, China, claims to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies. “Two beautiful little Chinese girls, named Lulu and Nana, came crying into this world as healthy as any other babies,” said He in a YouTube video posted on his company’s channel on Monday. Before being implanted in the womb as embryos, Lulu and Nana’s genes were altered to prevent contraction of HIV. He used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to perform gene surgery in order to reproduce a natural genetic variation that confers strong resistance to HIV-1 infection.
He’s actions have caused a global outcry, with scientists worldwide expressing shock and outrage. More than 120 Chinese scientists issued a joint statement on Monday, condemning He’s use of the CRISPR-Cas9 on a baby as a “huge blow” to the ethical standing of Chinese biomedical research. Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, described the experiment as being “far too premature.”
“We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being,” Topol explains. “It’s a big deal.”
A few scientists have spoken out against the criticisms, however. George Church, a famed geneticist at Harvard University, argued that He’s research is “justifiable” as a valiant attempt to battle HIV, “a major and growing public health threat.”
The Chinese government has halted the work of He’s lab, having ordered immediate investigations into the experiments. Furthermore, Professor He’s university, the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said it was unaware of the research project and that Professor He has been on unpaid leave for the past few months. Gene editing outside of lab research is outlawed or restricted in many countries, including China.
The CRISPR gene editing technique used by He was developed in 2013, and while its potential has been widely praised, it is still considered experimental. Many unintended mutations, capable of causing genetic problems later in life, including cancer, are associated with the procedure. As explained by Feng Zhang, one of the key inventors of CRISPR, “when you change one thing, something else gets changed, too.”
Several scientists have reviewed the experimental materials that He provided to the public and said the tests are insufficient to confirm whether the editing worked or caused harm. 
It was also noted that the evidence may suggest that the editing was incomplete and left various changes to a patchwork of cells. Moreover, even if editing worked perfectly, the imposed HIV-resistant gene variation is known to increase risk of other viruses and diseases. Such evidence begs the question of how much there was to be gained in terms of protection against HIV.
Professor He’s lab has altered embryos for over seven couples, but only one of the experiments has led to pregnancy. Many are unsettled that the participants may not have given fully informed consent to the treatment, as He’s consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program.
However, He maintains that the patients were well aware of the nature of the research, saying that he personally explained the forms to each family “line by line.” He also promised to provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and medical follow-up until the children reach adulthood.
According to He, the parents involved refuse to be identified or interviewed. He also would not disclose where the parents are from or where the work was done.
Professor He recognized early on that his work would cause much controversy. However, he believes “families need this technology,” He explained.
If the treatment causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”

A recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that sensitivity to the bitter taste of caffeine increased people’s coffee consumption. Scientists have differing opinions on the evolutionary purpose of bitterness perception. “The conventional answer is that taste is a sentinel that protects us from harm. It allows us to sense toxins, poisons” explains Dr. Danielle Reed, a researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, in the report. 
"You'd expect that people who are particularly sensitive to the bitter taste of caffeine would drink less coffee," said Marilyn Cornelis, who is an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and one of the study’s authors. Why then do they like it so much?
Reed explains that some people think “taste is a little more nuanced than that … we often have the idea that bitters are poisonous, but in a sense, bitters are also medicines. The bitter perception system is very sensitive because a little bit of bitter might be a good thing.” 
The later view might better explain the results of this study. The authors believe that people with genetic variations that provide extra sensitivity to the taste of caffeine learn to associate it with its benefits — namely staying awake.

Big data has become vital in the modern age. The analysis of trends drives company decisions, while consumer choices are analyzed to tailor advertisements and purchases to an individual user. Social media companies track the pages their users are interested in to personalize the content they see. Medical data can be analyzed to track diseases. Weather data can be used to predict storms. The list goes on and on. Data analysis has become the bread and butter of the information-driven era.
With the ever-increasing amount of available data, it has only become more important to simplify the process of analyzing it. 
This is what researchers from the University of Cordoba’s Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis have been working on. Their work focuses on producing models capable of predicting several variables, based on the inputs from the same set of variables. In other words, they reduce the amount of data that a model needs to analyze by having the computer learn the different qualities of the input data.
Sebastian Ventura, one of the researchers, points out that the method of reducing data is a much cheaper and more effective strategy than just increasing computing power, and that there are a few key benefits of the data reduction. First, by simplifying the data set, the model could be more accurate, since extraneous data not affecting the model are removed. Second, with less data to input, less computing power is required. In turn, this ends up increasing the efficiency and rate at which models can be made.
With the sheer amount of data the world produces, having more efficient predictive algorithms is key to processing it, which has driven a global trend towards modernizing predictive models. Besides individual researchers working on their own projects, many government organizations are also funding big data projects. For example, the E.U. funded the BigStorage project in 2015 with the goal of developing new approaches to data analytics concepts, providing 3.8 million euros to finance the project.
It is also important to remember that there are many variables computers still won’t be able to account for. Big data is not infallible, and researchers should be careful when making bold claims about its versatility.

Before the stream of Netflix’s cheesy Christmas rom coms was released to the world, a surprising horror hit was found in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. The show is based on the Archie Horror series of the same name, which was a darker retelling of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the basis for the tv show of the same name that aired from 1996 to 2003, starring Melissa Joan Hart. My interest in the new show was rooted in this 90s classic, which was a favorite of mine growing up. The star of the 90s Sabrina, besides the title character, was undoubtedly Salem, a talking black cat full of witty banter and an ongoing desire for world domination. In fact, Salem’s taste for world domination was about as dark as the old show went. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has bigger aspirations. 
One of the most surprising aspects of the new Netflix series is just how satanic, demonic, and outright dark it is. Seriously, it goes there. Whereas the magic in the original show was conveyed with a bouncy ping sound to get out of doing homework and to fix other silly teen problems, the characters of Netflix’s show use magic to terrify their professor by drowning him in spiders, to perform exorcisms, and to attack creepy sleep demons that prey on their worst nightmares, which though an interesting concept, was overwhelmingly the worst episode of the show. At one point, someone (I won’t say who) has to shoot his undead zombie brother in the face before said zombie brother starts to feed on humans. But wait, there’s more. The witches and warlocks in this show serve the dark lord (aka the devil, sometimes referred to as Satan) and on a witch’s 16th birthday, they must sign their name over to the dark lord and are bound to do whatever he wishes if he calls on them (which Sabrina isn’t too keen on). 
In spite of every exclamation of “hail Satan,” the show is rooted in Sabrina’s journey in deciding who she is as half witch and half mortal, supporting her friends, and being with her boyfriend, you know, just like any regular teenager. Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina makes the role hers, and while I love Melissa Joan Hart’s portrayal, Shipka’s version is amazing in its own right in portraying Sabrina's inner strength and independence. The distinct characterization of the aunts was also great, and the contrast of Hilda's (Lucy Davis) meekness to Zelda's (Miranda Otto) unwavering support of her beliefs (worshiping the devil and all) and their expectations of their niece added to Sabrina's conflicting emotions. Harvey Kinkle (Ross Lynch) didn't retain the "stupid" trope that he had in the original, which was refreshing. But the newest addition of Ambrose (Chance Perdomo), a witch who is housebound after attempting to blow up the Vatican (as one does), was my favorite. Confined to the Spellman household, Ambrose copes with his loneliness as Sabrina's closest confidant and partner in crime, or by trying to win the love of a fellow warlock. With that being said, I have to applaud the show’s diversity in casting and LGBT representation. It truly is a Sabrina retold for modern times.  
Although the overly demonic aspects can be a little unsettling at times, I would highly recommend Netflix’s Chilling Adventures of Sabrina for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. It’s a fresh and intriguing retelling of the teenage witch many of us grew up loving, with just a few more deaths and exorcisms thrown in, sans talking black cat.

Just like October, November also had some high profile releases. Let’s talk about them. 
Widows
Widows is the latest film from Steve McQueen, the man behind great films like 12 Years a Slave, Shame, and Hunger. His latest film is a heist drama about the four widows of a group of criminals, led by a woman named Veronica (Viola Davis), planning to pull off a final heist to pay back a debt left by their dead husbands. It’s an absolutely fantastic film from start to finish. Every character is so rich and detailed, as is the way Chicago is portrayed in the film. The plot is incredibly unpredictable, and the film both subverts and reimagines the classic trope of the heist genre. One plot twist in particular made my jaw drop, and it was one those twists that I should have seen coming but didn’t. That’s the quality of writing in the film. The dialogue and script were so tight, with every little subplot and detail being used in service of deepening the characters and enhancing the story. Every performance was spot on, and no one felt forced or out of place. This is the first time I’ve seen Michelle Rodriguez show that she can really be a great actress when given the right role and proper direction. All the antagonists of the film were so fleshed out, with complex motivations and characterization, and a lot of the film was devoted to that. Daniel Kaluuya is quickly jumping towards the top of the list of my favorite actors, and his performance as a psychopathic gangster in this film was even better than his performance in Get Out. There was also a lot of political intrigue that I didn’t expect from the film. Really, there was a lot I didn’t expect, such as the fact that the heist part of the film is the shortest part. It’s also incredibly well shot, with some great long takes that are used for fantastic visual storytelling. Overall Widows is one of the best films of the year, and is one of the best heist dramas I’ve seen. I definitely recommend checking it out in theaters if you can. 
Creed 2
This was much better than I expected it to be. It’s not as good as the first Creed, but it does come close. The biggest drawback of the film is that there is always the sense of a “been there, done that” feeling. However, not every boxing movie has to be Raging Bull, and considering this is the eighth film in the Rocky franchise, a franchise built around being inspiring boxing movies, this is almost as good as it gets. Michael B. Jordan is so perfectly cast as Adonis Creed, and seeing his relationship with Rocky is just an absolute treat. There is so much feeling infused in both performances, and I just love watching these characters, and the story itself actually has great stakes. In Rocky IV, Creed’s father, Apollo, is killed in the ring by Ivan Drago, and Adonis is going up against Drago’s son in this film. The Dragos were actually fleshed out in this film surprisingly well, and you understood the motivations and dynamics that made the family tick. So when it came down to the fight scenes, they were all really intense because there was so much care that went into giving all the characters depth. All the fights were spectacular, though nothing was quite as amazing as the long take fight in the first Creed. Sure, this film is formulaic, but it follows the formula incredibly well and has good direction, performances, and dialogue. I couldn’t ask for anything more from a Rocky film, and I would recommend checking this one out. 
Bohemian Rhapsody
I want to preface this review with the fact that I enjoyed this film and that Queen is one of my top five all time favorite artists. So it was painful for me to accept that I simply did not enjoy this film as much as everyone else did. Rami Malek’s performance as Freddie Mercury is one for the ages, the music was amazing, and the Live Aid concert scene made my heart leap with joy. I enjoyed a lot of the humor, and I enjoyed watching everyone on screen play these characters. But I couldn’t overlook just how stale, uninspired, and by-the-numbers the film felt, and I definitely couldn’t overlook all the inaccuracies. The most glaring one was changing the year Freddie Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS for the sake of dramatic effect. They also portrayed Mercury as the villain in the middle part of the film, which was very off-putting. Nothing felt urgent or felt like it had any stakes. It also felt like there were three different films crammed into one film, and there was no focus at all. It’s unfortunate that despite Queen’s approval of the film, it didn’t feel like a film that really truly honored them. The entire film was a missed opportunity that I enjoyed simply because I love Queen. I will still recommend the film because I am in the minority with this opinion. I just really wish I enjoyed this film more.
The Bad Movies
First up in the bad movies list is Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which was an avada kedavra for the Harry Potter franchise. It was absolutely boring, nonsensical, and just full of empty spectacle. Check out Izzy’s amazing review of it on page B8. Next up is The Grinch, which was made by the creatively bankrupt geniuses at Illumination Animation who brought you terrible films like Minions, Sing, and The Secret Life of Pets. Their latest film is (surprise surprise) also terrible. It’s just loud and stupid, full of sound and color that signifies nothing. It’s just so boring and not creative. I did not laugh or smile a single time watching this. This is the second bad adaptation of a Dr. Seuss story from Illumination Animation, who I’m sure is now cursing them from his special spot in hell (he wasn’t a very good man back in the day). It’s baffling that the animation, the supposed bread and butter of this company, is so bad. They don’t have a good art team and they cut costs for their animation, so all the character designs are not good, and it’s a visually bland experience. I’m sure infants will be entertained, but everyone else is better off watching any other version. Finally, we have Robin Hood, the new one. I snuck into this after watching Creed 2 because there was no way I wanted to pay to see even a minute of this. Of the half an hour I saw, this is the second worst film of this year, behind Disney's A Wrinkle in Time. It’s so laughably incompetent. All the performances are shockingly awful. The action and special effects are shockingly awful. The entire production is just shockingly awful. Films like this make me question my sanity and reality. Am I really watching this? Why does this exist? Who thought this was a good idea? There are certain films that should just be cancelled before they’re released, and Robin Hood, the new one, falls into this list. There were only a few other people watching, and everyone was just bored. So don’t be like those people or me, and don’t see this movie.

This year, Phipps Conservatory is pulling out all the stops for their Winter holiday installment, appropriately called “Holiday Magic: Let it Glow!” As the name suggests, the decorations focused on using lights and colors to convey a festive mood, something that is immediately clear from the way the Conservatory is illuminated at night.
Inside, things just get better. When I visited on the last Friday of Thanksgiving Break, Phipps — which to me was always very green — looked completely transformed, resembling a Christmas wonderland more than a botanical garden. Countless Christmas trees, wrapped in brilliant lights and ornaments, were dotted throughout, and fairy lights hung from the ceiling. Even the workers who were surveying the crowd and acting as guides were dressed in elf hats and Christmas lights. Everywhere I looked, people were crowding for pictures, giving the otherwise spacious rooms a very packed and cozy feeling.
Continuing through the different rooms, the decorations became increasingly whimsical. There were interactive diorama displays showing Phipps’ history in the South Conservatory, a giant gingerbread house, gargantuan presents, and posh tea sets decorating the Serpentine Room, penguins (not real ones) enjoying themselves in the East Room, and the massive Fir tree in the Victoria Room. Other rooms, such as the Orchid Room, Fern Room, and Stove Room had minimal decorations, but it was a pleasure nonetheless to see the colorful flowers and the carefully curated flora.
The most impressive exhibit, however, was not inside the Conservatory but outside it in the Outdoor Garden. I had never visited the Outdoor Garden before, so it was doubly shocking to see this previously unexplored outdoor space transformed into a field of lights. With curiously shaped light sculptures, strings of colorful LEDs, and even more trees both real and fake, there was something to look at wherever you turned. With the saturation of families and couples, the atmosphere felt warm and encompassing despite the cold, with hot chocolate and other treats available from vendors set up around Phipps. Admittedly, I felt a little out of place wandering solo among the crowds, but it was all well worth the visit.
Holiday Magic is around until January 6th, so I would recommend going before leaving for break. When I went, the event was not free even for CMU students because it was the opening night and thus required the purchase of a timed ticket, but things might have changed by now. Despite the price, it was a wonderful experience, and one that I highly recommend. Whether it’s with friends, a date, or by yourself, a visit to Phipps is sure to help lessen Winter’s cold and put you in a festive mood.

Recently, Netflix cancelled Daredevil, despite it being very successful critically and with fans; and earlier in the year, they also cancelled Iron Fist and Luke Cage. It’s clear that Netflix is winding down their corner of the Marvel Universe, which they cited was due to creative differences. But it’s baffling that they are doing this. These shows, especially Daredevil, were incredibly successful. But given Disney’s plans to create their own streaming service for their own content, it was only a matter of time before the Netflix universe came to an end. They will never say it’s because of Disney, but everyone knows it’s that. So, in honor of its cancellation, I figured I would finally gush about season 3 of Daredevil, which I have been wanting to do since October. 
Season 3 was easily the best season of all the Marvel Netflix shows. After a lull for the Netflix shows in the last year, season 3 came out swinging and knocked it out of the park. This is why the show’s cancellation blew my mind. They completely nailed it this season, and yet it got cancelled. Almost everything about it was perfect. This is the first season of all the Netflix Marvel shows where I didn’t feel the pacing all that much. There were a few elements that could have been cut here and there, but there wasn’t a single filler episode for once. Every subplot had something to do with the main story or contributed to a character’s arc throughout the season. Everything was tight and fresh, and there was a constant sense of forward momentum that made the season really intense. 
On the subject of intensity, let’s talk about the show’s action. This season raised the bar for action on TV. I can name every single fight scene in every episode, because each one was a standout. This season made a smart decision by only including one big fight per episode. This made each one more creative and intense, and they all had narrative purpose. There was one fight in episode four that floored me. It was an eleven minute single shot that transitioned between a fist fight, a plot-forwarding conversation, and a full scale prison riot. It’s one of the best action sequences I’ve ever seen, and I don’t think I can watch any other action scene on TV or film without comparing it to this show now. 
The other thing that made all the action intense was just how much you cared about all the characters. Matt Murdock’s crisis of faith creates a very compelling arc for him in the season that ended in a satisfying manner. You really feel his struggle to balance his duty as Daredevil, his life as Matt Murdock, and the religious belief that drives him. He was also incredibly underpowered this season after a devastating injury he sustained in The Defenders, which meant he was in constant danger and I felt like he could die at any moment. He is matched by Wilson Fisk, AKA Kingpin, who is now second to the Joker as one of the best on-screen comic book villains. He is menacing and calculating, with an incredible amount of depth that has been built since the first season. You get how he ticks, and while you realize it’s horrible, it’s also fascinating to watch him. He manipulates the season’s other villain, Benjamin Poindexter, AKA Bullseye. His character finds the right balance between scary and tragic, and you honestly feel bad for his character as much as you hate him. 
There honestly was no weak character this season. Returning side characters Foggy Nelson and Karen Page, both of whom I typically found annoying in the other seasons, were given a lot to do and had amazing character arcs. Ray Nadeem, the FBI agent watching over Wilson Fisk, is another side character who could have been handled in the most cliche and boring way possible. But the show avoids that and instead gives him excellent motivations, and as an Indian-American, I really appreciated the added details and accuracy of his family life. Father Lantom and Sister Maggie were great foils to Matt’s increasing cynicism with religion, and they provided this season with some of the best dialogue exchanges. 
It’s a shame that this show is cancelled now because there was so much potential for the show to get even better than it already is. But as it stands, season 3 is the final season of Daredevil, and it was a near perfect and fitting conclusion to an amazing, but flawed, show.

Nestled in the middle of South Craig Street, Eatunique is a cute cafe that offers a variety of sandwiches, soups, and salads. It’s my go-to place when I’m near Craig Street, and it’s quite convenient for students who live in the Oakland area off Fifth Avenue. It’s extremely consistent and reliable for a fresh and filling lunch in the middle of a busy day. 
The location: Craig Street is home to several food places, including Union Grill, Ali Baba, Little Asia, Lulu’s Noodles, and Sushi Fuku. Eatunique satisfies a Panera-sized hole for a fast and fresh American-style lunch made from real ingredients. It’s close to campus, close to several off-campus housing options, and is a short walk from several bus stops along the 61 and 71 bus routes.
The vibe: Casual. Eatunique is a simple cafe. It’s nothing fancy - don’t expect a hipster setting or a cute rustic layout. But what it doesn’t have in aesthetic, it makes up in ample seating. There are several different areas with tables, and it’s a great place to meet up with friends or find your own table.
The food: The real star here is the sandwiches. Eatunique offers several options off the grill, like the Great Rinaldi, an interesting combination of meat loaf, fried egg, and barbeque sauce, or the Spicy Grilled Cheese and Bacon, which is made with multiple cheeses that is complemented by the sourness of banana peppers. They have several vegetarian options, like the Malibu Avocado Burger or Southwest Sizzler, and deli options as well.
Lit or Nah: I wouldn’t necessarily characterize Eatunique as “lit,” but it’s a great option if you’re looking for something near campus when you’re sick of the on-campus options. But the real kicker here, beyond the convenience and food, is that they take DineX. Yes, they take DineX! That makes this lit times a thousand.

K-Pop Dance Club’s (KPDC) fall showcase, nightlife, brought in new vibes, new looks, and tons of new dances. Each semester, KPDC hosts a free showcase in the university center, where groups of club members perform numerous dances to popular k-pop songs. Every time I attend these showcases, I’m always so amazed by how many people love K-pop. There are usually over one hundred people that participate in the showcase, all of whom have various dancing backgrounds. This semester’s KPDC showcase was unique, where there was a greater variety of the types of dances that groups performed. There seemed to be a good balance of edgy, darker themed dances, like the ones to NCT 2018’s “Black on Black” or NCT U’s “BOSS”. But there were also more cutesy pop dances like the one to MOMOLAND’s “BAAM”, and even some smoother, sensual dances like for Jay Park’s “All I Wanna Do”. The variety worked perfectly with the event’s theme: nightlife. KPDC also did something this year that they’ve never done before which was host an afterparty, Luminescence, along with other cultural organizations Chinese Student Association and CMU Raasta. The entire KPDC event was a huge success, bringing in a full house of people for both the showcase and afterparty. I can’t wait to see what’s in store for next semester’s showcase!

Dear Michelle,
It’s the last week of the semester and I have never been so stressed! It’s ridiculous how much work I have right now, I don't think the workload has ever been this bad for me. Or let me clarify, I've always had a lot of work. But at least all the deadlines for my assignments were spread out in the week, and not due on the same day! This happened to me a couple of times this week, and it's all just left me feeling extremely overwhelmed. I don't know how I can go on to finish the semester. Do you think you could help me out? Tell me what to do!! 
Thanks, 
Definitely Overwhelmed, Never Ending 
Dear DONE, 
The first thing I have to say is hang in there. You're so so close and the final stretch of the semester is usually going to be the most difficult for everyone. I completely understand what you're going through, and so does almost every other student on campus. Please keep that in mind. We're all going through this together, and struggling with friends can actually be a pretty helpful way to deal with this stressful time. The first thing I would advise you to do is to talk to your closest friends or family members if you start feeling really overwhelmed. They can provide you with comfort and more advice on how to best deal with your stress. Reaching out to your friends is especially helpful because they'll likely be able to relate to you, and you all can work together to find ways for making this situation a little better.
On those days or nights when you have so many things due the next day, something that can help your mental organization is to allot an hour or so to work on each assignment that you have. That can help distribute your time and efforts, and also help you make progress on all your assignments. Also, please prioritize taking breaks. You don't want to completely burn yourself out while you're working. 
I know it's hard right now, but you're going to get through this. This probably also isn't the first time you've dealt with a stressful situation. But just remember to stay relaxed, stay focused, and ask for help when you need it, either from your friends, family, or even your teachers - it's definitely not a bad thing to ask for an extension. And trust that you'll make it through to the end of the semester in one piece. Have confidence in yourself and your abilities, and know that everything will all be fine in the end. 
Best, 
Michelle

Imagine Dragons surprised many with the release of their fourth album, Origins, while finishing up the final leg of their Evolve World Tour. Only a little over a year after the release of their previous album, Origins also came as a surprise because most artists, Imagine Dragons included, do not typically release new albums every year (their first album Night Visions came out in 2012 and Smoke and Mirrors released in 2015). As a huge fan of Imagine Dragons since my brother introduced me to Night Visions, I was thrilled when I found out I wouldn’t have to wait much longer for new music after Evolve's release in 2017.
In "Boomerang," lead singer Dan Reynolds offers up honest lyrics about the difficulty of letting go of past relationships. Comparing this lost love to a boomerang, he wonders, “Should we go ahead or should we turn around?” then follows up with “I know I’ll see you tomorrow,” showing the struggle to move past this relationship, since he constantly comes back.
“Cool Out” continues with this theme of love and failed relationships, and how the two stand with different perspectives; it shows how one wants to hold on, while the other feels as though there are too many differences between them to work out. The music perfectly matches the lyrics, with a slower, rhythmic beat as Reynolds muses about the relationship, and more intense and repetitive as the ex has to tell him to “go home” and “cool out” because their relationship isn’t working.
With a softer and more natural, acoustic feel to it, “West Coast” is a refreshing change from what a lot of Imagine Dragons’ music tends to be. It feels more open and real as he pleads to make his love stay, willing to do and be anything. Although he can’t be “Superman,” he will “be your West Coast … the sun … the waves … the one you love the most.”
“Only” and “Birds” seem to complement each other, with “Only” exploring a relationship that revolves around “you and me / only,” but it’s just a dream, and waking up from that dream in “Birds” and wishing that they were still together.
An upbeat individualist anthem, “Machine” expresses the idea of being one’s own entity, rather than just a part of a “machine” that others can control and manipulate. “Zero,” which was produced for Disney’s upcoming Ralph Breaks the Internet, surprisingly meshes well with the rest of the album. Despite being a fun and upbeat song, there are definitely deeper messages in it. Similar to “Machine,” it discusses being different from the crowds in another sense: feeling like nothing and trying to break out of that to become someone more. In that sense, both of these songs remind me of the song “Thunder” from Evolve, where Reynolds discusses wanting more from his life, and how he was able to make a name for himself while remaining true to his identity.
“Bullet in a Gun” acts almost as a counterpoint to “Zero” and “Machine,” tackling the struggle in the rise to fame, and how it can be a destructive industry. It talks about the ones who are unable to make the climb to the top, and how they can lose their minds or identities in the process of trying to be successful. Reynolds sings, “How many voices go unheard? / How many lessons never learned? / How many artists fear the light / Fear the pain, go insane? / Lose the mind, lose the self / (You only care about fame and wealth) / Sellout, sellout, sellout”
“Real Life” takes a darker tone, discussing the horrors of the world, and how we often watch in shock through the internet and news, struggling to cope with these atrocities we cannot control. In a desperate attempt to calm a struggling loved one, Reynolds sings, “Oh, hey, Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes / Can we live, yeah, real life, real life? // I wish I had the answers / Something you could hold too / Only thing that's real to me is / You.” In a similar vein, “Love” broadens the theme of love with greater social implications. It discusses the state of the world we live in and seeks to know “where did we all go wrong?”, emphasizing how perceived differences in race should not divide us and cause us to hurt one another since “We got the same heartbeat / We’re living for the same dreams / We got the same bloodstream.” 
The other songs on the album include “Stuck,” “Bad Liar,” “Digital,” “Natural,” and “Burn Out,” and although I don’t have much to say about these five in greater detail, I do appreciate them as much as the rest of the album.
Origins is unique, but possesses many qualities as a whole that are reminiscent of previous albums, making it easier to ease into the album upon its release. This seems to be a trend with Imagine Dragons, as each album adds a bit more nuance to their sound while ultimately maintaining their identity as a band. Unlike the last two albums, which took some time for me to adjust to and love (particularly with Smoke and Mirrors, which took me a few years to ease into), Origins was effortless and is probably my favorite album so far, stylistically and lyrically. Imagine Dragons has consistently produced a wealth of beautiful lines and verses, but Origins went above and beyond for me. The whole album was emotionally potent, not just in realistically portraying heartbreak in romance, but heartbreak with regards to the greater world.

On Oct. 29, Carnegie Mellon Housing department closed a deal purchasing the Fifth Neville apartments for $17 million. Tenants returned home that afternoon to find a folder slipped under their door labeled, “Acquisition Notice.” Inside was a four page document welcoming tenants to the CMU Housing community and explaining the terms of the purchase. Most significant to tenants, CMU Housing will not be renewing any tenant’s contracts and they will have to move out at the end of their lease. Though this acquisition will undoubtedly benefit the CMU Housing community, the transition has become a source of outrage and stress for many of the apartments’ current residents.
Fifth Neville is a popular spot due to its close proximity to the Carnegie Mellon and Pitt campuses. Jihoo Park, a 4th year Architecture major who resides in Fifth Neville, estimates that 98 percent of the building’s residents are students. “There is never a free room,” Park said, and to rent an apartment students have to put their name on a long waitlist. Park says that Fifth Neville has a significant community of South Korean and Chinese students, due to its proximity to Seoul Mart, a Korean marketplace.
Fifth Neville’s location was also important to CMU Housing. Its proximity to other housing options already owned by Carnegie Mellon makes it a natural addition. The building sits across from Residence on Fifth and is just blocks away from Fairfax, Webster, and Shady Oak, all of which provide apartment style living options through campus management.
International students took to Wechat, a Chinese social media platform, to air their grievances. Fan Yan, a junior in Mechanical Engineering, compared her experience to the Chinese government’s history of suddenly informing tenants that their building is being demolished. Just days before demolition a large “拆” character, directly translating to “tear down,” will appear on the outside of a building.
Many currents residents of Fifth Neville moved there with the intent to stay until they graduated. This is the case for Christina Chou, a junior in Information Systems, who is outraged and disappointed with both CMU Housing and Neville’s past management. “The reason I moved out from Fairfax to Neville in my second year is that I do not want to move again!”
CMU Housing plans to renovate Fifth Neville Apartments to bring it up to CMU Housing standards, and do not see renovations with people living in there as a viable option. They have already installed a fire extinguisher under the sink of every room and plan to “sprinkelerize” the building.
A Letter to the Editor titled “Carnegie Mellon needs to support the tenants they displace” was published on Nov. 18, scrutinizing the purchase of Fifth Neville. The writer, PhD student Daniel Sun, is concerned that the manner in which CMU Housing handles this transition will set a precedent for future property acquisitions, which Xi presumes will continue in the future to accommodate an increasing student population.
Tom Cooley, the Executive Director of Housing Services at Carnegie Mellon, told The Tartan that he understands the students’ perspective, but assured The Tartan that CMU Housing does have the students’ best interest at hand. He noted that the building was for sale and that anything could have happened to it, and that CMU Housing is managing it more to the students’ needs. Additionally, CMU Housing is allowing current student residents to participate in the room selection process for next semester, and many students have expressed gratitude.
When asked about CMU Housing’s plans going forward, Cooley said that CMU Housing wants to provide spaces for students to thrive outside of the classroom. He said they are going to continue to invest in current and future infrastructure, but did not outline any specific moves they seek to make.
Not all residents are so troubled by the acquisition. Brandon Fu Hao Pek, a sophomore in Computer Science, is content with the opportunity to move back into campus housing. “I was planning to just live [in Fifth Neville] for a year and head back on-campus next year cause I like the on-campus community, compared to how I don’t really know my neighbors right now.” Additionally, Brandon didn’t see the acquisition as much of an “ordeal,” noting that no one is obligated to renew a lease.
Chou has previously lived in both dormitory and apartment style on-campus housing, but has found her off-campus experience most comfortable. She explained that her current bed is much larger than the twin beds offered by Carnegie Mellon and has significantly improved her sleeping habits, and that being able to sleep in her own bedroom has made her relationship with her roommate much more tolerable.
Park was already considering moving out of Fifth Neville because his roommates are graduating at the end of the Spring semester, but now that he doesn’t have a choice. It feels different, and there is a level of stress. “I wasn’t planning on it, but now I don’t have a choice.” He continued, “I always see CMU spending money, and those are probably really good improvements towards the University, but sometimes it makes me salty because none of those actually affect me in a positive way. And now it is affecting me in a negative way.”
Looking forward, Chou is concerned about a decrease in availability of off campus housing. “I understand that incoming freshman need more space, but upperclassmen deserve the rights to live near campus as well. With Neville being acquired, almost all surrounding apartments belong to campus housing.”
It has only been a month since the deal closed. CMU Housing plans to work with students in the Spring semester to try to make their transition as smooth as possible and encourages students to reach out for help.

In the weeks following President Jahanian’s inauguration, one perhaps unintended consequence has arisen: the lawn in front of the College of Fine Arts building is more akin to a plowed field than a grass lawn after the removal of the large tent set up for inauguration events.
It is a situation that has left students on campus frustrated. The lawn is a common walking path and one of the first things people see when they walk on campus, but it has been almost grassless since even before the inauguration, after being previously damaged by the first-year orientation events.
The Tartan spoke with Julianne Mattera, National Media Relations Representative for Carnegie Mellon’s Marketing & Communications department, who explained that “the grass in front of CFA is typically replaced each fall following orientation because of the damage caused by the tent that is constructed in that location.” Instead of replacing the grass after orientation events this year, “the university decided to instead wait until after Inauguration to replace the grass because of the tent for that event.”
Some also worried about the cost of the landscaping work, and whether it too would be covered by the Board of Trustees funding for the inauguration tent, as The Tartan reported the week after the inauguration.
Instead, Mattera states that the replacement of the lawn is “built into the university’s operating budget,” as “the [College of Fine Arts] lawn was purposefully used for both Orientation and Inauguration, instead of using a different location for each, to minimize the cost and impact to campus grounds.”
The decision to use the lawn for two separate events and not replace the grass in the time between them was indeed an effective cost saving measure, yet, weeks after the inauguration, the grass has not been replaced. Mattera told The Tartan that “the intent was to replace the turf immediately following Inauguration, but the unusually wet November prevented that work.”
With December’s lowering temperatures and increased snowfall, however, Carnegie Mellon Facilities Management groundskeeping, who are in charge of the relawn, are surely going to face continued difficulty in replacing the grass. The Tartan reached out for a comment from them, but unfortunately, no response was given.
Since the inauguration, people continue to air their frustrations with the aesthetic of the lawn. Someone unknown to The Tartan even vandalized a sign that read “Turf Renovations in Progress - Please Use Sidewalk” with the sentence “[lawn] will be physically assaulted again in 2019.”
In terms of outward appearance, Sophia Angel, a junior in Dietrich College and a Carnegie Mellon Andrew Ambassador, told The Tartan that when giving tours to prospective students, parents, and visitors, Andrew Ambassadors “do not mention the lawn unless specifically asked because talking about the lawn is not in our tour script.”
Angel continues, “when someone does make a comment we talk about the event that happened which caused the mess,” as in the inauguration of President Jahanian. Despite some campus displeasure over the state of the lawn, Angel says “I personally don’t think the state of the lawn detracts from the appeal of CMU especially because we direct everyone’s attention to the academic mall, which is stunning.”
As of now, The Tartan is unsure of exactly when the lawn will be replaced. But as outdoor spaces typically aren’t heavily used in the winter, we can look forward to sitting on the College of Fine Arts lawn when the weather warms, at the very least.

You’ve probably heard of the Marine Corps, the infantry wing of the United States Navy, travelling across land, sea, and sky to kill people, but the CyberCorps might be a little less well-known. That might change soon, with the recent $5 million National Science Foundation (NSF) renewal to the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service Program at Carnegie Mellon University (SFS@CMU).
The program, according to the Carnegie Mellon CyLab website, covers all or part of tuition, room and board, and books for up to two years of graduate studies, while also providing an annual stipend of $34,000. In return, the students are required to do an internship with a government agency and work for the government for at least two years following their graduation. If a student does not finish their degree in two years or leaves the post-gradation position before their time is up, they must pay back the scholarship money for the time they didn’t serve. This means that if a student leaves, say, a year into their government job, they are required to pay back $34,000, plus a year’s tuition, room and board, and books, to the SFS Program Office.
The ethics of locking students into government contracts in order to afford the rapidly inflating costs of higher education are concerning, but these scholarships are a common way to draw highly-skilled students into public service.
According to a university press release, Carnegie Mellon “has received approximately $25.8 million through the SFS program and graduated 210 SFS students who have gone on to work for the CIA, FBI, NSA and…other government organizations.”
This program is another example of the close relationship Carnegie Mellon has with the federal government, with $172 million in $172 million in direct funding to the university coming from the Department of Defense in 2017, as well as the university’s close relationships to military contractors like the RAND Corporation.
The cybersecurity focused program, according to an SFS factsheet, is a partnership between the NSF and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to “attract students to the cybersecurtiy [sic]/information assurance fields.” While “cybersecurity” might sound like a defensive occupation, the Trump administration’s national cybersecurity strategy included “authorizing offensive cyber operations against foreign adversaries,” according to an article published this year in The Washington Post.
The sponsorship of DHS means that students may work on projects like the installation of facial recognition systems at the border, which capture the “facial biometrics of travelers entering and departing the United States,” raising ethical questions about governmental surveillance.
The National Security Administration (NSA), one of the employers cited in the university press release as a potential employer for students in the SFS program, is also involved in massive data collection programs. These programs, such as the mass collection of United State citizens’ phone records and mining personal data from private servers, received substantial criticism when the news broke in 2013.
The NSA’s data collection programs have only accelerated since then, with the NSA collecting “more than 534 million records of phone calls and text messages,” in 2017, a threefold increase over 2016, according to The Washington Post. The SFS@CMU program does require that students take a single ethics course, but it is questionable how effective this single course will be in combatting the continued expansion of such programs.
While the students do have their choice of government agencies to work for, many may be drawn into projects like these, making choices that negatively affect the privacy and lives of millions. Scholarships like SFS demonstrate the necessity of expanding ethics education for students who have to make lasting choices about what they want to do, and inevitably end up in positions where the systems they build greatly affect the world.

“Wrap up the fall season with TEDxCMU’s coziest event of the year!” This was the tagline for TEDxCMU’s Fall Mini Event, and between the complimentary doughnuts, coffee, and Red Bulls, the Christmas lights strung around the railings of Giant Eagle Auditorium, and Baker Hall’s sheltering warmth, the event certainly lived up to this standard.
Four students spoke at the Mini Event: first was Sarah Boyle, a junior in Drama, who spoke about comedy as an agent for change. Next, Zirui Zheng, a masters student in Information Systems discussed his journey of self-identification. Third, senior in Biological Sciences Raashmi Krishnasamy detailed three steps that Carnegie Mellon students can take to succeed happily. Lastly, Ethan Yang, a freshman in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, spoke about how an accidental haircut got him out of his comfort zone.
Boyle began by explaining that “playing to the truth” and being believable to the audience is crucial in a successful performance. She said that stereotypes are important in improv comedy because they make the situations believable, but they may be demeaning to the characters.
Improv can also be used to change people’s ideas of what is normal and believable, Boyle explained, and spoke on the power of diversity in comedy. When an improv troupe has more diversity, it contains more personal perspectives, which it can use to help normalize more diverse ideas.
The second speaker, Zheng, spoke about the experiences he has had since coming to the United States from China seven years ago, and the lessons that he has learned. When he first moved to the U.S., he adopted the name Michael. Afterward, he began to contemplate the balance of Chinese and American culture in his life.
After living in America for a few years, he learned many valuable lessons. First, he learned that stereotypes can be true sometimes, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Zheng also emphasized the importance of uniqueness and being comfortable with that uniqueness. He explained that everyone is unique, but that uniqueness only shows when people are comfortable being themselves. And when you are yourself, people respect that. Lastly, he spoke about how the United States is full of unique, diverse cultures, and how it is our job to bring out this uniqueness and diversity in everyone.
During her presentation, Krishnasamy explained that happily succeeding at Carnegie Mellon can be achieved in three steps: by asking yourself why you are making your current choices, being truthful with your answer to the first question and striving for excellence rather than perfection.
One day, Krishnasamy ended up in the hospital, and she discovered that her illness was partly caused by stress. She realized that if she had asked herself why she made certain choices, like why she was taking 15-112 as a pre-med student, and more importantly, been truthful with her answer, then she would have realized earlier that she was studying something she was not truly passionate about.
Lastly, Krishnasamy explained that Carnegie Mellon students should not strive for perfection because perfection is unreachable, citing Carnegie Mellon’s stress culture as a driver behind students’ quest for perfection. She suggested that our students should be striving for excellence instead because excellence is limitless. When a student has passion, purpose, and takes these three steps, then that student is on their way to happily succeeding at Carnegie Mellon.
Yang, the fourth and final speaker at the Fall Mini Event, spoke about how a haircut helped him to become more comfortable with all aspects of himself. When Yang was in fourth grade, he was diagnosed with moyamoya, a disorder caused by blocked arteries in the brain. After a stress-crying fit, he passed out and then needed brain surgery, which left incisions on both sides of his head.
He was so worried about being different that he always kept long hair to hide his scars. However, in his junior year of high school, his barber slipped up and gave him a haircut in which his scars were completely visible. When he went to school, he was bombarded with questions about them. At first, he was very uncomfortable talking about it, but after a while, he grew to be comfortable with it.
Yang said that getting out of his comfort zone led to a lot of personal growth. He left the audience with this message: “It changed my life — try it and see how it changes yours.”
Samuel Yip, the co-president of TEDxCMU, said that these speakers were chosen because the messages of their speeches were very pertinent to Carnegie Mellon students. 
Anyone interested in hearing their speeches can find them on YouTube. Yip said the TEDxCMU team is working hard to prepare for two upcoming events: the spring Mini Event, which will take place in February, and the main event, which is scheduled for March 30, 2019.

In the weeks after the Tree of Life shooting a memorial was installed in the University Center’s Lee Lobby, commonly referred to as “the brown chairs.” The memorial was designed to be a safe space to reflect and grieve as a community.
Cushions are placed around two large coffee tables, and a small metal fence surrounded the memorial on all sides but one. The famous Jewish proverb “it is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it” is printed in golden vinyl onto one of the two tables, along with the proverb’s Hebrew characters. A plaque is posted on every side of the fence, asking readers to take some time to reflect and come together in this time of healing. Students were invited to write or draw on a card, cut a piece of thread, and tie it on the fence.
The memorial was planned and constructed in the days after the tragedy by CMU Uplift, a small group of people who seek to positively impact campus, in conjunction with Kristen Hughes, a graphic design professor. They felt inclined to help the community in some way, and sought to integrate themselves with the commemorative actions already being taken by CMU Hillel, Chabad and AEPi.
Adjacent to the memorial, three piles of stones were placed up against the glassine windows. These memorial stones were placed on the Fence in the two weeks after the shooting. Hillel had brought them over after the Fence was repainted.
The memorial is still up in the Lee Lobby, and by now has gathered nearly 100 responses. On Wednesday, Nov. 28, Sarah College of the Provost's Office and Daragh Byrne, an architecture professor, met with Hughes at the memorial in the Lee Lobby to discuss what to do next.
They remarked on how large the memorial has grown. In the first days the memorial was up, they recalled, the Lee Lobby was quiet and students seemed almost afraid to sit in the chairs casually.
Meditating on how everyone deals with grief individually, College said “Some would just read a prompt, and then read a couple responses and walk away, some wrote the first thing that came to mind, and others really sat down and thought “do I want to participate, and in which way...I watched some students that were here for 45 minutes.”
Emphasizing the multitude of languages that people had responded in, Hughes reflected on how beautiful it was to see community, in all forms, coming together. “There is something very universal as we grieve, but also as we think about where we are going in the future and what our place in all this is,” Hughes elaborated.
The proverb “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it” references the name of the desecrated synagogue, but it also looks forward. Hughes emphasized that “it goes against all forms of hate. It is about resilience.”

At the close of every year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and society at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the campus and our society.
A thistle for the eternal legacy left by Stan Lee, whose death was met with great sadness and deep reverence. Despite the shock of his passing, his iconic work will always be regarded as hugely influential on modern American pop culture.
A thorn to the tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue. On Oct. 27th, 2018, a gunman entered the building, shouted anti-Semitic statements and opened fire, killing eleven and injuring seven. 
A thistle to the Carnegie Mellon community for rallying together in the wake of the tragic Tree of Life shooting. Students engaged in discussions, attended vigils, painted the fence, and held fundraisers in support of the Pittsburgh Jewish community.
A thorn to the tragic death of Pittsburgh-born rapper Mac Miller, who was the unfortunate victim of a drug overdose in September. His passing prompted thousands of fans to mourn his passing with a vigil in Pittsburgh’s Blue Slide Park, which he named his debut album after.
A thistle to the Philadelphia Flyers’ mascot Gritty, who with a terrifying orange beard and crazy googly eyes, has become an internet darling. Gritty has done just what a mascot should: be an instantly recognizable symbol that raises the Flyers’ national profile. The mascot should get extra thistles for his anti-fascist clout.
A thorn to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, prominent journalist and critic of some aspects of the Saudi regime, at the hands of the regime he had critiqued. His murder is a dark sign to journalists and defenders of free speech across the world.
Thistles to the new campus renovations: most notably La Prima in Wean Hall and the dining areas in the new Tepper Quad. Now there are more places for us to get bougie coffee in-between classes!
A thorn to the colossal tent that took the idyllic CFA lawn and turned it from a place for students to hang out with friends and study in the outdoors into a gigantic mud pit.
A thistle to the shift from Culinart to Chartwells. Overall, food quality has gone up due to this switch.
A thorn to the Underground renovation. Now, because of its hipster restaurant in a gentrified neighborhood-aesthetic, the safe haven for students staring at their screens and on the verge of mental breakdowns is destroyed. First-years will now never know the comfort of being able to finish a paper and cry while being hidden by the dim lighting. Extra thorn for them misspelling "Pittsburgh," omitting the "h."
Special thistles to all that worked together following the Campus Cupboard study that revealed widespread food insecurity here at Carnegie Mellon. This year, the CMU Pantry opened up in the Residence on Fifth. Students can get fresh and canned food twice a week by visiting the pantry. We are excited to watch a community develop around the pantry!
Thorns to the bizarre crime incidents near campus. In an ongoing stream of weird and disturbing campus crime alerts, the university was notified of a man wearing a scream mask attempting to rob people at gunpoint near the university. While watching the horror movie classic might be a fun Halloween activity, having it inspire the near-campus robberies extending over the past few months was less than thrilling. However, the serial masturbator(s) would not be outshined and made it in a few crime alerts, most notably at a nearby Starbucks. Both prompted students to be extra aware of to their surroundings. 
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon’s 10th president, Farnam Jahanian. Prior to his Presidency, Jahanian served as the University’s Provost and Chief Academic Officer for two years. He has already left his mark on the University as Chairperson of the Task Force by leading the Strategic Plan 2025, and introducing other new programs. The Tartan looks forward to the impact he will make during his time as President of the University!
A thorn to the recent acquisition of the Fifth Neville Apartments by Carnegie Mellon, an action that perpetuates the unethical and ill-considered displacement of Pittsburgh residents in quickly developing areas. This decision is not only controversial for its explicitly immediate consequences but also for the longstanding Carnegie Mellon history of displacing local communities for the sake of university plans.
A thistle for the $50 million in scholarships announced during President Jahanian’s inauguration. Cindy and Ted Johnson, both Carnegie Mellon alumni, made the largest scholarship donation the University has ever received. They made this donation to try to open up the Carnegie Mellon experience to students from lower income families, and lessen the burden of student debt for some students. This is an effort that the University must prioritize in order to truly have a diverse student body.
A thorn to the archivist and the Caliban owner that conspired to sell stolen rare books from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Both Caliban and the Carnegie Library are important institutions for Carnegie Mellon students who like to read and study. It is a bummer that people charged with protecting books were responsible for defacing and stealing them. 
A thistle to the changes to Carnegie Mellon's course add, drop, and withdrawal that all took place this year. The earlier course drop deadline, now Oct. 8, gives students 31 class days to decide to drop a class instead of to the 51 students had previously, to encourage people to drop classes earlier and limit their stress. In addition, students can now drop a class at any time of the semester with no repercussions, up to three times in their undergraduate career.
A thorn to Judge Brett Kavanaugh being sworn in as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and the aftermath for survivors like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who are subjected to immense disrespect.
Thistles to the 2018 midterm election results! There’s much work to be done to enfranchise all people, but large voter turnout and the representativeness of the elected officials were all major wins!
A thorn to the Trump administration’s policy of separating hundreds of migrant children from their families and housing them in tent cities and subpar facilities.
A thistle for the increased diversity in Hollywood. We saw the release of Marvel’s Black Panther, which not only made over one billion dollars, but inspired a cultural movement and became a milestone in black representation. We also saw the release of Crazy Rich Asians, the first dominantly Asian cast in a Hollywood movie in 20 years, committed to telling the stories of Asians, by Asians.
A thorn for the tragic fire that destroyed the National Museum of Brazil. The museum lost up to 20 million priceless historical and scientific artifacts in the fire, many of which were important parts of scientific and cultural research.
A thistle to Diane Turnshek and her group of researchers who have worked on taking pictures of the night sky to further our understanding of light pollution. Here’s to a future with reduced light pollution, where we can bask in the subtle glow of more visible stars. 
A thorn to the surge of wildfires that have swept through California this summer, displacing thousands from their homes, devastating communities, and taking over a hundred lives. 
Lastly, a thistle to all the readers of The Tartan! Thanks for another great year!

In 2012,  National Rifle Association (NRA) Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said, in light of the Sandy Hook school shooting, “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun." In the numerous shootings since — and the overall dialogue on gun regulation — this quote has been used as an argument time and time again for opponents of gun control.
Taking out the word "only," LaPierre's quote isn't illogical. There have most certainly been times in which a "good guy with a gun" stopped "a bad guy with a gun," or at least mitigated potential damage. Stories about people successfully using their legally-owned arms to defend themselves may not be on the front pages, but a quick search can show you a good array of examples. For instance, in Oklahoma, an armed bystander of a bar shooting intervened and reduced the number of deaths to just one: the shooter. Of course, in such stories, the involvement of the bystanders should be applauded. However, such stories remain just that: individual stories. They alone cannot be extrapolated to show causal relationships or definitive statements.
Unfortunately, too many of these stories don’t have happy endings. This November, in the suburbs of Chicago, black security guard Jemel Roberson was reportedly detaining a man shooting in a bar. Authorities were told to look out for an armed suspect. With this in mind, Roberson — despite wearing his security guard uniform — having a gun was the cause for him to be killed by an unnamed officer. More recently, in Hoover, Alabama, 21-year-old Emantic "EJ" Bradford was the latest "good guy with a gun" who was mistakenly identified as a gunman who injured two teenagers when, in reality, he was a man with a legally-owned gun who was allegedly "trying to wave people away from the shooting" just moments before he was shot by police. Although a "good guy with a gun" did stop a "bad guy with a gun" in these cases, the intervener's reward was death at the hands of trigger-happy police.
Again, these unfortunate incidents alone cannot confirm nor deny LaPierre's core argument. Case studies lack the substantiality to draw causal relationships. However, the search for data to find overall trends that could help us find the answer is discouraging. In the mid-90s, economist John Lott co-authored a study that argued that concealed carry deters crime. However, the statistics provided are shallow, only displaying the number of observations, mean, and standard deviation. Since then, opponents have deemed a 2004 National Academies National Research Council report a rebuttal, although the latter research does not provide such a conclusive argument as Lott's. A report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2014 showed that in terms of sheer number of instances, unarmed citizens restraining shooters were far more common than armed citizens. Obviously, this statistic alone is inconclusive; the number of unarmed citizens walking around on a daily basis is more than likely greater than the number of armed citizens. However, this comes to show a crack in LaPierre's logic; perhaps it is not the gun that empowers the good guy but rather the good guy himself taking initiative to intervene.
So how much weight does LaPierre's argument carry? It's extremely difficult to say. However, I have a hard time believing it is the only way, and the majority of this nation agrees. Statements with such definite terms are hardly ever completely true, and this is no exception. Looking into policies like maintaining background checks, or improving our mental health system to ensure guns don't fall into the wrong hands, doesn't stop the "good guy" from getting his gun. Does it eliminate the chance of the "bad guy" getting his gun? Of course not. But neither does the status quo, and solely relying on a strawman "good guy" hasn't gotten us anywhere in terms of the dialogue on gun violence. Just because a good guy with a gun is one deterrent of gun-related violence, being competent with placing the burden on the "good guy" is not enough, especially when the fate for their deed may be a bullet in their head.

This year’s California wildfire season has been one of the most destructive ever, with nearly 1.7 million acres of land burned. To make matters worse, torrential rains are now causing flash floods that are trapping people in its homes and cars. With no natural barriers in the way, the only salvation for those stranded are the deployed water rescue teams.
We like to think that as humans, we are at the mercy of the elements, that whatever mother nature throws at us we must take in stride, because we have no say in the matter. This idea stems from the earliest days of human civilization, when we really did have to defend ourselves against storms and floods that were no fault of our own.
Today’s reality is very different, so we need to discard the notion that the weather is some intangible event. Storms, wildfires, and other phenomena are all products of our environment, one that we have continuously destroyed through wasteful consumerism and destructive business practices. From dumping industrial waste into the rivers to leveling the Amazon Rainforest, there really is no limit to the damage we can do. As a consequence, we are hit with harsher natural disasters, ones that take human lives.
Scientists have warned us ceaselessly that we are fast approaching the climate collapse, and it seems that we have already passed the point of no return. The question now is not how we can fix the planet; it’s how we can lessen the impact. We’ve all heard about how we can make a difference through our personal habits, and while it’s hard to stay consistent — I know I struggle with it — we should still try. Small sacrifices, aggregated across large populations, can lead to some legitimate good.
But it’s hard to mobilize masses, because there’s a systemic failure in our nation, and it is the prevalence of anti-science.
Greed and corruption are motivating forces for turning a blind eye to abhorrent acts, and the current government is very open about their blatant disregard for global warming and other threats to our planet. We see this at the highest level of government, with Trump having not only withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accords, but also saying on multiple occasions that he doesn’t believe in global warming.
We see this with other politicians, and it’s always straight denial, or at least some serious doubt. Many of them even try to actively disprove climate change, such as when Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) brought a snowball into the Senate chamber, using the fact that it was cold outside to "disprove" global warming. Now obviously, these politicians are not simply stupid or irrational — at least, I hope not. They’re bankrolled by big corporations to protect companies from environmental regulations; the cheaper and dirtier the methods, the greater the profits. We see the same reasoning with gun control, where the solution is never to bolster restrictions.
Willfully ignorant politicians are only part of the problem. What’s even more troubling is that there are people who wholeheartedly believe that climate change is false and that there’s nothing wrong with the planet after all. Unlike other ridiculous theorists (such as the flat-earthers), these everyday climate change deniers pose a serious threat because they will do everything within their power to upend established and empirically proven scientific thought.
There’s the old saying about never debating stupid people because they will just drag you down to their level and beat you there. Therefore, avoiding these people at all costs seems like a sensible thing to do. They do their thing and we stick to our enlightened realm of scientific fact rather than their domain of illogical, ideologically driven fiction.
Yet much like those who spread hate speech online, the only way to combat these people is to continue engaging with them. We cannot push all the climate change deniers off our platforms because thanks to the wonders of modern technology, they will just find each other and create an echo chamber. Rather, we have to continue to combat their anti-science perspectives with sound arguments, no matter how painful it may be.
People are entitled to their own opinions, even when it comes to objective facts. It’s fine to disagree on something, as long as you do so for a legitimate reason. Depending on your ethics, getting rich, seizing power, or satisfying your own ideology may be sound motives. If that’s the case, then please do so in more environmentally friendly ways, ones that recognize the legitimacy of global warming. If, on the other hand, you find such motivations despicable, then speak out against it. Climate change deniers, like other dangerous minorities, are only prevalent because we do not do enough to rebuke them, as they thrive off of our apathy.
Just because the people in charge are myopic and gridlocked does not mean we have to be as well. It’s not good enough to simply fight against climate change in a physical sense; we also have to fight along an ideological front, discrediting all those ideologies that undermine the gravity of the situation. So next time you see someone openly denying climate change, say something — the future might depend on it.

As the year approaches an end, I went down a rabbit hole. I tried to psychoanalyze the trend of far-right, authoritarian leaders being elected or allowed to stay in power in the last few years. Sure, there are some leaders, like Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan, and Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, who manipulated the political system in their favor to keep themselves in power. But Brazil voted for Jair Bolsonaro, a man who looked favorably upon military dictatorships. Hungary and Italy both voted for far-right parties, and Hungary has a supermajority with its far-right parties. Denmark’s far-right party saw a surge in support. Of course, I can’t forget to mention that Brexit happened in 2016, as did the election of Donald Trump. I know why this all happened. I know how history repeats itself. But I wanted to look towards my own understanding of human behavior and apply that to my understanding of what freedom and democracy means. Doing that, I concluded something.
Human beings don’t deserve democracy and freedom. 
That is the first part of a two-part conclusion, but I have to explain what this first part really means. Admittedly, I am looking at this as someone more familiar with U.S. politics, but the concept applies to really any democracy. A basic tenet of democracy is that you’re free to vote and you have rights. The trouble is that the authoritarian leaders are elected because voters are willing to sacrifice some of their freedom in exchange for security due to fear stoked by these far-right leaders. In Europe, the fear stems from immigrants, and in Brazil, from corruption and crime. I’m of the opinion that anyone willing to sacrifice freedom and democracy for security and stability out of fear doesn’t deserve freedom and democracy in the first place. 
The reason for this is that it gives the leaders carte blanche to enact increasingly undemocratic policies. Many will argue that nothing truly “bad” has happened, which is not true at all. Keep in mind Brexit happened without the UK Independence Party (UKIP), Britain’s far-right party with a platform based on nativism and anti-migrant fear, being in power. In Hungary, the far-right party in power is moving to amend the constitution to limit checks and balances. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, champions illiberal democracy. Italy’s own far-right party has also been threatening the system of checks and balances. 
The election of these leaders just seems so hypocritical to me. I understand that there is desperation, hope, and fear. I understand that the situation of many nations like Brazil and Italy is one of strife. But why vote in someone who clearly would facilitate more turmoil? What is Bolsonaro’s willingness to torture and engage in extrajudicial killings going to do for the rate of violence in Brazil? How is turning away migrants going to help the Italian economy or any European economy? If anything, European nations need more immigrants to help improve their economy. A vote for a far-right leader is a vote against democracy and freedom. Anyone who fails to see that or sees it and votes far-right anyway doesn’t deserve either. Frankly, no human does. We are greedy, selfish, fearful, irrational, and unkind as a species. It’s in our nature to want to be led in some way and to have some direction, even if the direction is an authoritarian regime that doesn’t care about anyone. True character is revealed under pressure, and when the pressure is too much, we resort to fearmongering and a desire for stability instead of valuing our basic rights. 
However — and this is the key part of my conclusion — even if we humans don’t deserve freedom and democracy, we need it. As much potential as there is for negative change, we have the equal potential for positive change, and democracy provides that. For all my cynicism, there is a part of me that knows that things will improve. It’s in our nature to fear, sure, but that fear is dispelled when we realize we have made mistakes, and we work to amend our mistakes. There will be a lot of damage done for sure, but nothing is irreparable. When we realize that we made a mistake, we will vote to fix things again. This happened in the U.S. midterm elections, and it will happen in Hungary, Italy, and Brazil later on. So for all those like me who feel disillusioned and dismayed about people and about the rise of far-right, authoritarian leaders, hold out some hope. It’s difficult in an increasingly cynical world and we will have to witness a lot of terrible things, but it will get better as long as everyone pays attention and cares about what’s happening.

On Dec. 2 Frank Hu published "Anti-science: a global threat," where he proposed debating climate change skeptics- ostensibly to convert them. I emailed him and included a teaser: I used to be very worried about CO2 emissions, and have changed my mind. I also cited a couple of the numerous reasons why I have done so. There has been no reply from Hu, not even a "I'm neck deep in finals and will get back to you."  I infer, then, that Hu's interest is not in debate or informed discussion between open minds, but rather in proselytizing to the heretics. And heretics we are; there are public calls for believers like myself to be arrested, tried, imprisoned, and even executed. One wonders if the last would be by burning at the stake, a fitting homage to a prior inquisition also created by questioning the priesthood.
My principle reason for having changed my mind was the fact that climate "scientists" refuse to share their data and methodologies. Independent verification of data, data collection, analysis methods, and not silencing - but rather answering - critics are all foundational requirements of a valid scientific theory. Yet Warmists have outright threatened to delete their data rather than having it examined by those outside the clique.
A second reason is data fraud. Multiple instances of overt manipulation changing temperature trends from negative to positive exist. Animated graphs abound, e.g., at realclimatescience.com, showing how data has been adjusted to amplify, if not completely fabricate, increasing temperature trends. One graphic at that site highlights how tens of thousands of square miles of land - never mind water - have no temperature monitoring sites at all, but we are 
assured that temperatures there are record-setting.
Lastly, a valid theory can be proven false. But with the Holy Writ, it doesn't matter - warmer, colder, wetter, drier, stormier, or calmer, all are taken as 
proof. This violates the falsifiability standard. I highly recommend wattsupwiththat.com and climatedepot.com in addition to the above. I also recommend the books "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change," "Human Caused Global Warming," and "A Disgrace to the Profession."

The death of John Chau, an American self-styled missionary, at the hands of the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands has shone a spotlight on one of the last completely isolated groups of people. The Sentinelese arrived on the islands 35,000 years ago, and are believed to be descendants of the earliest humans to migrate out of the African continent. Chau tried approaching the tribe twice after bribing fishermen to transport him to the North Sentinelese Island in the Andaman Islands: once on Nov. 14, when tribe members had warned him away, and the last time on Nov. 16, when he did not heed warnings and was shot by an arrow. Calls then began to “modernize” the tribe, to punish those responsible for the death of Chau, and also to integrate the Sentinelese into the mainstream. 
Chau had broken laws that protected the Sentinelese. The laws were put in place because the tribe members have been isolated for so long that their immune system does not protect them from common diseases that affect so many of us. Diseases like the smallpox, measles, typhoid, and cholera were all brought to North America by European settlers. The Native American people, whose immune system had never faced such diseases and hence weren't protected from them, died in huge numbers when epidemics struck them. Even today, Native Americans continue to struggle with particular diseases. If the Sentinelese are exposed to a disease as simple as a common cold, there is a great danger of them being wiped out. “God, I don’t want to die,” Chau had written before his tragic death, but he was risking the lives of those in the tribe by even approaching them. 
As for the calls to “modernize” the Sentinelese, isn’t it our ethical duty to take into consideration the fact that the Sentinelese have repeatedly expressed that they do not wish to contact outsiders? Although most consider the Sentinelese as primitive and deprived as they do not enjoy the material conveniences and benefits that we do, anthropologist Dr. TN Pandit, who had successfully made contact with isolated tribes like Onge and Jarawa in the Andaman Islands back in the 1970s and 90s, disagrees. “Social mores are such that an individual knows that when he commits a wrong, he has to punish himself. There is no tribal chief or council to enforce anything. The community indicates its disapproval by not looking at him, not talking to him. If food is in short supply, they will share. If there is plenty, they will feast. Selfishness is unknown. The clan follows monogamy and close relatives do not marry each other,” explained Pandit, about the tribe’s societal structure and way of living.
The Sentinelese also do not attack outsiders immediately. They show warning signs through facial expressions, knives, arrows, and bows. And if one does not heed the warning, they consider it a disrespect and then take action. Chau’s death was regrettable and tragic, but experts opine that had he heeded the tribe’s warning, he would still be alive.
Several people, in comments on social media, described the Sentinelese people as savages due to them not wearing clothes. Pandit explained, “The absence of attire does not mean anything to them. They believe that the body is nature’s gift and should be treated with respect.” 
Edward Said, in his book Orientalism, observes that "human societies, at least the more advanced cultures, have rarely offered the individual anything but imperialism, racism, and ethnocentrism to deal with ‘other’ cultures.” Chau had written in one of his last journal entries: “Lord, is this island Satan’s last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?” He was denouncing the island’s people without knowing, or wanting to know, what their culture is; his focus was on spreading his own culture and religion. He was imposing his “superiority” over them, despite his ignorance of the Sentinelese’s faith. In fact, the Sentinelese, like most Andaman tribes, are animists. They worship nature: the sky and the sea. 
In 1991, Madhumala Chattopadhyay was the only woman in the team of anthropologists that had, for the first and last time, made friendly hand-to-hand contact with the Sentinelese before the Indian government imposed restrictions in 1993 that prohibited contact with them. Reflecting on her visit to the island, she said “you feel that you are there to study, but actually, they are the ones who study you. You are foreign in their lands.”
The Sentinelese are the last people left of an ancient culture that has been untouched by the violence and conflict that predominantly defines our “mainstream” history and culture.  And we should celebrate these people who continue to live and preserve their culture without any outside help. We have breathed the same air and peacefully coexisted with them for centuries, and we should leave them alone if for no other other reason than that contacting them will most likely result in their deaths.

In a thoughtful and well-written column, Dietrich College student Emma Flickinger argues that we only seem to celebrate the humanities when they are connected to other disciplines, and rarely for their own sake. Although we should certainly celebrate the humanities all by themselves, I don’t view our efforts as a sign that we are letting the humanities “fall by the wayside,” rather I view it as a core part of an intentional strategy designed to help the humanities thrive at Carnegie Mellon. Flickinger’s piece did make me realize that we have to do a MUCH better job of showcasing our commitment to the humanities at Carnegie Mellon and explaining how we intend to grow them. In what follows, I will begin this project, but by no means finish it. 
Student interest in the humanities has been up and down over the last 50 years.  After the financial crisis of 2008, student anxiety over employability resulted in sharp drops nationwide in the number of humanities majors and the number of students enrolling in humanities courses.  At Dietrich, student interest in primary majors that lead to a first job (e.g., statistics, or information systems) has exploded, but student interest in additional majors and minors in the humanities has bucked the national trend and held steady. Of the four departments in Dietrich with the highest number of student enrollments in the 2017-2018 academic year, three were humanities departments.  Although only a tiny handful of the more than 90 distinct majors at Carnegie Mellon require a language, almost 45 percent of Carnegie Mellon students take a course in Modern Languages, a rate nearly triple the national average.   
Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines at Carnegie Mellon are increasingly recognizing the value of adding or integrating the humanities into their research and education, and this is what we want.  The demand for incorporating ethics, rhetoric, history or epistemology into topics like artificial intelligence, climate change, technological disruption or machine learning has increased dramatically.  We also welcome what STEM has to offer us in advancing our own scholarship in the humanities. What’s exciting, original, and truly valuable about Six Degrees of Francis Bacon is first and foremost the humanities part: what we have discovered, with the help of computers, about the world of Francis Bacon, and about the social and power dynamics in early modern England. Flickinger wonders how many people who know about this award-winning project even know who Francis Bacon was. Well, more will now, thanks to a collaboration between a Carnegie Mellon literary scholar (Christopher Warren) and a statistician (Cosma Shalizi).
What we are doing with the humanities is what Carnegie Mellon does with all of its disciplines: encourage them to combine freely with each other and all other disciplines, especially when doing so leads to better ways to investigate questions that matter.  This is our secret sauce.  
When disciplines live inside of silos, they go stale. We have to make the humanities invaluable to scholars, students, and employers. In my view, the best route to this end is to join forces with other disciplines whenever and wherever we can.  Our Philosophy Department has made itself so desirable to researchers in biomedicine, computer science, psychology and other disciplines that this academic year they will receive over $2 million in grant funding from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and U.S. Air Force.  This is singular among American universities, but because of it, the department can also employ philosophers who do philosophy for its own sake.   
We are extremely excited about the energy in the humanities at Carnegie Mellon. In the spring, we will present the initiatives we are undertaking, both in research and in education.  We will organize a town hall open to all students, staff, and faculty interested in the humanities and their future at Carnegie Mellon, and discuss our strategy openly.  If we are to make Dietrich a destination for Carnegie Mellon-style humanities, then we need and want your help.  
The leadership in Dietrich and Carnegie Mellon passionately believe that reflecting on the human condition is crucial to any education of value and that to do so effectively requires humanistic inquiry. We are first and foremost a university, and we will never let the humanities go by the wayside.
Richard Scheines (@scheienes) is the Dean of Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences.
