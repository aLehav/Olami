Chiefs, Bucs still powerhouses
When you’re playing against Patrick Mahomes or Tom Brady, a lead is never safe. As Mahomes showed in the 2019 playoffs, and Brady made clear against Atlanta in Super Bowl LI, these two always win close games. It’s no surprise that both of them led their teams to victory despite Cleveland’s and Dallas’ valiant efforts, respectively. Brady put up 379 yards and four touchdowns in a last-second 31-29 win against the Cowboys, and Mahomes tallied 337 yards and three TDs as the Chiefs beat the Browns 33-29. Thanks to the efforts of these two “Madden NFL 22” cover athletes, it’s clear that Tampa and Kansas City will be square in the Super Bowl hunt.
Steelers impress as Bills flounder
Many people wrote the Pittsburgh Steelers off this year after the awful end to their 2020 season. However, in week one, the Steelers proved why they are always in contention. The defense in particular was a bright spot, as they held the potent Bills offense to a meager 16 points. Moreover, the Buffalo offense and the $258 million dollar man himself, Josh Allen, failed to deliver in key moments as the Bills performed miserably on both the third and fourth down, as well as in the red zone.
AFC leaders stumble
The Bills weren’t the only AFC team with preseason hype to crash and burn week one. During the offseason, pundits across the country were high on AFC contenders Tennessee, Cleveland, Baltimore, Kansas City, Indianapolis, and Buffalo. This Sunday, all of those teams except Kansas City left their games 0-1. The Ravens choked badly against Jon Gruden’s Raiders; Tennessee played horribly in all three facets as they got blown off the field by Arizona; over in Indianapolis, Russell Wilson and Seattle picked apart the high-priced Colts defense; and finally, Cleveland and Buffalo both lost close games to Kansas City and Pittsburgh, respectively. There’s still plenty of time left for these talented teams, but they certainly got off on the wrong foot this season.
NFC West goes 4-0
There seemed to be a consensus around the league going into the new season that the NFC West was going to be very tough. That holds true for the division after week one, as all four teams won in convincing fashion. Seattle beat up on the Colts, the 49ers put up 41 in Detroit, Arizona dominated offseason darling Tennessee, and Matthew Stafford’s Rams coasted to a win over Chicago on Sunday night. Could all four NFC West teams make the playoffs? Unlikely, but the fact that it’s a legitimate possibility just serves to show how strong the NFC West is.
AFC West goes 4-0 too
What a weekend for the western divisions. The AFC West played great as the Chiefs, Chargers, Broncos, and Raiders all ended week one with a winning record. While it would be shocking if Kansas City doesn’t end up winning this division, the Chargers and Raiders can certainly contend for wild-card spots. Las Vegas has a terrible defense, but Derek Carr and Darren Waller will keep them in games. Moreover, in recent years, the biggest problem for the Chargers has been slow starts to the season. A win over a solid Washington football team should give Justin Herbert and company some breathing room as they enter a rather tough stretch in their schedule.
Aaron Rodgers disappoints
After an offseason full of trade speculation, it became clear that this is likely Aaron Rodgers’ last season in Green Bay. The 2020 MVP put up a stinker this weekend against the Jameis Winston-led Saints as he threw for a dismal 133 yards, along with two back-breaking interceptions. If Rodgers keeps playing like this, his schedule might clear up for “Jeopardy!” sooner than we thought.
Sophomore QBs shine
While many athletes fall victim to the sophomore slump, one glaring exception to that comes in the form of NFL QBs. Typically, quarterbacks take a good leap in production during their sophomore year. In week one, that was evident as sophomores Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert, and Jalen Hurts all led their teams to victory. Even though these sophomores still have plenty of detractors, no one can deny they got off to a great start.
Rookie QBs’ ups and downs
Let’s start with the good news: all five rookie first-round QBs had a touchdown this weekend. The bad news: four out of the five rookies lost. Furthermore, 49ers QB Trey Lance (the one winner) only played a few snaps in their win at Detroit. While these rookies certainly put up nice stats, their play hasn’t translated to wins just yet. There’s a lot of pressure being placed on these guys (especially Trevor Lawrence and Zach Wilson) to be franchise saviors. Fortunately for fans of the Jets, Jaguars, 49ers, Bears, and Patriots, they clearly showed potential.
Broncos, Panthers, Texans hurt their draft slot
It’s hard to think of starting QBs less inspiring than Teddy Bridgewater, Sam Darnold, and Tyrod Taylor. At least Darnold has a chance at a Tannehill-esque redemption story as one could argue Darnold could not be properly evaluated starting on the dysfunctional New York Jets. Likewise, Darnold cannot be properly evaluated even after beating the dysfunctional New York Jets. However, the Broncos and Texans have no excuses. Denver passed on Justin Fields and Mac Jones in the draft so they could trade for … Teddy Bridgewater? The Broncos could have been a sleeper team this year if they had drafted a QB. And I get that Bridgewater played well in their week one win, but he’s not a long-term answer. Maybe they’re biding their time for a Rodgers trade? Regarding the Texans, Tyrod Taylor is a tank commander. But the thing about tank commanders is that they’re supposed to lose. If Tyrod drags this Texans team to 6-11 and the 11th pick, they’ll have a hard time drafting a top QB next year.
Giants look ready to blow it up
Actually, I can think of a starting QB less inspiring than the three mentioned above: Daniel Jones. Jones hasn’t played terribly in his first two years and even during the 27-13 loss to Denver, his stats weren’t awful. But when those are the best compliments you can give to a quarterback, it’s not a good sign. I would say the Giants are too good to tank, but after seeing their performance in week one, I think that I’m wrong. Unless Daniel Jones can right the ship, he and GM Dave Gettleman are probably enjoying their last season in New York.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to permeate every sector of the U.S. economy. According to the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) in their March 2021 “The Final Report,” it will "transform virtually every aspect of our existence." Carnegie Mellon has partnered with the NSCAI in a virtual panel series starting this year discussing artificial intelligence's impact on "economy, national security, and welfare."
The panel series invited a variety of speakers from Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania robotics and AI institutions. The discussions so far have revolved around robotics, semiconductor production, Pittsburgh industries, and other ways the U.S. can use artificial intelligence to improve domestic competition.
"We've had an unfortunate narrative in the public where people have akin artificial intelligence to Terminator and Skynet, and that's not the case," NSCAI Commissioner Katharina McFarland said during the first panel discussion. "This technology is here to stay, and you'll see in everything that you read, the ubiquitous nature of this can be a challenge for us, or it can be an opportunity."
The first panel discussion on Aug. 18 was "AI and the Future of Manufacturing: A Synergetic Relationship," which discussed how artificial intelligence has begun integrating into supply chains. Gary Fedder from Carnegie Mellon's Manufacturing Futures Institute guided the conversation, which addressed many possibilities for AI to be involved in the supply chain, including in semiconductors and in robots that fuel many manufacturing processes. In the opening remarks, McFarland framed the discussion by mentioning insights from the NSCAI report, such as how national security is tied to economic strength and that AI could improve U.S. economic strength by improving manufacturing capabilities.
Robotics has been widely integrated into the manufacturing process, and the panel discussed different ways that AI could improve these robotics. Ira Moskowitz from the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute mentioned the various ways that AI can be applied to robotics, such as predicting human intent or developing simulations for robots in situations where there is limited real-life data. Elizabeth Ann Holm from the Air Force Center of Excellence on Data-Driven Discovery of Optimized Multifunctional Material Systems mentioned how AI could support the move to agile manufacturing, prioritizing customizability over scale, as providing customizability requires finding patterns from accumulation of data which AI excels at. Carnegie Mellon alumnus Jared Glover from CapSen Robotics also mentioned that right now, robots often have to be programmed for very specific tasks such as moving each individual finger, so robots cannot easily be repurposed for different tasks.
"When we talk about 'artificial intelligence,' intelligence is sort of with a lowercase 'i' right now," Glover said. "It's definitely not at human-level intelligence, no matter how you measure it."
Semiconductors are also a key part of the manufacturing process, powering robots and other necessary machinery. Shailesh Patkar from semiconductor company II-VI Incorporated mentioned how his company is using AI for inspecting chips and improving product efficiency and performance. Moskowitz added that since the semiconductor industry already runs so well, the only aspects left to improve are more complex, and AI excels at more complex operations. Holm also mentioned how the industry is shifting away from large, monolithic manufacturers to smaller manufacturers. Glover, however, pointed out that the adoption of these technologies have been slower in smaller manufacturers because of high costs, unfamiliarity with the technology, and difficulty repurposing robots.
The discussion then shifted to how the U.S. could invest in educating both workers and students in related industries. Holm also mentioned how, in order to support these supply chains, there must also be enough students in data science and AI to meet these demands. McFarland, Moskowitz, and Fedder added that the unique nature of the COVID-19 situation allows us to think about more hybrid, non-traditional classroom approaches to training technologists.

Spoilers for “The Green Knight.”
In the grand pantheon of stories that concern themselves with honor, chivalry, and sacrifice, the legends of King Arthur and his knights stand out. The Arthurian legends feature characters who test their loyalty and strength through various challenges where the hero goes on a journey and is fundamentally transformed. Of course, in recent years, many movies based on Arthurian legend have devolved into action schlock with horrific special effects. “The Green Knight” eschews all that for a beautiful, slow-paced, atmospheric, semi-erotic, contemporary update to the original poem on which it is based. 
The poem itself, titled “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” details the story of King Arthur’s nephew and youngest knight, Gawain. The Green Knight challenges Arthur and his knights to deal one blow to him. Gawain accepts the challenge and beheads the Green Knight. After one year, Gawain has to make the journey to the Green Chapel, where the Green Knight will be waiting to deal the same blow to Gawain. 
Gawain ventures across the land and is eventually welcomed by a lord, his lady, and an elderly lady who doesn’t speak. The lord proposes an exchange of winnings, promising Gawain that he will go hunting every day and will provide Gawain his entire hunting haul in exchange for whatever Gawain receives while staying at the castle. While Gawain is at the castle, the lord's lady seduces him, giving him kisses which Gawain then gives to the lord. 
On the final day Gawain stays at the castle, the lord's lady gives Gawain a girdle that will prevent him from physical harm and instructs him to keep the gift secret from the lord. Gawain departs from the lord’s castle and heads to the Green Chapel. The Green Knight tests Gawain’s mettle, and the girdle protects Gawain from being beheaded. The Green Knight reveals himself to be the lord of the castle earlier. It turns out that Gawain was being tested by the elderly lady in the castle, who is a sorceress and Arthur’s stepsister. Though Gawain lied about having the girdle, the Green Knight doesn’t blame him for it and Gawain returns to Camelot having essentially failed the journey. 
At its core, the story focuses on a man whose honor is fundamentally challenged and fails to uphold his virtue. But who would blame Gawain for protecting himself? After all, the blow in return from the Green Knight would have killed him. It is reasonable that even the most virtuous of knights would sacrifice their honor to protect themselves, especially when there is no benefit to being killed by the Green Knight. It’s a playful and interesting deconstruction of the traditional themes of honor, sacrifice, and chivalry that proves how futile those values are when faced with the reality of death. 
The film adaptation takes the aforementioned themes and flips them on their head. The story generally plays out similarly, but with significant changes to Gawain’s character. Gawain is not a knight in the film adaptation; instead, he’s just the reckless nephew of the honorable King Arthur who spends his time in brothels and pubs. His mother summons the Green Knight to test her son’s honor and might, and Gawain recklessly beheads the Green Knight when none of the other knights wanted to. 
The result of this is essentially a hero’s journey where the main character fails repeatedly. He can’t admit his love for the woman he is with. Within the first day, he loses his horse, armor, and sword to bandits. He falls sick eating psychedelic mushrooms. He flinches when he sees giants. When it comes to the sequence with the lord and the lady, he doesn’t even follow through on the “exchange of winnings” proposal, sexually engages with the lady, and takes the girdle to protect himself. Gawain’s character is fundamentally dishonorable, almost as if the film is portraying what it would be like if someone who isn’t a knight would depart on a journey meant to test their strength and honor. 
The film’s end departs the most from the original poem. Gawain arrives at the Green Chapel, and as the Green Knight gets ready to behead him, Gawain runs away. He returns to Camelot, where he is knighted and bears a son with the woman he loves only to leave her when he is eventually crowned king after Arthur’s death. Years later, his son dies in battle, Gawain becomes a hated king, and he dies when his castle is overrun in battle. 
Just as the film seems like it is ending, it suddenly cuts back to Gawain in the Green Chapel. It’s a truly breathtaking sequence, and it was at this moment the film clicked for me. After the vision of his future, he removes the girdle and tells the Green Knight that he’s ready to face the final blow. The film ends ambiguously, unclear whether or not Gawain died. 
While the poem showed how even virtuous and honorable individuals can crack under the fear of death, the film portrays an inverse relationship. Even the most dishonorable and weak-willed are capable of showing some virtue when faced with the consequences of their actions. It’s an excellent companion to the original poem, one that simultaneously respects and enhances the source material. Where the original poem is a playful deconstruction of the traditional themes of Arthurian legends, the film is a reaffirmation of those themes. 
Of course, one does not need to be familiar with the poem to enjoy the film, though it may be a little harder to follow if you’re unfamiliar with the original material. It’s the type of film that demands your attention yet encourages you to soak in the atmosphere and feel the weight of Gawain's journey. It helps that lush visuals and a magnificent score accompanies the film, which elevates each sequence of the film’s carefully constructed tapestry. 
This is not a film for everyone. It’s incredibly surreal, and a lot of the action that occurs will force the audience to put two and two together in order to figure out what is happening. That is what I love about this film, but not everyone will find that appealing. Regardless, this is a film I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone, even those who may not enjoy it. 
Score: 9/10

As new and returning students alike settled into campus for the 2021 fall semester, many were surprised by what they saw upon their first trip to the Cohon University Center’s Lower Level: lines stretching nearly 200 feet from the SMC package pickup window, down the hall, past every mailbox, and wrapping around the elevator corridor, with wait times reaching nearly two hours.
As the semester began, students ordered packages to their SMC mailboxes en masse. Little did they know, they would be waiting days, if not more than a week, for their delivered packages to be processed. 
Student Package Coordinator Courtney Lepsh explained that the backup was due to a lack of staff following an apparent mass layoff this summer. However, this layoff, which had been announced in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic, was anticipated since retention was promised only until June 2021. 
Lepsh described severe understaffing and overworking in Carnegie Mellon Postal Services, Facilities Management Services, campus stores, and restaurants, which was corroborated by a Carnegie Mellon University Bookstore employee who wished to remain anonymous.
Lepsh recounted, “On the first day of classes, there were well over 100,000 backed up packages, and only five of us working. Many of us were working over 10-hour workdays every day just to try and get caught up.” She continued, “FMS (Facilities Management Services) had the same issue with maintenance calls, but they were awesome: they had some of their guys come over and work from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. to try and help relieve the enormous pileup we had on our hands.”
As the first two weeks passed, many frustrated students attempted to make use of the SMC’s proxy service or find a friend who would let them ship packages to their independent or off-campus address. Lepsh stated at the time of the interview on Friday that, “Thanks to the hiring of two new full-time staff, several temp employees, and a whole lot of hard work, we can say that as of today we are fully caught up.” The wait time in line averaged five to 15 minutes on Friday, and, at times, was nonexistent.

On the first day of classes, David Rudo, a computer science first-year, had trouble connecting to CMU-SECURE WiFi, the preferred wireless network for students and faculty on campus. The network worked well during Orientation Week and when he was in his dorm, but whenever he went to large lecture halls or buildings on campus and tried to connect to the internet, the connection was either too slow or would not work at all.
“I pretty much ran off of a hotspot for a good week and a half before the WiFi started to work again,” Rudo said. Other students also raised concerns about the various issues they were having, including trouble connecting to the wireless network, slowed-down connections, and not being able to access the internet despite being connected to the WiFi.
On Sept. 8, Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer Stan Waddell sent a campus-wide email assuring that Computing Services is “aware of the recent wireless network issues” and “working closely with our network vendor” to fix the issues. Aruba Networks, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, has been Carnegie Mellon’s main campus wireless vendor for over a dozen years. The software issue Aruba found was affecting the wireless network at Carnegie Mellon and their other network customers.
In an email response to questions from The Tartan, Waddell explained that when this software issue would trigger, different small groups of devices across all of the main campus networks such as CMU-DEVICE, CMU, and CMU-GUEST, would temporarily experience anything between a successful connection with poor performance to being unable to connect to the wireless network at all. He claimed, however, the majority of devices would have noticed no impact. He explained  further that Computing Services, per their long­­standing standard operating procedures, had evaluated all open vendor software issues and available software versions prior to the beginning of the semester and chose the most recent, stable, and tested version of Aruba Networks’ software. He said it wasn’t until Sept. 1 that Aruba recognized the software issue that impacted Carnegie Mellon and their other large network customers.
Waddell shared the full vendor report with The Tartan, which revealed that “WiFi device connectivity failures are experienced only during high bursts of client roaming events” and that such events result in high CPU utilization by the Station Management (STM) process in the Mobility Controller(s). The root cause of this issue, the report states, has been traced to code changes made to resolve a bug. Aruba developed emergency patches to remove the code changes made as part of the bug fix.
In the email sent out on Sept. 8, Waddell announced that updates on the situation will be posted on a special wireless network status page until the issue is resolved. The page says that a workaround applied on Sept. 3 was unsuccessful, but another applied on Sept. 7 improved wireless network stability. According to the status page, the network has remained stable since Sept. 9.
The page also revealed multiple scheduled network maintenance works and related outages in the past couple of weeks. Waddell explained that Computing Services has a change moratorium in the week before and the first week of classes to promote technological stability. However, as they worked with Aruba to fix the software issue, they tested and implemented numerous solutions to determine which would help address the issue. The maintenance works listed on the status page were, in large part, Computing Services “removing these numerous workarounds in a controlled manner.”
The wireless network status page also allows for people to report any issues with the WiFi. Waddell said there have been no indicators of any wireless problems related to the software issue since the fix was applied. He also assured that Computing Services is continuously monitoring the health of the wireless network and reviewing all inbound issue reports.

Despite their relative longevity in pop culture, it is safe to say that the recent announcement of a new studio album by Swedish disco-pop group ABBA was unexpected. Their first new release in four decades, “Voyage,” is set to arrive on Nov. 5, 10 songs long and complete with its very own winter holiday carol. 
The group, composed of two formerly married couples, Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and Benny Andersson, famously broke into popular consciousness in 1974 when their hit song “Waterloo” won the Eurovision Song Contest. In the decade to follow, the band released nine albums and reliably topped European and U.S. charts. Their consistently emotional and upbeat disco sound, rivaled only by the earlier but equally popular Bee Gees, flooded a musically rich 70’s era. In fact, the persistence of their music in our popular culture can probably be attributed to its near-perfect representation of that specific genre and era — bell-bottoms, heady florals, go-go boots, and blown-out shag haircuts. When people want to access that era again, ABBA is the perfect vehicle.
Besides decade nostalgia, ABBA's revival in the 21st century can also be connected to an unexpected outlet: Hollywood. In 2001, when Catherine Johnson’s “Mamma Mia” hit Broadway as one of the most creative jukebox musicals of all time, ABBA’s songs reached a new audience and a new generation, generating not one but two film follow-ups. In 2008 and then a decade later in 2018, audiences everywhere immersed themselves in what seemed to be the dream: a never-ending summer in Greece, replete with crystal clear waters, gorgeous vistas, and, of course, a cast that will burst into any one of ABBA’s most celebrated singles at any given moment. 
This is not to convince you to watch “Mamma Mia” if you haven’t already (though you should), but to say that ABBA's new album release was in no way unexpected because it was unwanted by the masses. ABBA’s music and style has clearly continued on long after they left the stage. It is why they left the stage that is significant here. By the year of their last album, both couples that composed ABBA had gone through painful divorces, putting strain on their creative dynamic. It was considered unlikely that they would reunite in any way, let alone to create new music. 
The timing and the circumstances of their new release raised many questions about what the content would be like, as any band reuniting might. Any doubts about the quality of the new music were quickly vanquished by the release of two singles last week. “Don’t Shut Me Down,” eerily reminiscent of some of ABBA’s final releases, “Slipping Through My Fingers” (1981) and “Super Trooper” (1980), sounds like a reckoning, a ridiculously nostalgic and morose reminiscence on one’s life followed by a realization of remaining future potential. Though obviously referencing the reunion of people on hiatus, the song picks up where ABBA left off in 1982 with no evident shift in style. 
The second single, “I Have Faith In You,” is an absolute homage to ABBA’s core energy. Unrecognizably quiet at the beginning, it explodes into a chorus so enormous that you can imagine half the world singing along. This is what ABBA has always been about — glamorous, uplifting, unfailingly cliché, and romantic. In a way, this single feels like a reference to the ABBA revival’s “Mamma Mia” roots — from its ensemble finale nature all the way down to the pit-orchestra instrumentation.
Lyrically, the two released singles give us a taste of what we can expect from the rest of “Voyage,” even if the name has already brought on some speculation (just like their 1976 “Arrival”). This will be a revisiting, a revival, and a finale all in one, just like their popular 1977 song “Thank You For the Music.” Lines like “We still have it in us” and “The apartment hasn’t changed at all/I got to say I’m glad” give us the sense that we are receiving the purest form of these writers’ feelings regarding the past few decades. Have they missed the music? Do they intend to continue? All of this, set on a melancholic-hopeful musical background, sets the scene for what will surely be an emotional experience for many fans.
And as if we could not ask for anything more, the new album is arriving with a side of live shows, just in time for the post-pandemic tour rush. However, considering their age and possible reluctance to reunite, the members of ABBA will not be making appearances on the “Voyage” series set to take place in a custom stadium in London in the spring. Instead, concert-goers will watch avatars of the members perform with a live band. 
Most importantly, ABBA’s re-entry to the music world is both a contribution to and a statement on the state of nostalgia today — nostalgia for the old and the seemingly simple. Whether it is the popularity of the dark academia aesthetic or the mass obsession with “The Queen’s Gambit,” there seems to be an increasing number of people pining to be in another era. “Voyage” promises to take us all back, to create a new generation of people who can say that they got to listen to an ABBA album the day it was released.
