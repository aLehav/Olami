It seems the time has come for a change in the Pittsburgh Steelers. With the exception of their head coach and offensive skill players, the Steelers are some of the oldest in the league: They have grizzled veterans both on the field and in their coaching staff. After watching their franchise quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, get knocked down and beaten up nearly every play, team owner Art Rooney II made a change in the team’s offensive coordinator position without consulting head coach Mike Tomlin. 
Although it was publicly announced that former offensive coordinator Bruce Arians retired, there were rumors that Rooney forced him into retirement. This was an attempt to avoid the bad publicity of not renewing Arians’ contract.Meanwhile, Arians became the new offensive coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts, further justifying that he was forced into retirement instead of making the decision himself. 
To make matters worse, Roethlisberger was publicly upset with Arians’ supposed retirement.
Roethlisberger and Arians joined at the same time in 2004 and developed a very good rapport. When the news of Arians’ retirement reached Roethlisberger, he responded by publicly requesting a meeting with Rooney.
To fill the void, the Steelers hired Todd Haley to be the new offensive coordinator. Haley made his name as the offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals in 2008, the season they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII. He was then hired to be the head coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, but was fired with three games left in the season due to the Chiefs’ poor record and Haley’s poor relationship with the players and the front office. 
Haley’s offensive philosophy is very different in comparison to Arians’. Haley’s game plan is similar to the high-octane passing attacks used by the Green Bay Packers or New England Patriots. This is in stark contrast to the “Ground and Pound” running-based style that the Steelers have employed in the past. The players hope this move will bring their offense into the modern style and eliminate much of the predictability that has plagued them in recent seasons. 
While Haley brings a completely different offensive philosophy with him, he also brings a significantly different personality. He has an abrasive personality and has had rocky relationships with his past teams. The sight of Haley and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner yelling at each other became common. There were also rumors of Haley and Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli having strong disdain for each other and butting heads on personnel decisions.
Many believe Haley was added to Tomlin’s staff not only to revitalize the offense, but also to put a little more pressure on Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger was very comfortable with Arians and may not have been performing at his best. The Steelers believe Roethlisberger can turn into a 5,000-yard passer, like Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
But the Steelers have never been a pass-first team. Their offensive line was built with the idea of creating holes for the running back, and protecting the quarterback was an afterthought. Moreover, having Roethlisberger drop back to pass 20 more times per game will open him up to even more hits and injuries.
Another problem is the Steelers’ receivers. Wide receivers Antonio Brown and Mike Wallace thrive in the deep-passing game. The issue is that most of these deep plays are set up by the play-action, and thus need a strong running game to succeed. The Steelers don’t have the wide receivers or tight ends to run a pass-first offensive. 
While Haley’s hiring may be seen as a way of turning Roethlisberger into a better quarterback, it is important to look at the effect on the rest of the offense. Historically, new offensive coordinators and returning quarterbacks underperform. Fans should not be surprised next season if the Steelers’ high-octane offense gets stuck in neutral.

Lakers guard Kobe Bryant took another big step in NBA history last Monday with a long-distance two-point shot against the Philadelphia 76ers. That shot, his 24th point of the game, moved him past former teammate Shaquille O’Neal for fifth top scorer of all time.
O’Neal sits at 28,596 career points, but Bryant now sits at 28,662 points. 
Of all the people who have been a part of Bryant’s career, the most unlikely was the first to congratulate him.
The storied rivalry between the former teammates, Bryant and O’Neal, is well documented. But as soon as Bryant sank that long-distance two-point shot, O’Neal called up ESPN reporter Stephen A. Smith, who was covering the game, and left a message for Bryant: “Congratulations for being the greatest Laker ever.”
This is a title Bryant definitely deserves. But before we start looking ahead to where he will end up in the pantheon of NBA greatness, we need to look back at his 16-year career and appreciate his present game as he continues to make history.
Now in his 16th season, Bryant has logged more minutes than has any other active player in the NBA. If you include almost two seasons’ worth of playoff minutes, he has played 18 seasons of basketball. I won’t even bother listing the number of players whose bodies could not handle the physical strain of that much basketball, whose mentality was not strong enough to push themselves, and were then forced to hang up their sneakers. 
It is clear that Bryant’s work ethic is unparalleled. He takes better care of his body — and his game — than any other player. That is why, 16 seasons into his legendary career, he can still score better than anybody.
There have been seven 40-plus point games by players aged 33 or older: Bryant has four of them, all this season and all sequential. He is still arguably the most watchable and exciting player in the league and, in my opinion, the best.  
Basketball analysts and veterans everywhere will tell you that when “Father Time” comes knocking, he hits you like a brick wall. While Bryant’s legs continue to weaken and his athleticism dwindles, nobody can argue that Bryant has been Father Time’s most worthy adversary in the league.
This begs the question, however, of where he will end up on the ladder of career scoring. He has just four players ahead of him: Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
If basketball’s history is any indication, he will probably finish third behind Malone and Abdul-Jabbar. But keeping in mind his competitive drive and how fixated Bryant is on the game of basketball, I think that even Abdul-Jabbar’s record is in jeopardy. 
After all, Bryant is just under 10,000 points away from passing Abdul-Jabbar — roughly 25 points per game for the next five seasons. Bryant is currently averaging is 29.4 points per game in the 2011-12 season. Even if he doesn’t maintain those numbers over the next five seasons, he can easily make up the difference with more seasons. The only question that remains is if his body can last five, six, or seven more seasons. However, passing Abdul-Jabbar is not what really motivates Bryant: Winning a sixth championship does. “I just want number six. I’m not asking too much. Just get me a sixth ring, damn it,” Bryant said in the post-game interview to ESPN reporters after last Monday’s game.
A sixth championship will put him past fellow Laker player Magic Johnson and on par with Jordan and Abdul-Jabbar.
This man’s thirst for basketball greatness will not be quenched until he gets another championship. Frankly, this man’s thirst for basketball greatness will probably never be quenched.

Cze-Ja Tam is a long-tenured athlete; she has been playing tennis for 10 years, and is beginning her final season on the women’s tennis team this year.
She will graduate from Carnegie Mellon this spring with a degree in psychology. Planning to continue her education in graduate school, Tam hopes to one day fulfill her goal of becoming a pediatric nurse practitioner.
With this being Tam’s last season, she has some specific goals that she wants the team to reach while she is still here. “I hope our team will be able to win ITA indoors, UAAs, and make at least the semifinals of NCAAs,” Tam said.
During her first year at Carnegie Mellon, Tam and the women’s tennis team won the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) indoor nationals. “Winning ITA indoor nationals has been my proudest moment on the team,” Tam said.
She boasts a record of 58–18 for her career in singles matches and 41–16 in doubles matches.
“She is a consistent player who the team can always rely on to play well,” said senior teammate Laura Chen.
Her success on the court has led her to several championship competitions, where head coach Andrew Girard says she plays exceptionally.
“On the court, Cze-Ja has racked up a lot of wins for us over her three-plus years. She has had some clutch victories for us, probably most notably her three-set win to clinch the match for our team against top-seed Denison in the ITA Indoor National Championships her freshman year,” referring to her 7–5, 6–3 win in a singles match against Emory University. 
Looking back over the past three and a half years, Tam has had many memorable moments on the team. One of her funniest moments included a disaster at practice. “I had to make a trip to the emergency room after practice,” Tam said, who had accidentally hit herself on an overhead followthrough.
Moments like these remind Tam of what she enjoys most about the tennis team: “Having teammates who are always there for me.”
“She is very talented and makes everyone feel like an important part of the team. As a captain, she is really committed to team unity,” said third-year architecture major and teammate Christina Brant.
Tam loves traveling with the team and bonding with her teammates on the road. “The time to chat [with the team], and sing songs that coach really dislikes are among my favorites,” Tam said. She also enjoys eating. “[I eat] everything. I will eat anything and everything,” she said.
Tam has found being a Tartan to be rewarding, on and off the tennis court. “Being able to both receive a quality education and having a strong body of dedicated athletes is amazing,” Tam said.
Tam mentioned many things she will miss about the team after graduation. “Team events, coach’s amazing speeches, pigging out with the team will be missed,” Tam said.

The biblical story of David and Goliath best describes how the stage was set last Friday for the women’s basketball team’s game against the University of Chicago. 
Unfortunately for the Tartans, the story did not play out in their favor as Carnegie Mellon was unable to pull off an upset against the No. 2 Division III team in the country.
The Tartans had hoped to use some momentum from their win against Brandeis University last week to hold their own against a nationally ranked team. However, the odds were not in the Tartans’ favor, as the team was winless in their last 18 games with Chicago, which has been perfect in its last 23 games at home.
The Chicago Maroons kept those records alive as they defended their perfect regular season record with guns blazing. 
Starting out the game on a 13–3 run, the Maroons jumped out to an early lead and never looked back. Despite their efforts, the Tartans could never shut down Chicago’s powerful offense long enough to close the gap.   
Chicago went on to take a 45–17 lead into halftime, but the story of the second half was no different than the first. Riding on the coattails of a career-best 20-point performance from first-year forward Hannah Ballard, the Maroons buried the Tartans in the final 20 minutes of play.
Chicago’s solid defense made matters even worse for the Tartans, as they were forced to turn the ball over 30 times.
The Maroons even found a way to shut down Carnegie Mellon’s leading scorer, junior forward Emily Peel, by holding her to just 15 points in the contest. No other Tartan was able to score in the double digits. The 95–46 win moved Chicago’s record to 21–0 (10–0 UAA), and extended their NCAA Division III record for the longest regular season winning streak to 39 games. With the loss, the Tartans’ record dropped to 8–13 (2–8 UAA).
Yesterday, the Tartans traveled to Washington University in St. Louis, the No. 12 team in Division III, where they lost 86–74.
The game was fast paced, as both teams shot for a high percentage. Despite the loss, the Tartans outshot the Washington University Bears, pouring in 52 percent from the field. The Bears shot a respectable 49 percent from the field.
The Tartans’ balanced offensive attack featured five players scoring in the double figures. First-year guard Chandler Caufield and senior forward Jennifer Larsen each scored 15 points, a career high for Caufield, who also had a career-high seven rebounds. Peel added 14 points, while first-year guard Gabrielle West and sophomore guard Jacquie Shaw scored 13 and 10 points, respectively.
The Tartans hung tight with the high-ranked Bears, but a cold start to the second half buried Carnegie Mellon, the Tartans missed their first five baskets, which put them down by 14 points. The Tartans will compete at home this Friday against Emory University at 6 p.m.

In another battle that came down to the final seconds, the men’s basketball team came up short on Friday, losing to the University of Chicago Maroons 77–75.This was the second game that the Tartans lost by two points or fewer, and the third out of the last five games.
Despite missing a shot at the end of the game, sophomore guard Asad Meghani played well in crunch time, hitting two three-pointers in the last 30 seconds of overtime. Meghani finished the game with a career-high 21 points, and senior guard John Duhring poured in 24 points, tying his career high.
The Tartans’ defense held firm in this match; although they allowed the Maroons to shoot 47 percent, they were able to force two missed shots at the end of regulation time to send the game into overtime.
During the overtime, the Tartans were down by five points before Meghani’s two three-point shots brought Carnegie Mellon within one point of the Maroons. A Maroons’ free throw secured a two-point lead.
Then the Tartans’ coach Tony Wingen called upon Meghani to take the potentially game-winning shot, but his three-pointer fell short as the clock expired.
The Tartans shot over 40 percent from the field and 70 percent from the charity stripe, which is usually a recipe for success, but proved to be useless against the Maroons.
The Tartans’ game against the Washington University in St. Louis Bears yesterday was similar to their game against the University of Chicago. Carnegie Mellon shot 47 percent from the field, including 42 percent from the three-point line. However, their defense allowed the Bears to shoot 53 percent.
Duhring, who scored 23 points, was the catalyst of the Tartans’ offense. When Carnegie Mellon needed to make a run in the second half, down 60–52, Duhring led a 7–0 run by scoring five of the seven points. Additionally, his late-game layup brought the score within three points (73–70) with five minutes to go, but the Tartans could not prevent the Bears’ 10–2 run.
Junior guard Andre Moore poured in 16 points, Meghani added 15 points, and sophomore forward Christian Manoli racked up 10 points and eight assists, a career high. In the end, the Tartans fell 88–79 to the Bears.
The Tartans will return home to face Emory University at 8 p.m. in Skibo Gymnasium on Friday.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team was victorious against Slippery Rock University, a Division II school, this past Friday.
 It was the first match of the season, and the Tartans won with an overall score of 9–0. 
Starting with the No. 3 doubles, first-year pair Clare DuBrin and Bryn Raschke came out with a strong 8–0 win.
In the singles matches, sophomore Katie Cecil at the No. 3 was the first to win, with scores of 6–1, 6–1.
Senior Laura Chen won the Tartans’ third singles match at No. 1 singles with scores of 6–3, 6–4, solidifying the team’s victory over Slippery Rock. 
“It was a great way to start the season,” Chen said. “We look forward to the next couple of matches because they will prepare us for indoor Nationals in a couple of weeks.” 
Senior Courtney Chin played a long match at No. 2 singles; she was the last Tartan left on the courts after splitting sets.
Since the match had already been decided in favor of Carnegie Mellon after the 5–0 lead, Chin played a third-set tie-breaker to decide her match. Chin ended with scores of 6–7, 6–4, and 10–3.
“Everyone has been working really hard in practice so far this spring, it was great to finally get out and play some external competition,” said head coach Andrew Girard. “There are a couple kinks that we need to work out here and there, but overall a very solid performance for our first match of the spring.”
The Tartans will host Indiana University of Pennsylvania and California University of Pennsylvania next Saturday at 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., respectively.

Suite retention
Housing and Dining Services is currently reviewing the retention policy as it applies to Resnik and West Wing suites. The results of this review may affect the way suites in these locations are retained and filled for room selection 2013.
Woodlawn Apartments
Due to planned renovations, Woodlawn Apartments may be unavailable for residents during room selection, as early as room selection 2013.
Room selection process change
Housing and Dining Services will continue to develop and implement new software and technology processes associated with room selection. Changes to room selection 2013 will be announced in advance.
Anticipated change in the housing proration policy
The cancellation and refund policy is currently being reviewed by Housing and Dining Services. Some changes are being made beginning in the 2012–13 school year to the system that processes refunds when students leave during the semester. More information will be available in upcoming months as final decisions are made.
Private and semi-private bathroom cleaning
Students residing in suites or rooms that do not share a community bathroom, and instead have a private or semi-private bathroom, may become responsible for cleaning their own bathrooms during the 2012–13 school year. If this change is finalized, residents assigned to these locations will be notified. Bathrooms will still be cleaned by Housing and Dining staff during winter break.
Individual Phone Lines
Housing and Dining will continue to remove individual phone lines from student rooms in response to feedback that the majority of students do not see a need for the land lines. Instead, common phone lines in each building, to be used for emergency purposes, will be available. Buildings that have been (or soon will be) affected by these changes include Boss House, Doherty Apartments, Donner House, Hamerschlag House, Morewood Gardens, Morewood E-Tower, Mudge House (except for B and C tower basement rooms), Scobell House, Shirley Apartments, Stever House, Resnik House, West Wing, and the Residence on Fifth.

Room selection has several possible options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as “pull-in”), general room selection, RA/CA housing, special-interest housing, block housing, gender neutral housing, and open assignments.
The majority of students will participate in one of the three most common room selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, and general room selection. However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room selection occurs during the next five weeks of classes, so all students returning next year should begin thinking about their housing plans for the 2012–13 school year.
Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for the next school year. The room retention phase begins today, Feb. 13, and ends March 9 at 5 p.m. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to most upper-class students not in special-interest housing, a first-year dormitory, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember that once they retain, they cannot change their housing assignment or cancel until the open cancellation period begins on April 6.
Room with a retainer
Any student retaining his or her room during the first phase is required to fill any remaining vacancies in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” A student eligible to be “pulled in” to a room already designated to a retainer must be eligible to participate in room selection, and must not have already selected an assignment for the 2012–13 school year.
General room selection
General room selection is the final phase of room selection, during which eligible residents who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose a room from the spaces remaining. Students planning to participate in general room selection must “elect to participate” in the general room selection before March 29 at 5 p.m. by signing a housing license agreement. They are then eligible to receive a random room selection number.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during the 2012–13 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in room selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection process carried out by the Office of Student Development.
Special-interest housing
Special-interest housing allows groups of students to apply for group housing centered around a certain interest or theme. Special-interest housing groups should consider the ways in which they plan to positively impact the larger residential community, then complete the special-interest housing application process. Housing locations with special-interest housing options available for the 2012–13 academic year are Margaret Morrison Apartments, Resnik House (480 and 580 suites), Morewood Gardens (two spaces available), and Mudge House (A-100).
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a “block” of apartments near each other in one of the apartment-style dormitories (Fairfax, Webster, Shady Oak, or Shirley Apartments). Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who will be responsible attending the block housing selection, scheduled for Thursday, March 22, and Friday, March 23.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing is a program in the Oakland Community Apartments that permits upper class male and female residents to reside in the same room. Housing locations with gender-neutral housing available to students during the 2012–13 academic year include Fairfax, Webster, Shady Oak, Shirley, and Neville Apartments.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2012–13 academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students wait until they receive an offer of a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within a three-day window without any penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.

Make some room, Hamerschlag Hall and Wean Hall. A new state-of-the-art building to house the department of biomedical engineering and the Energy Futures Institute is in the works.
The university has recently committed to building a 100,000-square-foot biomedical engineering, nanotechnology, and energy facility that will sit among Hamerschlag, Wean, and Roberts Engineering halls. Pradeep Khosla, dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT), said that he has been pushing for the approval and construction of this building for the last five or six years. 
“We are going to do this building because, for the college to be competitive, we need to have state-of-the-art infrastructure that allows us to recruit the best and the brightest faculty, which in turn allows us to recruit the best and brightest students,” Khosla said. “I think this building is going to be critical in maintaining our competitive edge.”
Khosla said that the building will be built predominantly for research use. In addition to housing the biomedical engineering department, there will be a 10,000-square-foot nanofabrication facility, over twice as large as the current 4,000-square-foot facility in Hamerschlag Hall. Lastly, it will house Carnegie Mellon’s Energy Futures Institute, which focuses research on solving energy problems, such as the transition from fossil fuels to new energy sources and developing a smart electricity grid, according to the department’s website.
Hoping to follow in the footsteps of the Gates Hillman Complex, which won LEED Gold certification last November, the new building will employ sustainable “green” technologies. Khosla said that the university is still working with the building’s architect, OFFICE 52, to finalize those plans. “We know it will be at least LEED Silver, probably more,” he said.
The new building will connect two floors to Hamerschlag, Wean, and Roberts Engineering halls, and an additional connection will be made to Porter Hall. “There is no such connection right now, and I wanted to integrate this side of campus, which is mainly engineering, into one cohesive hall,” Khosla explained. He hopes that this integration between buildings will encourage collaboration between students and researchers across departments.
The area around the new building will be slightly altered, as well. The patio that connects Wean, Hamerschlag, and Porter halls will be filled in with more green area so the Mall will extend from the College of Fine Arts all the way to Hamerschlag Hall. This, Khosla explained, is the way that the new building’s architect thinks that Henry Hornbostel, the campus’ original architect, intended it to be.
“It’s going to be a building that satisfies the contemporary needs, but respects the Hornbostel vision and puts it in perspective,” Khosla said.
Bryan Good, a senior biomedical engineering student, is excited for the plan. “Currently, most of the research labs are located at the Pittsburgh Technology Center, which is very inconvenient for students and faculty,” Good said. “Having more research facilities on campus will help get more undergrads involved in research and also help entice the best faculty to join the department.”
The new building is included in the Institutional Master Plan, a 10-year plan that includes projects like relocating the Tepper School of Business and expanding the Heinz College. Plans for the new building are currently in the process of gaining approval from the university’s board of trustees. Khosla has already begun fundraising for the event. 
“There’s a lot of excitement amongst our alumni to help support what they think of as a worthwhile and visionary project,” Khosla said.
Khosla is confident the project will be well received by the board. “I’m hoping about 30 months from now, the building will be finished,” he said.

A 2011 CNN report indicated that there were over 300 million Twitter users. Despite these large numbers, users may not know how their followers react to their posts. There might be the occasional “unfollowing” or “retweeting,” but no additional feedback is typically given.
Presented with this problem, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Georgia Institute of Technology recently published a study designed to understand the different reactions spurred by Twitter updates.
The study was led by Paul André, a postdoctoral fellow in the Human Computer Interaction Institute, and accompanied by MIT Ph.D. student Michael Bernstein and Georgia Tech Ph.D. student Kurt Luther. They will present their findings on Monday at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Seattle, Washington.
André said that the question that ignited this research was the following: There are many mechanisms of positive reinforcement, such as favoring tweets, “like” buttons on Facebook, or “+1” on Google, but what would a “dislike” button tell us? There is an accepted practice of online social interaction, as Carnegie Mellon computer science Ph.D. student Rob Simmons confirmed, but the norms are not clear to everyone. 
“If everyone understood the best way to phrase something ... people could improve the way they write content,” André said.
The research aimed to raise awareness among Twitter users of what makes their tweets more likeable. The design implications are also valuable: A reader might be able to filter the Twitter feed content according to their preferences.
The researchers designed a website called “Who Gives a Tweet?” (WGAT), where followers could rate the tweets of other users. Users could provide feedback for a feed by clicking one of several options: “Worth Reading” (WR), “OK,” and “Not Worth Reading” (NotWR).
Users could also explain why they chose a particular rating by selecting one of the following: “funny,” “exciting,” “useful,” “informative,” or “arrogant,” “boring,” “depressing,” and “mean.” After WGAT launched, it was featured on news sites like CNN, Mashable, TechCrunch, and OneForty. The press allowed the site to go viral. This popularity resulted in the collection of 43,738 tweet ratings from 1,443 users in late December 2010 and January 2011.
Two kinds of findings were revealed by the study: the types of tweet categories that were liked or disliked, and the reasons why. André mentioned that the skewed sample population of the study — information-centric people or CNN readers — might influence the division of tweets into categories. Future research might try to generalize to other populations and Twitter as a whole.
The categories of tweets that were deemed worth reading were self-promotion (linking to something that the tweeter created), information sharing, and questions for followers. Presence maintenance (saying “Hello people!”), conversational, and “me now” (the tweeter’s current status) were the most strongly disliked.
Foursquare location check-ins were especially hated by users because of their irrelevancy. Every so often, someone “checked in” to a different city or even country, and users were typically annoyed by this. On the whole, the sample of Twitter users liked 36 percent of tweets, disliked 25 percent, and were neutral to 39 percent.
A tweet “being boring” was the most common reason to dislike it, accounting for 82 percent of why a tweet was rated NotWR. Other reasons included repeating old news (something as old as four hours was considered old news on Twitter), being cryptic (posting a link without a contextual explanation), or using an excessive number of # and @ signs.
When following celebrities or organizations, people looked for professional insights and were disappointed when receiving personal ones. News organizations were expected to only give a taste of the story in the tweet and not reveal all the information. Three components that increased the likelihood of a post’s popularity were information, humor, and conciseness.
Happy feelings were valued, as opposed to “whining,” which was disliked. The researchers advise tweeters to use a unique hashtag in questions so followers can keep track of the conversation.
The online persona that a person creates using social media may become more and more important for potential employers and personal connections. Last month, for example, a Twitter joke about “destroying America” (meaning having a good time) resulted in two British citizens being deported from the U.S., according to the Washington Post.

Taste is an integral part of people’s daily lives. With so many different reasons to eat or not to eat a certain food, taste vastly simplifies the decision of what to eat, and whether to keep eating. Yet scientists know less about taste than they do about hearing and sight. What makes it so complicated? How exactly does taste work?
The sensation one interprets as taste is not the product of the tongue alone — a person’s tongue, nose, ears, and eyes are all part of the sensory overload that people experience when they bite into a piece of food. According to WiseGeek.com, “What we perceive as taste is a complex interplay of smelling and tongue-tasting. The nose, tongue, eyes, and brain all evolved together to ensure that we consume the good stuff and keep out the bad stuff: rotten foods, poison foods, and other indigestibles.”
The tongue is the main organ of the somatosensory system — the system that controls the actual taste of food. In the tongue, there are specialized groups of cells known as taste buds. Almost 100,000 taste buds are located in the back and front of the tongue, while others are located in the sides and roof of the mouth. The tongue is special in that it can only perceive five tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami (meaty).
Evolutionarily, there is a reason people experience these particular tastes. Generally, basic tastes can be classified into two categories: good (appetizing) and bad (unappetizing). Donuts and chocolate, for example, taste good because they are sugar-rich and therefore sweet. Sweet foods, in terms of evolution, were seen as good items for humans to eat, especially in the hunter-gatherer days when fruits were a major part of human consumption. At the same time, bitter things were generally predictors for certain poisons, and the bitter taste served as a warning to not consume the food.
But the senses are obviously not limited to sweet, sour, salty, bitter, or umami. In fact, the most savory taste that people associate with food is directly related to its smell. For example, popcorn has a very distinct taste. When asked to describe it, an average person might say buttery or salty. Some might even describe it as crunchy, referring to the crunchiness of popped kernels. However, the only real taste that people pick up is saltiness. The buttery odor is associated with taste even though it is actually how the popcorn smells. Similarly, the associated texture — crunchiness  — is based on mechanics and muscle nerves within our tongues.
According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology website, “Our body’s ability to sense chemicals is another chemosensory mechanism that contributes to our senses of smell and taste.” An example is the feeling of hotness or coolness that is associated with certain foods. People might say that a food is spicy, but in reality, it just generates a lot of heat within their mouth.
These hot and cold sensations people perceive are not tastes, but are detected by thermoreceptors within their mouths through chemesthesis. Chemesthesis is the ability of special receptors in people’s mouths to detect certain chemicals. If one were to place a chili pepper or a menthol strip in his or her mouth, heat would be generated or absorbed, and would activate the thermoreceptors. The brain then perceives the hot or cold sensation as a taste.
Moreover, eyes play a major role in deciding the taste humans perceive when eating a certain food. A 2008 article in the Chemosensory Perception journal suggested that food color may play a role in determining the taste humans associate with it. For example, if a person is given a flavored yet gray-colored popsicle, that person may claim that the popsicle tastes particularly bland.
Taste is not merely a way to see if one enjoys a certain food or not; it has an evolutionary reason behind its existence. Combined with information from other senses and other receptors, the sensations people attribute to taste provide a rich, delightful way to continue eating delicious food.

Skin cancer drug reverses Alzheimer’s
Researchers at Case Reserve University’s School of Medicine recently gave large doses of Bexarotene, a drug that treats skin cancer, to mice that showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Within 72 hours, the mice showed improvements in memory and an over 50 percent  decrease of amyloid beta, a protein associated with Alzheimer’s in the brain.
Before giving the mice Bexarotene, the researchers allowed the mice to walk into a cage where they were given an electrical shock. After receiving a dose of Bexarotene, the mice showed improvements in memory by remembering the previous shock and not entering the cage. The researchers are hopeful that these results could be the origins to a complete cure for Alzheimer’s.

Kodak stops digital camera production
Kodak has announced that it will no longer produce digital cameras, as the company tries to monetize after its recent bankruptcy. However, Kodak isn’t completely exiting the digital camera field, as the company may instead license its brand name to other camera makers. 
In addition, the company has decided to cease production of pocket video cameras and digital frames. With Kodak cameras receiving less demand than Fuji and other brands of cameras, it is seeing a higher need to diversify. This phasing out of Kodak’s dedicated capture devices business will occur during the first half of 2012. Despite these cuts, the company will continue to honor product warranties and continue to offer product service and help.

Is Venus’ rotation slowing down?
Venus’ rotation on its axis seems to be slowing down, according to recent measurements. In the 1990s, NASA’s Magellan probe measured the Venusian day to be 243 Earth days, but the European Space Agency’s Venus Express orbiter recently found the planet’s rotational period to be 6.5 minutes slower. This difference may prevent scientists looking to send rovers over to the planet from accurately predicting the location of features on the Venusian surface.
Scientists speculate that the cause may be friction from weather systems, or that gravitational interactions between the Earth and Venus might be manipulating the planet’s angular momentum. Another possibility is that the Magellan probe might have recorded the Venusian rate of rotation when the planet was rotating faster than normal.

Google announces new music device
Google representatives recently announced a prototype “entertainment device” that will make the company more involved in consumer electronics. In May 2011 the device was merely announced as possible project, but last week the company filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to test the device.
The device is said to be a music hub of sorts that can be hooked up to speakers or to a stereo and stream digital files stored in Google Music or on other devices. The device can also be connected to smartphones or tablets, allowing multiple linked devices to play music at the same time in multiple locations. The device would run on the Android platform.

Hackers attack CIA, other sites
The CIA’s website was hacked in a distributed denial of service attack by the group Anonymous last Friday afternoon. Hacker groups such as this have been attacking a series of law enforcement agencies and government websites. As soon as the website was rendered inaccessible, one of the Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous read, “cia.gov DOWN. #UMAD?#Anonymous.” 
It took several hours to bring the CIA website back up, but it only took minutes for other government sites that had been attacked in the past, like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to reboot. Anonymous has been attacking sites like the U.S. Department of Justice, Universal Music Group, and the U.S. Copyright Office in response to the recent FBI raid on the filesharing site MegaUpload.

Lethal form of protein identified
Scientists from the Florida campus of the Scripps Research Institute have identified a highly toxic protein that causes severe neuron degradation and eventually results in death. The protein acts similarly to the prions that cause mad cow disease, but it is more than 10 times more deadly than currently identified toxic proteins. 
The scientists learned that the protein’s high toxicity arises largely from its unique structure, alluding that similar proteins may play a key role in other disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson diseases.

Electrically engineered clothing, politically charged fashion, and biologically inspired design: These seem unlikely enough on their own, let alone incorporated into the same student-run fashion show. But all of these elements came together on Saturday night for Lunar Gala 2012: Blur, as student designers showcased a diverse array of talent and inspiration. The culmination of a full year of organizing and designing, Lunar Gala was a dazzling display of what a group of dedicated students is capable of putting together with a great deal of focus, innovation, and artistic savvy.
Behind the Scenes
A significant amount of work goes into preparing for Lunar Gala each year. An intensive, year-long process of recruitment and advertising makes the event possible, said Alexander de Ronde, the gala’s director of public relations and a junior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in communication design and decision science.
There is “really not any down moment” for the Lunar Gala, de Ronde said. As second-time director of public relations for the gala, de Ronde oversees a significant amount of work going into the show: designing posters, organizing the program, recruiting designers, and advertising for the event, particularly through Facebook and other social media. By the time this year’s Lunar Gala was over, the board and theme for next year’s show was already decided. Lunar Gala is, in many ways, a “continuous thing,” de Ronde said.
Designers also have a daunting workload in preparing for the show. “Blood, sweat, and tears” is how designer Rain Chan-Kalin, a fourth-year design and linguistics double major, described it. According to Chan-Kalin, designers’ work started in September, when they submitted their portfolios, and continued with sewing, fitting, and choosing models for each outfit. “Somehow it all comes together — usually in the last week,” she joked.
“It was a lot,” said designer Ibrahim Garcia-Bengochea, a fourth-year architecture student, commenting on the workload for the gala. Over winter break, Garcia-Bengochea redesigned his entire line. On top of the stress from the past few months, nerves were also running high right before the gala. “Something always goes wrong,” Garcia-Bengochea said, remembering a fiasco from last year when he lost a pair of pants. Despite the strain, however, Garcia-Bengochea was “really pumped” for the gala and its exciting air of “non-stop heart-beating.”
Optimism was a common sentiment between designers  and organizers on the eve of the gala. Despite some concerns about this year’s more complicated stage setup, co-producer Ian Anthony Coleman, a senior international relations and politics major with a minor in French, was confident in his models’ abilities. “People know how to just keep going,” he said.
As co-producer, Coleman also had a heap of tasks leading up to the event, from working with Student Activities, AB Tech, and cmuTV to looking over designer applications to organizing and running rehearsals. Despite being “kind of tired,” Coleman looked forward to the event with enthusiasm. In particular, he was excited to see the audience’s reactions to the new elements in this year’s show. “The moment I know I succeeded is when the line starts forming,” he said. “The energy in the room is just unparalleled.”
Lunar Gala 2012: Blur
The energy was indeed high before the show began on Saturday night, as viewers waited in a line that wound all around the first floor of the University Center. The night got off to somewhat of a hectic start, with organizers trying to clear space for people to walk through the University Center and viewers still eagerly standing in line well after the doors opened at 7:30 p.m.
Once the audience was seated and the program began, however, the months of preparation became apparent. With its impressive runway and sophisticated lighting, the show gave off an air of professionalism. Considering the sheer volume of elements that had to come together, the show ran with very few hitches.
Student designers showcased their talents in diverse collections inspired by everything from photography to biology to Lady Gaga. Several of the clothing lines featured organic looks and muted color palettes. “Verdure,” a collection by Andreea and Silvia Manolache, a senior Bachelor of Science and Arts student and a senior business administration and math double major, respectively, started the program. The collection offered a series of graceful, soft, and effortless looks that sought to “symbolize the grandeur of nature,” according to its description on the program.
Similarly, junior communication design major Sarah Gorman’s “Aviary” incorporated natural elements in her first few looks with a more subdued palette and looser silhouettes, though moving toward more modern, fitted, colorful pieces as the collection progressed. And though not explicitly inspired by nature, Chan-Kalin’s “Oblique” had similarly organic elements, with simple shapes and a somewhat earthy color palette of reds, yellows, browns, and whites.
Beyond the mere inspiration for clothing, other collections pondered the nature of clothing itself. In her line “Transparent,” Alina Narvaez, a sophomore in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, explored the restrictions of women’s clothing and the changing forms these restrictions have taken throughout history. Moving from vintage to modern styles, Narvaez asked the audience in the written program, “Is the modern woman liberated? Or is she objectified?” 
Likewise, Colleen Clifford, a first-year architecture student, examined different kinds of curvature in her collection “Raw Curves,” while Anya Weitzman, a senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student, showcased female-empowering pieces in “PRO.”
Senior Bachelor of Computer Science and Art student Alex Wolfe’s collection “Kitsune” directly challenged the way we wear clothes by presenting a whole new dimension to clothing: Sculptural extensions grew out of the pieces or served as eccentric headpieces. In essence, Wolfe sent wearable art down the runway. Fashion is considered in many ways a form of art, and Wolfe took this definition to a more literal interpretation of what people wear and how they wear it.
Two particularly interesting collections drew inspiration from science and engineering, in true Carnegie Mellon fashion. In “Lux” by Alanna Fusaro, a sophomore industrial design major, and John Brieger, a sophomore computer science major, the clothing was adorned with LEDs that set off blinking patterns. Junior design major Chris Ioffreda’s “Bioflux,” on the other hand, took inspiration from and incorporated visual elements from biology — such as webs and scales — into the clothing.
Scattered throughout the program were performances by several student dance groups. Between collections, Dancers’ Symposium, Soulstylz, and Jungle Royalty took the stage with fierce choreography, earning loud cheers from the audience. In this way, the organizers of the event tipped their hats to other art forms being explored on campus and added some variety to the program.
This year, many commercial boutiques also showcased their work, adding a new element to the show. Designer Days Boutique, H&M, Victoria’s Secret Pink and Calvin Klein, Urban Outfitters, Jupe and Panello, and American Apparel, among others, all presented large collections. Many of these boutiques offered discounts to students with Lunar Gala tickets to further promote their lines.
As the program closed with a series of thank-yous from the organizers and wild cheers from the audience, student reactions were very positive. “It was really good,” said senior biology major Sherry He. Senior biology and viola performance double major Megan Peaco agreed. Both were there to support their friends who had designed collections, and each began excitedly listing their favorites, generally very impressed with the show and only stipulating that they wished there had been more lighting in the aisles.
But, according to de Ronde, this enthusiastic reception should come as no surprise. After all, as de Ronde said, “People keep coming back.”

As many “tropers” will tell you, the best way to make a story compelling is not by telling, but by showing. In 2011, Fast Eddie, the mysterious administrator of tvtropes.org, sent out a call to find someone to demonstrate, categorize, and explain the tropes — or literary and rhetorical conventions — that are seen in television shows, movies, literature, and comics. With tropers auditioning from around the world, Carnegie Mellon creative writing alumnus Tom Pike came up with a unique direction and won the trope-of-the-week contest.
“I imagined what [Fast Eddie] originally had in mind was a vlog,” Pike said. “You know, something more like a critic making funny points about a trope every week and being entertaining by just talking to the camera.”
Instead, Pike decided to make the vlogs into episodes, in which he would demonstrate a trope through a story of someone trying to demonstrate a trope. “It was an idea I’d had floating around in my head,” Pike said. “I can make it a story about someone who is trying to do that and failing miserably.”
Pike named his show Echo Chamber, which plays on the idea of repeated thoughts and actions. Pike and senior dramaturgy major Dana Shaw play the lead characters. Zachary Wallnau, another Carnegie Mellon alumnus, plays the laughable and not-all-there cameraman.
Explaining Echo Chamber can be a bit confusing, but here’s a quick rundown: Pike created Echo Chamber, and his character within the video also created Echo Chamber in the fictional world where the character now makes videos about trying to make videos.
Like many recent television shows — think Community — it self-references things that happen inside the show and also in the personal lives of the actors. In the episode titled, “Unresolved Sexual Tension,” Pike warns Shaw that “the moment we start blurring the line between fiction and reality, all of a sudden there’s a whole bunch of tropes we can’t do ’cause there’s unintended implications. We’re trying to make a web show about the tropes, not live them.”
For the cast, this is a very true reality. “On another level, we are having these meta-characters doing meta-things that reflect our lives,” Shaw said. “There are things where we can’t remember what happened first in the show and first in real life.”
“One example is ‘The Terrible Interview’ montage,” Pike said. “It merges reality and fiction. The plot of the second season involves an introduction of a rival show that attempts to steal one of the crew members away from Echo Chamber. It actually wound up happening a couple of times.”
The show, which is filmed on the Carnegie Mellon campus, has received positive reviews from other tropers and has gained a significant following. “I believe that this [show] has allowed us to demonstrate that we know how to deliver what a client wants,” Shaw said. “It’s gotten us the chance to be seen by people in the business.”
In an interview with io9.com, Fast Eddie commented on the role tropes play in storytelling: “To capture people’s attention, you want to bring them in using a familiar platform like these tropes. Once you get them there, that’s where you have the opportunity to extend your viewpoint and offer up what you’re trying to say. But first you need to get their attention with something familiar, so they’re not struggling to figure out what’s going on.”
That is exactly what Echo Chamber is trying to do: explain the intricacies behind stories. You can watch the first season on YouTube under the name “tvtropesorg.” A second season of Echo Chamber is scheduled to premiere this April.

We’ve all seen movies like The Wedding Planner, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall — stereotypical romantic comedies at their best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint). But this Valentine’s Day, if you’re staying in with your loved one (or by yourself), consider watching one of these romantic films.
An Affair to Remember
This 1957 classic is one of the greatest love tales of all time. Directed by Leo McCarey and starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, An Affair to Remember currently holds the No. 5 spot on the American Film Institute’s list of the top 100 greatest love stories in American cinema.
In this film, playboy Nicky Ferrante (Grant) and night club singer Terry McKay (Kerr) have an affair while on a cruise from Europe to New York. They agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months, even though they’re both engaged to other people. After an unfortunate accident, Terry is unable to make the date, and the rest of the film traces their unfolding future. Even if the story sounds uninteresting to you, you should consider watching it just to see Grant in his prime.
The Road
Directed by John Hillcoat and based on the 2006 novel by Cormac McCarthy, The Road follows the story of a man and his son trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. This isn’t your typical Valentine’s Day film, but it’s a heart-warming tale of a father’s love for his son in the face of cannibalism and the breakdown of human society. It’s a depressing movie, but in the best way possible.
WALL-E
If you’re looking for a lighter movie, WALL-E is the ultimate animated love story. Produced by Pixar, WALL-E is filled with allusions to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, but still captivates audiences of all ages. The film focuses on the love between WALL-E, a trash-scavenging robot, and EVE, a high-tech superbot. The characters communicate primarily through body language and robotic sounds, and there is very little dialogue in the film. 
Secretary
Starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader, Secretary follows the story of a young girl, Lee Holloway (Gyllenhaal) who has taken a job as a secretary after being released from a mental hospital. Holloway’s relationship with her boss, Mr. Grey (Spader), quickly turns into a sadomasochistic one, and the two fall in love. Things get complicated when Holloway gets engaged to a nerdy friend from high school, and the rest of the movie traces the ensuing drama.
So if you’re looking for something more interesting than your average romantic comedy, try one of these classic or unconventional love stories. Whether you’re looking for something classically romantic, heart-warming, or sexually intriguing, one of these movies is sure to pair nicely with your significant other (or a pint of ice cream).

Security guards, miscellaneous trinkets, and long lines were all a part of sophomore art majors Claire Gustavson and Keith Lafuente’s opening night at The Frame gallery last Friday.
The show was titled I am better than you, and visitors could feel that spirit from the moment they entered the venue on Forbes Avenue. The press release at the front door raved about the two artists, and reminded those attending to bring gifts and offerings.
Gustavson and Lafuente transformed The Frame into a fully immersive exhibit. The show was broken into four different sections — Gustavson’s altar, Lafuente’s altar, a gift shop, and a special room that patrons could only enter one at a time. Fake security guards stood at the entrance to each section, dressed in suits, glasses, and serious attitudes. Certain people were denied access to the mysterious performance section for no apparent reason.
The two altars were separated and were very different from each other, including different music, lighting, and general vibes. Gustavson’s altar was covered in candles and letters, and the room — which was sectioned off by dark curtains — was full of rugs, prayer cards, and shoes.
Patrons entering the room that held Lafuente’s altar were warned by a security guard to keep their distance from the altar, but the room was open so patrons could walk through freely. The altar was adorned with trophies, photos of Lafuente, pins, and a large chain. In the middle of the room were a small rug and piece of wood.
After viewing the altars, patrons waited in line to gain access to the mysterious performance section of the exhibit. Entering one at a time, patrons walked to the back room and found the two artists engaged in a dialogue about colors, gifts, and offerings while a projector shot images onto them in the dark.
At times it was hard to tell whether the artists were in character or not, and it was difficult to gain meaning from the dialogue. The first line I heard upon entering the small room was, “Once you go black, you never go back, right?” The dialogue between the two was meant to get laughs and be a unique memory for those who were lucky enough to get past security and make it inside.
The line to enter this part of the exhibit was long, and as the night progressed, rumblings were heard from the crowd about whether the wait would be worth it. A similar frustration for those in attendance was how hard it was to hear what Lafuente and Gustavson were saying in the small room over all the people talking just outside.
The gift shop included plenty of trinkets related to the exhibition. A personal favorite was a framed essay of Gustavson’s from her first-year Globalization Through History class. There were also American flags with Lafuente’s face glued to them, temporary tattoo hearts with Gustavson’s face attached, and other random objects to remind patrons that the artists are “better than you.”
Those who attended the exhibit had mixed reactions. While the exhibit was an interesting experience, junior industrial design major Maureen Griswold said, “I think if you didn’t know [the artists] and you went to it, it would be a little confusing. But once you met them, you’d be like, ‘Oh okay, it’s a parody.’ ”
Despite the wait and the uneasy feel the security guards gave patrons, the show was well executed and generally enjoyable for those who came out. Lafuente and Gustavson successfully converted The Frame into a more experience-based exhibition space, and while some frustration about being turned away after waiting in line to enter the back room was obvious, it was all in an effort to maintain the theme of the show that the two wanted to present.

Despite the fact that Blind Pilot has played in Pittsburgh multiple times in the past, last Friday marked the band’s first time playing at Mr. Small’s Theater in Millvale. An old church converted into a concert venue, it was the perfect space for the almost religious experience of a Blind Pilot concert.
The night’s musical experience began with The Barr Brothers, an indie folk band from Montreal. While serenading the audience with a folksy repertoire featuring instruments not usually found in contemporary pop music — a harp, a pump organ, and a strand of polyester thread tied to a guitar string — they were very insular performers.
While it was clear that the band played passionately, they interacted little with the audience. The Barr Brothers’ style meshed well with the folk-inspired guitar pop that has gained Blind Pilot a fervent following and critical acclaim from NPR, but the audience did not seem that interested. Throughout the entire set people were chatting and drinking, eagerly awaiting Blind Pilot to take the stage.
There is only one term that could be used to accurately describe the group of people that had congregated in Mr. Small’s on Friday: sincere. This was clear from the moment Blind Pilot began playing the first song of their set. While the audience did not suddenly go quiet, the conversations took a dramatic turn from idle talk to veneration of the band. Throughout the show, people were voicing their amazement at the band’s musical talent and how much they were enjoying the emotionally charged set.
Like the openers, Blind Pilot did not interact much with the audience. After every couple of songs, lead singer and guitarist Israel Nebecker would talk to the audience, but it felt unnatural at times, as if he’d much rather share his music than his words. It was clear that this performance was not meant for fair-weather fans or for people who had never listened to the band before. For the band and the devoted fans in attendance, however, it was a magical experience.
The band closed their set with a heartfelt performance of “We Are the Tide.” As the group left the stage, the lights went out and the audience began the ritual of demanding an encore. Within minutes, the band returned to the stage to perform a three-song encore that was arguably the highlight of the show.
The first song, “Bitter End,” began as a solo performance by Nebecker. Midway through the song, the rest of the band came on stage and joined in the performance. This was followed up by a joint effort with The Barr Brothers to cover American folk singer-songwriter John Prine’s “Clay Pigeons.” The performance was quiet, subtly powerful, and emphasized the folk roots that Blind Pilot had begun their career playing.
To end the night, Blind Pilot went completely unplugged except for a microphone. It took several minutes to quiet down the audience; however, the effort was rewarded with a beautiful rendition of “Three Rounds and a Sound.” While the effort could have been written off as cheesy, the sheer sincerity of the band’s performance and the audience’s enraptured silence was moving in a way that is not often seen in contemporary concerts.
Being in the audience and listening to that raw and completely honest performance was a moment of spiritual awakening. Even for those who weren’t fans of Blind Pilot’s music, it was difficult to walk away from Mr. Small’s and not feel satisfied with at least that final performance.

In a time where the Top 40 is overflowing with AutoTune and songs made for clubs, The Fray reminds us that success can come in the form of a less electronic instrument. The piano-driven rock band from Denver gained worldwide fame thanks to its emotional single “How to Save a Life,” and has remained relatively popular since. This past week, The Fray released its third album, Scars & Stories, which doesn’t stray far from its two previous studio albums.
The starting track, “Heartbeat,” is also the band’s first single from the new album. Starting as a fast-paced drum beat topped with narrative lyrics, the song continues into a slower chorus where the band’s lead singer-songwriter Isaac Slade hits some higher notes and gives some heartfelt advice, singing, “If you can love somebody, love them all the same.”
“The Fighter” is probably the most commercial of the songs, and is the closest The Fray comes to a mainstream hit on this album. Documenting a fighter and his internal struggles about his lover and violence in the world, this track wraps an unfortunate story into a heartfelt, feel-good song.
“The Wind” is a soft song, but the ethereal background music that plays throughout takes the song to a different level. And then there’s “Munich,” which was inspired not by the German city, but instead by a particle collider in Switzerland.
In an interview with The Huffington Post, Slade explained his fascination with the Swiss experiment: “They’re looking for the God Particle — basically, the particle that holds it all together. That song is really just about the mystery of why we’re all here and what’s holding it all together, you know?” It’s not unlike The Fray to talk about metaphysics and other things besides sex and alcohol, so this broad scope feels natural coming from Slade.
The other tracks don’t seem to stand out as anything exciting. They’re good, but they aren’t memorable. The lyrics, as per usual, are insightful and well-crafted, but the music is lacking compared to the group’s previous hits like “How to Save a Life” and “You Found Me.”
The closing tracks on the band’s albums seem to go one of two ways: They either end with an energetic, music-heavy anthem that summates all the intensity of the preceding songs, or they let you down gently and bring the sound session to a finite close. The closing track on Scars & Stories, “Be Still,” falls in the latter category. With only Slade’s vocals partnering with a ghostly piano, he repeats the lyrics with a heartfelt honesty.
As a whole, this is not the album that you put in your car when you’re going 70 miles per hour with the windows down. Instead, it’s more appropriate as background music if you’re doing some work or sitting at a Starbucks. It has its moments of radio-friendliness, but it never fully commits to that identity. Stand-out tracks include “The Fighter,” “The Wind,” and “Be Still.”

Dear Patrick,
I’m getting tired of all these dumb pictures and memes people keep posting on Facebook. They’re not funny, and they just clog up my news feed so I can’t see things I do care about, like... I’ll think of something later. But still! How can I get rid of them?
Thanks,
Memes Indubitably Suck, Are Not Too Hilarious, Rather Ordinarily Provoke Exasperation
Dear MISANTHROPE,
Congratulations! You’ve just realized that most people are dumb. Enjoy the false sense of superiority that comes with that realization. Go check your Facebook right now. I bet you’ve shared a few photos too. Of course, yours are funny, unlike all those other people’s, right? Oh, wait — no, they’re not. Your memes aren’t creative and no one is going to donate 15 cents to fight breast cancer because you shared that. You are part of the problem.
Of course, I might be wrong. You simply want Facebook to go back to its roots: A place for you to easily stalk members of the opposite sex. The easiest thing to do is to unsubscribe from their updates. Or just unfriend everyone who shares stuff. But you’ll probably be alone at that point.
It’ll be just like Google+,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My BFF is studying abroad this semester! OMG, like I’m sooo depressed. I mean, now all we can do is Skype, IM, talk on Facebook, share stuff on Pinterest, and email each other. :( What can I do to get through this semester?
<3,
Feeling Really Isolated, Especially Needy During Lonely Evenings, Soulmate Scrammed
Dear FRIENDLESS,
The key here is to let as many people as possible know that you’re sad and miss your friend. What is Facebook for if not saying how much you miss her and posting on her wall every five minutes? 
Okay, now that she and everyone else knows you miss her, get on with your life. Skype every once in a while if you need to, but let her enjoy her time abroad. You can take this time to make more than one friend. The hard part is when your friend comes back. She may return much more pretentious than when she left, saying things like, “Well, when I was in London/Prague/who cares....” At that point, just maintain the urge not to strangle her.
But no one will blame you if you do,
Patrick Hoskins

In 1988, pop culture’s unkempt poster child of doom and gloom and lead singer of British supergroup The Cure, Robert Smith, married his childhood sweetheart — Mary Poole. To honor the occasion, Smith wrote “Lovesong,” perhaps one of the world’s most covered songs.
Despite the fact that musicians such as Adele, 311, Jack Off Jill, Tori Amos, and Death Cab for a Cutie have covered this song, it is perhaps one of The Cure’s weakest. When compared to every other song on 1989’s Disintegration, something isn’t quite right.
It could be Smith’s disregard for his signature three-minute introductions, or perhaps the lack of multifaceted lyrical interpretations, that make the song so boring in comparison to the rest of the album. In “Lovesong,” Smith croons “however far away / I will always love you” over and over again. What happened to the sad, dark, and depressing Smith that we all know and love?
Other songs on Disintegration follow The Cure’s formula of melodic happiness juxtaposed with oh-so-sad lyrics. On “Lullaby,” Smith is afraid of a spider, while on “Pictures of You,” Smith reminisces on a lost love. Despite this shift in formulation, “Lovesong” peaked at number two on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, and has been covered too many times to count.
I guess people love the straightforward presentation of the song: It’s comforting and idealistic. I know Valentine’s Day is coming up, but please, whatever you do, do not play this song. If you’re alone and looking for some good music, check out The Cure’s extensive back catalog.
Also, regardless of your plans for this fantastically commercial holiday that allows Hallmark to stay in business and creates an artificial demand for roses, you should call up your mom, and tell her that you love her.

The Art of Getting By
10 12
This coming-of-age movie is a romantic comedy/drama that takes us back to those not-at-all terrible years in high school. George Zinavoy (Freddie Highmore) and Sally Howe (Emma Roberts) are the protagonists. Zinavoy is a talented loner who comes to the realization that he will die someday. Charming, right? Howe is the offbeat, complicated (and gorgeous) girl who happens to take a liking to George, which leads to an awkward courtship. Problems arise and are resolved, as they so often are in these stories. Oh, and for originality: It’s set in New York.
The Lion King
8 10 12
One of the best movies ever made, The Lion King has everything: romance, violence, laughs, tears, and an epic storyline. The Lion King is a story that still resonates with audiences today. From James Earl Jones’ powerful voice-work as Mufasa to the delightful tandem of Timon and Pumbaa singing “Hakuna Matata,” there’s something for everyone in this film, which follows a young lion cub’s quest to regain his rightful throne. If you haven’t seen it, do yourself a favor and stop depriving yourself of one of the greatest tales ever told.
Psycho (1960)
8 10 12
Another classic piece of American cinema, Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho was one of the first great suspense/thriller films to be released. Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, a creepy motel owner who is devoted to his mother, in a manner of speaking. And when Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) makes a stop at the Bates Motel, she finds out just how far that devotion goes. The infamous shower scene took six days to film, featured 77 different camera angles, and was originally supposed to be played without the famous screeching and horrifying musical soundtrack.
The Thing (1982)
10 12
Directed by master of horror John Carpenter, The Thing stars Kurt Russell and several other actors known primarily because of their roles in this film. The movie takes place in the Antarctic, as a group of American researchers encounters a creature that is able to take the form of any organism it kills. The American crew is forced into a game of cat and mouse with the creature, and each other, since they are unable to tell who has been assimilated and who is still human. Fun Fact: This is John Carpenter’s personal favorite out of all of his films.

Friday morning, Carnegie Mellon alumnus (HS ’80) and The Last Lecture co-author Jeffrey Zaslow died at age 53 due to injuries he sustained in a car accident. Zaslow lost control of his vehicle on a snowy road in northern Michigan.
Zaslow, a Philadelphia native, graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a creative writing degree. He was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, and served as editor-in-chief of The Tartan.
After Zaslow attended the final lecture of  late Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Randy Pausch, “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” he wrote an article on the subject for the Wall Street Journal. He then Zaslow began working on The Last Lecture with Pausch. Zaslow soon befriended Pausch, who was suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer.
The Last Lecture was a hit. It became a New York Times bestseller in 2008 and has been translated into 48 languages, selling more than 5 million copies in the U.S. alone.
The book propelled Pausch and, to a degree, Zaslow into the national spotlight.
Anne Witchner, former director of student activities at Carnegie Mellon, met Zaslow while he was a student. “Zaslow was a very bright young man,” Witchner said. “I knew he would do well.”
Zasow returned to Carnegie Mellon for orientation every year after he wrote The Last Lecture, and also spoke at Homecoming events and other functions. 
Witchner recalled that Zaslow would always stay for book signings after his speeches, and never left until every single person’s copy was signed.
“He had a total understanding of the human condition, and was a very down-to-earth person who saw the world in a very sensible way,” Witchner said.
Zaslow was also a consistent contributor to the Wall Street Journal, as well as the author of numerous nonfiction books, such as The Girls from Ames. He collaborated with Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband on their memoir, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
Other notable works of Zaslow’s include Highest Duty, a book co-written with Captain Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who landed U.S. Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in January 2009.
Zaslow’s final book, The Magic Room: A Story About the Love We Wish for Our Daughters, was released in January of this year.
Zaslow was twice named “best columnist” by the National Society of Newspaper Columnists, and received the Will Rogers Humanitarian Award in 2000.
According to a statement Wall Street Journal editor Robert Thomson made to the paper’s staff, “Jeff’s writing, for the Journal and in his books, has been a source of inspiration for many people around the world and his journalistic life has been a source of inspiration for all journalists.”
Zaslow began his career writing for the Orlando Sentinel ’s magazine section. He then took a position as a staff writer at the Wall Street Journal and, after winning a competition  to replace writer Ann Landers, published a front page feature for the Chicago Sun-Time.
Zaslow also made numerous media appearances, on programs such as 60 Minutes, The Tonight Show, The Today Show, Oprah, Larry King Live, and Good Morning America.
Zaslow is survived by his wife, Sherry Margolis, and his three daughters: Jordan, Alex, and Eden.

This year, proposed Port Authority service cuts could affect many Carnegie Mellon students and others affiliated with the university. On Jan. 18, the Port Authority Planning and Development Committee introduced a fare increase and service reduction proposal, which would cut current service hours by 35 percent, effective Sept. 2. A fare increase, effective July 1, would accompany the service changes. The service changes have been proposed as a response to the Port Authority’s $64 million budget deficit.
The Port Authority has been cutting service for several years. According to Port Authority data, in 2010, bus services were cut by 15 percent and over 250 Port Authority employees were laid off due to budget shortfalls. In March 2011, the Port Authority scaled back services by another 15 percent, eliminating 29 routes and reducing service on another 37 routes. Bus fare has also been increased several times since 2001.
The steady decrease in available bus service has changed the way that Carnegie Mellon students travel. According to Lieutenant Joseph Meyers of the University Police, Carnegie Mellon shuttles and escort buses gave 40,000 more rides in 2011 than they did in 2009. Meyers, who oversees transportation for the University Police, said that he believes the increased ridership was due to the recently expanded reach of the shuttle routes, along with Port Authority cuts.
Meyers said that if additional routes were necessary for the Carnegie Mellon shuttles, they would be added, but only after more research and information was obtained about the Port Authority cuts. “My top priorities are safety and consistency, so all students can do what they need to do,” Meyers said.
The planned service reduction is not, however, a foregone conclusion. Announced route eliminations have been scaled back in the past. For instance, the 15 percent service reduction in 2007 was planned and announced as a 35 percent reduction. However, former Pennsylvania Governer Ed Rendell granted the Port Authority a one-time emergency fund of $45 million dollars. This money allowed the Port Authority to retain more routes. But the $45 million dollars has run out now, and the Port Authority once again faces major service cuts.
According to Heather Pharo, a Port Authority spokesperson, the Port Authority considers several factors when deciding how and where to reduce service. Among them, Pharo said, are ridership levels, the presence of other transportation options in the area, and operating costs.
But Pharo said that all areas would be affected by the proposed cuts. “There’s really no fat to trim in the route system,” Pharo said. “There are no easy decisions to make. While we are proposing the elimination of probably about half of our routes, there isn’t a single route that wouldn’t see a reduction.”
According to Pharo, one of the effects of the service reduction would be a severe drop in nighttime service. Only 12 routes would continue to run after 10 p.m. Among them would be the 61B and the 86.
In addition, Pharo said, the Port Authority would have to lay off several hundred employees.
Pharo said that the Port Authority has entered what is known in the mass transit industry as “the death spiral,” in which service must be reduced and fares must be raised in order to save money, which in turn reduces profits as ridership drops. She said that this is not a problem that the Port Authority can fix on its own. “We need something that’s a dedicated solution at the state level, and something that deals with inflation,” Pharo said.
Such a solution may take some time to come about. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett’s 2012–13 budget, which he released on Tuesday, does not address mass transportation. Carnegie Mellon’s Student Senate has created a petition against the Port Authority service cuts at www.stoppatcuts.com, which simultaneously sends emails to Corbett, the Pennsylvania State House transportation committee, and the signer’s district’s representative, urging them to support Pennsylvania House Bill 2112.
House Bill 2112 would fund mass transit using money from tolls gathered on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. A similar funding scheme was proposed in 2007 with Act 44, which would have turned Interstate 80 into a toll road, some of the proceeds from which would have gone to fund mass transit in Pennsylvania. Rendell, during his term, signed the bill into law. 
However, the federal government rejected the application to toll Interstate 80, and in 2010, Act 44 mass transit funding was cut in half. According to Pharo, this funding cut led to the March 2011 service reduction.
While the state searches for a funding solution, Carnegie Mellon students worry about how they will get from one place to another. 
“I rely heavily on the Port Authority system to get to and from work,” said Carrie Weintraub, a first-year information systems major. “If bus service were to be reduced, then I would not be able to have the job that I have now.”
Sophomore chemistry major Haylie Kim said that  she feels that Pittsburgh’s bus service is already too sporadic.
“I feel as though the bus schedule is sometimes very unreliable,” Kim said. “There have been many instances in which I needed to get on the bus to go to an important meeting or an interview, and ended up having to wait for the bus that was said to come in five minutes for half an hour.” A substantial service reduction would make buses even rarer.
Weintraub also worried that a reduction in bus service would trap students on campus. 
“The buses also allow students to get out and about in order to explore the city and get out of the ‘CMU Bubble,’ ” Weintraub said. “Without the buses, the extent to which students would get off campus would be Craig Street, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and Oakland. That would be a real shame, since there are some real gems downtown and on the South Side.”
Pharo said that it is the Port Authority’s sincere hope that it will not have to reduce service. “Unfortunately, for a lot of the people who take these routes, there will be no options left,” Pharo said. “It’s been very difficult for us to come up with this. We want to have these routes in our system. They’re all vital.”

Tom Corbett, the governor of Pennsylvania, unveiled his new 2012–13 budget to the public last Tuesday, revealing heavy funding cuts to state universities.
Speaking to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, Corbett’s address outlined his proposed budget for the coming year. He said, “We will not spend more than we have.”
The $27.1 billion state budget also cut funding to numerous social welfare programs while maintaining funding for correctional facilities — something which hasn’t happened in the last 10 years.
Despite the reduction in  the higher education budget, this proposal is meant to shelter public schools from any more funding cuts, and will not raise taxes for Pennsylvanians.
In his speech, Corbett called the proposal “a budget grounded in difficult realities but framed in the optimism that we are solving our problems.” He continued, “Once again, revenues do not match mandated, escalating costs. That means we must continue the course bravely charted by this assembly in the year just passed.”
This budget proposal comes on the heels of last year’s controversial budget, which slashed funding to many state programs in an attempt to reconcile $4 billion dollars in state debt.
This year, the state is expecting to incur a $719 million deficit by the end of June, and is seeking revenue outside of tax increases.
The state plans to fund itself through a new fee on Marcellus Shale drilling; a 30 percent cut in funding to the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania State University, and Temple University; and the elimination of a substantial amount of line-item spending.
“I am submitting to you a budget proposal that is at once lean and demanding. In the coming weeks we will sit down to work out the final details as we map out our course. But this map comes with boundaries. We will not spend more than we have,” Corbett said in his speech. “We will not raise taxes. There is no talking around these limits. Every dollar taken in tax is one less dollar in the hands of a job holder or a job creator. Every dollar spent by government is one dollar less in the sector that creates real prosperity.”
Despite these arguments in favor of the new budget, a number of lawmakers stand in opposition to the proposal.
The office of Pennsylvania State House Democratic Caucus Chairman Dan Frankel (D.–23rd district, Allegheny County) released a statement in rebuttal to the budget announcement on Tuesday. In the statement, Frankel said that Pennsylvania’s transportation infrastructure requires investment that it will not receive in the new budget and called the cuts to the University of Pittsburgh’s funding “devastating.”
State representative Jake Wheatley (D.–19th district, Allegheny County) agreed. Wheatley’s office released a statement in which he said that Corbett should have addressed transportation in his budget. 
“I was amazed that the governor punted again on what to do about transportation funding,” Wheatley said in the statement. He also echoed Frankel’s remarks regarding education.
In his own press release, State Senator Wayne Fontana (D.–42nd district, Allegheny County) summed up his reaction to the proposal by saying, “Less than a week after we celebrated Groundhog Day, Pennsylvanians had a Groundhog Day moment of another kind as Governor Corbett outlined his 2012–13 state budget yesterday. Apparently, the governor wants a repeat of last year’s budget, which means more painful cuts, no direct job creation funding, and no concern for ensuring that wealthy corporations pay their fair share.”
“A budget reflects priorities,” Frankel further said in his statement. “It concerns me that this budget makes significant cuts in health care, zeroes out the diabetes program, cuts public welfare, and slashes higher education, but increases funds for controversial partisan and ideologically-based programs like Voter ID and crisis pregnancy centers.”
In a statement released by his office, University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Mark Nordenberg acknowledged that the governor is under great pressure to balance the budget, but said that the funding cuts will be devastating for Pitt.
“Unfortunately, what almost certainly will prove to be most memorable about 2012 is that an already brutal budget year has been made far worse by today’s proposal for deep and disproportionate cuts emerging from the state capital,” Nordenberg said. “It would reduce our state support, if adjusted for inflation, to the lowest level since Pitt became a state-related university.”
Some Pitt students also expressed discontent with the new budget. First-year biomedical engineering student Maria Alessi said, “I’m very disappointed in the government and think they are being far too extreme in this case. The tuition at Pitt and Penn State, at around $15,000, are already some of the highest of any public university in the entire U.S.; many families already are struggling just to be able to pay that.” 
She added, “I see Corbett’s actions as being extremely shortsighted, negligent, and irresponsible.”
Namita Matharu, a first-year neuroscience major, concurred. “Pitt is a renowned university for its academia as well as its exceptional research opportunities,” she said. “The new budget will be a major setback on our education and each student and professor will, undoubtedly, feel the effect heavily.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu spoke at the Tepper School of Business on Thursday in a largely unpublicized visit to campus. Chu spoke to an audience of fewer than 60 students and faculty members with a short set of prepared remarks, followed by an extended question and answer session.
Chu opened by telling the story of how he became involved in energy research. He left his faculty position at Stanford University to lead research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory after he became “very concerned about climate change.” 
He spoke about the early days of his research there, when Chu and his colleagues had not yet secured grant funding for alternative-energy research. During those days, they held informal meetings and seminars without the promise of funding, as they taught themselves to tackle what Chu called “the energy problem.”
After Chu’s prepared remarks, the topics of audience questions ranged from the Fukushima nuclear plant to Solyndra’s bankruptcy, and Chu addressed each question at length. Michael Lawrence, a first-year master’s of business administration student, asked what the government had learned from Solyndra, the now-bankrupt company that produced thin-film solar cells and was backed by the Department of Energy. Chu said, “Whenever there is new emerging businesses, not all of them succeed.”
Regarding the Fukushima meltdown, Chu has already publicly stated that the United States must continue to support investment and licensing for nuclear power plants, a message he echoed in his talk.
When asked about the future of smart grid technologies, Chu launched into a detailed explanation of how current power systems waste electricity, how to level loads, and even how auto-defrost works in a modern refrigerator. 
He said that he sees improvements in power distribution and electrical conversion as upgrades that will benefit everyone who pays an electricity bill, as well as waste less energy. But Chu said that few changes have been made to our power distribution system. “Our electrical system is something that would be recognizable by Edison and Westinghouse and Tesla,” Chu said.
The talk, while often highly technical in nature, was geared toward the many MBA students present. Chu presented alternative energy technologies and innovation as business opportunities. “It is okay to make money and save the world,” Chu said. “There, I said it.”
He not only discussed investment and innovation in nuclear power, solar cells, and smart grids, but also talked about business plans for technology that are already in place. He discussed a financial market for investing in medium-risk renewable energy technologies or businesses that manage the permits, liability, installation, and repair of solar panels on residential rooftops.
Chu won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997, has been a professor of physics, and was the chair of the physics department at Stanford, as well as the director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He was appointed secretary of energy in 2009. Tim McNulty, Carnegie Mellon’s associate vice president for government relations, reiterated that the students and faculty made it possible for two U.S. secretaries to visit campus just this month.
Pittsburgh was just one stop on Chu’s trip this week, which he took in order to “participate in events across the country to highlight America’s investments in cutting-edge energy innovations that are laying the building blocks for an American economy built to last,” according to a Department of Energy press release. While in Pittsburgh, Chu toured the facilities at the Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The NETL is the only national laboratory that remains government-owned and -operated; the others are now operated by local businesses or universities.
The program was hosted by the Tepper School of Business Energy Club and the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center (CEIC).

World Bank Group president Robert B. Zoellick spoke at Kresge Theatre last Thursday as part of the university’s Thomas M. Kerr, Jr. Prelaw Society’s annual lecture. 
The event was co-sponsored by the Center for International Relations and Politics and the global studies major.
The moderator for Zoellick’s address was social and decision sciences professor Kiron Skinner. 
While the event was technically part of the pre-law program, Skinner and Joseph Devine, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies at the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, emphasized that bringing Zoellick to Carnegie Mellon was a joint effort among several different parties.
“Our pre-law program is quite proud of our expanded mission, but to command the kind of gravitas that would enable us to attract a speaker of the type and stature as our guest today, we needed to partner with a more nationally visible entity and persona,” Devine said. “Fortunately, we had both in our Center for International Relations, with which we are co-sponsoring today’s event, and its director, Dr. Kiron Skinner.”
“Mr. Zoellick brings a truly global perspective to issues related to the intersection of politics, culture, markets, and technology,” Skinner said in a university press release.
The event was mostly a question and answer session between audience members and Zoellick. 
A large crowd of people lined up to ask Zoellick questions, ranging from University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon undergraduates to a former U.S. executive director at the World Bank.
The majority of questions related to environmental or human rights issues, some of which took on a confrontational tone. 
One student asked if Zoellick understood the concept of self-determination, and if so, whether he regretted supporting the Iraq War.
Throughout the questions, Zoellick emphasized that the World Bank seeks to solve problems by providing economic incentives, rather than by forcing governments to take certain actions.
“I don’t tell countries what to do,” Zoellick said. “Our primary way of helping countries and companies is showing them what’s in their best interest in the long run.”
One topic that came up frequently was climate change. 
Many students felt that Zoellick was not doing enough to prevent carbon emissions, deforestation, and other environmentally harmful activities. However, near the beginning of the talk, Skinner and Zoellick made a point of discussing how the World Bank’s strategy can encourage environmentally friendly practices.
“The role of the bank is to connect issues of development and growth with the climate change agenda, and in some instances, we’ve been more successful than the environmental negotiations,” Zoellick said. “We’ve done projects in 45 developing countries that range from technology to energy efficiency to deforestation, and these projects are on the ground examples of how to make the issues work.”
Nevertheless, many in the audience asked Zoellick why he was reluctant to take regulatory action with regards to carbon emissions.
“If I create an incentive system to arbitrate so that somebody can pay companies to produce the carbon elsewhere, and it’s a net benefit, that’s a good thing,” Zoellick responded. “But if you try to deal with the world of carbon production in a command and control regulatory way, you’re not going to be successful.”
Despite the occasionally confrontational tone of the forum, many students left with a positive impression.
“It was enlightening to hear his comments and be aware of the varied activities carried out by the World Bank,” said Satyam Bakliwal, a master’s student in business administration. “When the political process isn’t capable of offering the most efficient ways of dealing with the above concerns, the World Bank is in a powerful place to do so, and that is the hope.”

CMU Press’ Magpies wins gold medal award in Florida
Magpies, a collection of short stories by Lynne Barrett published by Carnegie Mellon University Press, has been awarded the gold medal for general fiction in the sixth annual Florida Book Awards. 
The short stories in the book differ dramatically in style. One of the stories, “Links,” borrows the layout of a web page to tell a story of the dot-com boom, while “Cave of the Winds” uses the alphabet to narrate a story about Florida’s hurricane season. Barrett also explores a wide spectrum of genres in her book, ranging from mystery to magical realism. Most of the stories take place in Florida, where Barrett was born.
“In a time of broad ‘experimentation’ in short fiction, what is refreshing about Lynne Barrett is that her stories have honest-to-goodness plots. Reading stories which actually tell stories is a satisfying thing,” Gerald Costanzo, professor of English and founder and director of the Carnegie Mellon University Press, said in a press release. 
The Carnegie Mellon University Press was originally founded in 1972 as a publisher of poetry. Since then, the organization has also published classic contemporaries, short fiction, and regional social history. Among the press’ most notable achievements is the 1986 publication of Thomas and Beulah, a book of poems by Rita Dove, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize the following year.
INI creates new program for business, tech students
Carnegie Mellon’s Information Networking Institute (INI) will be offering an Executive Master of Science in Information Assurance program beginning in the 2012 fall semester. An option for non-degree students to pursue certificates in this area will also be available. 
The new program is geared at business leaders and tech experts who see cyber-security as a top priority. 
The program will train such audiences in the use of tools like forensics to identify and track malevolent attackers.
“This is an interdisciplinary program designed to meet the needs of today’s fast-paced global business environment combining online sessions with periodic, short sessions on the Carnegie Mellon campus,” INI director Dena Haritos Tsamitis said in a university press release.
The INI program spans 20 months over the course of five semesters. Students will spend a total of 24 days on campus during the program.  Students will also complete six hours of online coursework every semester.
“Students pursue the program with a cohort of about 20 peers, who add enrichment to each other’s professional network and enhance learning by sharing their own knowledge that has come from experience,” Tsamitis added in the press release.

Oklahoma Democratic State Representative William Fourkiller has proposed a bill that, if passed, will tack on an extra 1 percent tax for violent video games to fund the Childhood Outdoor Education Revolving Fund and the Bullying Prevention Revolving Fund.
Although the bill has good intentions to combat childhood obesity and bullying, the legislation is poorly executed both in terms of its presentation and in its aims to combat these problems.
If the point of the law is to fight childhood obesity and bullying through taxation of media, why is this new tax only for video games? Movies, magazines, and music, which are highly accessible to young crowds, have the potential to reach a much wider audience than video games.
Moreover, these forms of media can convey violence and promote inactivity just as effectively as video games. If Fourkiller had included these types of media, the bill could have had a lasting impact on bullying and obesity if passed.
If the bill hopes to stop such issues, it should impose a much larger tax in order to prevent sales of violent video games. As a consumer of video games, I can say that an extra 60-cent tax on top of a $60 price tag will not deter anyone from getting their video game fix.
The revision of the legislation to have a larger tax increase for violent video games, however, could serve to make consumers think twice about their purchases and, in turn, stop what Fourkiller believes to be the problem at its source.
One of the most alarming portions of the bill is the statement that all teen-rated games are considered to be violent.
This means that even motion-control games like Dance Central, which promote physical activity and cooperation through choreographed dance routines, are in the running to be taxed.
If the intention of the bill is to promote health and cooperation, it should not be taxing games that actively fight these problems in the same way that it taxes truly violent games.
If Fourkiller had hoped to combat the issues of child obesity and violence, his bill would have been thoughtfully executed to include a more specific list of taxable items based on actual violence in video games, rather than the given ESRB rating.
For now, though, one can only hope that this rash bill is significantly altered if it has any hopes of becoming law.

China’s authoritarian government is as tense a topic now as it was 60 years ago. Various activist groups’ attempts to modernize China into a democracy only increase the tension.
Last Friday, these tensions were pushed even further when Zhu Yufu, one of the founders of the federally unrecognized Democracy Party of China, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for circulating a poem titled “It’s Time” online. He is accused of writing this poem to rally democratic activists to promote an uprising in China.
From an American perspective, Zhu should have the rights to free speech and the press.
Freedom of speech is an innate liberty to humanity that should not be repressed.
The alleged subversion of state power not only has a grave overtone, but it is also difficult to repeal, especially with a criminal record.
Zhu was imprisoned twice before this incident: once from 1999 to 2006 for helping the foundation of the Democracy Party, and again from 2007 to 2009 for pushing a police officer.
In a nutshell, the law states that anyone who tries to defame the government in order to undermine its authority will endure a long prison sentence.
This includes even the most minor of offenses, like a blog article, or in this case, a poem.
Zhu’s poem suggests that the Chinese citizens should assemble to attempt a rebellion against the authoritarian party, like the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia early last year, that resulted in the ousting of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The Jasmine Revolution argued for fair and equal rights, and it expanded into Egypt.
Zhu insinuated that the Chinese activists should cause a similarly effective uproar to fight for democracy.
It may not be the prettiest or cleanest campaign, but in the face of such opposition, great measures are often necessary to ensure freedom of speech.
If Zhu had written this poem in America, a lawsuit and a trial would most likely not even be considered. It’s a simple classification of freedom of expression, a right that should be extended universally. In America, the implications of China’s regulations on freedom of expression seem unjust.
The Chinese government plays by a different set of rules, a set that Zhu’s actions clearly break. Zhu attempted to undermine the government and therefore broke the law. In China, it is just another example of committing a crime.
Perhaps the Chinese government will someday reach a compromise and accept such democratic values, but for now, the words of Abraham Lincoln come to mind: “The best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly.”
The best way to repeal Zhu’s sentence and fight for democracy might be to revolt, or it might be to play the game and wait for the other team to lose its footing.

Last Tuesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in a 2–1 decision titled Perry v. Brown, that California Proposition 8 — the 2008 “ballot measure” that limited marital relationships to opposite sex — was unconstitutional. Proposition 8 drafters claimed that they will appeal to higher courts, as expected.
Gay marriage freedoms in California have fluctuated, to say the least, throughout the years.
Before the introduction of Proposition 8 on Nov. 5, 2008, California boasted its title as the second state to allow gay marriage — regardless of the right’s four-month duration. The proposition, upon passing, trumped the state court’s ruling that allowed gay marriage.
This recent decision is different from past legislation opposed to Proposition 8 in that it may actually work.
Many legal analysts predict that the ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court, and will be picked up next term. As Andy Pugno, the general counsel, stated in a letter to Proposition 8 supporters earlier this week, “The 9th Circuit’s decision is completely out of step with every other federal appellate and Supreme Court decision in American history on the subject of marriage, but it really doesn’t come as a surprise, given the history of the 9th Circuit, which is often overturned.”
What differentiates this present decision is that the scope of the ban lift was more narrow this time around. It looks solely at the issues of Proposition 8 in recognizing the title of gay marriage and does not, according to the appeals court, extend to the controversy over whether or not same-sex couples may be denied the right to marry in the future.
With the ruling most likely being appealed to the Supreme Court, there are two possible outcomes.
Because of the limited controversial nature of the ruling, it is likely that even Republican justices will rule in favor. It is also likely that Justice Anthony Kennedy — classified as the swing vote because he is the only moderate in the Supreme Court — will rule in favor of this narrow judgment.
Regardless of the route that the appeals ruling takes, I predict a favorable outcome because of the 9th Circuit’s smart legislative thinking in constructing a narrow ruling.
The new ruling specifically stated that Proposition 8’s sole objective “was to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians in California,” which runs against constitutional protections, the 14th Amendment being the lead constitutional precedent.
Unlike other 9th District legislation on gay marriage, the recent action is limited to California, even though the 9th District Court has jurisdiction in other states. This, in itself, makes it more unlikely for the Supreme Court to reject the ruling.
As Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote in the majority opinion, “California had already extended to committed same-sex couples both the incidents of marriage and the official designation of ‘marriage’.... Proposition 8’s only effect was to take away that important and legally significant designation.” He then explained the nature of Perry v. Brown. “This unique and strictly limited effect of Proposition 8 allows us to address the amendment’s constitutionality on narrow grounds,” Reinhardt said.
For now, Proposition 8 is unconstitutional in California. That in itself justifies celebration. However, the ruling represents a larger triumph. Finally, after a history of tumultuous rulings, California is beginning to understand that Proposition 8 is not simply an affront to gay marriage, but a violation of basic civil rights.
Due to the differences in the current ruling from the past attempts to legalize gay marriage in California, future success in the movement is more attainable now than ever before.

Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music is an esteemed program; training with its distinguished faculty has led many alumni to notable careers. However, while the school is well intentioned in training its students, it is somewhat misguided, overemphasizing one very specialized aspect of the music industry.
The school places the highest value on the orchestral career track. This is due in part to the close relationship between the school and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. This relationship is positive and assures high-caliber training, but orchestral careers have become over-prioritized while other possibilities such as chamber music, music business, and music education seem to go unappreciated. Orchestral careers may have been more viable in previous generations, but with shrinking funds, even reputable orchestras are going bankrupt and jobs are disappearing.
The School of Music is filled with creative and intelligent students. Unfortunately, with their highly specialized orchestral training, their job prospects tend to be bleak and depressing.
Students find themselves approaching graduation with no plans for the future except to win an audition. The tough competition for a position in a professional ensemble becomes even more daunting as students leave the comfort of the academic system. It is not uncommon for over 100 people to audition for a single position. If students begin to look at other career possibilities, they will realize that they aren’t qualified or prepared to do much outside of their classical training.
The Master of Arts Management classes offered through the Heinz College have the potential to arm music students with the skills they need to become successful entrepreneurs. Regrettably, there is little cooperation between the two schools, and it is very difficult for music students to take these classes.
Fortunately, newly appointed interim head of the School of Music Denis Colwell has some very positive ideas about how to evolve the program.
Already in his time as an administrator, he has encouraged the creation of a student government, which gives him a direct link with the opinions and ideas of the student body. An entrepreneurship program specifically for music students is rumored to be in the works as well. Colwell understands the importance of helping students create marketable niches for themselves, and students and administrators alike would benefit from following his lead.
Students should be strongly encouraged by the culture of the institution to be versatile and creative entrepreneurs.
One idea would be to have students present their art within the community, where it can be made relevant and interesting to the audience. The work of music students laboring for hours to get exactly the right tone quality, rhythm, and intonation will all be for naught if they do not understand how to realistically market their abilities. One could even argue that it is the duty of musicians today to assist with the evolution of their art form within society — if it does not evolve, it will go extinct.
Carnegie Mellon does a good job of classically training students. If the program is able to mature into something creative, relevant, and vibrant, its students will be prepared to succeed and it will be able to flourish as one of the great music schools. Carnegie Mellon’s administration should acknowledge the natural evolution of musical art forms and help its students properly prepare to thrive in the job market.

“This afternoon at 5:30 p.m., Occupy Pittsburgh will rally and make statements for the press at People’s Park. Afterward, they will march away from the encampment site.” This quote, taken from an article on Occupy Pittsburgh’s website, represents the belief of the local Occupiers that their movement has ended on a victorious note.
They stayed encamped in BNY Mellon’s park until Wednesday, two days after the third official eviction date.
The court-ordered end of the camps is not a victory to be relished, no matter how many extra days the group was able to stay in the park. If Occupy Pittsburgh members were serious in their fight against the 1 percent, then leaving would not have been an option.
Think back to the infamous protests at University of California, Davis.
Those Occupy protestors fought for their beliefs, no matter the violence and opposition they faced.
In hindsight, the Occupy Pittsburgh group had a media opportunity that was completely wasted. In recent months, the press coverage on the movement has died down. This was Occupy Pittsburgh’s shining chance to draw swarms of media back to the group’s cause and its plight.
Even in the days leading up to the eviction date, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette speculated about the group’s fate.
Simply put, last Wednesday was a let down. For the months of effort and protesting that went into the movement, it seems as though the group just gave up without a fight; it didn’t stick to its guns.
Members of Occupy Pittsburgh rented out luxury hotel rooms to “monitor” last week’s eviction. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, protesters stayed for three nights in the Omni William Penn Hotel, which overlooks the park. Rooms at the hotel cost about $250 per night.
Apparently, the group partially paid for the luxury rooms through donation money that was collected to winterize the tents and buy warm clothing for the protesters who stayed in the park. The rooms were further subsidized through the group’s general fund and private donations.
This kind of hypocrisy, added to the wasted media opportunity and lackluster eviction, makes the Occupy Pittsburgh movement disappointing at best.
The editorial board claims that the Occupy Pittsburgh protesters failed to take advantage of a media opportunity when they were evicted from Mellon Green last week. However, the board’s underlying assumption — that protests are only legitimate when their members are arrested or abused — overlooks the achievements of Occupy Pittsburgh and the Occupy movement in general.
In Pittsburgh, Occupy protesters have been camped out since October — 118 days from beginning to end. Although the movement lost steam as time went one, it was a constant presence throughout much of the winter. We should be admiring their dedication, not ridiculing them for leaving when ordered to do so rather than face arrest.
Occupy Pittsburgh did not see the violence between protesters and police that characterized the Occupy Oakland movement or the G-20 here in 2009. If police brutality is what the board considers necessary to make an eviction less “lackluster,” then I gladly accept this so-called disappointment.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has proposed changing its rules of criminal procedure. Since early January, court officials have tossed around the idea of more clearly defining their ban on the transmission of communications in state courtrooms.
Officials are now proposing a ban on computers, iPads, cell phones, and other electronic devices that would allow real-time reporting ­—via text or tweet, for example.
According to supporters of the changes, the proposal is meant to make sure jury members don’t base decisions on media reports; to protect witnesses from intimidation; and to minimize distractions during court proceedings.
Rules that limit communication between the courtroom and the outside world are already in place and already as defined as they need to be.
Currently, the Rules of Criminal Procedure of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania assert the court can prohibit communication via telephone, radio, television, or advanced communication technology. Additionally, photography and videography are prohibited.
However, each judge presiding over a courtroom is allowed to interpret these rules as he or she sees fit.
Some Pennsylvania courtrooms have allowed real-time reporting to take place.
According to the Centre Daily Times, live tweeting was allowed during the preliminary hearing of two Pennsylvania State University officials involved in the Jerry Sandusky scandal.
Live reporting from the courtroom already has adequate restrictions. To add new and heavier shackles to courtroom reporting would only slow down the inevitable dissemination of information. If the current rule is changed, reporters will still report live; they will just be running in and out of the courtroom handing slips of paper to waiting colleagues or making quick phone calls to the office. Depending on the courtroom, reporters have to do this anyway. But that is the sort of freedom of interpretation that makes the current law work just fine; judges can decide how to run their courtrooms on a case-by-case basis.
As Judge Mark Bennet of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa said in an interview with the ABA Journal, “I thought the public’s right to know what goes on in federal court and the transparency that would be given the proceedings by live-blogging outweighed any potential prejudice to the defendant.... I allowed it because of my belief that we are the most mysterious branch of federal government and we need to find ways to be more transparent.”
It is essential to protect the already limited reporting rights that journalists have in the courtroom. The proposed change in the Rules of Criminal Procedure would only undermine transparency and hinder the public’s right to know what is going on in its court system.

In the Jan. 30 issue of The Tartan, Student Senate announced its intention to evaluate the use of the University Center, particularly the Scotland Yard game room on the lower level (“Initiatives by Student Senate are underway”). We of the University Center staff support this idea. However, Student Senate is not working with us to see this idea come to fruition.
Unlike other buildings on campus, the University Center has a dedicated staff working nearly 24 hours a day, every day, to supervise and maintain the building. This staff, of which I am a part, believes foremost that the University Center is a student space.
We are interested in what students want to do with the University Center. If something isn’t working well or could work better, we want students to approach us with a solution.
It is disheartening to read that Student Senate is meeting and proposing changes without reaching out to the building staff beforehand.
It would seem as though those students believe we are resistant to their ideas and their proposed changes. That is entirely untrue.
Judy Ghogomu, a facilities manager for the University Center, and I have spoken with a few students regarding minor issues about the game room, including non-student use of the facilities, new foosball equipment, and the security of the In The Groove dance game. Each time, we have come to the conclusion that a student committee is necessary to oversee the game room and its use and maintenance. Each time, we have seen no one come forward to put the work into developing such a committee.
It does nothing to announce to the student body an amorphous and lofty goal to evaluate the use of student space if you will not put in the footwork to enact change. We would very much like to be a part of the conversation toward solutions instead of loosely associated with unnamed problems.

Romantic movies and silly love songs are all well and good, but love is a complicated thing. Keep on your toes, keep your heart and mind open, and enjoy the ride. 
Do something nice, like surprise a friend with a cute little Valentine's Day card. Good friends are hard to find. When you find one, treat that person right so he or she sticks around.
Remember on Wednesday that it's not the walk of shame, but rather the stride of pride. 
The economy is still in bad shape, so you might want to hold off going all out for Valentine's Day. Be economical and suggest that you and your significant other take a short break. Make sure to win him or her back before St. Patrick's Day. 
Leos in relationships: Do something really romantic for the one you love. Your partner deserves it for putting up with you. Leos not in relationships: The good thing about Valentine’s Day is that candy will be half off on Wednesday.
Don't let your friends give up their dates just because they are short on cash. You're a big spender and a great friend, so convince your friend to share his or her significant other with you for the day. 
You may be flying the Singles’ Awareness Day banner high and with lots of pride, but this week, around lunchtime, you will meet an amazing person who will change your life. 
Your secret admirer wants you to get a clue and notice that someone likes you. For heaven’s sake, what do people have to do in order for you to take a hint?
Screw Cupid and just enjoy this week. Don't let anything, especially an idea or a holiday, hold you back.
The outcome of your Valentine's Day is still up in the air, but no matter if it is the best or worst day of the year, just remember that Stevie Wonder makes everything better. 
Playwright William Shakespeare said it best when he wrote, "If love be rough with you, be rough with love; prick love for pricking, and you beat love down."
You're not bitter or jealous of everyone who will be partaking in Tuesday's festivities. You're just more mature and know that Tuesday is just another day. Scoff at those silly lovebirds, and be happy that you know what love really is.
