The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team played Oberlin College on Saturday. The hard-fought contest ended in a 73–64 win for the Tartans, improving their record to 6–0 for the season.
Oberlin got off to a 5–0 start before the Tartans made their first basket. Though the Yeowomen were able to get off to a fast start, junior guard Jackie Hudepohl’s scoring helped the Tartans close the gap during the course of the first period. The Tartans even managed to take the lead a few times before the quarter finished with a 14–14 tie.
In the second quarter, Oberin once again worked up a lead, this time keeping a tight defense against the Tartans.
Junior center and forward Lisa Murphy kept the Tartans afloat during the period, getting the Tartans through their largest deficit of nine points and keeping the game much closer at 36–33 Oberlin going into halftime.
The third quarter saw Oberlin extend their lead with a few three-point shots. Senior forward Liza Otto contributed to much of the Tartans’ scoring in the period, and Murphy was able to get open for plenty of two-point baskets as the Tartans came back. After taking the lead with two minutes to go, Oberlin came back with another three-point field goal, but the Tartans were able to retake the lead after a foul gave Murphy the chance to make some free shots. The Yeowomen had a chance to tie the game at the end of the period, but the Tartans got the rebound and managed to get one more score out of it, closing the period with a 58–53 lead.
The Yeowomen got off to a quick start in the final period, tying up the game before Murphy made another basket. Several lead changes ensued as both teams refused to let up. In the last two minutes, the Tartans found themselves with a sizable lead and managed to burn quite a bit of time as they continued to add more breathing space. At 30 seconds, the Yeowomen were desperate to extend game time by fouling after earning a three-point field goal. However, the Tartans were able to recover the ball after Oberlin failed to score again, finally finishing off the Yeowomen.
Though the offense took a while to truly get going, the Tartans turned out another strong performance. Murphy led the way for the team with 28 points and 12 rebounds. Otto earned 15 points and four rebounds, Hudepohl got 13 points and eight rebounds, and senior guard Lindsay Poss notched 10 points and seven rebounds.
Although the Tartans played from behind during much of the game, they were able to pull through and end up on top by a fair margin. “It was really great to come back,” Murphy said after the game. “Coming back shows a lot of mental toughness in the team.” The defensive effort helped keep the deficits to manageable levels before the offense finally got going. “Our defense brought home the win.” Although the Tartans will face their next six opponents on the road, Murphy has confidence that the team will be strong enough to earn a number of wins during the stretch.
The Tartans will next take on Bethany College on Monday.

Just before the season, I picked out four teams I thought might have surprising seasons – two teams whose fortunes might turn from the previous season and two who might make a surprise trip to the Super Bowl. Exactly none of the four predictions panned out. Here I’ll look into what I had wrong and why these predictions didn’t work.
Minnesota Vikings
I had the Minnesota Vikings improving dramatically from last season. However, almost immediately after the writing of that article, the Vikings lost right tackle Phil Loadholdt for the season, making the right side of the offensive line a major weak point heading into the season. Add in quarterback Teddy Bridgewater’s struggles in his second season trying to get the ball downfield combined with a series of receivers who are at their best 15 or more yards down the field, and it’s clear that this offense is a work in progress.
It’s possible the Viking’s defense has also been a key factor in its improvement in record this season, but they’ve struggled against the run and cornerbacks Terrance Newman and Trae Waynes have struggled to lock down number two receivers. Due to cornerback Xavier Rhodes eliminating most number one receivers, that pair has been picked on a lot. The linebacking corps has been excellent, but passes and runs to the outside have caused significant struggles for the second level of this defense. If they can find a cornerback-safety combination on the roster to complement Rhodes and safety Harrison Smith, this could be a top level defense, but in its current form it is definitely beatable.
The Vikings are 8–3 with a surprising lead in the NFC North, but they really have not been close to as good as their record this season. They continuously look unable to move the football and simply eke by bad teams. They were blown out in week one by the San Francisco 49ers, who are football’s worst team. The Vikings should look to use the rest of the season to build an offense more conducive to their quarterback’s talents — namely his pinpoint midrange accuracy and his stunning poise under pressure — to improve down the stretch.
Denver Broncos
This team, like the Vikings, is nowhere near as good as its 9–2 record might suggest. They slipped by in each of their first 6 games, winning by an average of six points and winning only one game by more than seven. They really should have come out of that stretch 3–3 and not 6–0, but those wins are banked. After surprisingly dominating the Packers (who have seen their own struggles since that game), the Broncos offense has ticked up to match their dominant defense. The reasons for the struggles of the offense were largely the scenario laid out in my predictions. The offensive line has meshed terribly and quarterback Peyton Manning is finally too old to play football. However, that defense led by linebacker Von Miller has been so good, they picked up the slack. The Broncos have also replaced Manning with quarterback Brock Osweiler who has been mediocre — a huge improvement over Manning’s disastrous performance. After a referee-provided win against New England, the Broncos now have four wins they have banked despite being thoroughly outplayed by their opposition. However, as the offense improves and the defense continues to destroy hopeless opposing quarterbacks, this team could be a scary sight come the playoffs.
Dallas Cowboys
It’s not too hard to figure out why Dallas went from possible Super Bowl contention to bottom feeder. The prediction was based on the idea that running back DeMarco Murray was not actually that important to this team and the success was due to his offensive line. That turned out to be true as running back Joseph Randle found plenty of success before losing his job to running back Darren McFadden, who also has played very well. However, quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant — both of whom are top three players at their position — have been injured for basically the entire season. Romo clearly had not healed from his broken collarbone before he came back, and now it’s broken again and he is out for the season, while Bryant does not have his usual burst. Without them, the offense has been helpless. The defense has improved, but their improvement from bad to subpar does not make up for the loss of their two best players. Even with a weak NFC East, this depleted Dallas roster won’t sniff the Super Bowl this season.
Indianapolis Colts
The Colts will make the playoffs this year based on their bad division, but they don’t deserve to. Quarterback Andrew Luck has missed lots of time with lacerations to his kidney, but the Colts looked horrible with him on the field. Backup quarterback Matt Hasselback has been okay in Luck’s place, but that’s all. The defensive moves general manager Ryan Grigson made actually worked, and the Colts defense has improved from disastrous last year to being pretty much league average this year.
On the other hand, the offense has been absolutely unable to do anything. The offensive line has been a nightmare and running back Frank Gore subsequently has holes to hit on offense.
Neither Luck nor Hasselback has had any time to throw and have struggled to hit any receivers. With the offense failing completely, an average defense has managed to keep this team hovering at .500, but winning the AFC South is not what the Colts had in mind before this season. 
At 6–5, there is still time for the Colts to right the ship. They have the talent to succeed offensively and make a deep playoff run. However, a season that began with Super Bowl aspirations is likely to end in divisional round as the Colts are steamrolled by a team that actually earned a playoff spot.

Junior Defensive End Brian Khoury sets the edge when it comes to balancing the Carnegie Mellon academic life with football. Khoury has shown confidence in dominating in both fields: taking on the challenges of an electrical and computer engineering (ECE) major and a heavy football practice schedule and coming out on top. This season he was well rewarded, being recognized as the University Athletic Association (UAA) defensive player of the year and an Academic All-American. Perhaps the best reward, however, was helping the Men’s Football team to its first UAA championship in 10 years.
On and off the field, Khoury looks to maintain his successful lifestyle and inspire his teammates and supporters to follow. Courses can frequently get tough, and a huge challenge to managing the football double life requires athletes to push through late nights and practices and stay with it all. 
Khoury speaks to the balance of keeping practices light and fun, while maintaining the focus needed to be successful. “[Y]ou look around you see ... guys pretty tired and you were with them last night at 2, 3 a.m. doing a problem set. And yeah, it’s a tough situation but you just find a way to enjoy it," Khoury said. "Or at least enjoy it until it happens next Thursday when the problem set’s due again." 
With the added workload off the field, keeping a good handle on the situation is key to a well-rounded college experience, both for the team and individually as a student and an athlete.
When away from the team, Khoury balances spending time with teammates, other friends he has through clubs, other sports teams, and classes. Khoury initially competed with Carnegie Mellon Solar Splash racing his freshman year, something that really opened him up to the impact of his work.
“[W]hen we made our boat, we went to Europe — our boat broke down, of course — and we were on the side of this canal in the Netherlands and this whole group of eight to 10 year-old kids came up and they thought we were rock stars.” Although Khoury has participated in Solar Race team and The Tartan Athlete Fellowship clubs in the past, he emphasizes the importance of making sure not to over-extend.
“If you can find something you enjoy and... it’s worth the grind and the process getting there, embrace it; go for it,” he said. Doing what you care about well is not only personally rewarding, as illustrated by Khoury’s experience in the Netherlands, but can be broadly influential both within the team and beyond. Taking care of responsibilities helps Khoury set a good example on the team, as he works with other athletes who have to learn to perform even under difficult conditions, but Khoury’s experience in Europe is informative of the real-world repercussions his work can.
Being on the team is a two-way relationship for Khoury. On top of the contributions he works to make, the team gives Khoury a great support group, with teammates to work with, eat lunch with, and work through injuries with. Being a part of the team, “It helps with girls,” Khoury laughs. But, he explains, the joke isn’t really such a joke at all. He and his teammates do look out for each other and advise each other all the time.
Even during the busiest semesters in ECE, including this one, Khoury can find time to relax with other guys on the team, if only for a meal. Pulling aside for lunch on campus, or if there’s time getting out for the luxury of some good Pittsburgh chicken wings, means that at the busiest times there still is a time to step back and enjoy the situation.
Not that homework with teammates isn’t enjoyable. “Guys are giving me a hard time about Oreos," Khoury said. "They were picking on me 'cause I said Oreos weren’t that good. They’re okay but they’re like the Notre Dame of snack cookies. They’re decent but they’re overrated.” Sometimes, doing homework on a Thursday night can leave anyone a target for getting a little too comfortable in his or her shoes.
So what has changed for the football team this season? Khoury explains how the excitement and the confidence built up this season after each next win and brought out a team that could control the tension between excitement with where the team was and the need for focus on the task at hand. While they made the best of the ride, guys on the roster stepped up in their roles and played their play week to week to help get Carnegie Mellon on top.
During the week, it’s always a goal for the team to keep practices consistent, but the energy definitely showed up. Khoury commends the team for the discipline they had early in the season, pulling their situation together after a 1–3 start and staying away from any internal struggles. Instead of pointing fingers, players stayed on top of their own game contributions and got the team into the win column, and kept them there.
Khoury gets back in action next fall with the start of the Tartan’s title defense, but for now, he’ll put in the work everyday that gets him ready to play at a high level.

As we all know, my loyalty to my favorite player is as fickle as fantasy football itself. And as much as I loved Jeremy Langford two weeks ago, his moment in the limelight is over. He still scored nine points in week 11 and 10 points on the Thanksgiving Day return of Matt Forte. While that's not nothing, it's much less than the 29 points that made me fall in love with Langford, that big teddy bear. (Get it? Bear?)
The real star of my heart right now is Russell Wilson. In week 11, he had his first three-touchdown game of the season and threw for 260 yards. This all amounted to a 25-point week, his best of the season. I still lost to Team "the bo jacks" 69–62. So that was pretty funny.
Week 12 was very interesting. Seattle Seahawks versus Pittsburgh Steelers. Team Ya Gurl Gutie versus team Bofa Deez Nuts. Russell Wilson versus Ben Roethlisberger. And as fate and luck would have it, the Seahawks, Ya Gurl Gutie, and Russell Wilson came out on top. Roethlisberger may have scored 21 points, not bad, but my best friend and the love of my life Russell Wilson put up 34 points. Wilson actually scored a career-high five touchdowns. His spectacular game catapulted me and my team to the victory of Bofa Deez Nuts, 82–69.
This week, he's got a pretty tough match-up against the Vikings — ranked sixth in points allowed to opposing quarterbacks — which has undermined my confidence a little bit. My backup quarterback Matt Cassel also seems like a solid choice now that Tony Romo is out. I do worry that the Cowboys could have an awesome week, resulting in a disappointing bench-player-outscoring-starter mishap. But Wilson is on a roll. For now, I'll have to stay loyal — but just this once.
I also feel the need to send some love Eric Decker's way. So far this season he's scored a touchdown in eight out of his ten starts, and six of those have been double-digit performances. I was wary about him for a little while because he's had a knee injury since week three, but in spite of that he's continued to surprise and impress me. Decker has consistently carried my team, and for that I am forever grateful.
This week is the last regular season matchup before the playoffs. Unfortunately there is just no way I'll make it. Only the top four teams out of the league's 20 will advance, so the odds were difficult to begin with. Team M and "Church League Fistfight!!!" both have 11-1 records, snagging two of the playoff spots, and next in line are the three teams with 8-4 records. This week will decide which two get to advance. Still, I'm pretty proud of my 7–5 record. At least I'll finish the season above .500. And even if I won't win the Shiva, at least I won't win the Sacko.
On another positive note, it looks like I should be able to finish the season off with a victory. My opponent Team Harvey is still starting Joe Flacco, who tore his ACL two weeks ago. I feel pretty confident that I'll have the advantage at quarterback.
However, we are fairly evenly matched in everything else. At running back, I've got the dream team of LeGarette Blount and Jeremy Langford, who both have favorable match-ups. DeMarco Murray and Lamar Miller are better running backs, but they have harder match-ups. Hopefully this will even out the score to keep the deficit minimal.
At wide receiver, we both have one really good player — Decker for me and Jarvis Landry for Harvey — and one less reliable but sometimes awesome player — Dwayne Harris for me, and Devin Funchess for him. If I had known there was a player whose last name is Funchess, I definitely would have tried to draft him, so I'm slightly disappointed in myself. I ended up starting Harris over Pierre Garcon this week because, now that DeSean Jackson is back, Garcon just hasn't been as productive of a player.
I'm also getting the sense that tight ends just never score more than 10 points unless they're Rob Gronkowski. So I've just stopped being concerned about the five points Jared Cook may or may not score. It feels like a waste of my worry.
I do feel good about the D/ST match-up, Jets versus Ravens. ESPN Fantasy called the Raven's pass defense "porous" and while I don't know what that means, it sounds good for me and also makes me giggle. I don't know why. The Jets are facing the Giants in a New York brawl which might not be easy, but at least the Jets aren't porous.
Brandon McManus, who I used to adore, has continued to disappoint me, but I'll direct that blame toward the Broncos. Yet while they have been struggling recently, things could look up this week. They're playing the Chargers who are 3-8 for the season. That bodes well for opportunities for McManus to put up points. Team Harvey's kicker doesn't matter.
All I can do now is pray that he doesn't find a new quarterback by Sunday at 1 p.m., and I should be golden for one last fantasy hurrah.

Creativity is not just for human artists any longer. The first annual Robot Art competition is currently being held, and a team of Carnegie Mellon students are working hard to create a robot with artistic abilities. This international competition, created and sponsored by Andrew Conru, an entrepreneur who founded FriendFinder Networks Inc., has cash prizes of up to $100,000 for the winning team’s institution. But more than that, it is a call for collaboration. 
Through the combined efforts of the participants, Conru hopes that the contest will breed a collaboration between roboticists which will lead to advancements in the artistic capacity of robots. Going further, the Robot Art initiative could perhaps create the opportunity for technology to gain a semblance of humanity. “I want to support education and humanize technology,” Conru said in a press release from Robot Art’s website. “If robots can communicate through artwork that provokes humans to think, feel, and do,” Conru believes that there might be a shift in the public perceptions of robots and artificial intelligence.
The Carnegie Mellon contenders are a team of four: Kim Baraka, a robotics masters student, and Su Baykal, a senior in human-computer interaction and a science and humanities scholar, as well as Yeliz Karadayi and Robert Zacharias, architecture masters students. All four are students of Robotics Institute faculty member Illah Nourbakhsh’s Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) class.
The team first ventured into the world of artistic robotics when they discovered a shared interest in a project connecting robotics and art and naturally began working together within the class. In an interview with The Tartan, Kim Baraka, the group’s leader, said “the course project we came up with involved a study whose aim was to get an understanding of how humans could co-operate with a robot on an artistic task. The [Robot Art] competition was the perfect incentive.” 
After much deliberation, the team developed a haptic feedback system — a touch-sensitive system. The goal of this project was to build a system where both a human and the robot could collaborate using only force feedback. “We thought that was a novel method of collaboration that contrasted with existing computational creativity interfaces,” Baraka said.
When asked about the idea of humanizing technology, Baraka said that it was “a noble cause — difficult to do.” 
Much of the human-robot creative interaction that currently goes on is between the human artist and the robotic medium — such as Adobe’s Photoshop or InDesign, for instance. The human makes all of the choices and does all of the thinking within the constraints of the interface. 
The interface itself has only one role in the creative process: to realize the human artist’s vision. 
Baraka and his team tackled the idea of humanizing their device when it came time to test its collaborative abilities. “We tried to evaluate differences between people who were told that they were collaborating with a computer program controlling the robot and people who were deceived into thinking there was a human controlling the robot in another room.... people had very different perceptions of the experience.”
The idea of perception seems to be integral to the future of more human-like robotics. While there may always be a difference between the organic human and the engineered, what can turn a tool into a collaborator is the perception of agency. If people believe that a robot is working under its own power and making its own decisions, based on some perceived artistic criteria, perhaps the person might view the robot as having a valid aesthetic and being capable of creating something meaningful. 
This goes back to one of the ideas behind artificial intelligence, that in order for something to be intelligent, it should have the ability to create and invent. In terms of speech, this might mean being able to hold its own in a conversation; in terms of art, this might mean painting a piece that makes people stop and think.
“It’s like teaching a walking robot to dance,” Conru said in an interview with The Tartan. 
It’s an exercise in human-robot interactions, in thinking about a robot as not just a tool or a medium, but as something that can inspire and possibly evoke emotion in humans. The Robot Art 2016 initiative has two branches: telerobotics and fully automated robot interfaces. 
Telerobots are systems with which a person may interact in order to, say, paint. Fully automated systems function by themselves. There is great potential in both kinds. Telerobotics have the potential to assist the elderly or sick individuals with certain tasks, and the idea of full automation is very appealing to the idea of robots as agents. 
Ultimately, the Robot Art 2016 competition is proving to be an exciting opportunity to unite great minds for a great purpose.

In the United States alone, there are over one million amputees, people who suffer from some sort of limb loss. One of the most difficult things about making life better for these amputees is developing robust, effective prosthesis technology that can supplant the role of regular human limbs. The intricate locomotion and modalities of muscle movement are complex, and these obstacles pose difficulties for scientists in developing prosthesis equipment.
In effort to abate these difficulties, Steve Collins, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Hartmut Geyer, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, along with a team of researchers, are working to develop innovative prosthesis technology that better addresses current issues facing leg prostheses, such as maintaining balance and the energy cost of walking. 
The team’s new technology centers around modeling the reflexes that control walking via computer simulations, implementing those neuromuscular reflexes into prosthetic legs, and studying how well the prostheses mimic the reflexes. Although these reflexes are very intricate, we are all familiar with them. For example, during a doctor’s visit, when the doctor taps your kneecap, the local reflexes in your leg muscles produce the observed jerking motion.
Understanding these reflexes can lead to solutions for some of the problems amputees have when using prosthesis. For example, balance is currently one of the major issues with leg prostheses. Human limbs’ reflexes can respond to imbalances in terrain. This allows them to adapt their gait while walking to maintain balance. While current prostheses attempt to mimic these reflexes, they lack the technology to properly replicate natural leg motion. 
Geyer and Collins are trying to gain a better understanding of what local reflexes in the leg control balance and how to implement those reflexes into prostheses. 
“Our work is motivated by the idea that if we understand how humans control their limbs, we can use those principles to control robotic limbs,” Geyer said. 
So far, their models have been able to respond to disturbances at the beginning and the end of the prosthesis’s leg-swing. Although these results are promising, Geyer recognizes that there is more to be done, as the model still has issues with leg-swing disturbances.
To supplement this work, Collins is developing prosthetic knee simulator systems, which he calls universal device emulators. These systems are designed to be able to test the output performance of prosthetic limbs based on variations in prosthesis design. The aim in designing these systems is to allow scientists to test variations on what they think are effective prostheses models, and then run experiments to determine the success of the model. 
The systems are also designed to be flexible, so that scientists can quickly and easily tweak parts of the prosthesis and observe how these tweaks affect output. By developing these hardware systems, Collins hopes to deliver better conclusions about what prostheses need, and thus how to better design them.
One of the outcomes Collins hopes to see with these emulators is their application as clinical tools to improve the prescription of prostheses to amputees. Much like optometrists prescribe glasses based on a series of vision tests, Collins believes the same can be done for amputees using these systems “by quickly changing the behavior of the robotic device, thereby quickly optimiz[ing] the prosthesis for each individual patient.” 
Additionally, Collins hopes to use these systems to continue studying and optimizing prostheses so that eventually they can outperform their able-bodied counterparts. The group strives to develop technologies that can supersede current limitations on prosthetic limbs, and it has already experienced some success in this endeavor: “Earlier this year, we developed an exoskeleton that reduces the cost of walking,” Collins said.
Although the focus of these technologies is to develop better prostheses, another goal of Collins and Geyer’s research is implementing the technology into human augmentation. Once the team has developed effective prosthetic models and finalized the universal device emulators, they will hopefully turn to using these technologies to improve physical performance for people without any amputations.
The boundaries of such applications, which could theoretically range from improving military personnel to enhancing athletic activity, provide ample space for imaginative, novel applications.

When an act of terrorism occurs, news of the event spreads quickly through social networks. But sadness and outrage aren’t the only sentiments that get passed along — terrorists themselves also use social networks to bolster their cause. At last week’s Pugwash meeting, we discussed what could be done in response to social technology being used for nefarious purposes.
One of the first points raised was the question of who should be responsible. Is it the duty of companies like Twitter or Facebook to find terrorist content and remove it? Some argued that it’s not the job of private organizations to be deciding what is or isn’t allowable content, but others said that organizations already make moral or political decisions, such as removing barbarity, or making an option to change profile pictures to celebrate gay marriage.
Another concern was that even if regulations were in place and big sites like Twitter and Facebook removed terrorist content, would that even accomplish anything? There will always be more websites willing to host terrorist materials, or sites built by terrorists themselves. Trying to shut down activity on the internet is like trying to use your fingers to plug a leaking dam.
Other Pugwash members wondered if it was really worth the effort to stop tweets or Facebook posts when there are so many other causes that can lead someone to commit terrorist actions. It’s not as if someone wakes up one morning, stumbles across a tweet that says “ISIS is great! Join today!” and makes the decision to become a terrorist. There have to be more factors, and maybe those deserve more attention.
However, just because there are other things that can be done to stop terrorism, doesn’t mean we should ignore the role social networks play. It may seem mundane, but the hubbub over ISIS’s effective use of social media isn’t there for nothing. Maybe someone who isn’t inclined to join won’t ever be persuaded by some tweets, but terrorist groups do inspire and win over the people who feel angry or upset, and need a reason to fight. 
Most of those who join terrorist groups from the United States and other western countries are middle-class, educated individuals that are enamored by radical promises of purpose and glory.
So how can we fight this? One idea was that the United States government should expand their Facebook presence. If social media is an effective tool for ISIS, it can also be an effective tool for our government. If people felt less disenfranchised and more as if they had a meaningful connection to their own government, then maybe they would have less impetus to join terrorist groups.
And while it might be hard to enact this in a meaningful way — there are stories of failed Russian schemes to create fake Facebook accounts that push pro-government opinions on social networks — just engaging more with citizens would make them less likely to defect. When ISIS and other terrorist groups push their ideology, we should provide a more positive alternative.
While this idea sounds practical and effective, it also raised a few concerns. Is fighting fire with fire really a good idea? Pro-government social media accounts could be supporting the same kind of nationalistic fervor and us-versus-them mentality that they’re trying to combat in the first place.
In conclusion, as long as we have the Internet, people will use it to convey terrible messages. ISIS and other terrorist groups’ use of social media is the most recent area of concern. Whether by actively removing terrorists from social networks, undermining other factors that would encourage terrorism, drowning the messages out in opposing ideologies, or some other method, this problem has no easy answers.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on social media and terrorism.

Encryption is the process of converting any text or message into a form that cannot be understood by a person who does not have information regarding how the conversion was made. The non-coded message is called plaintext and the converted message is called cipher text. One can change the cipher text back to plaintext using an algorithm (called the cipher) which gives a certain set of possible values and a key that leads to a specific value when used with the cipher text and the cipher. The key and the cipher contain all the information about the conversion between plaintext and cipher text.
Encryption is a way to hide and transport sensitive information. Credit card numbers for online transactions, social security numbers in employee databases, and other personal and financial information all need to be encrypted.
For example, when making a purchase online, a person types in their credit card details and sends it to the site. While this information is being sent, an attacker could potentially extract that information and use it for nefarious purposes. The point of encryption is to secure the data so that no one can access, understand, or use it besides the person that sends the data and the person that is supposed to receive it.
The best encryption system is one that is unbreakable. However, for practical purposes, quality encryption is one where even if the cipher is known publicly, the message cannot be decoded. Basically, only a person with a key should be able to decrypt the message. Also, the attacker shouldn’t be able to “guess” the key based on a numerical pattern. That is, the algorithm should be good and no one should be able to try all possible key combinations in a feasible amount of time, meaning the key-size should be long.
There are two kinds of commonly used encryption techniques — symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption. Symmetric key encryption is relatively simple: Both the receiver and the sender have a common key that can be used to decode or code the message. In asymmetric key encryption, the receiver has a public key that is visible to anyone who wants to send a message. The sender sends a message using the public key to the receiver. After that, the receiver has a private key that is confidential, which is used to decode the message.
One commonly used symmetric cipher is the American Encryption Standard (AES), originally called the Rijndael after its creators, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. AES rearranges a given message and transforms it in several rounds, using relationships with a key, that are repeated depending on the length of the key. That is, AES with a 128-bit key would undergo 10 repetitions, with each repetition having four rounds. So hypothetically, one can encrypt the message using the key and performing the operations and decrypt it by using the key and performing all those operations backwards.
An example of asymmetric encryption is the RSA algorithm, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adelman. The RSA algorithm involves the use of prime numbers and the prime factoring problem. Again, broadly speaking, the algorithm depends on the product and factorization of two arbitrary, very large prime numbers, for example those with over 100 digits. The fact that there currently exists no efficient algorithm in the world to factor a number forms the basis of this system. In this case, the two prime numbers are kept confidential and their product is published as the public key, along with an exponent that plays a major role in converting the message. The private key comprises a different exponent and the product of the prime factors, which is used to convert the cipher text to plain text.
These are only a few of the encryption methods currently in use. Research is being done on other approaches to encryption such as “honey encryption,” where incorrect attempts to break the cipher produce data that seems right but isn’t; “functional encryption,” where the key reveals only a certain aspect of data that the sender wishes to share; and “quantum key encryption,” which uses the quantum properties of atoms to encrypt data. 
Each of these systems, and others that are being produced, will hopefully provide new methods of encryption that will give users even better security in the future.

Glow-in-the-dark solid form of carbon discovered
Last Wednesday, materials scientists Jagdish Narayan and Anagh Bhaumik from North Carolina State University in Raleigh reported on a new solid form of carbon in the Journal of Applied Physics. This new carbon, called Q-Carbon, glows in the dark, is magnetic, and is tougher than diamond, another solid form of carbon.
“Q-carbon’s unusual properties make it ideal for all sorts of applications, from electronic displays to abrasive coatings on tools to biomedical sensors that are compatible with the body” Narayan said. One of Q-carbon’s most exciting features is its magnetism, since no other form of carbon is magnetic.
Narayan and Bhaumik created Q-carbon with a laser heating technique, using a high-powered laser beam to hit a carbon pellet and spread the carbon thinly onto a flat sheet of sapphire. The carbon was then melted and cooled rapidly to transform it into a new material. In Q-carbon, the carbon tetrahedral structures are all jumbled up instead of forming neat lattices, as is the case in diamonds. Because of their similar structure, the researchers can convert Q-carbon to diamond at standard temperature and pressure by providing the seeds for crystal growth.

Magnetic fields at Milky Way’s black hole found
Researchers have recently detected magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of Sagittarius A-star (Sgr A*), the black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. “These magnetic fields have been predicted to exist, but no one has seen them before. Our data puts decades of theoretical work on solid observational ground,” said principal investigator Shep Doeleman from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and MIT’s Haystack Observatory.
The magnetic fields were discovered using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a global network of radio telescopes that link together to function as one world-wide telescope. With the EHT, the researchers observed that light is linearly polarized near the event horizon and, since polarized light is emitted by electrons spinning around magnetic fields, the light directly traces the magnetic field structure of Sgr A*.
“With this result, the EHT team is one step closer to solving a central paradox in astronomy: why are black holes so bright?” Doeleman said. The results have been reported in the journal Science.

International panel approves human gene editing
During an international summit on Dec. 3, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the United Kingdom’s Royal Society convened to discuss the ethical, legal, and regulatory consequences of gene-editing. The scientists concluded that human gene-editing research could begin so long as no pregnancies result.
Gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 have become very cheap and easy to use, and may be useful in correcting genetic diseases. On December 1, Sangamo BioSciences, a biopharmaceutical company, announced that clinical trials to replace a broken gene in adult hemophiliacs using gene editing could begin next year, which would fall under current regulations for gene therapy.
The catch is that no pregnancies can result from gene editing research, and the committee said it would be “irresponsible” to proceed with human studies in germline cells. “As long as those cells are not implanted into a woman to create a baby, it is not germline editing,” said committee chairman David Baltimore, a 1975 Nobel Laureate.

Archaeologists explore intact Etruscan tomb
While working in a field of Città della Pieve, a small town about 30 miles southwest of Perugia, a farmer discovered a rare and undisturbed Etruscan burial site that was dated to approximately 300 B.C.E.
The Etruscan people were a civilization that dominated Italy from 900 to 400 B.C.E. and was eventually absorbed into the roman empire.
The Etruscans were known for their art, agriculture, fine metalworking, and commerce. Some of their influences include introducing wine-making to the French, teaching the Romans how to build roads, and introducing writing into Europe. However, the Etruscan culture had always been a mystery due to a lack of records documenting their society. 
After archaeologists came and opened the tomb, which was dated from the fourth century, the team found two sarcophagi, as well as other artifacts, within a 16 square-foot chamber. One of the sarcophagi contained the tomb of a male, thought to be named Lars. The researchers anticipate that the discovery will allow them to learn more about the world’s most mysterious ancient cultures.

Scientists study reactions in solar energy storage
Researchers at the University of Oregon have developed a new method to study the reactions that occur as water-splitting cells produce fuel from absorbing sunlight. Particularly, the group had found a way to study the exchange of electrons at the interface of two cells. One of the cells was a semiconductor that generated electrons after capturing sunlight, while the other cell was a catalyst that produces fuel out of those electrons.
In their experiment, the researchers coated an electrically charged titanium dioxide electrode with different films of catalyst. They then monitored the accumulation of charge and change in voltage on the catalyst. 
From their results, the scientists found that more energy was derived from the interfaces of catalysts that were permeable to ions, which are charged atoms or molecules. While the system from the experiment was not the most efficient, the group’s study may contribute to the design of more effective semiconductor-catalyst devices. The research has been published in ChemSusChem, a journal that covers research in sustainable chemistry.

Samsung to pay Apple to settle patent dispute
Last Thursday, papers sent to a California court indicated Samsung’s agreement to pay Apple $514 million, which will settle a patent dispute between the two companies. A statement declared that the payment would take place within 10 days after an invoice was received.
This agreement is part of a larger $1 billion lawsuit filed in 2012 which claimed that Samsung’s copyright infringements on Apple’s patented technology. For example, one of the patents that Apple brought to court included the “pinch to zoom” feature on smartphones, a case that was later invalidated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). 
Shortly afterward, Samsung also attempted to bring the case to the US appeals court, but the company was then denied the opportunity. Despite the settlement, the dispute between the two companies will continue to drag on, as the USTPO continues to review the validity of some of Apple’s patents, and as Samsung intends to file new appeals.

Hey, Josh!
I have a bit of a problem. My girlfriend of two years broke up with me recently because, among other things, she didn't like how much of a dreamer I am. I'll admit, my head is in the clouds, but I never thought that it was a bad thing until now. Nowadays, I think that I have displaced all of my emotions onto someone else, and this crush — if you can call it that — has built this person up such that the reality isn't even close to the picture in my head. She is intelligent and successful and someone whom I admire very much. I can very plainly see that this person doesn't like me, but in my mind, I can't stop thinking about how good we'd be together, and how much I really wish that she liked me in return. I'm also aware that the version of her I like is not the version that exists in the world — I have built the idea of her up so much that it's unrealistic, and that's my problem. I know in my head that this will most likely never work, but there is always that hope; and every time I convince myself that I am over it, that it was not a good idea, I see her somewhere, in line at Entropy, or around Baker, and my old crushy feelings come roaring back. What do I do? How do I ground myself back into reality and stop all of this blushing and stammering and dreaming? How do I get my feet back on the ground?
Signed,
Putting Up with Disastrous Dreams of Intimacy, Nausea, and Giggles.
Dear PUDDING,
First of all, I'm very sorry about the breakup. Secondly, I want to make it clear that being a dreamer and an idealist are not bad character traits, nor anything to be ashamed of. Unfortunately, there really isn't a way to just logically stop all of these feelings. Your best bet is to either avoid her entirely or to actually get to know her. In one scenario, you might forget about her and have a clean break, and in the other, there are two options: Either you both hit it off and have a grand old life, or you begin to see the disconnect between the version of this person that you're so attracted to, and you realize the difference between what she is (the reality) and what you want her to be (your concept of her). The blushing and stammering and dreaming are all par for the course, but the best thing you can do for yourself is either let this crush die of natural causes and take some time to heal, or to pursue it and see what happens. 
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown

I grew up in a household that was particular about when and where holiday music could be played: from after Thanksgiving Day to Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Because of this, I am always excited about the season in which I can listen to some of my favorite carols and holiday tunes without being scorned by my parents. Each holiday album and song reminds me of December memories throughout the years, and gives me that semi-awkward wistful look that always looks beautiful in movies, but is weird to see on people’s faces in real life.
Here are some of my favorite things to listen to on the days when the days are short and all you want to do is drink your weight in hot cocoa, snuggle, watch Love Actually multiple times, and eat mashed potatoes at any given opportunity.
Pentatonix’s That’s Christmas To Me
It could be my enduring love for Kevin Olusola, this a cappella group’s beatboxer, but 2014’s best-selling Christmas album was super popular for a reason. As much as I love solo renditions of the classics, the small chamber vocal arrangements on this album are refreshing to the ears. Having been used to choral arrangements of church carols, and the mellow timbre of the likes of Michael Bublé for the poppier tunes, Pentatonix offers an interesting halfway point between the two common types. I love their “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” and their “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy,” but they also have a mushy gushy original tune, “That’s Christmas To Me,” which I love.
Last year my parents bought me the album as an early Christmas present, and also to fuel my — and their — obsession with Kevin Olusola. We listened to it multiple times on our annual cross country car trip to my grandparents’ house. If you didn’t have the chance to hear this last year, or weren’t paying attention as it played constantly in the background during long Barnes & Noble shopping trips, it is totally worth rocking out to this year.
A Taste of Chanukah
I listen to this album once a year. Growing up as a demi-Jew (half-Jewish), my winter holidays tend to be an amalgamation of the two holidays. One of my favorite traditions in my family is listening to this variety album of Chanukah tunes while decorating the family Christmas tree, complete with the Star of David perched on the top. Being a Boston native as well, this Boston-centric album is a wonderful taste — no pun intended — of various Chanukah traditions. Featuring ensembles from New England Conservatory and around Boston, songs are sung in various languages with different styles and vibes. The album opens with “Oy Chanukah,” an English and Yiddish take on the classic. Throughout the album there are more classic songs, like “Ikh Bin a Kleyner Dreydl,” (a German variant of “I have a little dreydl”), as well as psalms, and a comedic latke cooking demonstration. Chanukah is the celebration of a miracle, and the comic energy and general lightheartedness make this album a great addition to the holiday celebrations.
Josh Groban’s Noël
Josh Groban has the wonderful talent of being at once humorous, and also soothing. Though by no means a favorite singer of mine, Josh Groban’s Christmas album Noël is a great sing-along opportunity, if you are into belting loudly and dramatically with friends and family. To me, singing carols and other songs with friends is a wonderful and relaxing way to spend an evening, particularly if you’re stuck together in a small space — a car for instance — traversing slowly through a semi-scary snow storm and trying very hard not to skid on the ice. Be very careful though, as it is important to pay attention to others in the car when engaging in a sing-a-long, because there is nothing less fun than being stuck in a place where there is a sing-a-long happening that you are not into. And Christmas is no time to start fights.
Ella Fitzgerald’s Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas
One of the great vocalists of her time, this album from 1960 is still one of my favorite holiday music choices. Her renditions of songs such as “The Christmas Song” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” add just enough embellishment and jazzy calmness to make them interesting and joy-inducing. I think her voice is extraordinarily beautiful, and I’d basically choose to listen to it all the time, if I could. For whatever the reason, I seem to have a mental block when it comes to memorizing the lyrics to multiple verses of Christmas carols, whereas I can unwillingly recite all the lyrics to Katy Perry’s “Firework.” Fitzgerald’s album is a great place to re-learn some of those words you forgot, so you don’t embarrass yourself in front of all your cousins when you gather ‘round the piano’ later.
Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You”
To be honest, I’ve never listened to the album that this classic holiday song came off of in 1994. It’s called Merry Christmas, and I’m going to try to make a point of listening to it over break this year. However, almost everyone loves this song. In high school, my friend David Julien listened to this song every day starting from the beginning of October until March, conservatively, which was pretty weird. But because of that, this song makes me quite nostalgic and is also a good song to dance to. I personally don’t find this song amazing, but it just wouldn’t be Christmas without Mariah Carey crooning in the back of my mind.
Regardless of what you choose to listen to this Christmas, I hope that the holidays are very fun. For those who prefer instrumental Christmas music, there is a wealth of beautiful options. If you prefer to listen to get your holiday groove on to the impassioned and tortured vocals of Three Days Grace or Green Day, feel free, as long as you are happy.

It seems like just yesterday a young Canadian boy from YouTube was telling us one time that we were the girl of his prepubescent dreams. A lot of time has passed since then, and we’ve watched Justin Bieber go from a kid in a purple hoodie with hair in his eyes to kind of a tool. From getting arrested for a DUI to leaving a monkey in another country, J-Biebs seems to have done it all. Just when it seemed like things couldn’t get any better for the singer, he made a turnaround reminiscent of Britney Spears circa 2007 following his roast on Comedy Central. He apologized for acting like such a brat, but who could blame the guy? He’d been thrown into the spotlight at a young age and if you’ve ever seen his father’s Twitter, you know he doesn’t have the best role models around. However what’s even more exciting than his becoming less of a jerk is his change in musical style.
Since singing Chris Brown songs on YouTube, Justin Bieber has always been influenced by hip hop and R&B. However he was instantly launched into the spotlight as a young pop star that young girls were literally selling their virginities to meet. Anyone over the age of sixteen didn’t even bother giving him the time of day, aside from maybe humming his mainstream songs because they were always on. I personally was an ardent Jonas Brothers fan and because I only had room in my heart for one J.B., I never really could get into his music. However, when he came out with his song “Boyfriend,” I saw a glimpse of something unexpected from him. I saw a glimpse of the Justin Bieber of today.
I was still in denial and naively waiting for the day that the Jonas Brothers would get back together that fateful day in 2012 when I first heard “Boyfriend” and thus I paid it and the rest of the Believe album no mind. When I heard “Where Are Ü Now” I knew that I could no longer ignore this new sound Justin Bieber had. I found myself actively listening to this song all the time. I actually felt bad for Justin Bieber that this person was not there when he needed them! Dare I say I was becoming a fan? As a hardcore fan girl in my youth, I knew that these were early onset signs for becoming a Belieber. I continued to push these thoughts out of my mind and told myself that I liked “Where Are Ü Now” because of Skrillex, but when I heard “What Do You Mean?” I could no longer blame anyone else for my love of this song. I had to come to terms with the fact that while Justin was making this effort to include more R&B stylings and synthesized music, I was turning into a Belieber.
Following the release of this song, I was wowed once again with “Sorry,” an anthem about how your ex actually misses you for your personality and not just for the sex. As much as I believe that every line of that song is entirely full of crap, the music is great and his vocals are even better. His song “Love Yourself” is a brutally honest jam about his dating someone who’s so vain, but only realizing it in hindsight even though he should have known the moment his mom said she didn’t like her. This song leaves me dying to know if it’s actually about Selena Gomez, and if so, why he dated her for so long. As if those songs weren’t enough, his latest single “I’ll Show You” has put my socks back on and blown them off again. Bieber sings about how it’s not easy being in the spotlight and even though the pressure makes it hard for him to always do the right thing, he plans on showing us the real Justin Bieber. If the real Justin Bieber keeps making this kind of music, I’ll be entering 2016 as a Belieber.
Justin Bieber has been on a steady incline following a very sharp decline. While he’s still not perfect as a person, his music has shown a whole new side of him that has never before been seen. His current music is so honest as opposed to all of the cookie-cutter pop songs he previously released. His music reflects real relationships and feelings as opposed to just being about nothing. I never thought that “Bieber Fever” could happen to me. I thought I followed all the precautions to make sure that I never caught it, but it came out of nowhere. Justin Bieber, after all these years, you may have finally made me one less lonely girl.

I chose to study abroad at the Carnegie Mellon equivalent school in London: an all science, technical university called Imperial College London, where at a 70:30 male to female gender ratio, the odds are still good and the goods are still odd. Unlike most study abroad programs, I will be in London for the entire school year and taking classes for my primary major for the duration of my stay.
Upon first arriving in London, I quickly became aware of the “vacation changes.” These are what I like to consider to be the differences between the UK and US that anybody going to London on vacation will notice. For example, almost getting hit by a black cab because you looked the wrong way before crossing the street or the fact that British people don’t say vacation, they say “holiday.” At first, these differences really stressed me out (I have an irrational fear of being hit by a car), but now, three months later, all of this has become a part of my daily life. People no longer need to translate for me when there’s a British word I don’t understand. In fact, I now use some of these foreign sayings myself.
At Carnegie Mellon, I was in a sorority and Mock Trial, was working a part time job, and had to keep up with classes for a double major in chemical engineering and engineering & public policy. Here in London, I only have chemical engineering courses. I have an average of three hours of class per weekday. We do not have any graded problem sets or midterms. There is only one final exam for each of our courses in June. I cannot remember the last time in my life that I have been so stress-free.
I spend my time doing the things I wish I could have done last year, but never had time for. I walk down to Pret-A-Manger, London’s Starbucks equivalent, for a coffee. I run through Hyde Park on the daily, which actually is an incredible experience in itself. My usual route takes me around the famous Serpentine River and then past Kensington Palace, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge reside. I am lucky, because I am located just south of Hyde Park, and right next door to the Royal Albert Hall, where events such as the world premiere of the new James Bond movie occur. All I have to do is peek out my window and watch the movie stars walk down the red carpet right below me.
London is probably the most expensive place I have ever been. One pound is equivalent to approximately one-and-a-half dollars and I spend about three times more per week than I did in Pittsburgh (to be fair, I am overspending). I’m constantly tempted by the styles and clothes that people wear here and have Harrod’s and great shopping right down the road from me. I have to cook for myself here (after being on Red-9 for two years) and have found myself copying the first-year students on my floor for dinner ideas. I am the only third year on my floor, but it seems as though the first years that I live with are just as mature as I am. I believe that it partially has something to do with the drinking age being 18 in this country. Drinking is much more casual and accepted here. The dorm I live in has its own bar downstairs that our university sponsors. Our hall sponsored events typically involve drinking. It’s very strange for me that we are encouraged to be drinking in our first-year dorms together.
Something I will always be grateful to Carnegie Mellon for is its diversity. Last year, I made friends with a study abroad student at Carnegie Mellon from Switzerland. This semester, during a long weekend, I was able to visit him and get to explore the Swiss Alps and eat endless Swiss cheese and chocolate. Traveling is one of the best parts of getting to study abroad, and knowing someone from the place you are going makes the experience so much better. So far, I have visited Geneva and Edinburgh and will be going to Berlin soon. Traveling around Europe, even by plane, is extremely cheap, and has made this experience so memorable.
It’s now the end of the first semester, and I am so glad that I will be here until the end of June. I have been here for three months already ­­— the time has flown by. I have grown to love this city and all it has to offer. The crowded tube stations during rush hour, the women dressed in Topshop from head to toe, and for now, the Christmas lights on every street market across the city. This school year, so far, has been so different on so many levels and I can’t wait to see what next semester has in store for me.

Two years after dropping his first independent album, rapper G-Eazy sold out his first solo show in 2014. Following this skyrocket to fame was his second album, These Things Happen, which exuded Bay Area pride and deliberated on his newfound recognition. The album, which remained at the top of charts for a full year, featured top hits such as “I Mean It” and “Almost Famous” which highlight G-Eazy’s reservations about how long he will be able to hold onto the spotlight. Will he stay relevant? Can he handle a solo tour and make a name for himself? The open-ended set up and introspective vibe of this second album laid out a solid platform on which a highly anticipated follow-up album, with the answer to all of these questions, could be built.
When It’s Dark Out, G-Eazy’s third album, does not disappoint. The album, which dropped last Thursday, is very much a continuation of G-Eazy’s musings about his newly acquired fame and fortune. The featured artist line-up for When It’s Dark Out, though lengthy, is arguably much better than previous albums. The album features Big Sean, Chris Brown, Tory Lanez, Keyshia Cole, and E-40, to name a few.
The album’s intro track samples a beat used several times throughout this album and These Things Happen, which creates a nice cohesion between his past albums and the songs on this particular album. The intro track features G-Eazy singing the words to the poem “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night” by Dylan Thomas. The seriousness and almost eerie vibe of the intro sets the stage for a more serious album.
The first song, “Random,” previously released as a single, has a classic G-Eazy vibe — medium paced rapping with the occasional, frustrated yelling, and a mildly to severely cocky demeanor. Although the featured artists on the album are quite good, it was nice to see G-Eazy start off the album with a statement song that was true to his style and featured his voice alone. The slightly boastful “Random” highlights the hard work that G-Eazy has put into his success thus far in his career, and focuses specifically on how recent events and efforts have pushed him into the spotlight.
“Me, Myself, & I,” the third song on the album, gives us a meditative look at G-Eazy’s success. The premise of the song is plain and simple: Would his friends really be here if he weren’t famous? This theme is seen throughout the album, especially on songs “Sad Boy,” “Don’t Let Me Go,” and “For This.” These themes highlight G-Eazy’s struggle between loving fame and wanting to be surrounded by people who love more than just his success.
Within the next two or three songs, you can really start to see that this album is going to be more personal than his previous two. “Drifting,” an R&B crossover track featuring Tory Lanez and Chris Brown, talks about G-Eazy’s simultaneous drift toward fame and away from the woman he loves. This is another reoccurring theme in the album — G-Eazy is surrounded by beautiful women because of this fame and success, but none of them is who he really wants. The mixing of an almost confused, pondering G-Eazy with this classic cocky rap style creates a dynamic and quite enjoyable album. It’s almost like G-Eazy was in the middle free styling, took a step back and asked himself, “Is this really who I am now?”
The song “Sad Boy” is a perfect example of this confused side of G-Eazy. During the song, he is asking himself why he is unhappy, even though he is living a lavish lifestyle which many envy. This song undeniably signals a transition in the mood of the album. If you came to When It’s Dark Out in the search of feel-good, hyped up vibes similar to recent releases like “Forbes” and “I Mean It,” then you’re definitely going to want to stay within the first half of the album.
The latter half of the album features some really personal moments for G-Eazy about love, family, fame, and the sheer act of balancing it all without losing himself. In “Think About You,” he talks about the inner conflict of deciding whether or not to reach out to a lost love. He doesn’t want to hurt her by reaching out and opening up old wounds, but the last things he wants to do is hurt her by ignoring her. In “Everything Will Be OK,” featuring R&B and hip-hip singer-songwriter Kehlani Parrish, we see a vibe from G-Eazy that is more personal, in which he discusses not only this lost love, but the love lost between his parents. The song is five minutes of chills and pure heartache, but you simply can’t turn it off.
The honesty and reality of this album is refreshingly deep. Many of the songs on When It’s Dark Out are far more relatable than his popular singles about making it big, selling out shows in Europe, and buying Lamborghinis. The album show a more mature, confident rapper. Songs “Nothing To Me” and “For This” show a side of G-Eazy that is far less concerned with abiding by mainstream rap and the opinions of others, and far more concerned with telling a powerful story through quality music.
Even though the album does feature a mellower, more personal touch, G-Eazy fans can rest assured that the rapper’s classic boastful rapping style still has a strong presence, most notably in “You Got Me,” a song previously released as a single, and “One Of Them,” which essentially outlines a list of things that G-Eazy would like — or perhaps is demanding — one of.
All things considered, When It’s Dark Out is a quality album. G-Eazy stayed true to himself, while still managing to successfully create a strong dynamic between someone who is both confident and confused. Although some of the featured artists seem to be an odd combination with the rapper, and the quantity of artists featured on the album seems a bit excessive, most of the songs were good, many of them great, and a few were, in my opinion, fantastic. The contemplative vibe from his second album remains strong in the third album, and the listener still ends with the same, persistent question: “Where does G-Eazy go from here?”

I walked through the door to Wigle Whiskey for their holiday bitters demo with a couple misconceptions. First, I thought I was about to get free drinks, yet I had to pay a reasonable six dollars for the most delicious whiskey cocktail I’ve ever imagined (The Burgundy: white wheat whiskey, apple cider, cranberry tea, and mulberry spice syrup, with a dusting of cinnamon on the surface). And second, I thought bitters were only for drinks. Demo leader and head of bitters distribution for Wigle Allison Burns proved me oh so wrong.
Allison stood behind her table, full of crackers, cheese, yogurt, soup, and bitters. She shouted “Remove bitters from your bar cart!” to anyone that asked. “It’s an extension of your spice rack!” My small mind couldn’t handle this rupture in reality. Prior to this life-changing experience, the only ideas I had about bitters were of that Angostura bottle with the confusing paper that doesn’t actually fit, and classic cocktails like an Old Fashioned or a Manhattan. But then I realized what a bitters is, and it’s really nothing more than an extract: botanicals soaked in alcohol for a long time that becomes a super concentrated flavor bomb. You just have to know how to use it.
The recommendations that Allison had laid out for us on the table were a really exciting sneak peek into the potential of bitters as an ingredient. The first taste I got of it all was just an amped up cheese and crackers, which she recommended as a snack to leave out for guests at a party. It was simply crackers and slices of brie, but then she had mixed up honey with bitters to drizzle on top. Even better, there were two options: honey with pomander orange bitters, and honey with rosemary lavender bitters. Both were great, but I personally loved the pomander orange. Brie and fruit are just so perfect together.
Next to that was maple-flavored Greek yogurt with mole bitters, which is inspired by a Mexican sauce which is both spicy and chocolaty — the stuff of dreams. The flavor combination was intensely good. The smoky sweet maple flavor really hits it off with the spicy dark bitter flavor. I could imagine this as just breakfast, or even a dip for some crunchy gingersnaps. Allison also shared that for Thanksgiving she used the mole bitters on top of her pumpkin pie, and every morning she throws a little splash in her coffee. Both had me very tempted to buy a bottle.
But the true treasure of the evening was the squash soup featuring the classic aromatic bitters. For the penny-pinchers, unmotivated folks, or unskilled chefs, you can do this with any store-bought boxed soup and a couple tablespoons of bitters. But if you’re the from-scratch type, here’s some good news. Allison was giving out recipes.
Squash and Bitters Soup
1 3-pound squash, kabocha, butternut, or pumpkin
2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
2 large leeks, while and pale green parts only, finely chopped
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 quart of chicken stock
2 cups of water
2 tablespoons of aromatic bitters, Wigle variety recommended
2 tablespoons of light brown sugar
1 teaspoons of sea salt
3/4 teaspoon of black pepper
1/3 cup of heavy cream
Start out by peeling the squash, removing all the seeds, and chopping it into 2-inch cubes.
Then in a big heavy pot, melt the butter over medium heat. This will become the tasty bubble bath for the leeks and garlic. Let them simmer and stir occasionally until the leeks are translucent, which should take about six minutes. Next up is everything but the cream. Cook it all uncovered until the squash is tender. Somewhere around 25 minutes later, pour the pre-soup chunky medley into a blender in batches.
This serves eight, so when you make this for your next fancy friend dinner party or to impress your family over break, give your guests options. I recommend putting the heavy cream in a gravy-boat-type pouring container, alongside some extra salt, pepper, and bitters. Let everyone have their soup perfectly to their taste. I would also add some spice to the soup, like nutmeg or cinnamon, but sparingly of course so you don’t overwhelm the squash.
Allison said that the beauty of bitters is that it brings out the sweetness around it, and this rang the truest to me in this soup. It’s so creamy, sweet, and seasonal. Then that little hit of bitter on the back of your tongue reminds to appreciate the slight sweetness.
But since I would also like to throw in a nod to tradition, and no meal is complete without a cocktail, I must include Wigle’s recipe for an Old Fashioned.
Old Fashioned
2 ounces of wheat whiskey
1 sugar cube
2 dashes of pomander orange bitter (which was my hands-down favorite)
1 piece of orange peel
Muddle the sugar cube with the bitters to dissolve it. Then add the whiskey and stir it up. Because you’re fancy, finish it off with a little twist of orange peel. Bottoms up, friends.

Universal Studios in talks with Tom Cruise for The Mummy reboot
On Nov. 23, it was reported that Universal Studios’ upcoming “Monsters Universe” was putting its pieces on the board with a selection of writers developing production strategy for reboots of the studio’s classic films. A reboot of The Mummy will be the first to emerge from the pack, and the studio is eyeing A-list action star Tom Cruise to play a leading role. Though this does not come as a shock, casting Cruise would be a home run choice for Universal. Cruise is one of the few true “action stars” remaining (along with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Vin Diesel, and Jason Statham) but he brings an additional level of acting talent that most others attempt to imitate. Cruise has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has been cranking out action hit after action hit in the past few years. The Mission: Impossible series just saw another success with Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Edge Of Tomorrow was one of 2014’s most pleasant surprises, and Cruise is currently filming the sequel to Jack Reacher, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. The deal between Cruise and Universal is not finalized yet (at least, not publicly) but adding his caliber of talent would only increase the value of the new shared “Monsters Universe.” The Mummy is set for release in March 2017.
Steven Spielberg comments on recasting Indiana Jones
Recasting roles is not a new phenomenon in Hollywood, especially iconic roles. Seven different actors have played James Bond since the early 1960s. We are about to meet our third Spider-Man since 2002 with Tom Holland. The first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was released in 1982 and was quickly followed by two more films and a third in 2008. Steven Spielberg, director of all four Indiana Jones films, has been hearing all the chatter about recasting the role with the likes of Chris Pratt or Bradley Cooper. As far as Spielberg is concerned, Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford and Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones.
“I don’t think anyone could replace Harrison as Jones, I don’t think that’s ever going to happen,” Spielberg said in an interview with Screen International. “It’s certainly not my intention to ever have another actor step into his shoes in the way there have been many actors that have played Spider-Man or Batman. There is only going to be one actor playing Indiana Jones and that’s Harrison Ford.”
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm and producing partner with Spielberg, has confirmed a fifth film is on their radar, but has no timetable for production or release. There is no denying Spielberg’s power in Hollywood, and the exponential growth of that power when discussing a film series he is synonymous with building into the cinematic juggernaut it became. Personally, I think recasting the character would offer more opportunities for the survival of Indy. Obviously, should Harrison Ford return to the character, I would be first in line at the theater, but considering Ford is entering his mid-70s, I am willing to put the character and the story in front of the man. Harrison Ford brought Indy to life and I’ll always be able to go back and watch The Temple of Doom whenever I need a dose of Harrison charm, but recasting the character would give Lucasfilm the freedom to think long-term about the franchise and develop any of the numerous stories that have been formed around the character. The creative team behind Indy is the same team behind Star Wars, but the franchises are very different. Indiana Jones needs a refreshing start to attract new audiences, especially in international markets, and attaching a new face may be just what the doctor ordered.
Universal Studios eyeing Ryan Gosling for Neil Armstrong biopic
Based on the James Hansen novel “First Man: A Life of Neil A. Armstrong” Universal Studios is looking to secure The Notebook star Ryan Gosling to star as the famous astronaut in the upcoming biopic aptly titled First Man. Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) is attached to direct, and this would not be the first time Gosling and Chazelle would work together. The two are currently filming La La Land, a musical starring Gosling as a jazz pianist who falls in love with an aspiring actress played by Emma Stone. Chazelle made his directorial feature film debut with Whiplash and directed J.K. Simmons to an Academy Award win, so his ability to draw out amazing performances is tested and proven.
The “Space Race,” as it was called, is an extraordinary time in American history and Armstrong made world history in 1969. Nearing the 50th anniversary would be a real treat to learn about the man’s story and re-experience the magic that space travel offers. As far as Gosling is concerned, La La Land is still shooting, and he is slated to star in the sequel to Blade Runner. That film begins production next summer, and First Man would likely follow. Gosling can be seen in The Big Short, hitting theaters December 11, 2015, and in La La Land, which is set for release on July 16, 2016.

If you think that “French v. Hong Kong New Wave” sounds inaccessible and pretentious, you’re right. Even so, I was compelled by my love of film and French to leave my warm dorm room for the chilly streets of Lawrenceville Friday night. Full disclosure, I could only sit through one of Row House cinema’s four screenings of both French and Hong Kong new wave films. Don’t get me wrong; the theater was lovely, clean, and entirely functional. The film, however, was hard to get through (potentially due to my underdeveloped film knowledge — pun intended).
I’m pretty clueless when it comes to film-making and film history, so here’s the relatively minimal context I learned for this film screening: New Wave is a film movement that is characterized by significant innovations to the medium (like location shooting) as well as a uniquely socially conscious voice centered around cultural and political issues of the time. French New Wave is attributed to filmmakers of the 1950s and ‘60s who were moving away from the mainstream period pieces largely written by French novelists. Row House showed Made in the U.S.A. and Le Cercle Rouge to illustrate the work of this movement. Similarly, Hong Kong New Wave sought to upend the status quo by creating grittier, rougher films that were also distinctly Hong Kong. Their films were made in Cantonese, the dialect of most residents, rather than the industry-dominated Mandarin films that were shot by transplanted mainland filmmakers. The spirit of this movement was shown with the screenings of Fallen Angels and The Killer at Row House. I’m fairly certain that the parallels between the New Wave movement in different countries are vast, complicated, interesting, etc. Unfortunately, I know nothing about them and was drawn to Le Cercle Rouge mainly because of my conversational knowledge of French.
Le Cercle Rouge is about two men and their male friends as they plan and execute an “elaborate” heist. Main characters Corey and Vogel are attractive criminals who are mustachioed and clean-shaven, respectively. Corey is sprung from prison after making a seedy deal with a corrupt prison guard in which he agrees to do one last job. Meanwhile, Vogel escapes from a train bound for an especially secure prison and is now on the run from the French police. From the moment that Vogel dives into Corey’s trunk, the two are fast friends, and begin plotting a good old-fashioned jewelry heist once they get back to Paris. I won’t spoil the ending, because it was pretty unexpected. However, like most of the movie, it was also anti-climactic.
Overall, I had the same general thought as I always do when watching old movies, which is “aww.” It’s usually an, “aww, that’s cute” with mild condescension and apology at the parts that feel obsolete. Still, there are valuable moments of perspective that can be gained from old films. For example, scenes from Vogel’s train escape yield some remarkably beautiful and enlightening images. First, we are shown the open and solitary countryside and forested areas where Vogel has taken shelter, and soon after, this visceral landscape is quickly transformed by the occupation of myriad police officers as they form lines and begin to comb for the fugitive. The once peaceful and isolated hillsides are now swarming with beings, creating an intense atmosphere for the chase. This type of imagery is timeless.
Additionally, although the film takes a general crime drama format, there are many unexpected moments scattered throughout that take a strangely light-hearted tone. For instance, there are two different scenes that depict the uncompromising detective, Mattei, at home, feeding his three cats. The cats are not integral to the plot in any way, so I’m led to believe they are there for comic relief and character development. It’s scenes like this that feel quintessentially “old-fashioned” because they are stripped of every gimmick, reliant on their premise in order to be funny. I appreciate it because it makes me wonder about what was considered funny back in the day and how things have changed. Maybe 45 years ago it was crazily absurd for a full-grown man to go home to an apartment of cats and be so loving towards them. Maybe, it got some belly laughs back then, but this is usually one of the points where I think, “Aww, how cute,” and move on.
Overall, the film was a drag, but the beer selection was great and the seats were decently clean and comfortable. Row House likes to have fun with its audience by discounting ticket prices to patrons that are in costume, and offering a Twilight Zone pinball machine in the lobby. Needless to say I’m excited to go back next week for a series of Miyazaki screenings in full costume. In general, I recommend visiting Row House Cinema on Butler St; just don’t go to see a film that you know nothing about because you’re told that it’s old and important.

Even the journey to Studio 201 seemed perfectly suited to the experience that was Milk Like Sugar, a play about an underprivileged 16-year-old girl who must decide whether to follow through on her friends’ pregnancy pact. When our Lyft dropped us off at a seemingly deserted warehouse, we were near positive the location was wrong and we’d been stranded God knows where. But thankfully, Carnegie Mellon is a master of signs. We followed a trail of logoed arrows, which circled almost 360 degrees around the building and finally arrived at an unassuming door marked “ENTER” in spray-painted letters. This one actually opened, and once inside, we were given our tickets and ushered into the largest, coolest freight elevator I’ve ever seen.
When we joined the half full audience, I felt that we’d stumbled upon a niche experimental theater piece. The set itself was immediately eye-catching. A wall of cardboard Pepsi boxes surrounded several monitors which blasted Nicki Minaj music videos, a sugary yet tooth-rotting pop culture reference that foreshadowed the central metaphor of Milk Like Sugar.
The play, written by Kirsten Greenidge in 2011, is clearly contemporary, riddled with slang-heavy dialogue and perhaps already outdated references to the un-coolness of flip-phones. The plot hearkens back to after-school specials and ABC teen dramas, where the protagonist must rise above her situation and break the cycle of teen motherhood, abusive relationships, and underemployment. I was relieved that  Milk Like Sugar managed to avoid the worst cliches, including — worst of all — an improbably happy ending.
The play could’ve easily fallen flat without junior acting major Daryl Paris Bright’s portrayal of earnest but never pitiful Annie. Junior musical theatre major Lea DiMarchi also shined as Annie’s best friend Talisha, a self-righteous bully in a snapback who turns to well-off older men to distract her from her poor life prospects. Senior acting major Alexandra Miyashiro’s Margie was perhaps the least compelling character, a shallow and clueless lollipop-licking girl who inspires the trio’s pact with her accidental pregnancy.
Annie is at the crossroads of an identity crisis. Talisha and Margie pressure her to go splitsies on a kickass baby shower. Her would-be “baby daddy” Malik, an amateur astronomer endearingly played by junior acting major Siddiq Saunderson, encourages her to follow him to college. Junior musical theatre major Iris Beaumier’s Keera, a wholesome poindexter-type who somehow becomes one of the play’s most interesting characters, preaches about the power of prayer and family game night.
Senior musical theatre major Rayquila Durham also gave a standout performance as Annie’s mother Myrna, a janitor who can barely read but dreams of becoming a writer. Having been a teen mom herself, Myrna works hard to provide for Annie, yet cannot bear the thought of her daughter proving herself to be “better.” Durham makes palpable Myrna’s battle between supporting Annie’s aspirations and shielding herself from the knowledge that a better life is beyond her reach. In one of the show’s most powerful scenes, Myrna rebels against Keera’s religious idealism, demanding to see “the Holy Ghost fry up some chicken” if he wants a prayer of gratitude so badly.
Predictably, Annie’s potential paths for a “better” life go sour. Like clockwork, Annie falls out with every important figure in her life. Instead of adding much depth to the characters, these annoyingly equidistant scenes veered toward melodrama and the “tragic backstory” trope, reiterating the same PSA points until they grew tiresome.
Junior musical theatre major John Clay III played Love Interest #2 Antwoine, a tattoo artist who provides Annie with yet another hard dose of reality along with an unexpected shot of self-worth. Unlike Malik and Keera, Antwoine values Annie for the person she is, not for who he could shape her to be. When he and Annie make love, the distorted videos in the background grow clearer, actually focusing in on our protagonist’s face, and the “Great Wall” of Pepsi crashes down. Annie finds a moment of genuine connection and transcendence above the sugary fakeness that permeates her life. Even though she has fallen down the path society prescribes to girls like her, she actively makes that choice. Her lack of opportunity is tragic, as is the pervasiveness of such cycles of deprivation in low-income communities. It’s tragic that Annie has few better options than to tumble into Antwoine’s arms. But Milk Like Sugar is saved from being trite or overbearing by the fact that Annie is not a tragic character.
Milk Like Sugar has a number of points it’d like to shove down your throat, but with its intriguing use of multimedia and a few electric performances, its often bitter message goes down sweet.

As bicycling becomes more popular around the country and in Pittsburgh specifically — according to non-profit and bicyclist advocacy group Bike Pittsburgh, the rate of Pittsburghers commuting by bike increased by 408 percent in 2014 — both the local government and the university have taken steps to change how bikers make their way around the city. 
In the fall of last year, for example, the city announced the installation of artist-designed bicycle racks in the Cultural District downtown after implementing two new miles of protected bike lanes earlier that year. The new lanes were created as part of the Green Lane Project 2.0, an initiative from national organization PeopleForBikes.
These reforms play into Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s “Complete Streets” initiative, announced in April. The $32 million plan spans the next five years, and intends to make Pittsburgh’s streets safe for pedestrians and bicyclists alike with upgrades to traffic signals, bike lanes, and sidewalks. Pittsburgh City Planning Director Ray Gastil said in the first public meeting on the Complete Streets initiative last Tuesday that the city expects to install 10 new miles of bike lanes per year over the next five years.
Organizations outside of the government have also made efforts to make biking easier in Pittsburgh. Over the course of the last year, the Pittsburgh Bike Share has opened 50 bike sharing stations with 500 bikes powered by Healthy Ride, small non-profit based in the Strip District. Using Healthy Ride, cyclists can rent bikes and return them to any station across the city. Erin Potts, director of marketing and outreach for the Pittsburgh Bike Share, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the service has had over 200,000 riders since May 31. 
Despite great strides, biking in Pittsburgh isn’t perfect. Bicyclists in Pennsylvania over the age of 12 are not required to wear a helmet, and last month an assistant director at the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Russian and East European Studies was killed after being trapped between two vehicles while biking on Forbes Avenue in Oakland, less than a mile from Carnegie Mellon’s campus.  
At Carnegie Mellon, crowded bike racks around campus are a testament to how many students, faculty, and staff bike to, on, and around campus, and some students are having difficulty reconciling Carnegie Mellon’s continued efforts at campus redesign with a bicyclist-friendly future.
A year ago The Tartan published a letter to the editor from Bruce Chan, a student in the Master of Urban Design program in the College of Fine Arts who graduated in August. 
Chan took issue with the university’s renovation of Legacy Plaza, what he calls “a truly inviting space for social and active interactions to happen.” The Plaza, strung with lights between West Wing and the Jared L. Cohon Center, is home to the Tartan Express food truck and outdoor seating for students. One thing, however, is conspicuously missing — bicycle racks.
“The redesign does not provide any bike parking. In fact, the existing bike racks on the north entrance of Margaret Morrison Hall were relocated on Nov. 3 to the north side of West Wing and Resnik House,” Chan wrote to The Tartan. “This is all part of the university’s larger plan to keep bicycles on the perimeter of campus…. Cyclists will park their bikes at the closest entrance of their destination and lock up to whatever is most convenient: trees, the railing, benches, chairs, and maybe the food truck itself. This rogue parking will only add clutter to the new Legacy Plaza and diminish its quality.”
In a recent interview with The Tartan, Chan said that he is still working to make life better for cyclists in Pittsburgh. Certain neighborhoods, Chan says, are almost inaccessible from campus by bike. “Right now a lot of students are stuck living in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill because of the inaccessibility to campus,” Chan said. “If CMU was able to really embrace students biking more, grad students and undergrads could live further away from campus and have more access to affordable housing.”
In September, junior electrical and computer engineering major Don Zheng posted a picture of a bike chained to the Judith Resnik memorial on the Academic Mall to the Overheard at Carnegie Mellon Facebook group, which has over 13,000 members. Commenters on the post attributed the misplaced bicycle to a shortage of bike racks on campus — “CMU is adding bike racks, but not fast enough,” senior computer science major Stuart Guertin wrote.
John Pyun, a senior physics major, has had difficulty finding a place to park his bike among the construction on campus.  “It got harder to find a place to lock up my bike after they started the construction, and I have to ride my bike around campus multiple times to find a place to park,” Pyun said. Pyun has also had his bike stolen, and as a result switched from a cable lock to a more secure U-lock, making it hard to chain his bike to objects that aren’t bike racks. 
Chan said that although biking around campus can be difficult, the administration has been responsive in dealing with the concerns of bikers through organizations such as the Bicycling Advisory Committee (BAC), originally founded by Ph.D. candidate in rhetoric Mary Glavan as part of the Graduate Student Assembly.
Karen Brooks, co-chair of the BAC and self-identified “freelance bike geek,” has been working with Director of Parking & Transportation Services Michelle Porter to meet bikers’ needs on and around campus. Brooks also serves on the board of Bike Pittsburgh. “It’s a group of students, staff, faculty working to make bicycling better,” Brooks said of the BAC. 
The BAC also offers classes, such as How to Ride in Traffic, to bikers on campus.
“We’re working to identify where the parking is and where it should be,” Brooks said of bike racks on campus. “Obviously there are a lot of bikes that get locked to railings and trees and all kinds of stuff, and it turns out that there are also some bike racks in the basement of garages and stuff where no one ever parks. I’ve been able to work with facilities to make some small changes here and there — move racks, put them places that are more convenient during construction — but we’re looking for a whole campus-wide sweep and distribution of the racks in the next couple of months.”
Brooks also acts as an ad hoc liaison between Bike Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon; Bike Pittsburgh has been working with Director Design of Campus Design and Facility Development Bob Reppe to keep bikers in mind as the university expands.
“Scott Bricker, the executive director [of Bike Pittsburgh], has been working with Bob Reppe and various other campus administrative staff to make sure that we’re advocating for the same things, and present a unified front as far as the city goes, and other entities like PennDOT and the Port Authority,” Brooks said.
The Tepper Quadrangle, for example, will help connect campus to the Panther Hollow Trail via bike paths. The Panther Hollow Trail, currently difficult to access from campus, links Oakland directly to Downtown and Southside without using major roads. “Essentially they’ll connect campus and Neville to the path. The path then goes down Panther Hollow and connects to the Eliza Furnace trail, which goes directly to Southside and Downtown,” Brooks said. 
Both Brooks and Chan acknowledge that there’s still work to be done for bikers and pedestrians on and off campus. “Fortunately, the campus itself is pretty safe, it’s pretty isolated,” Brooks said, “But as soon as you step off campus it gets pretty dangerous.” 
Chan highlighted the importance of the bus stops at the intersection of Forbes and Morewood avenues as links between Carnegie Mellon and the rest of the city, but noted that the intersection is dangerous for bikers. 
“That bus stop, it’s right in the middle of the street,” Chan said. “There are talks of a safer way to cross Morewood and Forbes to access those points of transportation, and talk of a bike lane at Forbes to improve the safety of that intersection.” 
Chan agrees, however, that biking in Pittsburgh is getting better. “One of the reasons I chose to go to CMU for urban design is because there’s a real culture of advocacy for transportation,” Chan said. “As part of my education I really wanted a city that had a robust and well-known advocacy group, and Bike Pittsburgh is known nationally as a great organization, and they have a great relationship with CMU.”

YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter let the world watch the daily progress of massive social movements like the Arab Spring and the Black Lives Matter movement. Now, Carnegie Mellon’s own Center for Human Rights Science will help protect human rights by creating a system to collect and archive user­generated media.
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Humanity United, and Oak Foundation recently donated a collective $1,185,000 to Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Human Rights Science for the development of instruments to collect photographic and video evidence of human rights abuses, post-conflict situations, and protests. 
With this new funding, the Center for Human Rights Science will provide members of the human rights community with technologies and abilities which presently only military, corporate and intelligence personnel can access. They aim for these new products to promote transparency and human rights organizations’ leverage to protect victims of human rights abuses around the world. 
The director of the Center and associate professor of science, technology, and society in the Department of History Jay D. Aronson said, “What we’re trying to do is level the playing field and provide [information] to the human rights community as well.”
Aronson united Carnegie Mellon scientists and human rights defenders in 2011 by creating the Center for Human Rights Science. Aronson and an array of representatives from Amnesty International, the Carter Center, Human Rights Watch, the International Criminal Court, SITU Research, and the Syria Justice & Accountability Center will guide the program’s expanding technology. 
Other Carnegie Mellon faculty members direct the Center, including Alex Hauptmann, a principal systems scientist in the School of Computer Science’s Language Technologies Institute, and Yaser Sheikh, associate professor in the CMU Robotics Institute.
Aronson founded the Center for Human Rights Science in 2011 after multiple conversations with human rights organizations about their limited abilities to document technical human rights data. “The Center was really born out of requests for help,” said Aronson. “The idea was to create a structure where I could build partnerships between the human rights community and faculty here or researchers here who had expertise that might be relevant to problems that the human rights community was increasingly facing at that time.” 
The Center is currently working on projects such as post­-conflict and post­-disaster DNA identification, as well as the Syrian Casualties Project.
As human rights organizations accumulated more user­-documented footage of human rights abuses, the need to store the data increased. 
“One of the huge questions in this domain is archiving,” said Aronson. “I think that it’s really important to gather this information for posterity so that we can use it in the future and so that we can understand how other people can use it in the future.”
Yet, many online videos and photos of human rights abuses violate the terms of services of platforms, like YouTube and Facebook, because of their graphic content. This poses a challenge for human rights defenders, who try to gather the user-­generated media for statistics and evidence. Aronson seeks to address this problem: “The question then becomes, well, where do they keep it? Do they provide it to some organization for safekeeping? Do they keep it in their servers even if it violates their terms of service? It’s very challenging."
Aronson describes the technology used by the Center for Human Rights Science as a “filtering mechanism” that human rights defenders use to find relevant images and the audio of human rights abuses. 
As of now, the Center’s most prominent projects analyze content from the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in Syria. The Center anticipates collecting data from U.S.­-based protests and human rights abuses in the future. The reports from this project will be published in a series called Voice of Witness.
“One of the big things that we’re developing, what it will be able to do is to find objects using computer vision and machine learning,” he said. “So tanks, helicopters. It works also for sounds. So particular kinds of weapons, you can key in and ask it to find a particular kind of sound of a particular type of weapon if you’re interested in that. Screams. Crying. It also works for some spoken language. So if there’s a particular phrase that a group uses or that’s of interest to you, you can search or that.”
Aronson recognizes the limited power of user­-generated media in legal proceedings, but believes that it can aid a witness’s testimony. Videos and images provide context and perhaps proof of human rights abuses, even if they do not stand as direct evidence. 
The other challenge posed by user­-generated content is the reputability of the content creators themselves. “I think the challenge is really to understand not just what’s being put online, but why. Every video tells a story, and every story provides someone’s perspective, and so it’s really important to understand that part, in addition to trying to figure out how to extract information from these sources,” said Aronson.
The Center intends to share their developing technology with their current partners, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. 
The Center’s leaders have not yet decided how to make the technology available to more human rights organizations, or even to the public, although they realize that the technology will probably be commercialized in the coming years.
“We’re trying to figure out the best way to make the technology available to the human rights community, in a usable but also in a responsible way, in the sense that it’s powerful, it can extract things out of video quickly,” said Aronson.
Mossab Alsadig, a junior computer science major, was skeptical about the ability of user-generated content to inform people of the nuances of an issue. 
“The media is usually a small picture, so it’s naturally going to be missing a lot of the context surrounding the initial issue,” she said. “And when that’s left out the conversations become really skewed, one sided, and uninformed.”
Junior statistics and technical writing major Angie Tang also voiced her concerns about social media’s role, yet ultimately approved its purpose: “Overall, I think social media and user-generated content can positively benefit the organization’s mission, since they show how these abuses and protests are a reality. I think with the right organization, it can be a very powerful tool to help with social good.”

Carnegie Mellon broke previous fundraising records this year during its second significant effort to fundraise for campus groups during a larger national day of giving. The university participated in #GivingTuesday, a global day of giving started by New York cultural center 92nd Street Y in 2012, by encouraging university constituents to give back to campus. #givingCMUday is Carnegie Mellon’s take on the event.
The Office of Alumni Relations and Annual Giving first embraced the event last year, largely carrying it out through social media, drawing out 533 donors. This year, the office set a goal to increase that donor count by 18 percent, to 630 donors. Their final donor count nearly doubled that number — 1,209 students, parents, alumni, staff, and faculty turned out to surpass that goal, according to the university’s official #givingCMUday website. They also broke the university’s record for the most donations received in one day, from 878 previously. These gifts amounted to $180,487.01.
The turnout overloaded the online system, according to Director of Annual Giving Mary Ann McCollough. This then prompted donors to call in gifts and pledge to send donations by mail. McCollough said that the Office of Annual Giving’s goal was to encourage donors to understand that “there are thousands of funds in this university. Whether it’s your college, your department, your club, your organization, give where you believe need[s] support.”
Carnegie Mellon’s standard donation form, which is hosted on www.giving.cmu.edu, gives donors the option to choose any campus fund ranging from academic departments and student activities, to athletic teams and Greek organizations.
The Office also ran five planned social media challenges and one pop-up challenge throughout the day, including one which asked campus members to tweet which fund they believe is most important to Carnegie Mellon and encouraging them to post a photo wearing Carnegie Mellon swag or plaid. Randomly selected winners received $500 toward their fund of choice. 
The School of Drama Showcase and a currently unannounced winner as of press time received money for a challenge that asked campus members to tell how Carnegie Mellon philanthropy impacts their lives. 
Kappa Alpha Theta and service organization Juntos received money for a challenge to film a Vine wishing a stranger “Happy #givingCMUday.” Winners of other challenges include Camp Kesem, a group that organizes recreational camps for children of parents with cancer, the Tepper Class of 2016, and Mock Trial, among others.
In addition to these challenges, representatives from the Office of Annual Giving tabled in the Jared L. Cohon University Center, where they asked students to write the name of an organization they believe deserves $500 on a heart-shaped sticky note to post on the wall. 
Thanks to the generosity of five alumni donors, five of the 362 notes were randomly selected to win $500. Another almunus offered to match student donations up to $500 in donations to support the Presidential Fellowship and Scholarship program.
However, the reception among students was not as overwhelming. Senior civil engineering major Erin Persson said that “Most of us don’t have steady income or extra money to give out, and we shouldn’t be expected to give more as students.” In order to combat this type of negative reaction, McCollough shared that in future years the office plans to do more advertising prior to the event to ensure better student understanding. “First it’s the awareness, then it’s the education, and then it’s participation. And we have to continue to cultivate that,” said McCollough. “Fundraising is no longer a letter in the mail.”
In July, Carnegie Mellon hired Scott Mory as vice president for university advancement in order to spark fundraising efforts. 
Previously, Mory led the efforts of the University of Southern California on a campaign to raise $6 billion, one of the largest university campaigns in history. 
This comes alongside recent efforts focused on giving such as last November’s launch of www.crowdfunding.cmu.edu which allows student organizations to use the platform for 30 days, and the donation incentives for the class of 2015. Because giving factors into the algorithm that determines university ranking, Carnegie Mellon is making efforts to better its standing.
The larger #GivingTuesday initiative raised $116.7 million this year, with 698,961 donations made at a mean gift size of $107.47, according to the initiative’s website.

Last Friday, free sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was held in Rangos Ballroom for Carnegie Mellon University students. The event came days after World AIDS Day, which was last Tuesday, Dec. 1, adding to many events being held around the world to bolster the fight against AIDS.
As stated on the event’s website, the many events surrounding World AIDS Day seek to “unite people in the fight against HIV, commemorate those who have been lost to HIV/AIDS, educate, [and] reduce stigma around HIV/AIDS.” Friday’s event, hosted by the Pittsburgh Health Association, included rapid testing for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.
Statistically, it has been proven that one in six people in the United States go day-to-day, unaware that they are infected. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS — acquired immunodeficiency syndrome — and very serious health defects and other life-limiting conditions. After 10 to 15 years, HIV will have already severely damaged the immune system. Many may subscribe to the mentality of “that could never happen to me,” but nothing is known for sure until tests confirm, and that is the message this event was seeking to spread.
“Don’t be afraid or ashamed to get tested” said Jade Schiffer, a sophomore decision science major and peer health advocate. 
Apart from free HIV and STI testing at the event, there were also tables set up outside of Rangos for the already established “Free Condom Friday.” Julian McClain, a representative for the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, was also present to provide information about his organization’s contribution in the fight to minimize the spread of HIV. The organization has taken the initiative to reach out to high schools and colleges to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. “Once we start outreaching to 25 or 26 year olds, it’s already too late,” said McClain.
Also available was literature providing information about pre-exposure prophalyxis, or “PrEP.” PrEP is a small blue pill that a person can take every day that prevents them from getting HIV 99 percent of the time. With the additional use of condoms, as usual, this pill is extremely helpful for HIV prevention with regular sexual activity or, if one has an HIV-positive partner.
In addition to the HIV testing that was being conducted in Rangos, “Why not get some information about a blue pill that could protect you for the rest of your life?” McClain said. 
In honor of World AIDS Day, this Thursday, the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force will be hosting a “PrEP Rally” at the Kelly Strayhorn Theater 7:30–9:30 p.m. This event serves as an official information session for PrEP. It will include talks from HIV specialists and other community members for anyone interested in the new PrEP pill. Other events include a drag queen cheer squad and a vogue dance showcase. The Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force is one organization that is taking steps in the fight against AIDS.
As for recommendations for ways students at Carnegie Mellon can prevent the spread of HIV, Peer Health Advocates has several recommendations: Early detection is better, so be sure to be tested as necessary. Make informed decisions about sexual activity and medical treatment. The tests that were performed at this event can also be conducted at University Health Services on campus. Tests are free of charge with university health insurance. A rapid HIV test, which is simply taken with an oral swab, only costs students without university insurance $20.

Dear Fellow Students,
As we approach our winter break holiday, it is imperative that I provide the following reminder to our student community:
Jibby and I need to know about any changes that you or any collection of students might envision for Carnegie Mellon. It is our responsibility to make time, if necessary, to hear what those changes are. When student government agrees that your ideas will benefit both you and our student body, it is also our responsibility to find ways to help you transform your ideas into reality. 
Serving the student body this semester has been an amazing experience. Helping the Active Minds organization through our INSPIRE program to bring alumni artist Kai Roberts back to campus, putting on events like student/faculty mixers and student-led town hall meetings are just some examples of how Jibby and I have approached making Carnegie Mellon the best that it can be. But we’re not the only ones who have ideas on how to do so.
After participating in an event demonstrating our solidarity with the African-American students at the University of Missouri, Jibby and I helped organize a meeting with the student orchestrators who made that event happen. As a result of hearing of their dissatisfaction with the way race and diversity are addressed at Carnegie Mellon, we are excited to help them work towards their goals aimed at promoting equality for all members of our campus community.
Jibby and I pursued our offices to provide an advocate and activist platform for every student who calls Carnegie Mellon home. We are proud to do so for the student leaders mentioned above, and we are excited to hear how we might empower you as well. 
May your winter break be blessed and fun. 
Sincerely,
JR Marshall
*Student body president

Dear readers of The Tartan,
In the last issue of 2015, we published a series of letters to the editor about the black student experience at Carnegie Mellon. When these letters were published, it was brought to our attention that the letters had been edited in the production process, which is not only against our policy, but highly unethical. Though the editing was an innocent mistake that resulted from a training gap, it is regrettable and unacceptable. 
The message of the letters was altered when the letters were edited without the permission of the authors. We at The Tartan are deeply sorry that this happened, and are taking all of the necessary steps to ensure that it will not happen again.
The letters to the editor we publish are intended to be a platform from which student voices from our community can be heard. By editing the letters, The Tartan violated the trust of the student body. In light of this, we, Brian Trimboli and Laura Scherb, Editor-in-Chief and Publisher, respectively, would like to reiterate the revised policy that is effective immediately: 
“Letters must be submitted by 5 p.m. on the Wednesday before publication by mail or to forum@thetartan.org. Letters from within the university community take precedence. Letters intended for publication must be signed and include the author’s address and telephone number for verification; letters must not exceed 350 words. No edits will be made to any published letters without the author’s permission; in the case of no response from the author, The Tartan reserves the right to postpone the publication of the letter. Authors’ names may be withheld from publication upon request. The Tartan reserves the right to reject any letter.”
On behalf of the entire staff of The Tartan, we would like to apologize again for our actions regarding these letters to the editor. It was never our intention to silence a voice or change a narrative, and we hope that we can regain the trust of the student body in light of these actions. 
Sincerely,
Laura Scherb, Publisher
Brian Trimboli, Editor-in-Chief

This past summer, I discovered the term "Millennial" and its many connotations. I was a local camp counselor responsible for about twenty children. After a long day of running back and forth from the various activities, the bathroom every ten minutes, and one trip to the nurse’s office, I was completely exhausted. Just as I was about to leave, my manger told me: “Wow, you are not your typical Millennial.” At the time, I was slightly confused and unsure whether her remark was complimentary. I understand better now, but I'm still unsure if I entirely agree with her use of the word.
“Millennial,” coined in 1991 as another name for Generation Y, has faced a significant amount of controversy. Technically speaking, it refers to those born between 1980 and 2000. Older generations accuse Millennials of having no drive, never leaving their childhood homes, and being incompetent workers. They call Millennials lazy, unmotivated, selfish, narcissistic, and a dozen other things that have given the term and the group a negative connotation. These stereotypes have been proven inaccurate time and time again, but the social stigma remains.
What older generations forget, however, is that a large majority of Millennials entered the workforce just as America was suffering its lowest economic state since the Great Depression. Young people wanted to work, but there were few jobs to be found. They continued to live with their parents because they could not afford to move out on their own, due to both underemployment and an absurd amount of college debt. 
Recent studies have shown that over 70 percent of employers find that Millennials are better equipped workers than the generation before them, with 82 percent commenting on the benefits of Millennials’ technology skills and quick adaptability. Millennials are also open-minded, which is something that too often goes unmentioned. They have been brought up to be more understanding and accepting of diversity than any previous generation. They are willing and able to not just coexist with people who are different from them, but to learn more about these differences and find common ground despite them. This open-mindedness is the generation's greatest strength. 
Laura Olin, a member of President Obama’s 2008 campaign, said that “Millennials are wise enough to realize that no one is going to fix the world for them — it’s up to them.” Like Olin, I too have faith that the world’s saving grace lies with this generation. So I suppose I have a right to be confused about my manager's negative use of the word "Millennial." The word defines this generation — a generation of artists, thinkers, collaborators, and innovators, and I am proud to be a part of it.

°As headlines like “End the Gun Epidemic in America” become more common, Americans are growing increasingly afraid for their safety at work, school, and even in movie theaters. But has gun violence in America really gotten that much worse? While the media would like us to think so, the details say otherwise.
According a Washington Post article that went viral, “there have been 334 days and 351 mass shootings so far this year.” While this number initially seems insane, the definition of “mass shooting” is often disputed. The Washington Post took its data from the Mass Shooting Tracker, acknowledging that it “is different from other shooting databases in that it uses a broader definition of mass shooting.” According to the FBI, a mass shooting involves four or more deaths. However, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, a mass shooting occurs when four or more people are shot but not necessarily killed. Such a change greatly increases the number of reported mass shootings, such as one that occurred in a nightclub where only one person was killed but many more were shot.
In order to analyze gun violence in America, we must look at more meaningful statistics, such as the decline in gun-related deaths over the last twenty years. According to the Pew Research Center, firearm homicides have nearly halved from 1993 to 2013, from 7 to 3.6 homicides per 100,000 people. The Washington Post attributes this decrease in violent crimes to more police officers, technology, and a decrease in alcohol consumption. Even the prevalence of mass shootings has not increased substantially over the years. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northwestern University, claims that the rate of mass shootings has remained flat overall since he started tracking it in the 1970s.
America has become a safer nation over the last several decades. So why have we seen many more of these mass shooting headlines recently? For one, shocking headlines get higher reader counts. A much more interesting statistic than the number of mass shootings by year would be the number of articles about mass shooting by year. The prevalence of violence was greater in the 1990s, but media coverage of such events was not.
 
The media is instilling false fear in Americans. According to the Center for Disease Control, 11,208 homicide deaths occurred in 2013. In comparison, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States, took 611,105 lives. However, a search through the USA Today archive shows how much larger media coverage of mass shootings (a fraction of homicides) has become than heart disease. In total, there were 1682 articles results for “gun violence” and 1266 for “heart disease.” There were also more gun violence articles with shocking headlines that made the front page. Even though people are almost 60 times more likely to die of heart disease than homicide, they don’t walk the street worrying that they could have a heart attack any moment.
I do not deny that America has gun violence issues; it does. But gun violence is rooted more deeply into the history of America than the media coverage of a few recent mass shootings would lead us to believe. America has not entered a so-called “gun epidemic,” nor will it with any likelihood in the near future. If anything, America has had a gun-epidemic for generations. The prevalence of gun violence is decreasing in America, and though we still have a long way to go before gun violence can be ended altogether, we are in no more danger walking the streets than we were two decades ago.

After yet another mass shooting occurred this past week, this time in San Bernardino, Calif., the debate on gun control has been reinvigorated once again. While gun control itself is a contentious issue, piecemeal gun regulation often ends up out of the spotlight, allowing special interest groups like the NRA to spout (nonsense) slogans like “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun!” and change the focus of the debate to gun bans and away from laws that absolutely have to be passed.
One of the more egregious examples of gun companies being given too much free reign is a 1996 budget bill that prevented the study of gun research by the CDC. Since then, the government is not even allowed to produce reports on gun control, let alone use the potential information to create good, informed laws. Maybe the data will find that not everyone has enough guns and everyone should be required to purchase five automatic weapons with high-capacity magazines and carry them at all times to defend themselves. Maybe research will say we should ban guns entirely. We have no way of knowing what information the government will produce and even the former congressman who pushed the provision, Jay Dickey (R-Ark.), considers his efforts a mistake. However, these lapses in the law just don’t go away.
Mandates from internal, non-defaceable serial numbers to gun registries are just common sense. For the same reason we keep track of what license plate is on what insurance plan, it is obviously a good idea to keep track of what gun belongs to what person. Key Evidence in the argument against registries is Canada’s horribly run long-gun registry, created in 1998. The record-keeping errors and cost of hunting down every gun, considering that very old models were not even being made anymore, caused costs to go through the roof. America’s larger pool of gun ownership and cultural differences between the U.S. and Canada will make it even harder to do a similar thing in America. However, this was a long-gun registry of shotguns and rifles. Canada’s handgun registry is doing just fine, as is the handgun registry of every other high-income country in the world. The point is moot.
Detractors may point to San Bernardino's location in California, which has strict gun laws, but it’s so easy to just go to Nevada, get a gun, and drive it home that this particular response is meaningless.
We don’t allow any other dangerous machinery companies free range. You need a license —  which requires affirmative proof of capacity — to drive a car, operate construction equipment, and even open lemonade stands in some states. Why on earth would a gun, a machine explicitly designed for causing catastrophic injuries, get a free pass?
Of course, the answer is the NRA’s full coffers — courtesy of gun corporations — and excellent PR department that shift focus from meaningful steps in regulation to less-popular, full-blown gun control. But corporations don’t run the government unless we let them. Maybe the only way to stop a bad congressperson with a gun lobby is a good citizen with a vote.

The most important climate conference of the decade began this week in Paris. Analysts are hopeful that the results will end up being more productive than those from Copenhagen, and more binding than those from Kyoto, as politicians are finally realizing that “business as usual” will mean the destruction of entire ecosystems, coastal towns, and in some cases, countries.
The science is quite clear: Exceeding the two-degree global warming threshold will have catastrophic consequences. At the world's current rate of carbon consumption, we risk a five degree increase in only a matter of decades. Though most of our carbon reserves would be better left permanently underground, world leaders in Paris are challenging the scientific consensus and debating how much carbon we still get to burn. The situation seems unpromising, if not downright depressing.
It seems unproductive, almost baffling, for politicians at a conference intended to save the planet from climate change to focus instead on making the fewest amount of concessions while still maintaining a decent international reputation. Yet that is exactly what politicians arrived in Paris to accomplish.
Politicians, in most cases, represent power more than what they actually possess. And governments tend to represent the power of industry, their symbiotic partner-in-crime, which feeds them the capital they desperately need to function. This pattern will stay fixed unless there is a major social movement to change the game. International treaties pose no threat to the existing structure unless the governments that sign them are driven by the people and not corporate interests.
Chances are that the Paris talks will be more conclusive and binding than previous climate treaties. Chances are also that it will not be enough. The real battle will be fought on college campuses, the streets, and online — anywhere citizens can come together to challenge the conglomeration of government and industry that brought about the climate crisis. Progress will be made as far as it is demanded by the people. The climate movement will have to push harder. Our future as a species depends on it.

Parents who dream of their five-year-old playing sonatas can bring them to Carnegie Mellon in the hope of lessons. Through an application and interview process, their child can become one of ten students accepted to the Beginning Piano program, which trains children from the ages five to seven. The benefits of childhood music training are well documented, and music education is a great way for the School of Music to give back to the Pittsburgh community. However, the cost of the Beginning Piano program — and the distinct lack of financial aid options — makes this education and its plethora of benefits inaccessible to children of lower socioeconomic status. The program inadvertently ends up perpetuating privilege and elitism instead of giving all kids a chance at learning classical music. 
The caliber of Carnegie Mellon’s music programs is well known. Lesser known around campus is the Music Preparatory School, which houses the Beginning Piano program and additionally trains kids from the ages four to 18 in piano, percussion, guitar, and string instruments. Students in the general program take weekly private lessons at $85 per hour, as well as a free elective. At around $900 per semester, the Beginning Piano program is more comprehensive, including a 30-minute private lesson, a 45-minute group lesson, and a 45-minute Eurhythmics class, which non-music majors may know as the reason your music major friends spend exam week skipping around their dorms.
While Eurhythmics may seem odd from an outsider perspective, it is one of the cornerstones of music education here at Carnegie Mellon and is not offered at many other institutions. It teaches students how to better articulate themselves through music by feeling it with their whole bodies, and it has been proven to increase young children's self-awareness. 
The other benefits of the Prep School program are less unique to Carnegie Mellon and more widely researched. A study by the Boston Children’s Hospital found that music training in early childhood improved development in the areas of the brain that control executive functioning. According to head researcher Nadine Gabb, “Since executive functioning is a strong predictor of academic achievement, even more than IQ, we think our findings have strong educational implications.” Learning an instrument also helps with language processing. The Stanford Report found that music training helps people detect small differences in syllables and the rapidly changing sounds that make up a language. Another study published in PLOS One found a correlation between at least three years of musical training and increased fine motor skills, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning. 
What all of this adds up to is that programs like the Music Preparatory School help students improve their reading and physical ability, expand their vocabulary, raise their academic performance, increase their problem solving ability — all in addition to gaining the ability to play an instrument. The rewards of these improved abilities are obvious in the Prep School’s student body. Dan Barrett, the director of the program, described its typical student as an overachieving, Ivy League-bound kid with 25 extracurriculars. Surprisingly, the students who seriously apply themselves to the Prep School often do not go on to study music in college, because they excel in many fields. Barrett tied this academic success to their experience with music, and the weight of scientific research backs him up. 
However, the gains from music training may be even bigger, and arguably more important, for the groups that Carnegie Mellon has failed to serve. A 2014 study by Northwestern University found that students from impoverished backgrounds experienced a greater ability to interpret speech after two years of music lessons as children. Underprivileged youth often have difficulty interpreting speech patterns precisely, which is a major contributor to the academic gap in performance between children from rich and poor backgrounds. 
Academic performance is one of the few tickets to upward mobility, and the New York Times reported in September that the gap in earnings between those with and without a college degree is the biggest it has ever been. Yet according to the same article, “only five percent of Americans ages 25 to 34 whose parents didn’t finish high school have a college degree.” 
Giving children from underprivileged backgrounds the skills, self-discipline, and self-confidence necessary for college is vital, and music education can provide that. Carnegie Mellon has not been idle in this important field. Dr. Natalie Ozeas of the School of Music has created programs to get music exposure and education into Pittsburgh public schools, including an initiative to give keyboards to classrooms. 
However, the Prep School remains unattainable for many. The $900 semester cost for the Beginning Piano program in significant, and the program requires a commitment of four or five semesters, adding up to about $3500. Most students in the program continue their study through middle or even high school; poorer students must do the same if they want to see the same benefits. This is can mean over $3000 per year for a family already struggling to pay the bills. 
To be fair, this is how most universities run their music prep schools. However, Carnegie Mellon can and should break the pattern. The benefits of financial aid options are clear for underprivileged students, but there are also benefits for all of the students and the program at large. Having students from different backgrounds in the group lessons will allow all the children to hear about different perspective and experiences, and offering scholarships will help break the elitism so common in classical music programs. 
It will not be easy for the Prep School to create scholarship options. The program is currently completely self-funded, and the resources offered to students are impressive and therefore expensive. Nonetheless, the program should make it a priority to offer at least one full-ride scholarship through the entirety of their piano program, as well as a few partial scholarships. Carnegie Mellon has a chance to be at the forefront of equal access to music education, and we should take up the challenge. We want the best and brightest students — from all backgrounds.

Last week, Interview magazine published a cover story on Kylie Jenner, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner family at 18 years old, featuring a photo shoot with Jenner in a stylized wheelchair. The photo, shot by Steven Klein, prompted instant backlash; many decried Jenner for taking something essential to many disabled people's lives and making it a couture prop. 
Interview justified the shoot by saying the wheelchair is a metaphor for Kylie's existence in the limelight — she is shackled by fame, and subjected to constant media scrutiny. Jenner's stint in a wheelchair serves as a weakly justified societal commentary, and plays into the search for identity she says defines her coming of age. 
Although Kylie is still a teenager — "trying to figure herself out, experimenting with herself so that she might figure out who she is and who she wants to be," in the words of Chris Wallace's story for Interview — she should know better than to co-opt a wheelchair as a fashion accessory. As Jenner experiments with new looks in an effort to define herself, she takes something that stigmatizes those who are legitimately disabled, a wheelchair, and uses it as a tool for social gain and high-fashion spotlight. 
Disabled people have used Kylie Jenner's own anti-bullying hashtag campaign, #IAmMoreThan, to express their outrage and show that they are more than their disabilities. Jenner has subverted her own anti-bullying values by appearing in a wheelchair, sending the message to disabled people that their disability is only worthy of a magazine cover when it's deemed appropriate by someone as able-bodied. 
The Tartan encourages Kylie and the whole Interview team to think more broadly about their fashion choices in the future. These kinds of high-profile photoshoots in magazines such as Interview have the power to enforce or breakdown stigmas against already marginalized groups, and this photoshoot failed to be conscious of its impact.

Our university prides itself on using collaboration as a gateway to innovation. This is evident in our group work oriented classes as we are taught that teamwork is a critical skill to have, yet we fail to take responsibility for our teammates. Instead their issues are there own. For too long we have deemed our classmates lack of “success” their problem. This is no different from making racial issues faced by blacks also “their problem”. We have miserably failed to see that problems faced by our fellow peers are our problem as well. The success of the group is not based on one or a majority of the individuals, but the collective. The same line of thinking should be adopted when considering the injustices faced by POC in particular blacks. Helping me, not doing it all for me, or being concerned about my issues does not in any capacity have negative repercussion to you. Helping someone that is behind does not impede your ability to learn more; in fact taking time to help someone with a part they don't understand only helps you learn better. It seems as though it is taboo to talk about two very relevant B words: 1. black 2. blind. Well I finally have the audacity to do so. Numerous students, faculty and administrators turn a blind eye to the fact that CMU poorly represents and treats black students. 
Let's first consider the state of black students here at CMU. There are more people that look like me in the dining locations and custodial roles than there are in my own classrooms. I can name all of the professors that are black, as I have had the privilege of being taught by all but two of the six professors. In 2001, roughly 3% CMU’s faculty was black. The numbers are not drastically higher compared to the most recent data. In 2012, 1.8% of eligible black tenured and tenured faculty was black. That’s a 1.2% increase in 11 years. We need to do better. CMU uses the diversity card as a way to attract more students and donors, but how can we claim diversity when the statistics prove otherwise? Maybe we should be specific by what we mean by diversity. Is it amongst international students or academic interest? It’s certainly not a large amount of racial or ethnic diversity. The question now becomes why has the black experience at CMU not changed very much. The truth is I have no clue but that does not warrant the tendency to ignore the issue, which is why I demand we earnestly consider how we got to where we are today and how to make rapid and significant progress. What will it take for non black students and administration alike to see how ignoring blackness and covert racism is in fact condoning it. When will we start to see that not caring for our fellow peers and classmates is our issue. We as an institution should be responsible for the lack of the unpleasant experience of our fellow classmates, especially for black students. Standing up for issues faced by blacks is like a group project, you are evaluated on the input of all of the people not on the individual contribution. Blacks can continue to fight to end the injustices they face, but having non black allies will result in a more widespread and effective resolution of these issues.

A great man of action once said, “Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.” That great man of action was El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, formally and most commonly known to the world as Malcolm X. I want to be able to travel to that future that Shabazz talks about, but how can I prepare for it if I am unsure whether or not the institution that is facilitating my “education” cares about me?
There has been much attention brought to the many racial issues that still exist on college campuses around the country by many members of the CMU community. However, no one seems willing to acknowledge the many racial issues that still exist at Carnegie Mellon that are affecting black students. We, CMU in general, as a community have never really heard from the administration whether or not the well-being and success of black students on campus is a priority for the school.
Black students in America have been systematically oppressed by the educational system. Those who are fortunate enough to be accepted into CMU slowly realize that systemic oppression is still affecting them.
Many of the black students at CMU, including myself, come from inner city schools. These inner city schools have a history of providing sub-par education and have the nerve to say that their “graduates” are prepared for college. For a good portion of these inner city students, going to college means escaping institutional racism stemming from slavery, that corners them into the never ending cycle of poverty and struggle. However, even at a school as progressive as Carnegie Mellon, why are my fellow black brothers and sisters and I still experiencing the same racism and indifference from students, faculty and staff that our inner city schools taught us was over after the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s?
Many incidents occur at CMU that just get swept under the rug by CMU’s amazing PR team or by students too afraid to speak up. Racism, sexual assault, gender harassment, alcohol abuse, drug abuse are just a few of the issues that continue to affect many students on campus yet the Carnegie Mellon administration never really comes out and explicitly admits that there are problems and that they are going to solve it or at least try to make it better. Instead the administration is very quick to protect its image at the expense of the students by making general statements about “diversity and inclusion” without ever explaining what “diversity and inclusion” really means.
Why am I writing all of this? I am writing this because there are so many issues at Carnegie Mellon and I do not feel that the administration truly cares and I feel that many within the campus community are ignorant to these issues. I encourage CMU students that the next time you see a black student on campus, ask them if they have experience some form of racism on campus. I assure you that you will be surprised by their answers. Hopefully by more students becoming aware of one issue, it will lead to awareness of other issues affecting students.
So I ask the administration this, Do you care about the black students at CMU? Many of us are curious to know. And I am sure students of other communities are curious if you care about them as well.
I will leave you with another quote from Mr. Shabazz, “Usually when people are sad, they don’t do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about change.” Believe me when I say this, if you carefully press your ear against the wall, you will hear many starting to get angry.

Dog whistle politics and the “angry black person” narrative is the 2015, millennial form of racism. Taegan Goddard explains dog whistle politics as “a type of political speech using code words that appear to mean one thing to the general population but have a different meaning for a targeted part of the audience” (Goddard). Dog whistle politics, alluding to a dog whistle that produces a high frequency sound that only dogs can hear, is used subliminally throughout media to express racism and prejudice toward minorities.
Dog whistle politics happens everywhere: in politics, in the media, and often conservative fields in the workplace. But what surprises me is the prominent use of the tactic to disregard or invalidate people of colors’ feelings at such a progressive and forward-thinking school like CMU. Even though I’ve only been a graduate student at CMU for four months, I have already been a victim of these encoded words - whether by the student who felt “uncomfortable” going to a party where the majority of people were black, or my professor who asked me to give the “black perspective.” Too many many black students, including myself, have been called “angry” or “sassy” when we are simply defending ourselves or just speaking up against wrong-doings. For example, in a group meeting for one of my projects, a classmate made an offensive statement. In response, I told that classmate his statement was racist and offensive. Instead of apologizing and correcting his offensive statement, the classmate quickly called me “angry” and told me to essentially stop complaining. If you’re reading this and have trouble understanding why this situation is problematic, let me break it down for you.  Imagine someone calls your mom ugly. You try to explain to that person that you are offended and their words are hurtful. In response this person tells you to stop being “angry” and that the word “ugly” isn’t offensive, essentially invalidating your feelings. 
Now, not every black person is angry or sassy — and if we were, we would have perfectly good reason to be, but that’s another topic for another article. When you say minorities are angry, sassy, or mad, all you’re doing is putting them in a box and furthering stereotypes. This method of labeling a black person creates a frustrating cycle for blacks that goes something like Example A.
Our emotions are essentially trapped and I strongly believe CMU is too supportive and progressive of a school to allow this to continue to happen. So what can we all do to fix this problem? Instead of the continuous cycle above, the offense could be a resolvable sequence like Example B.  
Even if you’re not the person offending, you could stick up for the person being offended. While we can’t always prevent insults, we should try our best to make CMU a safe and inclusive campus for all students.
