This week The Tartan caught up with senior Clare McKendry, the captain of the women’s water polo team. McKendry has grown up playing water polo her whole life, and as a result has developed a passion for the sport.
She brought that passion to Carnegie Mellon and co-founded the club water polo team in the spring of 2009.
McKendry founded the team for many reasons; “I like people knowing the sport,” she said. McKendry supports all levels of play — whether people are just beginning or are advanced players, McKendry supports their involvement in the sport.
This past summer, McKendry worked as a lifeguard and helped coach water polo. She worked with children ages eight to 14 in a Splash Ball clinic, where they learned the fundamentals of water polo in a no-contact environment before they began playing. McKendry also helped coach a 16-and-under boys’ water polo team.
Besides working with teams, McKendry also plays in the open leagues to keep her own skills sharp and competitive.
At Carnegie Mellon, McKendry is a creative writing major with a computer science minor. In the future, she hopes to go to law school in California.
The club water polo season begins in February, and they will practice and compete through the month of April.
After not winning any games last season, Carnegie Mellon hosted the championships, where the Tartans were able to clinch their last two games of the season.
McKendry scored seven goals in each of the two final games for The Tartans.
In the pool, McKendry is a flexible player with the ability to play every position.
With the roster consisting of 10 players, McKendry says that she would love to see the team grow.
McKendry prefers to be a utility player on the team, which is a player that drives the ball forward toward the goal and has many scoring opportunities.
Undertaking her academics in creative writing and computer science, McKendry not only has her heart in the work at Carnegie Mellon, but also has her heart in the game.

Growing up as a competitive tennis player, I oftentimes felt that the sport that I played wasn’t given enough credit by my peers. Now I’m almost 21 years old, and tennis still doesn’t get the attention it deserves from America. I’m sure many of you did not know or did not care that the U.S. Open, the biggest tennis tournament held in America, has been going on for the past two weeks. A lot of people give the excuse that there no longer are any skilled Americans in professional tennis, but this U.S. Open has proven that the United States definitely has some good talent.
For the most part, people know Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and — starting this year — Novak Djokovic. As of right now, all three of those men are in the quarterfinals or further in the tournament, which is pretty predictable. But, throughout the first rounds of the Open, many Americans were able to pull off upsets in order to reach the later rounds of the tournament. 
Take Donald Young, who had never been past the second round in any major. Young, the enigmatic American talent, has had a rough time on his professional tour ever since becoming a professional at 17 years old. However, he rode the home-court advantage all the way into the fourth round, beating two top-20 players along the way.  John Isner, another young American, is a bit more well known than Young because of the epic match he played against Frenchman Nicholas Mahut at Wimbledon. Isner, who is blessed with a ton of height and a tremendous serve, has always been known as a guy who will give opponents a tough match, but is never expected to break through to make a lot of noise in a major. This year, Isner took a good draw and great play all the way into the quarterfinals until he lost on Friday to Andy Murray, top-five in the world rankings.
Of course, we can’t talk about American tennis without at least mentioning Andy Roddick. Although Roddick hasn’t done anything in more than a couple of years, many fans believe that he is still the best American tennis player. This is far from the truth, but Roddick did surprise everyone this year by knocking off a couple of top-15 players on his way to a huge matchup against Rafael Nadal. Considering Roddick is an ex-U.S. Open Champion, this was a match that everyone was looking forward to. Unfortunately, Roddick was just outmatched by a better, younger player. The match wasn’t even close, and Roddick was barely able to get five games as Nadal steamrolled him. 
Moving on, we see four familiar faces in the semifinals — Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray. These four players have been in the top four for what feels like forever, and that is a testament to their hard work and determination to compete with each other. Of the four, only Murray does not have a Grand Slam title, and he holds the burden of British tennis on his shoulders. 
Can this be the year that Murray takes it all the way? The odds are stacked against the Englishman, considering he will be playing his fourth match in only five days, due to the rainstorms that hit the East Coast. Playing four high-quality matches against tough opponents, with two of them being Nadal and Federer or Djokovic is such a difficult task that I’d put Murray’s chances at below 10 percent. The safe pick at this point is Djokovic, who is coming off one of the best years in recent memory, but I will turn back the clock and choose Roger Federer to win it all, just because I think he won’t go out with at least one more title. He absolutely demolished a strong quarterfinal opponent, and I think he is really set to capture yet another Grand Slam title. All I know is that it should be a great weekend for tennis, and I wish more people could appreciate that.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team has two tournaments in the books to start the season: the Carnegie Mellon Invitational and the Ohio Wesleyan Tournament. The first game of the season was against the Geneva College Golden Tornadoes on Friday, Sept. 2. This battle ended in a tie after the Golden Tornadoes’ early 2–0 was erased. Senior Carmen Minella was the hero in this game, scoring both goals for the Tartans.
In overtime, both teams got off some good shots — two in the first overtime, one in the second ­— and junior goalkeeper Zach Stahl maintained the tie by saving a point-blank header by Jon Mathoslah of the Golden Tornadoes.
The Tartans did not get their first victory of the season until the second game of the Carnegie Mellon Invitational against the St. Vincent College Bearcats. After the Bearcats scored the first goal of the game in the 32nd minute, the Tartans caught fire.
Sophomore Chris Wysocki scored the first goal for Carnegie Mellon in the 38th minute on a turnaround 10 yards from the net. Wysocki scored the next goal on a penalty kick as well.
Sophomore Max Tassano scored in the 60th minute off a cross from senior Kyle Young. Senior Brad Edelman scored the fourth and final goal for the Tartans in this bout on a rocket turnaround shot 18 yards out. 
The 4–1 victory spotted the Tartans at 1–0–1 to start the season.
On Friday, Sept. 9, the Tartans were handed their first loss of the 2011 season by Capital University at the Ohio Wesleyan Tournament. Capital’s goalkeeper, Bob Weisgarber, saved two good shots at the beginning of the second period by Tassano and Minella. Young had two shots saved by Weisgarber in the 60th minute as well.
The 13th-ranked Ohio Wesleyan team blew out the Tartans in the second game of the tournament on Saturday. 
The Battling Bishops scored in the third minute and never looked back. It was a tough battle for Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartans come back home to play on Wednesday, Sept. 14 against Westminster College.

The Carnegie Mellon University football team is off to an even start after defeating Grove City College last weekend and losing to Allegheny College this past Saturday. The Tartans beat Grove City 21–19 and lost to Allegheny 33–13.
Against the Grove City Wolverines, Carnegie Mellon was led by a strong running attack spearheaded by juniors Patrick Blanks and Jake Nardone and senior Chris Garcia. Blanks rushed for 126 yards on 17 carries, Nardone tallied 84 yards on 13 attempts and Garcia had 47 yards on 13 rushes. Blanks scored two touchdowns and Nardone had one.
The Tartan defense was also solid, limiting Grove City to 19 points. Sophomores Rob Winkleman and Jack Butler and junior Nick Karabin led Carnegie Mellon on this side of the ball with nine, eight, and eight tackles, respectively. Those totals were career highs for Winkleman and Butler.
After that impressive win, the Tartans faltered this past Saturday against the Allegheny College Gators. Turnovers marred the entire game for Carnegie Mellon, and while struggling to control the ball, the Tartans couldn’t get it together offensively and only scored 13 points to Allegheny’s 33. 
Blanks and Garcia led the Tartan offense again, each scoring a touchdown and rushing for 65 and 57 yards, respectively. Karabin, Winkleman, and Butler led the defense as well with 11, 11, and nine tackles, respectively. 
Senior Ray Johnson summed up the loss, “Offensively we weren’t able to sustain long drives like we did in week one. Defensively we gave up some key third-down plays, which helped them get in scoring position.... Turnovers really hurt us throughout the game.”
After a solid win and a disappointing loss, Carnegie Mellon football looks to get back on track this weekend, playing on Friday night against Catholic University in Washington, D.C. The Tartans are gone for the next three weeks and return home on Oct. 8 to take on Ohio Wesleyan University.

The first few days at Carnegie Mellon are often marked by a glowing, campus-wide ambiance that feeds off the sunny skies and palpable excitement around the new school year. Between dapping one’s bros and dissecting one’s ScheduleMan print-out, it’s not always easy to find time to lay back and embrace the tail end of the Pittsburgh summer. That is, of course, unless world-renowned trial biker Thomas Oehler is bunny hopping over you and five of your friends while you all lie face-up on the pavement outside of the UC.
On Aug. 30, former world champion trial biker and Red Bull athlete Oehler came to Carnegie Mellon as part of his “Back to School” tour that has stretched from Ohio, to Boston, to Pittsburgh. Crowds of up to 70 or 80 students at a time lined the architectural landmarks of Carnegie Mellon’s campus to watch Oehler hop from pillars, benches, and fences.
Senior computer science major J.P. Patrizio was dumbfounded by what he saw. “It’s like parkour ... except on a bike,” Patrizio said. “I haven’t seen anything like that before — it’s incredible. He literally jumped over me. So epic.”
Oehler’s had a passion for trial biking for a long time. Riding since he was just 12 years old, Oehler now dons a cattle-adorned helmet and the title of “Red Bull athlete.” Crowned world champion in 2008, he is always enthusiastic to hear students “ooh” and “aah” as he bikes over campus landscapes. Oehler said the way he aims to excite just comes naturally.
“When we were little, my friends and I used to try to impress each other riding around the neighborhood,” Oehler said in his Austrian accent. “It’s just what we did.”
Between every class change, Oehler made a point of performing mind-bending stunts that left onlookers with their mouths ajar. For students who have have never been used as a prop in a rogue trial biking exhibition, they’ve got a new story to tell. For Oehler, he’s just happy to be on his bike, living out his childhood whims.
As students gear up for a typical demanding semester at Carnegie Mellon, events such as this help to liven up a sometimes stressful campus.  Oehler was quite the hit, giving students a short escape from their academic livelihood.

After the first week of school, Carnegie Mellon’s cross country team participated in the Duquesne Duals in Schenley Park. Athletes from Duquesne University, Youngstown State University, Saint Vincent College, Niagara University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Canisus College competed against the Tartans. It was a warm day, with temperatures in the low 80s. Despite the heat, the Tartans performed to the best of their abilities. The men competed in an 8k while the women raced a 5k.
There were several top-25 finishes on the women’s team. Junior Emily Wobb took home fourth place with a time of 18:46, while sophomore Elise Hall finished closely behind in 19:09. Halley Bayer made her mark as a first-year, crossing the finish line in 20:28 and placing 20th. Finally, sophomore Catherine Paquette earned a 23rd-place finish for the Tartans with a time of 20:43.
When asked about the success of her season opener, Wobb commented on the positive impact of pre-season training. She explained, “It puts us all right on track for the entirety of the season, and it’s looking to be a great one.” Wobb pointed out that the team “acquired a lot of new runners this year, and each one is a hard worker; it showed at Duquesne Duals last weekend. I’m ecstatic about the way the girls’ team performed for our first meet.”
On the men’s side, the Duquesne Duals ended up being a very close race among teammates. First-year Josh Antonson finished first for the Tartans with a time of 28:18, which scored 26th. Close behind were sophomores Brendan O’Hara and Matthew Kusbit, who placed 28th and 29th, respectively, with times of 28:32 and 28:37. Junior Ben Finch also finished in 28:37, but came in 30th. Adding to the group of Tartan athletes were junior Marc McGeary and graduate student Jono Matusky. They finished 32nd and 38th in 28:40 and 28:47, respectively.
The Tartans will attend the Slippery Rock Invitational next Friday at Cooper’s Lake Campground. The women’s team competition will start at 5 p.m., followed by the men’s team, which will start at 5:45 p.m.

With only the preseason and the first week of class under their belts, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team hit the road last weekend to compete at the Ohio Northern University Invitational in Ada, Ohio. The Tartans played two games on both Friday and Saturday, coming out of the tournament with a record of 2–2. This past Wednesday, the Tartans hosted Marietta College and defeated the Pioneers 3–0.
In the Ohio Northern Tournament, the Tartans started off strong by topping Defiance College 3–1. Next, the Tartans faced the challenge brought by the No. 12 seed Heidelberg University. Heidelberg topped The Tartans 3–0. The Tartans struggled in their next game, suffering a 3–2 loss to Ohio Northern University. The Tartans returned to the court for their fourth game of the weekend and clinched a 3–2 victory over Trine University to end the weekend on a positive note.
“There are three freshmen on the team this year,” said sophomore Amy Friedman. “[A]nd as we get more comfortable on the court together our team continues to get stronger. I think we proved that with our win on Wednesday.”
The first-years are making their mark on the team. First-year Ali Celentano has had at least 6 kills each game — she put up ten against Ohio Northern. Sophomore Senna Parsa had a team-high in kills with 16 during the rally against Ohio Northern. On the defensive end senior Emily Baddock has been consistently good this season. Baddock has had at least 7 digs per game, with a high of 21 digs against Ohio Northern. 
Sophomore Emily Wright has been a great asset to the Tartans in the transition game as she has had between 20 and 30 assists per game. Wright had 36 assists and 23 against Ohio Northern and Trine respectively and had a game high 19 assists against Marietta.
This Tuesday, the Tartans host St. Vincent College in Skibo Gym. The Tartans will look to improve their regular season record.

People often separate the fields of science and art from one another with a metaphorical brick wall; scientists on one side may not even consider the possibility of working with the artists on the other side, or vice versa. Science can encompass anything relating to the study of the natural and physical world, and there are rules: for instance, the scientific method, a centuries-old practice used universally to test hypotheses and observe nature. Art, by contrast, is thought to have few rules — no limits. The process of creating art is often much more liberal. To some Carnegie Mellon professors, however, art and science have no such dividing wall.
Patricia Maurides, professor of art in the College of Fine Arts, holds a Bachelor of Science in biology and a master’s degree in fine arts, the latter obtained from Carnegie Mellon in 1995. While she was an undergraduate studying biology, Maurides said that she always kept an artistic performance element to her work. “My focus, just as an artist would have, was exploring identity and those issues,” Maurides said. “My toolbox would be the microscope; I would pull from that.”
Maurides has taught and currently teaches a course called Art and Biology that fuses the two seemingly polarized fields of study together. 
Ashley Baker, a senior art and humanities student who recently took the course, created photographs that expressed her perception of her migraines. 
“Up until that point, a lot of my photography had been straightforward ... I wanted to do something more abstract, and this was the perfect way to do that — to try to show that pain that you really can’t describe in words,” Baker said. “I think this project taught me to look at things differently because there are a lot of different perceptions. It’s true that everyone really does see things differently, and art is a super powerful way to show how you see the world.”
This semester, Maurides is teaming up with Marlene Behrmann, director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Carnegie Mellon. Together, they will teach a digital photography class that focuses on perception — how the brain interprets what it sees. Maurides emphasized the importance of people leaving their comfort-zones, and she claimed that that’s exactly what she and Behrmann were doing in creating this course. 
Throughout the semester, the students will have discussions on both sight and the brain, and they recently engaged in an activity that one may not typically associate with the art studio: dissecting sheep eyes and brains. 
Maurides explained that the dissection gives the students an opportunity to have hands-on experience, and she hopes it provides a catalyst for creating images.
“Some of them may find this as a metaphor for something else in their life; some of them may just be disgusted because it’s so visceral, and that’s okay, and maybe they create work about that, but it will be their visual reflection on the experience on dissection. It becomes very real,” Maurides said.
At the dissection, which took place last Thursday, the students of the digital photography class could have been mistaken for biology students. Equipped with latex gloves, scalpels, and cutting boards, they explored the different parts of the sheep eyes for about an hour, encouraged to keep in mind the idea of perception.
“Even though I do this very often, each time I am once again reminded of how amazing the organic system is. From this blob of fairly thick gelatinous material comes the myriad of behaviors that we have,” Behrmann explained to the students as they were setting up for the dissection.
Maurides believes that these types of opportunities, where science and art are practiced side-by-side, are valuable in allowing students to appreciate other disciplines. With no wall between art and science, students have many more resources available to help them observe, create, or find solutions. Maurides said, “It’s making available and expanding the tools for students to use in creative projects. This campus is so rich and diverse, and people are very willing to collaborate.”

In the midst of morning gulps of coffee, rushing off to class, taking quizzes and  exams, group meetings, all-nighters, and seemingly endless amounts of rain, many students at Carnegie Mellon may lose sight of the ultimate goal: obtaining a degree that will help them do what they love in the future.
Many students find that a great way to “taste-test” a prospective career is to intern. Two Carnegie Mellon juniors got an opportunity to do just that this past summer as software development interns at Rackspace. Rackspace is a web hosting firm based in San Antonio, Texas, with a focus on server stability and customer service. With about 3,000 employees and new offices emerging all over the globe, the company took the next step and started an internship program last year. After a successful cycle last summer, Rackspace looked to Carnegie Mellon for this year’s batch of interns.
Gabe Garcia, an electrical and computer engineering major from San Antonio, and Gus Ireland, a Boston native studying cognitive science and computer science, seemed to fit the bill perfectly. They had worked on coding projects before, and they were knowledgeable about general programming methodologies. The pair, along with other interns in Texas, got a chance to work on some big software projects for the company.
Such software projects included designing a Foundation Service Driver (FSD). What exactly is an FSD? Garcia explained:
“[It’s] a one-size-fits-all user interface for any future application developed by Rackspace,” he said. “It was primarily done in Java, a fairly easy-to-use language.... We made a verifier ... to make sure we were getting valid [results].”
In addition, the two plowed through other types of technologies, including Git, Maven, Ruby, CSS, JSP, WADLs, XSDs, and numerous other computing- and programming-centric technologies and languages. In spite of all of this, they never felt overwhelmed. Both juniors indicated that their coworkers at Rackspace provided the instruction necessary to help them along the way.
“That was one thing they were really good about,” Garcia said. “We were all at different levels of programming expertise ... they gave us different resources and things so that we could all get up to speed.”
While interns at other large companies may often be delegated “grunt work,” Ireland pointed out that Rackspace made them feel like part of the team.
“At Rackspace, they said ‘Oh, hey, here’s a project that’s a little out there,’” Ireland said. “‘We can’t really put a full-time person on it, but because you’re an intern, spend five hours a day working on this.’ It’s a different way of looking at internships ... innovation was the big thing thrown at us.”
So what did the two think of their “taste-test” of life as Rackspace software developers? Garcia still had a few unanswered questions.
“I’m still trying to decide between [a] hardware or software [career],” he said. “I was initially leaning toward hardware. I was kind of hoping that [this internship] would help me decide between the two, and it didn’t really. I still want to do either hardware or software, just not sure which one.”
Ireland had a different outlook. “For me, it was a chance to see the business world,” he said. “As opposed to this abstract concept of getting a job, it suddenly gives me a concrete idea of what I can do after I graduate.”
But Ireland also had a few reservations, specifically regarding the prospects of another internship at Rackspace. “I want to keep on exploring, and try to find different places,” he stated. “But ... I had a really good time [there], and learned a lot about how software is designed in the real world. It was a fun experience.”

Invented by German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg in 1440, the Gutenberg printing press utilized pressure and movable type to reproduce text. The iron press was invented three and a half centuries later, allowing printing to be done with steam power rather than manually. Only later in the 20th century, with the advent of phototypesetting (projecting text onto photographic paper), was the process no longer entirely mechanical.
Now, in the 21st century, students can print at five cents a page with the press of a button. Given the ubiquitous nature of modern printers and the astounding science behind them, there’s an awful lot that we may take for granted; it’s important to understand what’s really going on.
To begin, there are two common printing methods: ink-based and laser-based. As the older of the two, the inkjet method is a trademark of many printing giants, such as Canon, HP, and Lexmark. These types of printers use what is called the thermal bubble process, in which tiny chambers inside the ink cartridge are heated and electrified, causing the ink to vaporize and greatly increase pressure. According to Discovery.com, this effectively shoots a 70-micron (1 micron = 0.001 mm) droplet out of the chamber and sucks in ink from a reservoir to replace it.
Michael Richmond, a physics professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, often uses the next step in the process to teach students about electrostatics. According to Richmond’s lecture website, the droplet of ink shot out by the cartridge is charged by what he calls an “electron gun,” or a fluctuating flow of electrons. Before the ink hits the paper, it travels at a speed of about 800 inches per second through a capacitor, consisting of two parallel plates of equal and opposite charge that generate a uniform electric field. Depending on the charge of the droplet, this electric field will deflect its path a certain amount. The greater its charge, the more it is deflected.
In some cases, when the ink needs to go straight onto the paper, it will be given no charge by the electron gun. Discovery.com explains this process, noting that a good inkjet printer shoots out over 1 million droplets per square inch, so even if there are slight deviations in deflection, the resolution of the page will be remarkably clear.
Laser printing, however, is far more precise than its less expensive counterpart. The crux of this technology is photoconductivity, or the ability of a material to be charged (or discharged) by exposure to light. In the center of the printing setup is a photoconductive roller, which is initially given a positive electric charge. When the user presses the print button, the printer’s laser initializes and begins tracing out the letters onto the roller, causing only those letter-shaped areas of the drum to discharge and effectively creating an initially invisible electromagnetic image.
Next, positively charged toner powder, a mixture of pigment and plastic, is sprinkled onto the roller. Since like charges repel, the toner avoids the positive areas of the roller and falls precisely onto the neutral spaces traced out by the laser, forming the letters. Paper entering the printer is given a negative electric charge so that when it slides under the roller, it attracts the positively charged toner onto itself. Finally, the paper passes through the fuser, a set of heating rollers that fuse the toner with the paper fibers. This fusion between the toner and paper fibers is why laser-printing jobs come out hot and are impossible to smudge.
While the printer may not be the zenith of modern science, it is astounding to see how commonplace such a technology has become. Without an understanding of their inner workings, we may take these devices for granted. So next time you press the print button, take a moment to think about the incredible chain of events you just set off.

CO2 emissions outstrip GDP in 2010
The United States’ 2010 energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were published in a recent report by the Energy Information Administration. The year 2010 marked both the largest annual increase in CO2, and the largest absolute output in tons for the past 20 years. For the first time in 20 years, the increase in CO2 emissions (up 3.9 percent from 2009) was larger than GDP growth (3.0 percent), which is a stark contrast to the 20-year averages (0.6 and 3.15 percent, respectively). 
Economists are debating whether 2010 was an outlier or if it signifies a new trend where pollution outpaces economic growth.

Novel malaria vaccine still has hope
Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have shown that a new malaria vaccine protects between 71 and 100 percent of animal subjects in trials. The vaccine was administered intravenously in the studies, unlike a previous unsuccessful clinical study where subjects were given the drug intradermally. 
The vaccine, produced by the biotech company Sanaria, is extracted from mosquitoes’ salivary glands, making it the only drug to use the body of a mosquito as a bioreactor. Although there are currently no approved malaria vaccines, NIAID and Sanaria are optimistic that their new delivery method will prove successful.

Scientist finds fossils while walking his dog
Five papers in the current issue of Science detail newly found fossils that may be a missing link in the chain of human evolution. The new species, Australopithecus sediba, was recently found by scientists from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Lee Berger, who discovered the fossils while walking his dog, said that the combination of ape- and human-like features in the fossil are novel. For instance, long fingers are a sign that the creature was a tree-climber, but a long thumb indicates abilities of precision-gripping and tool-making.

High tech ghost town to be built in desert
Plans for building a 20-square mile metropolitan area from scratch in New Mexico were revealed last Tuesday. The city will have urban buildings, suburbs, and everything in between except for permanent residents. It will be used as a testing ground for real-world experiments in urban technology and ideas. Pegasus Global Holdings, a technology and infrastructure development group in Washington, D.C., developed the idea and will privately fund the project. New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez has already shown her support, calling it innovative and predicting its economic boon.

Carcinogens, hormone disruptors found in tattoo ink
Side effects from tattoos, such as allergic reactions, are well-known risks. However, the underlying reason behind such effects is largely unknown, which prompted researchers from the University of Regensburg in Germany to identify the chemical components of tattoo ink. They identified phthalates and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as constituents. Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors, and PAHs are known carcinogens. Though the chemicals in tattoo ink remain unregulated, the FDA is currently undertaking studies to assess the effects of these chemicals within the body.

New understanding of atmospheric particle formation
Jasper Kirkby and other scientists at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, published a study that may reduce uncertainty in the understanding of atmospheric particle formation. They discovered that cosmic rays, charged particles originating from outer space, drive an increase in new particle formation by a factor of between two and 10 compared to experiments without cosmic rays. The reason: Atmospheric ions, of which cosmic rays are the greatest source, can collide and form a stable cluster of molecules, which can then grow into new particles.

Carnegie Mellon students were treated to a surprise concert on the Mall Wednesday night in celebration of William Dietrich’s gift of $265 million to the university. The American rock band Guster, known for such songs as “Fa Fa,” “Amsterdam,” and “Do You Love Me,” played an energetic, 90-minute set, drawing a crowd that extended to the College of Fine Arts building by the show’s end.
The attitude for the night was set with the band’s opening song, “Barrel of a Gun.” The band played with reckless abandon and noticeable passion while the audience screamed the chorus along with lead singer Ryan Miller. After finishing the song, Miller introduced the band to the crowd of students, telling them that “we’re playing music we made when we were in college, just like you” and instantly creating a rapport that would be maintained and even strengthened as the night progressed. Miller would go on to joke about drummer Brian Rosenworcel drumming with his hands, one of the most immediately noticeable aspects of Guster’s performance, or poking fun at Will Ferrell in the movie Old School.
The show hit its first energetic peak during “What You Call Love.” While people were already receptive and engaged, their excitement grew exponentially during the horn line. This euphoric state managed to carry over into “Demons” and somehow turned a somber and heartfelt song about social insecurities into danceable music.
The high-energy performance continued until Miller performed “Come Downstairs and Say Hello.” Armed only with a ukulele, Miller confronted his audience about mustering the fortitude to change one’s life. Throughout the song, other band members gradually joined Miller, transforming the song from a heartfelt feel-good song into an energetic anthem. The band put this energy to use by following up immediately with the upbeat “Do You Love Me,” a song off of their newest album, Easy Wonderful.
While Miller’s banter was often entertaining, his tongue-in-cheek opinion of the school’s day of celebration was the most engaging and interesting by far. “We got a lot of money! Let’s throw a concert and a fireworks display!” Miller shouted before listing all of the changes he would make with $265 million. In the middle of his promises of “two dorm closets and no homework” and “gold-plated MacBooks for all freshmen,” the band began playing quietly and slowly built up in energy and volume, transforming the witty banter into a spoken word song, ending with chants of “Bill” in gratitude to the generous philanthropist.
The show came to a close in much the same way as it began — with energy and enjoyment by the band and the audience. After the band’s final three songs in their official set, all of them upbeat, engaging, and eliciting a lot of singing and dancing from the crowd, the band went on to perform “Hang On” as the encore. Much like “Come Downstairs and Say Hello,” the performance was not so much a fun crowd pleaser as a way to bring smiles to the audience’s faces.
Throughout the entire song, however, there was noticeable tension in the air. Students eagerly awaited the fireworks display that Miller had announced would happen during the encore. Once they did shoot off, coincidentally in tandem with a crescendo near the end of the song, the effect was magical. The atmosphere created by the bright and loud fireworks and the reassuring lyrics of the song caused the students to explode in cheers.
During the display, Guster seamlessly transitioned into abridged performances of “Stand By Me” and “Don’t Worry, Be Happy,” leaving the audience enraptured by 
the carefree sentiments. Miller ended the show with his desires for the Carnegie Mellon community: “I want you to live with your hearts. I want you to live with your brains. I want you to live with your balls. I want you to take every one of those $265 million and make them your own!”
Miller’s statements echoed a sensation that pervaded the night’s surprise performance: Guster would not be too out of place as students at Carnegie Mellon. Whether it was the quirky sense of humor, the odd array of instruments they played, including keytar, trumpet, two drum sets, bells, banjo, and ukulele, the odd metallic Devo-like dome that Miller donned while playing “Broken Heart,” or Miller’s parting sentiments, it was impossible not to feel a sense of kinship with the band as a member of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Ultimately, the night was a raging success. The weather was beautiful, the performance was engaging, and for once the multi-colored facade of the Hunt Library did not seem out of place. About halfway through the set Miller had introduced “One Man Wrecking Machine” as a “song about going back in time and not f***ing up where you f***ed up.” If the university had the opportunity to go back in time and do things differently, it wouldn’t have changed anything about this concert.

Renowned video game developer Will Wright was awarded the second-annual Pausch Prize by Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) on April 28. The prize recognized Wright's success in mixing art and technology. He is responsible for creating The Sims, which is the best-selling PC game series of all time, as well as Spore, SimCity, SimAnt, and several other titles. The Tartan had the opportunity to talk to Wright during his visit about his experiences, his views on the gaming industry, and his advice for current students.
TT: One thing that Randy Pausch is famous for around here is the First Penguin Award — which is in a way rewarding failure and rewarding big risks. In your experiences, how have you seen payoffs for taking risks, and what have you learned from things you’ve worked on that haven’t turned out the way you thought they would?
WW: I probably learn more from the projects that fail than the ones that succeed. When I’m hiring people, that’s the first thing I ask them — how many failures have they experienced? The people who have just been on successful start-ups or successful projects generally haven’t learned that much. It’s somebody who’s been through two or three failed start-ups.... It’s really kind of amazing if they’ve learned lessons from those. [They have] much more street smarts.
The kind of stuff we do with simulation [games] encourages failure-based learning, which is something that schools — something that traditional education typically tries to protect the students from. So I think failure-based learning is extremely effective. It used to be like the old model — you would be an apprentice of somebody, and you’d build chairs, and you’d build 100 bad chairs, and over time you’d get better and better and better — and then we kind of reversed it, and instead we send you to school. We’re not going to let you build a chair at all. We’re going to teach you how not to build a bad chair. And so they drill you with all these rules of thumb, and formal structures about how to avoid failure, but you never grew up experiencing it.
TT: Going off of that, related to _Spore, which is your most recent big project — if you’d had more time or more resources to push that, what's somewhere you think you could have gone with that, that you just didn’t get around to doing?_
WW: I think if we’d known the audience that it was really going to connect with, we would have aimed it younger, because it really clicked with a younger audience than I was expecting. Which isn’t the first time that’s happened — it happened with SimAnt as well. I think that if we really wanted to hit that older demographic we would have gone for deeper, more emergent gameplay across levels. I think we realized from the very beginning that in every level, if the possibilities open wider and wider and wider, most of that space the player was using would be unplayable. Which is why we had to kind of constrain it, you know, from stage to stage. 
But for young people — they were enjoying more of the creative aspects. It was amazing how many players were really into Spore that were like 3 years old. And they would be sitting on their parent’s lap, with the Creature Creator, telling the parent, oh, ‘Give it two heads!’ and ‘Give it five arms!’ you know, and you had this kid with incredible imagination, and you had a parent with hand-eye coordination driving the mouse, and it was a good synergy between the two.
TT: Yeah, I guess the kid is then watching their character in almost a movie.
WW: Just having it come to life was delightful for them, almost absent gameplay. But also they were just building these crazy creatures that the adults would never think to build. 
TT: Where do you see your kind of games — simulator-type games — being five or 10 years down the road?
WW: I think you’ll see more games kind of like that, basically taking a slice of society, of the world, and turning it into a toy. Very playful. We’re seeing a lot of these things now, in different directions, whether it’s Farmville, or something like that, or a cooking game on the Wii. These are games more about reality than they are about dungeons and dragons. But also we’re seeing a huge spread in demographics. We’re seeing women play games, or older people or younger people. Just the demographics [are] exploding now, so we’ll see different kinds of flavors of simulation that we haven’t seen before.
TT: With the big push into 3-D gaming and also motion-based gaming, do you see that as contributing to that [expansion], or working separately?
WW: I think they’re kind of orthogonal. I think we’re seeing diversification across almost every dimension of the platforms, the demographics, the game genres — they’re all just kind of exploding right now. There’s a strong indie game scene, there’s strong programs like here, at CMU. Whole new crops of people are coming into the field that are very skilled and qualified, right out of the gate. Whereas in my generation it was a few people, just kind of learning on our own, through a lot of failure. So it was more of a trickle. 
TT: One thing that a lot of students here, especially, have — they have a lot of really innovative, crazy game ideas. What would be your advice for them to [advance] those things to be reality?
WW: Well, I think as a designer you have to kind of be the champion of a project. So you have to learn to be very persistent. Usually if I have an idea and I tell people about my idea and they say, ‘Oh, that’s a great idea,’ then I get less interested in it. It’s when everybody pushes back on me and says ‘That’s crazy; you can’t do that’ or ‘That wouldn’t work,’ you know, that’s when I get really stubborn about it. And I think that’s a quality that if they do have a really strange new game idea, they have to learn to fight for it. And, you know, find ways to make it happen. It’s actually more satisfying, and it’ll end up being a better game with more people pushing back on you.

Attention, Carnegie Mellon students: A revolutionary new service has become available to music listeners across the nation. The name of this innovation is Spotify.
Spotify is a music streaming service that allows listeners to search and play songs from an impressively large variety of record labels. This selection of music includes about 15 million tracks, which means users can find almost any song from any album, by any artist. One exciting aspect of Spotify is that users are allowed to listen nearly instantly not to just a sample of the song, but to the entire, full-length song for free. The other incredible part is that all of it is legal. According to Wired, “Those who have tried Spotify know it’s like a magical version of iTunes in which you’ve already bought every song in the world.”
Spotify is easy to navigate, and searching for and playing songs is simple. There is no waiting for songs to download; it is as easy as one click. Listeners can hear almost any song they want whenever they want, make playlists of their own music files from their hard drive or iTunes library, and share music through social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. Spotify’s music library is a compilation of both the user’s music and its own extensive music collection. With all music libraries collected in one place and the ability to connect to a social networking site, it is easy to share music with friends.
On the side bar of the homepage, there is a “What’s New” tab so users can be up to date on the latest music. The “Top Lists” tab shows the most popular music, and the “Feed” tab shows music shared among friends and Spotify news. There is also the music library and all playlists, including the “Starred” playlist, to which any song can be added in order to create a massive collection of every song that the user wants. It is also possible to rewind or fast forward to any part of a song, and of course to replay it as many times as the user wants. One other helpful feature is the filter tool, which allows the user to type in criteria to filter music from any playlist or search results.
Although there are many benefits of the free service, there are also some limitations that are a bit disappointing. Listeners can only listen to the same song five times per month, with a maximum of 10 hours of music per month after a certain time period. However, paid subscribers enjoy more enticing features. Users of Unlimited or Premium Service enjoy an advertisement-free version of the service, an unlimited number of playbacks, and an unlimited number of hours of music streaming. Premium users also have a mobile service, by which subscribers are able to sync all their favorite playlists from Spotify to their mobile devices. Premium users also have an offline mode, which allows them to listen to music without internet access.
This creative music service is certain to change the way we share and listen to music. The service is an accessible — and legal — alternative to pirating music. Many music listeners are willing to search through files of mediocre quality, risk downloading viruses, and wait for a long duration of time to download songs illegally as long as the music is free and accessible. Spotify presents everyone with plenty of music at their disposal instantly, with no painfully slow downloads, no viruses, and no guilty conscience.
It is an ingenious concept, and it has already received significant acclaim. Billboard.biz praised Spotify, saying, “Spotify makes music fun again, just like the iPod did nearly 10 years ago.” Recorded music has come from vinyl records to tapes, to CDs to music files, and now it has reached music streaming so that music is easier to access than ever before. Thanks to Spotify, listening to music will never be the same.

It’s hard to resist seeing a movie surrounded by controversy; curiosity is even greater when the movie is based on an internationally best-selling book. Such is Kathrynn Stockett’s The Help, adapted for screen by her childhood friend Tate Taylor and featuring Emma Stone (Easy A), Broadway actress Viola Davis, and Bryce Dallas Howard (The Twilight Saga). Though The Help was harshly criticized for its occasionally unflattering portrayal of hired help, it opened to good reviews and critics recognized that at the heart of the movie is a story powerful enough to leave its mark on the global box office — a $125 million mark, to be exact.
The film follows liberal Eugenia “Skeeter” Phelan (Emma Stone) on her journey to uncover the secrets of white Jackson, Miss. households during the segregated civil rights era. She is one of the South’s few college-educated women, and is an aspiring journalist trying to prove her potential to male employers while fitting in among the traditional world of women. Her daring collection of the local maids’ raw revelations send Southern society into a panic after their harsh prejudices are exposed and published for the world to judge. As a result, Skeeter’s risky collection of stories threatens the safety of her family, the hired help, and a deeply flawed way of thinking during a time of social and political unrest.
The Help is structured around Aibileen’s (Viola Davis) point of view as she and her coworkers privately disclose their stories of pain, joy, and survival as second class citizens. Aibileen is a compassionate maid who supports and nannies neglected children, steering the film clear of a bitter and unpleasant narrative, while the supporting cast balances moments of heavy reflection with sophisticated comic relief. Standout stars are Octavia Spencer as Minnie, the sassy, no-nonsense “help” on a quest for revenge on her old mistress Hilly Holbrook (Dallas-Howard), and Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote, the ditzy and naïve housewife isolated from southern high society by a feud of the past. Hilly is quickly identified as the demanding debutante with an exaggerated sense of entitlement and condescending gaze, who is duly rewarded by the clever Minnie in an act that is forever referred to as “The Terrible Awful” (and it is terrible).
Despite the film’s positive reception, some audiences are offended by the message The Help sends. Organizations and boycott petitions criticize the movie for perpetuating a long-standing Hollywood tradition of casting actors of color in servile roles opposite heroic, good-natured whites. While it is true that The Help blatantly uses this dynamic to its advantage, it does not glorify the mentality of the South. The film treats each character with a measure of integrity and the general tone is disapproving of corrupt actions (while celebrating charitable ones — nod to a wonderful scene involving Hilly’s mother). The Help may not be the most pleasant reminder of America’s past, but it does its best to not alienate one group or audience with its sensitive depiction of racial relationships. Hopefully the film’s global success will draw attention to Hollywood’s internal issues that deserve to be addressed by executives and audiences alike.
There are scenes worth applauding for their brilliant performances and tragic moments of loss and despair. Both sides of the social strata are given fair insight and attention in complex situations. Real civil rights events like the assassination of Medgar Evans are touched upon carefully to keep the story in context while showing their struggle on a larger scale. Overall, The Help is a decent attempt at a racially conscious film that explores American history and appreciates the small victories that resulted in the revolution of a nation.

Many Harry Potter fans desperately wished for a Hogwarts acceptance letter for their 11th birthday, only to be bitterly disappointed. Now, over 10 years after Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was first published, Harry Potter fans are eagerly awaiting a different sort of acceptance letter: the opportunity to register for Pottermore, an interactive online website developed by J.K. Rowling alongside Sony and digital agency TH_NK. Although the website doesn’t open to the public until October, fans who completed a “Magic Quill Challenge” on the website in early August were allowed to register early; 1 million fans will be selected to access the site early in its beta stage.
Pottermore takes its users through each Harry Potter book chapter by chapter. Each chapter has several “Moments,” interactive illustrations of scenes from that chapter, into which users can navigate and from which they can occasionally collect items, such as books, potion ingredients, or Galleons. Along the way, users can discover special content that Rowling wrote about some of the characters; they can save this character information or particular chapters in their “Favourites.” This special content is currently the most compelling feature of Pottermore. One of the reasons Harry Potter fans love the series so much is the amount of care and detail Rowling put into creating the wizarding universe, and the special content reveals the thorough backstory she created for the wizarding world. The story provided about Professor McGonagall, for instance, is beautifully detailed and touching, guaranteeing that fans will see her in a whole new light.
As Harry Potter gains access to the wizarding world in the first book, so, too, do Pottermore users; when Harry goes to Ollivander’s Wand Shop in chapter five, the Pottermore user also receives a wand — complete with information about what the wood type and wand core signify — and the Pottermore user is sorted into a Hogwarts house alongside Harry. Users can brew potions or duel other users to earn house points in an attempt to win the House Cup.
Despite these attempts to immerse users into the world of Harry Potter, Pottermore doesn’t quite live up to expectations. For one, the ability to interact with each Moment is frustratingly limited; although they are beautifully illustrated, and have the occasional Galleon or book that a user can collect, after a while, it feels like one is merely scrolling through pictures just to find Rowling’s special content. Also, there aren’t many ways for Pottermore users to truly interact — although users can add one another as friends, they have no way of directly communicating with one another. The common rooms for the houses have just one list of comments that house members have made, with no way for members to directly respond to each other or have actual conversations. This might have been done on purpose in an attempt to protect users — Rowling has stated that she wanted Pottermore to be a safe environment for all ages — but it prevents a true sense of community from developing, without which Pottermore’s users will probably start to neglect the site once they have gone through all the books and the novelty has worn off.
The website is still in beta, however, and hopefully as Pottermore further develops and adjusts to the feedback it receives from users, it can flourish into an online experience that can fully do justice to the magic of the Harry Potter series.

Last spring, along with several other Carnegie Mellon students, I participated in the Washington Semester Program at Georgetown University. The experience was nothing short of incredible — I loved being surrounded by people who were so interested in and informed about politics, policy, international affairs, and all the other topics centered in D.C. Being able to witness national and international events first-hand, such as the government’s near-shutdown and the announcement of Osama bin Laden’s death, was an amazing learning experience that will influence the rest of my academic and professional career.
My internship was probably the most important part of my experience in D.C. I worked at the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a government agency formed in 2005 by President Bush to distribute foreign aid in a more impactful way and to hold governments more accountable than USAID’s model. I worked in the Department of Private Sector Initiatives, which works to encourage public-private partnerships in our invested projects and encourages American companies to make investments that would allow the impact of our projects to continue, even after MCC had used up all its funding for the project.
Specifically, I worked on projects in Namibia, Malawi, and Ghana. I was most involved in the Namibia project, which focused on Indigenous Natural Products (INPs). These products, mostly roots and fruits, can only be found in certain parts of Southern Africa and are often gathered by Namibian women to earn extra income. MCC was asked to help figure out some potential methods of streamlining the supply chain of gatherers, aggregators, exporters, and importers. I conducted research on which U.S. markets would be the easiest and most profitable to enter (for example, many of these INPs could be used in cosmetics, various food products, herbal medicines, or as components of industrial processes). After gathering the information, I gave a presentation on barriers to entry into each of these markets and possible marketing strategies for each of these markets.
One really cool part of my internship was getting to attend conferences and meetings led by international development professionals from all over D.C., especially those focused in African agricultural development, which was my boss’s specialty. I learned a lot about the roles of governments, banks, small and large farmers, agricultural businesses, and technology in agricultural development, but mostly I learned just how much I didn’t know about the subject. I hope to make my future career in economic development, so this internship was an eye-opening experience that taught me a great deal about how governments and NGOs interact with developing countries.
In addition to the internship, the academics at Georgetown were great. My favorite parts were having constant access to high-quality (and often famous) guest speakers and the intriguing field trips. I also really enjoyed the independent research project, where I got the chance to research a topic closely related to my internship and hopefully to my future career, which was the role of China in African development. And, despite having never heard of “public diplomacy” before getting to Georgetown and being unsure how I ended up in such a class, I ended up really enjoying my academic seminar on the topic.
Public diplomacy refers to the government’s efforts to shape the public’s opinion of the U.S. in foreign countries. in In my public diplomacy class, I learned about how the U.S. conducts its public diplomacy and got to interact with people from interesting, diverse backgrounds, such as Voice of America, the Department of International Information Programs, and the Art in Embassies program. We also got the chance to visit various embassies to find out how they conduct their own public diplomacy in the United States, which was my favorite part of the course.
I even got a summer internship in the public diplomacy field, and spent the summer working in the Office of Public Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador. That internship was lots of fun and hugely informative, and my Washington Semester experience really allowed me to hit the ground running when I got to El Salvador. The information I picked up in D.C. about embassies, the Foreign Service, and public diplomacy was invaluable and made my transition to working in El Salvador much smoother. While I was there, I even got to visit an MCC project site and sent pictures back to my old boss in D.C.
I sometimes get a little nostalgic for the time I spent in D.C., but I know I’ll be back there again in the future. After such an awesome semester there, I know I won’t be able to stay away for too long.

Unloved by her father and despised by all around her, the Wicked Witch of the West still managed to charm Pittsburgh last Thursday night. Last week marked the return of Broadway Across America’s production of Wicked to Pittsburgh, bringing Elphaba, Glinda, and all the wonders of Oz to the Benedum Center for the first time since 2008.
Wicked portrays an alternate version of the classic story of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Instead of following Dorothy, the musical focuses on the villain of the original tale, Elphaba (Anne Brummel), better known as the Wicked Witch of the West. Instead of being characterized as heartless, Elphaba is portrayed as misunderstood, forever in the shadow of her rival and later friend, the flashy blonde Glinda (Natalie Daradich). Although it is based on a 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire, Wicked the musical has taken on a life of its own. It has broken box office records since its first Broadway showing in 2003 and has toured worldwide.
The relationship between Glinda and Elphaba is the core of Wicked’s appeal. Although originally intense rivals, the two become close despite their opposing personalities. Daradich embodied the over-the-top, too-perfect, always-popular Glinda, making the audience laugh with her unnecessary posturing. In a sharp contrast, Brummel captured the cynical, brooding nature of Elphaba. The pair’s interaction provided comic relief throughout the light-hearted first act, particularly in “What is this Feeling?,” a duet about their mutual loathing.
For the most part, the supporting cast in Wicked serves only to enhance the characters of the two leading witches. Elphaba’s younger sister, Nessarose (Michelle London), is a catalyst for the early interactions between Elphaba and Glinda during their time at school. Compared to the strong leading roles, however, Nessarose often fades in importance.
Further complicating the duo’s relationship is arguably one of the most dynamic characters in the show, Fiyero (David Nathan Perlow). Initially appearing just as shallow and carefree as Glinda, this young prince ultimately becomes more selfless than either Glinda or Elphaba. Perlow perfectly captured Fiyero’s complexity, from the early scenes where he wants only to dance through life to the moral torment he faces later on.
Taking place in the Land of Oz, Pittsburgh’s production of Wicked uses special effects and garish costumes that enhance its inherent fantasy. The Emerald City, capital of Oz and home of the Wizard, is an overwhelming rush of green dresses, green hats, and green canes. The elaborate, often gaudy costumes make it quite clear that the setting is somewhere more fantastic, more wonderful than anywhere on Earth.
The Emerald City also features the most stunning effects in the musical, including the giant mechanical head that speaks for the Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Don Amendolia). Meeting the Wizard presents Glinda and Elphaba with a moral dilemma and leads into what is probably the best-known song from the show, “Defying Gravity.” Suspended in air, surrounded by fog and ethereal light, Elphaba realizes her independence and embraces her identity as an outcast.
In addition to the costumes and effects, Wicked’s ambience is enhanced by the varied set designs. The first thing audiences notice upon entering the theater is the large dragon head dominating the top of the stage. The purpose of this mechanical dragon is never fully explained, and it seems generally unnecessary except for dramatic effect. Most scenes have fairly simple sets, with a couple of beds to indicate a dormitory, for instance. One sharp exception is the Wizard’s palace. In addition to the mechanical head, there are also steampunk-esque towers and gears that move around the stage. The Wizard’s monkey servants climb around these towers to add a sense of urgency and chaos to the relevant scenes.
Although Wicked is an enjoyable escape from dreary Pittsburgh, it has its limits. The witches’ relationship is far more entertaining than the actual plot, and the self-conscious Wizard of Oz allusions and occasionally awkward song lyrics detract from any deeper message. Referring to Dorothy’s dog jokingly as “Dodo” rewards those familiar with the original story but breaks the audience’s suspension of disbelief. A few of the songs (“I’m Not That Girl” and “For Good,” in particular) are touching, but on the whole Wicked shines more when it tries not to take itself too seriously.
Despite its minor flaws, Wicked is an engaging, entertaining show, and the cast treats it with just the balance of exaggeration and sincerity that it needs. The memorable characters and musical numbers will remain long after the curtain falls.
Wicked will be playing at the Benedum Center downtown until Oct. 2. Tickets are available at www.pgharts.org or by calling (412) 456-6666.

Have you ever gotten a fountain drink from Carnegie Mellon Café and wondered: Who first thought of putting cubes of ice in a drink, anyway? Or perhaps you’ve pondered the history of fireplaces. Even if you haven’t, Bill Bryson has, and he answers these questions and many more in his nonfiction book At Home: A Short History of Private Life.
Inspired by his home, an English rectory built in the late 19th century, At Home takes readers through a tour of Bryson’s house and, chapter by chapter, discusses the history of each room. In the process, Bryson touches upon 10,000 years of history, from the world’s first farmers to Victorian childhoods and everything in between.
And “everything in between” is no exaggeration — Bryson discusses the origin of corn (did you know that evidence points to the Mayans producing genetically engineered corn?), the history of stairs (Peter Nicholson defined several mathematical principles of stairs in the early 19th century), and the importance of bats, among a dizzying array of other topics. But herein lies the book’s main flaw: Bryson enthusiastically approaches so many different subjects that all the names, dates, and places that he eagerly discusses can overwhelm the reader. This is not a book to read all in one sitting — it has too much information for one to digest at once.
Thankfully, Bryson’s conversational and approachable tone saves the book from being exhaustingly dense or incomprehensible. Reading At Home is akin to sitting with your charming British uncle and chatting about history over a cup of tea. As Bryson takes his readers on a stroll down the long and winding road of time, he enjoys pointing out history’s quirks, mysteries, and funny coincidences.
Some chapters, admittedly, are not as strong as others. “The Stairs,” which focuses on the types of paint in the Victorian era, is about as interesting as it sounds — which is to say, not very — and reading about rats in “The Study” makes one feel a bit queasy. Bryson succeeds most when discussing British social history, for example when he discusses the Great Exhibition of 1851 or the relationships between servants and their employers in the late 19th century.
Ultimately, At Home is a well-researched, artfully crafted book that has Bryson’s obvious passion for history shining out of every page. While dizzying in its expansiveness, At Home’s wide array of topics guarantees that there is something in the book that interests everyone. Bryson’s enthusiasm and approachable tone will help pique the curiosity of readers, and hopefully inspire them to delve further into the more obscure and fascinating parts of history.

Dear Patrick,
The TOC is coming up on the 20th and 21st, and I need a job. I have no idea how to write a good résumé, and I don’t have a lot of experience. Do you have any tips on rubbing elbows with recruiters? Please help me get a job. I don’t want to move back home with my parents after I graduate.
Thanks,
Budding University Student In Need of Employment Seeking Smart Mentor’s Advice, Job, Or Referral
Dear BUSINESS MAJOR,
The first thing you’re going to need to do is pad that résumé. The two most important sections of your résumé are your work experience and the projects you’ve completed. When it comes to work experience, use a lot of buzzwords. “Synergy,” “workflow,” “Six Sigma,” and “cyber-” are all good choices.
Next up is the projects section. Dust off those old syllabi, go through your old classes, and find the homework and projects that sound the most impressive. Next, research all the companies you’re interested in. Go to those companies, chat up the recruiters, telling them what you just learned, and make sure you get a business card.
Try not to embarrass yourself,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m caught between two girls. One girl is very attractive and easy, while the other is beautiful and intelligent. Which one am I supposed to choose?
Sincerely,
Fearful Of Remaining Eternally Virginal, Eager for Relationship, Appraising Lady Options, Need Encouragement
Dear FOREVER ALONE,
Two girls? Well, look at Mr. High Roller, talking to multiple females! You should be happy they maintain eye contact! Face it: Chances are, you’re going to strike out with both of them. You need to decide what you want right now. If you just want to have your fun and be done with it, go for the first girl. If you want something more, go for the second. It seems obvious to me which one you really want just by your two-word descriptions of them. I can’t tell you which, though — you need to figure that out for yourself.
Or you could try going out with both of them. But be prepared for some Three’s Company-style antics and karmic retribution if you do so. It’s gonna turn out they’re best friends, or sisters, and you’ll be left with egg on your face.
Or you could “discover plutonium by accident,”
Patrick Hoskins

Where have the rap crews gone? It’s as if these noble beasts were wiped out by a mysterious extinction. How was it that after 2003 the megafauna of the world of rap vanished? Was it an earthquake or a pandemic virus that took them out? An asteroid impact?
The truth is a little more mundane. We stopped listening. Well, that’s oversimplifying things, but the core reason behind the crews’ disappearance is that listeners stopped listening to group efforts. Granted, there are groups like Lil Wayne’s Young Money, but those acts are not much more than pomp. When I say rap crews, I’m not talking about Kanye West collaborating with John Legend and Kid Cudi. That’s simply a collaboration between the rap world’s supernovae.
When I think of rap crews, I think of groups like Wu-Tang Klan, Pharcyde, and Jurassic 5. The members become renowned, but their roots are in cooperative music, where the gestalt of the group’s sound takes precedence over the individual’s ego. The ’80s and ’90s were replete with crews. It was the norm. While all crews might not be everyone’s cup of tea — and perhaps I’m glamorizing the inner workings of “the crew” — the music that we’ve been left with by the crews of the past 20 years is a testament to incredible, well-oiled, rap-blasting machines.
If you’d like to help bring back these noble beasts, be sure to give the Pittsburgh-based Shindiggaz a listen. In 2010 the group released its first album, Saturday Morning Special. It is a throwback to the ’80s television that the group’s members grew up on, and it is a scorcher. Tight production and raw raps make the album a solid piece of work that the Shindiggaz describe on their website as “a neck-snapping boom bap that meets MCs bouncing off the walls with your fondest childhood memories of watchin’ TV, dancing on top of ’em with timbs on.” Since Saturday Morning Special, they’ve been banging out EPs, albums, and videos. You can find this living breathing crew on shindiggaz.bandcamp.com.

It's Kind of a Funny Story
8 10 12
Keir Gilchrist and Emma Roberts star in this dark comedy about love and mental illness. Based on the novel by Ned Vizzini, It’s Kind of a Funny Story follows Craig (Gilchrist), an over-stressed teen who checks himself into a mental hospital after contemplating suicide. While there, he befriends fellow patients Noelle (Roberts) and Bobby (Zack Galifianakis) and learns about how to deal with some of the pressures in his life with the help of family and friends.
The Cambridge Footlights
8 10:30
In lieu of a movie, go see the world-famous comedy troupe Cambridge Footlights, perform in McConomy as part of its international tour for Pretty Little Panic. The Cambridge University-based group, whose performance is being presented by Scotch’n’Soda, has started the career of many a British actor, including Hugh Laurie, Sascha Baron Cohen, Emma Thompson, and Stephen Fry. Don’t miss the group that The Independent has called “the most renowned sketch troupe of them all.”
My Dinner With Andre
7:30 10 12:30
My Dinner With Andre is essentially about what the title suggests: Wallace Shawn — best known as Vizzini in The Princess Bride — and Andre Gregory, each of whom is supposedly playing himself, have a fancy dinner together. Throughout the dinner, the actor/playwright and theater director share stories about their lives and influence each other’s perspectives. Shawn and Gregory co-wrote the film, which was directed by French director Louis Malle.
Suspect Zero
8 10 12
Before Dexter decided to take justice into his own hands, there was Suspect Zero, a movie about a serial killer who only targets other serial killers. Aaron Eckhart plays FBI agent Thomas Mackelway, who becomes obsessed with the murders and is haunted by his past mistakes as an agent. Fun fact: Eckhart also played main character Nick Naylor in Thank You For Smoking, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination.

100 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 28, 1911
A column addressed to first-year students advises them to not embarrass the school. “If you cannot afford to clothe yourselves properly, you can at least make liberal use of the clothes brush and the thread and needle. Wash your face at least once a day, and take a bath at least once a week.” Was the Class of 1915 that smelly?
50 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 20, 1961
The sports page summarizes varsity results from the previous year and looks forward to the upcoming athletic season. The 1960–61 year seems to have been one of rebuilding, as the swimming and golf teams were the only ones at Carnegie Tech to post winning records. Despite past scores, enthusiasm for all teams in the new year is running high.
25 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 9, 1986
A Tartan columnist reacts to a recent terrorist attack against the United States by deploring the country’s passive response. “The U.S. cleans up after the atrocity, but does not attempt to punish those responsible.... Instead of reinforcing terrorism, the U.S. could destroy it by active retaliation.” Perhaps George W. Bush took his advice.
10 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 10, 2001
Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon outlines a new plan for a building on the edge of Panther Hollow to temporarily house high-tech corporate offices. That much sounds familiar to today’s students. More unexpected are the plans for the building to contain a full bookstore and be turned back over for academic use after five years.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- Sept. 11, 2006
The Sept. 1 death of Pittsburgh Mayor Bob O’Connor leaves 26-year-old Luke Ravenstahl at the city’s helm. Financial matters assailed the new mayor right from the beginning, in the form of the imminently due 2007 city budget. At least the tuition tax proposal is still a few years off.
ONE YEAR AGO -- Sept. 13, 2010
Researchers at Northwestern University inadvertently discovered that inexpensive nanostructures could be created from sugar, salt, and 190-proof Everclear. They also inadvertently created a great excuse for lab techs caught red-handed: Those bottles are for ... uh, research.

Students, faculty, and staff woke up Wednesday morning to the unprecedented news that former industrialist William S. Dietrich II had announced his intention to gift a $265 million fund to Carnegie Mellon University.
The gift, which becomes effective upon his passing, is the largest donation to Carnegie Mellon in the university’s history, and one of the largest gifts by an individual to a private education institution in the United States.
In honor of the gift from the Pittsburgh native and Carnegie Mellon trustee, the university held a surprise day of festivities Wednesday and announced the renaming of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences to the Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
The celebration began at 11 a.m. with a ceremonial announcement in a tent on the Cut, where distinguished guests — including Board of Trustees Chairman Ray Lane, Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon, and Dietrich himself — addressed the crowd. A selection of students from all colleges were invited to attend the announcement; they gathered at the Fence, where they received T-shirts to commemorate the day’s events.
During the ceremony, Dietrich spoke of his affection for Carnegie Mellon and his faith that its students and faculty members would continue to break barriers with its interdisciplinary thinking and complex problem-solving strategies.
“This university puts Pittsburgh on anybody’s world map of great research cities,” Dietrich said. “Brilliant people come here as students and faculty, and their presence in our community adds something extraordinary.”
Initially, Dietrich did not specify for the funds to go to any one particular college or purpose. “But keeping in mind Bill Dietrich’s own interests [in history], we named the College of Humanities and Social Sciences for him, and we expect a substantial portion of the gift will go to support H&SS,” Cohon said in an interview.
A plaque dedicated to Dietrich’s mother, new H&SS namesake Marianna Brown Dietrich, was unveiled at the ceremony and will be mounted in the entrance of Baker Hall.
Dietrich shared a few personal anecdotes about his mother and family with the ceremony’s attendees. 
“One of my more notable exploits was setting off a firecracker in a pencil sharpener. The air was fogged with pencil shavings,” delivered a straight-faced Dietrich in front of the audience. ”Pulling my bacon out of the fire in the pencil sharpener escapade was one of my mother’s finest hours.”
Students presented the donor with a model of the Fence, painted with the words “Thank You, Bill,” identical to the Fence’s actual veneer Wednesday. Following the official announcement ceremony, students surrounded the real Fence for a series of commemorative photographs with university leaders.
After photos were taken, several students and special guests attended an invite-only luncheon in Rangos Hall. Guests were served a three-course meal, catered by CulinArt, and watched a presentation that featured Dietrich’s friends and colleagues speaking of his accomplishments.
During the remainder of the day, the Carnegie Mellon administration surprised students and faculty with free memorabilia, food, and drinks to commemorate the day. The celebration ended at 8 p.m. with a free  outdoor concert featuring the band Guster and a fireworks show.
“Activities Board was in charge of arranging things for the Guster concert,” said Joe Burgess, a senior information systems major and one of the heads of AB Tech. “We weren’t told much about the event; the university did a really good job keeping the various events a surprise.”
Despite the short notice given, student attendance was high throughout the day’s events.
“While our aspirations were incredibly high for this event, I think I can confidently say that it surpassed every one of our expectations,” Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno stated via an email interview. “The genuine excitement from our student body and entire university community was palpable throughout the day. I was deeply touched by students’ reflections on Mr. Dietrich’s speech and by their interactions with him at the morning’s events.”
While the ceremony may be over, Dietrich’s gift is still yet to come.
“The important thing to understand is that Bill Dietrich’s vision is long term,” said John Lehoczky, dean of H&SS. “On Bill Dietrich’s death, which will happen sometime in the future — I hope a while — this trust will be created.... The draws that are coming from the Dietrich trust will be relatively small ... so the Dietrich fund has a chance to grow at a faster rate.”

Although students only heard about trustee William S. Dietrich’s record-breaking $265 million gift on Wednesday, proceedings for the day of its announcement and the gift itself had been in the works for a long time.
“About eight or nine months ago, Bill Dietrich informed me of his intentions, but I suspect that this is what he intended to do ever since he sold his company [Dietrich Industries] about 15 years ago,” said Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon. “When he sold his company and suddenly had this big fortune, he decided to devote his life to growing that fortune as large as he could so that he could give it away. At that time, Carnegie Mellon was one of the recipients he had in mind, and thankfully we still are.”
Shortly after the end of the previous school year, the university began planning how to announce Dietrich’s gift to the world.
“It was Mr. Dietrich’s and our desires to be able to make the historic announcement not just to our university community all over the world in a synchronized way, but also to have an opportunity to share with the world the news of this incredible gift,” stated Gina Casalengo, the Dean of Student Affairs, via email. “Holding the information close to the vest allowed Mr. Dietrich and the university to control how the announcement was made and therefore the impact of this historic news for our university.”
According to Cohon, the news had an especially large impact in recognizing an area of the school often overlooked or overshadowed. 
“For Carnegie Mellon, which is usually associated with engineering, computer science, business, and the arts, this gift is quite a statement of commitment to the humanities and social sciences from a university not usually associated with those disciplines among its leadings,” Cohon said.
To maintain secrecy, not even students who helped plan or who spoke at the announcement event were informed of Dietrich’s gift prior to Wednesday. 
Casalegno explained that she could say that there was going to be a major event for the university, but she couldn’t reveal the exact nature: “AB Tech was pulled in about two weeks in advance, because we really need them to know if we can make something happen,” Casalegno said. “Only Joe Burgess [one of the heads of tech in the AB Tech crew] was brought on board a couple weeks in advance, and all he knew was that we had a concert as a part of a university event. He didn’t know what it was in context of. He knew the band’s name, obviously, but he knew that was confidential. So he probably knew more than anybody.”
Members of Delta Tau Delta fraternity, who painted the Fence in Dietrich’s honor Tuesday night, were also unaware of the purpose of Wednesday’s events.
“The university had approached our fraternity at the beginning of Orientation,” said Danny Kane, a senior creative writing major and member of Delta Tau Delta. “They told us that if we wanted to be part of a big event on campus, then we should take hold of the Fence and keep it. The night before [Sept. 7], they gave us nice paint and told us to paint ‘Thank You, Bill!’ on the Fence. We still had no idea what was going on, but by the next day, we were so honored to have been a part of the event.”
Students had mixed reactions to the secrecy. “I think it’s kind of amusing the lengths that [the university] has gone for this event,” said senior English major Avi Gibson. “It seemed a little over the top, but then again it’s a whole lot of money.”
However, Cohon insisted that, for whatever inconvenience it may have caused, the secrecy overall brought more attention to Dietrich’s gift. 
“We wanted to keep this as quiet as possible for as long as possible, because it makes for a great surprise and gets maximum media exposure, and that meant the story not getting leaked out too soon,” he explained. “It was that simple.”
It is ironic that this PR strategy is centered around a man who normally avoids the limelight. 
“Going along with Bill’s modesty and what I have observed, I thought the hardest thing about this gift would be to get him to go along with a public celebration,” Cohon said. “I fully expected Bill to balk at the idea of having his name on [H&SS].”
Cohon added, “I think it was the opportunity to name the college after his mother that caught his fancy and allowed him to overcome his own shyness when it comes to public celebration.”
Keeping with his modesty, Dietrich announced at the ceremony, “This day is not about Bill Dietrich. It’s about my mother, Marianna Brown. And it’s about Western Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon.... My hope is that by naming this college for her, you remember some of the values that made her life so meaningful.”

With his $265 million gift to Carnegie Mellon, trustee William Dietrich has provided not only the largest donation in the university’s history, but also one of the largest private donations to higher education anywhere.
Dietrich’s gift is nearly five times larger than the $55 million given by David and Marlene Tepper in 2004, which until last Wednesday had been the largest single gift to Carnegie Mellon in the university’s history.
“This gift is truly historic; that’s not just talk,” University President Jared Cohon said at Wednesday’s ceremony honoring Dietrich’s bequest. “Even taking into account the time value of money, this gift is larger than the one Andrew Carnegie made in establishing this university in 1900.”
In a letter dated Nov. 15, 1900, Carnegie announced his intention to provide an initial $1 million in bonds to create a technical school in Pittsburgh. Inflation data from Yale University economist Robert Shiller and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that Carnegie’s grant would be worth approximately $28.9 million today. Carnegie made further donations to the school multiple times.
Also referencing the university’s other namesake, Cohon said that Dietrich’s donation “will have lasting effect in the way the Mellon family’s generosity has had on this university over many, many decades.” Among other gifts, members of the Mellon family founded the eponymous Mellon Institute in 1913, donated $10 million to establish what is now known as the Heinz College in 1968, and left the university a $43 million bequest in 1999.
Other recent gifts to Carnegie Mellon include $30 million from an anonymous donor in 2008, $22 million from the Heinz Endowments in 2007, and $20 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2004.
Looking outside the university, information released by Carnegie Mellon and reported in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette estimated that Dietrich’s bequest was the 14th largest gift by an individual to higher education worldwide and among the top 10 in the United States. Taking personal and family foundations into account, The Chronicle of Higher Education placed Dietrich’s donation as 11th in the United States among single-university grants and 14th worldwide.
Nationally, the biggest private donation to a single university went to the California Institute of Technology in 2001. Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty gifted $600 million in cash and stock to Caltech to be paid out over a 10-year period, The Chronicle reported.
In 1997, the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering was established in Needham, Mass., with a $460 million grant in cash from the F.W. Olin Foundation. Adjusted for inflation, these two gifts would be worth $765 million and $648 million, respectively, in 2011 dollars.
Nine other U.S. universities have been the beneficiaries of private donations of more than $250 million in the last 10 years, according to The Chronicle.
International universities have also received headlining donations. The Anil Agarwal Foundation presented the largest higher education gift in the world, $1 billion cash, to establish Vedanta University in India in 2006. Taiwanese businessman Terry Gou gave $454.5 million to the National Taiwan University in 2007 for cancer research.

As part of Carnegie Mellon’s memorial of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a special panel event was held on Friday titled “Media Memories: 9/11 Scribes.” Held in the Singleton Room of Roberts Engineering Hall and hosted by the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the panel discussion looked back on the media coverage of the 9/11 attacks and analyzed how the event impacted newsrooms around the world.
CIT Dean Pradeep Khosla acted as the moderator for the event. The panel featured James Hagerty, news editor for The Wall Street Journal; Kevin Begos, supervising correspondent of the Associated Press; Rem Rieder, editor of the American Journalism Review; and Richard Snodgrass, author and photographer of An Uncommon Field, a book of photos and short prose on the temporary United Airlines Flight 93 memorial in Shanksville, Pa.
The panelists focused on the global lessons the nation learned from the tragic event, as well as how the landscape of journalism changed as a result.
While the event only lasted about an hour, the panelists were able to discuss in depth the impact 9/11 had on journalism.
Hagerty told the audience members the story of one of The Wall Street Journal’s reporters, Daniel Pearl. After the attacks occurred and the U.S. entered a war with Afghanistan, news organizations sent their journalists to go to combat zones; Pearl was one of these journalists. Unfortunately, Pearl was kidnapped by al Qaeda while in Pakistan and held for ransom. When their demands were not met, the kidnappers beheaded Pearl on video.
The other panelists had similar stories of tragedy. Snodgrass, during his individual talk, expressed to the audience how he felt when he first saw the Shanksville memorial. Before he saw it, he said he imagined it to be similar to Elvis Presley’s or Princess Diana’s memorials; he pictured the Shanksville memorial covered in flowers and small teddy bears. However, the sight he found was much different. He said, slightly tearing up, that the Shanksville memorial was “40 feet of fence” and a bare field.
Snodgrass then went into detail about why he wrote his book, An Uncommon Field, to specifically commemorate the Flight 93 passengers. He focused on what he saw as the passengers’ immense heroism. “Those people said, ‘No, you’re not going to do that.’ The heroes of [Flight] 93 weren’t trained; these were just people on a plane who said no,” Snodgrass said.
Throughout the discussion, the panelists stressed the importance of properly memorializing the 10th anniversary. “You need to walk the line between remembering and exploiting or wallowing in it [the tragedy]. Shed light, not horror,” Rieder said.
Each panel member agreed that it was essential to “use hero, not victim” when remembering the tragic event. “People want to remember something heroic, not vulnerability,” Snodgrass said, when asked about how the public’s memory of 9/11 would be shaped by the anniversary.
After each panelist gave personal input stories, Khosla opened the floor to questions. The first question was direct and straightforward: Would Americans ever allow a tragedy like 9/11 to happen again? “Since [Flight] 93, no one will get away with hijacking a plane,” Rieder said.
Most questions focused on how 9/11 would be treated differently by journalists and, if the attack had happened yesterday, how social media technology would have changed journalism’s reaction.
In addition to the panel, engineering students hosted a “Letters From Home” campaign, in which they collected thank-you notes and condolences for the families of Flight 93 passengers.

Under mostly cloudy skies and in view of a Fence painted in stars and stripes, around 100 members of the Carnegie Mellon community came together Sunday afternoon to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States.
The 45-minute program on the CFA patio began with a selection from Aaron Copland’s “Fanfare for the Common Man,” played by the Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble. After the musical introduction, University President Jared Cohon opened the ceremony with some brief remarks.
Calling Sept. 11, “a day of trauma for this country [and] a day which many have called the saddest day in our history,” Cohon contrasted the horror of 9/11 with the heroism of first responders in New York, the bravery of passengers on the crashed Flight 93, and the compassion Americans showed each other in the days following the attacks. At Carnegie Mellon, he said, “the response of students was something we were all proud of.”
As the immediateness of 9/11 wore off, Cohon said he was disappointed in the way American society “closed in” against certain groups of people. In a university context, he mentioned that visas for international students, even 10 years later, are still more difficult to get. “It would be a shame ... if one of the long-term effects is if we lose openness and diversity,” he summarized.
Seven Carnegie Mellon alumni lost their lives in the 2001 terror attacks. Cohon read their names, and English department professor Jim Daniels recited “Us, Now,” the poem he wrote in their honor. The poem is printed on a plaque in front of Carnegie Mellon’s 9/11 Memorial Tree on the hill next to the tennis courts. Currently, the plaque is also decorated with roses left by the members of the university’s alumni association board.
After Cohon’s remarks, the Carnegie Mellon choir sang “America the Beautiful” and a Hebrew version of Psalm 133. The text’s English translation was read by sophomore biology major Angela Yi. Junior social and decision sciences student Archit Kumar read a Hindu prayer for peace in Sanskrit and English. Steven Pepin, a junior in mechanical engineering, gave the Prayer of St. Francis, which was concluded with a choral “amen.”
The only applause of the somber but brisk gathering occurred when Cohon asked the crowd to recognize the event’s planners and participants. The ceremony then concluded at the Memorial Tree, where Cohon led a moment of silence.
The event was organized by the Student Life Office and School of Music professor Robert Page, with participation from campus musical ensembles and students of faith contacted by Student Life, said Student Life coordinator Ken Lawson. “There’s no prescriptive way that a group of any students ... are going to look to think about this day,” said Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, noting that Sunday’s ceremony was designed to bring the community together but to allow individual participants to reflect and react in their own ways.
Pepin, president of the Catholic Newman Club, was one such participant. A fourth-grader at the time of the 9/11 attacks, he said after the ceremony that he had been thinking about the perspective that today’s kids would have toward the events of 10 years ago. “They probably weren’t even alive,” he said. “Even I didn’t understand the repercussions at the time.” He also hoped that the commemoration would encourage people to remember the lessons of 9/11 throughout the year, not just on the attacks’ anniversary.
Despite the societal polarization and divisiveness that Cohon referred to in his speech, Pepin and Casalegno both thought that Carnegie Mellon had remained a welcoming environment for students of all backgrounds.“It’s a very friendly place. There’s always people smiling and making you feel welcome,” Pepin said.
Casalegno recalled a vigil held at the Fence in the wake of the November 2008 terrorist bombings in Mumbai, India, at which a Pakistani student spoke about her fear of being alienated because of her background. “The way she was received by the campus was very touching to me,” Casalegno said. “I’ve been touched on many occasions ... by the openness of our students.”
Other facets of Carnegie Mellon’s 9/11 commemoration included a panel discussion Friday with members of the local media, and bagpipers who played on the Cut Sunday morning at the times when hijacked planes struck New York, Washington, and western Pennsylvania.

While many students spent their summers soaking up the rays of the sun, two Carnegie Mellon students have been working to bring light of another kind to a rural village called Yele in Sierra Leone. Engineering and public policy doctoral student Paul van der Boor and junior economics and statistics major Tori Baggio are part of a four-member team called ELumanate that is currently working on refurbishing a hydropower plant that will provide electricity to over 600 households.
The team has been working with the community of Yele since 2007 and spent one month working on the hydropower plant this summer.
The group’s focus, however, is not solely on bringing about the arrival of electricity. Instead, they hope to see to it that the electricity brings long-term, sustainable change and empowers business owners and, as a result, the local economy.
In discussing the team’s goals in Yele, van der Boor said, “We don’t go to Yele and tell them: ‘Do this and this and you will be better off.’ We ask them what they need, what stops them from achieving their goals, and often find that we are able to help alleviate those constraints with the resources we have at hand.”
In order to achieve these goals, the group consulted the local population of Yele, and, with their help, came to the conclusion that a central community market, powered by the nearby hydropower plant, would be a step towards the team’s longterm goals.
This central market, which the group refers to as an “eLuma” (“e” for electricity and Luma meaning “market” in Krio, the local language), will enable local business owners to rent a space that is powered by hydropower, and thus allows access to a wide range of accommodations otherwise not available to small business owners in the region.
The group hopes that providing electricity within these shops will influence the types products available to the community, as products requiring electricity were previously unavailable. This includes perishable goods, medications, and vaccinations that need to be refrigerated, internet access for a study space with lights for students, and potentially a station for buying and charging LED lights for areas still without electricity. The bazaar will be 200 square meters in size, with an initial capacity for 16 shops powered fully by the hydropower plant.
Van der Boor explained the team’s long-term goals: “To provide eLumas in all rural villages in Sierra Leone so they can be empowered to generate their own economic development. Yele is representative of many rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa, many of which face constraints to growth, face rural-to-urban migration of the work force, and are therefore being gutted. eLuma has the potential of enabling the microenterprises of these communities to spark their own economic activity and making them sustainable.”
The team cites the creation of solid infrastructure that uses electricity in a productive manner as one of their primary hopes for the project. “This is not very common after the introduction of electricity,” Baggio said. “We are helping develop solid business practices on the most basic levels. But we are not giving them the ideas. The people there have them; we are just showing them how to make them a reality once electricity comes.”
This focus on developing productive business practices for small business owners in the region is key to the team’s vision. This will primarily be achieved through training and mentoring offered by a local entrepreneurial coach, who will advise shop owners throughout the process, from teaching how to successfully start a business to developing skills needed to run and maintain a successful and productive business.
Van der Boor explained, “With local entrepreneurs we identified their four main constraints to growing their businesses currently: energy services, financial services, business training, and commercial infrastructure. eLuma will provide them with these facilities so they can grow and develop their businesses and therefore increase their income while improving the livelihood of the local community.”
ELumanate’s partnership with Ecobank, a pan-African bank working in the region, will be a crucial step in training small business owners. “With [Ecobank] we will start small loan management as well as simple things like keeping inventory and tracking money spent in notebooks,” explained Baggio.
In only 12 months, the ELuma should generate a positive turnover. Initially, the construction of this community market will be funded by various investors, but the costs of keeping the bazaar up and running will fall to the community. Shop owners pay rent that covers the maintenance, local manager, and electricity costs of the cooling room. In the second operational year — when all 16 shops have been rented and the businesses are stable — the team plans to hire a local manager who, after five years, will run the project after the bazaar is fully turned over to the community.
While handing the project to a local manager may be difficult after all of the group’s hard work, ELumanate has recognized that turning their project over to the local people will greatly influence the potential success of the project. “We cannot chose the shops or run the businesses because we are outsiders. We also want them to take ownership of the eLuma by showing them that our gift comes with a great deal of hard work,” said Baggio.
Van der Boor added, “For example, we don’t go to Yele to build the eLuma and run the businesses inside the eLuma. All we do is ask the microenterprises what prevents them from growing, and seek to provide them with the eLuma, an innovative and holistic platform where they have access to the tools they need to overcome those barriers to growth by themselves.”
ELumanate was among five international finalists in this year’s Dell Social Innovation Competition. The contest received more than 1,400 entries from college students in 85 countries. The competition has received funding from a variety of organizations and companies including the Lion Heart Foundation (LHF), PowerNed, and Dell; however, the group is still currently seeking funding opportunities and donations in the hopes of securing the funds to complete the project.
“The lesson is that we don’t need to know the solutions to the problems of a complex community in Sierra Leone,” van der Boor said as he summarized his experiences in Yele and Sierra Leone. “But we can ask the right questions and facilitate to help them achieve their potential.”

CMU’s Reddy, Feigenbaum named to AI Hall of Fame
The IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine has chosen Carnegie Mellon computer science and robotics professor Raj Reddy, Stanford University professor emeritus and Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. alumnus Edward Feigenbaum, and eight others involved in artificial intelligence research as inductees into the inaugural IEEE Intelligent Systems Hall of Fame.
Launched more than 25 years ago, IEEE Intelligent Systems was one of the first technical magazines that emerged to cover the growing field of artificial intelligence. 
Just last year, the magazine’s editorial and advisory boards decided to start an annual Hall of Fame contest as an expression of their appreciation and respect for pioneers from all over the world who have made significant contributions to the study and development of intelligent systems.
“It is always exciting to see that there are people with such passion in a field, and we hope that our Hall of Fame will be a way to recognize and promote creative work and progress in AI and intelligent systems,” said Fei-Yue Wang, editor-in-chief of the magazine, in a press release.
Other inductees into the newly established Hall of Fame include Tim Berners-Lee, Noam Chomsky, Douglas Engelbart, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nils J. Nilsson, Judea Pearl, and Lotfi Zadeh.
English professor releases his new book, Trigger Man
Jim Ray Daniels, the Thomas Stockham Baker professor of English at Carnegie Mellon and a writer well known for his accurate portrayals of the gritty spirit of urban America, has more tales to tell of the streets of Detroit in his new collection of short stories, Trigger Man.
“The characters are a little older than in Detroit Tales, my previous book of stories about Detroit,” Daniels said in a press release. “The stories are a little darker and less coming of age. A number of these are family stories — families that are fractured and broken — and how they re-form out of the fragments.”
Stories in Trigger Man include “Candy Necklace,” a sad story from the point of view of a young girl, and “Clown, Drown,” a paper for a community college composition class with typos and grammatical errors included to preserve its authenticity.
In spite of the challenging situations they face, Daniels’ characters stand resiliently, ready to tackle whatever tragedies befall them next. “They are people coming to term with their lives,” he said in the press release.
Trigger Man is Daniels’ fourth book of short stories. He also has published 12 books of poetry, most recently Having a Little Talk with Capital P Poetry, published by Carnegie Mellon University Press. Daniels has also written three films.

Google’s recently released Google+ and its circles have put me in a difficult situation. 
When Google+ was released over the summer, I was anxious to try it. After registering, my email let out a chorus of dings to alert me that people were waiting for me on Google+. I immediately set to work, organizing my contacts into the little round spaces that would come to define my relationships. These “circles,” or labeled groups that allow for more customized sharing, are pretty simple — at least in theory.
Sister? Obviously she goes in “Family.” 
A close friend I spend hours with outside of classes? “Friend.” 
The kid who sat behind me in Interpretation and Argument? “Acquaintance.”
I hit a wall with the arrival of the third email announcing that a friend from high school had added me to her circle. “Add to Circles?” the email asked. It should have been a simple question, and it was, until I clicked the link, and my circles appeared onscreen. Is this person my friend, or my acquaintance?
Well, we survived high school Spanish together (primarily thanks to Google Translate), and yes, we’ve Facebook chatted a few times since we went our respective ways for college. We’ve kept in touch to an extent, but I can't think of the last time we exchanged much more than pleasantries. With that, I head towards the “Acquaintances” circle, but pause before releasing the mouse button, feeling a bit sheepish at grouping her into the same category as an Interp and Argument classmate. As my mouse hovers between the two, I feel an overwhelming wave of indecision, and curse Google+ for not revealing in what circle she chose to place me. Friend, acquaintance, or something else altogether?
So I closed the window — and now, over a month later, my circles stand as follows: Friends (1), Family (1), Acquaintance (1), Following (0). And the “People who’ve added you” tab, which represents all the people I've given up on categorizing: 37.
I was optimistic about the Google+ service. I love the idea of choosing whom I share content with; I relish the idea of being able to share a joke about bagpipes with a specifically “Carnegie Mellon” circle, whereas on Facebook such a post would leave everyone from my high school wondering what the instrument did to deserve my hatred. I love circles in theory; I just wish I could pay someone to organize and define my relationships for me, resolving any subsequent guilt.
Not only is the process incredibly tedious, but it also underestimates the amount of thought it takes to accurately categorize all of the relationships in my life. I don’t want to contemplate the status of my relationship with each person I stay in contact with online. To use the feature to its full potential, I would certainly have to create my own individualized circles, which I will have to think of an appropriate name for even before grouping individuals within it. This is a problem for me because, like most people, if I were honest about my online relationships I’d have to make a “people I once called friends, but now don’t call at all” circle and a “people I never speak to but feel guilty about rejecting” circle. With the fluidity of relationships, I’ll most certainly have to move people from circle to circle as time goes by — the “friends” I lose contact with will certainly have to be moved to “acquaintances,” while some of the new “acquaintances” I met at the start of the semester will have to migrate to “friends.”
I think I prefer the Facebook approach, which basically groups everyone from your dear Aunt Sally to the creepy guy down the hall under the title of “friend.” I recognize the gross oversimplification of that statement, and can see the benefits of evaluating the relationships in my life. However I’d rather do that when I’m in a contemplative state, maybe over a cup of tea and some good conversation. And while I still hope one day to take full advantage of Google+ and its social networking capabilities, I may have to hire a therapist to help me think through all my relationships before I can finally share my first post.

University leaders revealed last Wednesday in a surprise announcement that trustee William Dietrich will be giving Carnegie Mellon $265 million. This is a momentous event, and we join the rest of the university in thanking Dietrich for his generosity.
By any standard his donation is extraordinary. We are confident that future generations of students will have more opportunities and resources as a direct result of this funding. Dietrich’s choice of Carnegie Mellon is a tremendous vote of confidence in the university’s future. In particular, Dietrich credited Carnegie Mellon’s global reach and interdisciplinary philosophy for prompting his donation. The additional strategic funding that Dietrich’s gift will provide will improve Carnegie Mellon's existing programs worldwide, and it will also allow the university to create new partnerships and improve programs in every college. The contribution is even more striking since he never attended the school as a student.
One might think that a bequest of $265 million — one of the largest private gifts ever given to higher education — would attract attention on its own, but university officials decided to maximize the impact of Dietrich’s announcement by secretly organizing a day-long series of celebratory activities. In doing so, they ensured that Sept. 7 will be a day to remember thanks to a day filled with free T-shirts, cups, blankets, and food given away on the Cut, as well as a high-profile concert by Guster and a truly impressive fireworks show. University leadership succeeded in creating a day of celebration that could appeal to all facets of the campus community. 
All the same, we are a little confused as to why, amid two months of detailed planning, it took until the day before the events for anyone to announce to the student body that anything was happening at all. Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno said that the events’ purpose was kept under wraps in order to “make the historic announcement not just to our university community all over the world in a synchronized way but also to have an opportunity to share with the world the news of this incredible gift.” We can understand that. But content and scheduling are independent questions. It is not difficult to get excited about $265 million once the news has been announced. 
Asking Carnegie Mellon’s famously busy students to drop their schedules at the last minute, on the other hand, goes against the very work ethic that inspired Dietrich to make his donation. As Dietrich said in his commemorative speech, Carnegie Mellon students “never stop looking for a better way to do something, and they never stop working to make things better tomorrow than they are today.”
It would have been in the campus community’s best interest to have had a reasonable warning of the donation so that we all could have fully participated in and enjoyed the festivities surrounding Dietrich’s donation. Although Dietrich’s philanthropy has the potential to transform Carnegie Mellon’s future, many current students might have missed out on much of the event’s magnitude, given their usual focus on academics and student organizations. 
Despite this, we are excited for university’s future endeavors and grateful for the generosity of Bill Dietrich — a generosity that will surely not go to waste.

Did you know that one in four women has experienced domestic violence in her lifetime? 
Or that three out of four Americans personally know someone who is or has been a victim of domestic violence?
These alarming statistics are why I was so appalled by recent advertisements and photographs making light of domestic violence. Last month, as I was perusing the internet for my daily dose of news, I came across an ad for Fluid Hair, a hair salon in Canada. The advertisement depicted a woman sitting on a couch with voluminous hair, cute 1950s heels, a smartly cut green dress, and a black eye. Standing menacingly behind her is a man, whom we can infer is her boyfriend or husband, holding a diamond necklace. The tagline on the ad reads, “Look good in all you do.”
Cue feelings of righteous rage.
As the granddaughter of two amazing grandmothers, both of whom have either had to go through or deal with domestic violence, I can safely say that one in four women would be greatly offended by this ad. When your grandmother tells you stories of leaving her husband because the beatings became too much to handle, working ungodly hours in a hose factory to support four kids, and generally starving from lack of alimony, you tend to overlook the humor or artistic concepts the writers are trying to convey in such ads.
And it’s not the only glamorization of domestic violence roaming the internet. Photographer Tyler Shields posted outrageous photos of Glee’s Heather Morris on his website at the beginning of this month. Morris, garbed in a polka-dot dress reminiscent of a pin-up girl, sports a shiner on her left eye. The series of photographs shows a smiling Morris tied up by the cord of a hot iron, lying across an ironing board, drinking water from a hot iron, and gleefully ironing Shields’ crotch.
In both the Tyler Shields photo shoot and the Fluid Hair advertisement, art was the cop-out defense for insensitive portrayals of domestic violence. Sarah Cameron, owner of Fluid Hair, said that her company “just like[s] art, and it’s also subjective.” Shields also defended his photos in an E! interview, saying, “In no way were we promoting domestic violence. We wanted to do a bruised-up Barbie shoot and that’s exactly what we did!”
When looking at these incidents as works of art, the lines between right and wrong, and offensive and acceptable, are blurred. Isn’t art supposed to raise questions? To challenge society and make the viewer think deeply? Looked at in this way, these advertisements and photos don’t seem like such a big deal. Yet something about the subjectivity of the statement, it’s okay because it’s art, rubs me the wrong way. I mean, I’m sure Ed Gein — a famous American serial killer during the 1950s — thought his bowls made from human skulls were art. However, that doesn’t excuse the murders he committed.
And yes, using an example like the disgusting Ed Gein to make my point is a bit dramatic, but it does force one to look past the straw-man excuses Shields and Cameron make in defense of their so-called works of art. In addition, the commercialism that drove these incidents weakens any claim they have toward being made purely for art’s sake. 
The Fluid Hair ad was created to bring in revenue and create press for the salon; its main motive was to increase cash flow, not make an important cultural statement. Shields’ photo shoot with Heather Morris also seemed driven by commercialism; he picked a well-known actress from a well-known show to make a series of domestic violence photos that he later put up for sale for a couple thousand dollars. At that point, is it art or sensationalism?
Regardless of anyone’s opinion on whether or not ads or pictures depicting domestic violence are artistic or tasteless, there are some hard facts that should be considered. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), “85 percent of domestic violence victims are women,” with most cases of domestic violence never reported to the police. Children who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to abuse their own partner. The NCADV also states that domestic violence costs the economy $37 billion annually in medical and mental health services and loss of job productivity.
Taking the considerable and lasting emotional, physical, cultural, and economic effects of domestic violence into account, I would have to agree with Shields and Cameron’s critics in saying that their respective ad and photos were more than a little tasteless. Domestic violence is not something to take lightly in any terms, especially when this issue affects 25 percent of our country’s female population.

$265 million. That is an overwhelmingly generous, mind-blowingly large sum of money that, if distributed wisely, could make an enormous impact on Carnegie Mellon. But therein lies the question: How will the money be distributed?
As we've learned, the Dietrich Foundation will be formed to administer the fund to the university. One presumes, though, that the university will be able to make recommendations or requests as to where the money could be directed. If Carnegie Mellon is able to make recommendations to the Dietrich Foundation, let us hope that it decides to consult its chief investors: the students.
Think about it. Carnegie Mellon could not exist without its students. While Bill Dietrich's pledge to the university is staggeringly generous, Carnegie Mellon receives more money than that per year in tuition — nearly twice as much, in fact. $472,630,843, according to its 2009 tax forms, to be precise. And yet, despite all the money we pay to attend Carnegie Mellon, how often does the university administration communicate with students or consult them before making major decisions? How many students were consulted before the administration allowed the Roy A. Hunt Foundation to transform the library into Club Hunt, with its flashing LED lights? How did the university decide on the recent changes to the shuttle routes? Carnegie Mellon students pay a lot of money to attend this school; the least the university could do would be to acknowledge the trust inherent within that sort of major investment and show that they respect us and our opinions.
I must admit, I transferred to Carnegie Mellon last year from a private liberal arts college where the university's president was basically the school's unofficial mascot. He held office hours in the library once a week, so that students could come ask him questions or voice their concerns; he was always a public figure around campus; he was universally adored. To come from a school where the administration makes it a priority to listen to and respect their students, to a university where the administration appears to rank its own students somewhere below professors' research and its partnerships with major corporations in importance, is not only unnerving — it's frankly insulting.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Jared Cohon needs to expand his office hours and personally spend four of those hours sitting in Maggie Murph Café every week, waiting for students to come talk to him. I understand that he's a busy man. But I think the university does need to stop and think about respecting its students more. Perhaps if the student body felt like the administration actually cared about them, Carnegie Mellon's alumni giving rate wouldn't be a mere 16 percent (Princeton, for comparison, has an alumni giving rate of 60 percent). Although the university does consult students frequently, it is a select group of students that does not represent the entire Carnegie Mellon student demographic. It would behoove the administration to solicit broader student feedback; to reach out to those who aren't just straight-A students or the 50-100 student "leaders" on campus. 
Luckily for the administration, Mr. Dietrich's pledge presents the perfect opportunity to reach out to the students and find out what they want Carnegie Mellon to try and accomplish with those funds. Not only will the administration be able to better decide on how to improve the university with Mr. Dietrich's pledge, but they will also be improving upon their relationship with the people that matter most to the university's future: us.

With the new season of Dancing With the Stars rapidly approaching, ABC, the network which airs the show, released a much anticipated cast line up on its website at the beginning of this month. Soon after, the internet started buzzing about one of the cast members, Chaz Bono. Bono is the only child of the famous musical duo Sonny and Cher; he also happens to be transgendered, which is apparently an issue to many who watch Dancing With the Stars.
The controversy over whether Chaz Bono should appear on the show Dancing With the Stars is flabbergasting; it should not even be an issue. Yet ABC has been viciously attacked by conservative blogs and fans protesting Bono’s participation on the show simply because he is transgendered. Many fans have made comments on the show’s site stating that they will refuse to watch the show now that it is not “family friendly.”
Even with all the increased acceptance and tolerance of the LGBT community, this level of unfiltered bigotry shows that our society still has a long way to go. It is disheartening to witness such blind prejudice against transgendered people simply because it is, to many people, an unfamiliar topic. Those boycotting the show argue that Dancing With the Stars is essentially giving transgendered people more of a platform and media attention than appropriate. The backlash experienced by Chaz Bono demonstrates that such attention is needed; in an ideal world, gender would not be a source of contention and the Chaz Bono controversy wouldn’t be a controversy at all. But we don’t live in a perfect world, and while the “LGB” part of the LGBT community has gained significant recognition and rights, the “T” part has often been forgotten. Prior to Bono, there have been very few — if any — famous transgendered people to spread knowledge and awareness on a national level. Transgender issues, in comparison to lesbian and gay issues in recent years, have gone relatively unnoticed.
Bono, as well as ABC at large, now has the opportunity to make a difference by bringing transgender education to the forefront of people’s minds. Whether viewers of the show are tolerant or not, transgender issues are now being widely discussed; Bono alone has brought up transgender issues and discussed his own experience as a transgendered person on shows like Oprah, ABC’s Nightline, and the Late Show with David Letterman. 
Bono and the LGBT community have the chance to keep that discussion going, as well as lead it in the right direction — toward positive change. It takes controversy to gain attention, and only then can advocates raise knowledge and awareness.

Many Tartan readers may not know that Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon has been heading a Regional Water Management Task Force to study the city’s many water problems.
From 2006 to 2009, the task force gathered data on sewage problems, storm water overflows, and the like in an effort to propose a viable water management solution to southwestern Pennsylvania governments. After the region’s recent floods, Cohon and Tyler Gourley, a policy strategist, wrote an editorial in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette detailing their diagnosis and solution for many of the city’s water problems.
The gist of the article is that Pittsburgh’s water management is too fractured, with too many organizations overlapping and failing to communicate. The solution: consolidate overhead. The task force recommends an 11-county super-district that would centrally control and plan water management, including quality, supply, flooding prevention, sewage disposal, and pollution control.
Consolidating water management in the area seems like a smart idea, and Cohon’s argument for it is quite strong. But must we wait until local and regional politicians can come together and agree on an efficient plan? 
With multiple buildings flooded at the start of this school year and also in the summer of 2009, we wonder if we must continue to hope for system-wide changes while our own basements, labs, parking garages, and storage facilities undergo annual flooding.
While consolidation would certainly be good for the system at large, we bet it won’t immediately compel the clearly ancient and poorly maintained pipes under campus to stop breaking. We appreciate Cohon dedicating four years to analyzing the region’s issues, but we also want something to be done in our own backyard before campus is reduced to a pile of soggy belongings, sewage, and swamp.

Your free T-shirt collection is growing by leaps and bounds, so find something creative to do with them before you’re forced to relive your glory days, one shirt at a time.
At this very moment there is someone, somewhere doing something that you wish you were doing. Don’t just wonder about that someone; be that someone.
Yeah, I did just see you do that.
Dressing in styles from specific decades is so 1980s. Instead, dress in historical mixes of great global eras. Gladiator sandals paired with a kilt and a coat of iron mail is all the rage.
If the people you consider your friends can only identify you by your post-party behavior, then I guess those are the only friends that you could ever keep.
You know that you’re awesome, and your mom probably knows too, but no one else does. All that is about to change. Create your theme song so that everyone will know what’s true.
From now on, speak only in clichés when addressing anyone in the English department. Watch their faces as they cringe and feel the mix of enjoyment and subtle shame.
Please stop talking and quoting during the movie. It isn’t cool or clever; it is just irritating.
You have set some very large goals for the coming semester and that’s great, but it is the twists and turns in life’s plans that make it great.
I’m sorry, but the surprise revealed last week was in fact a donation and not an announcement that the university had cryogenically frozen Andrew Carnegie and brought him back to life.
You can dance if you want to. You can even leave your friends behind. But if you don’t dance and if you can’t dance, then get off the darn dance floor; you keep getting in my way.
I foresee mayhem, destruction, and just all-around chaos on the horizon — that or just another mundane week of class.
