The Olympics weren’t supposed to end this way. The United States was supposed to come home with gold, or at least a medal. But a day after losing to rival Canada, the United States men’s hockey team fell flat against Finland, losing 5–0 in the bronze medal game. 
Now the team, composed of NHL players from across the league, is forced to pull it back together as they join their other teammates who competed for Russia, Canada and Finland, and who all had emotional games with the U.S. The Penguins will have a particularly interesting trip back as they try to continue their dominance through the Metropolitan Division.
Head coach Dan Bylsma and assistant coach Tony Granato of the Penguins were both with the United States team in Sochi, with Bylsma serving as head coach of the U.S. national team. How he handles the disappointment of these Olympic Games and the massive media pressure that surrounds them will be key to the Penguins keeping level heads and making a strong push toward the playoffs.
Refocusing the team after this rough two-week stretch would be tough even for a coach that is not distracted, but balancing the tensions that arise from the rapid shift from teammates to competitors and back will be an even tougher tight rope given Bylsma’s proximity to the national pride issues at hand.
Star center Evgeni Malkin may have the toughest time returning to form from the Olympics. Playing in his third Olympic games, Malkin was one of the many NHL stars trying to bring gold back home to Russia at their home games. A common sentiment throughout the games was that regardless of medal totals, a gold medal for men’s hockey meant a successful Olympics for Russia.
Russia’s first major challenge came against the United States in group play. Malkin was forced to go head-to-head with his head coach and defensive teammates Paul Martin and Brooks Orpik in a game that, while meaningless for elimination purposes, felt and looked like the gold medal match. After the game controversially went into overtime due to an unallowed game-winning Russian goal, the resulting shootout was thought to go in Russia’s favor given the sharpshooters they had, such as Malkin. 
While St. Louis Blues winger T.J. Oshie became an overnight sensation in the U.S. for his winning 4–6 shootout performance, Malkin missed the net with his first attempt and was not given another chance to redeem himself.
In part due to this loss, Russia was not afforded a bye and was forced to play Norway to win a spot in the quarterfinals. While this game was not much of a challenge, it clearly had an effect as Russia was wiped out by a rested Finland in the quarterfinals. Malkin managed to get four shots on goal, but could not connect as the team fell 3–1. Malkin had the misfortune of going up against his line mate Jussi Jokinen in this game, as his bad luck streak against teammates continued.
While Malkin had tough individual games, the toughest rift to heal will likely be between the Canadian and U.S. contingents. With the neighbors facing off in the semifinals, this was thought to be the default gold medal game with the winner cakewalking to the finals victory. As such, tensions were riding high as the two NHL all-star squads faced off. With several sets of teammates facing off against each other, likely none was more opposed than line mates Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz for team Canada against their Penguin teammates and blue line pairing, Orpik and Martin. 
The eventual 1–0 Canadian victory, while triumphant for Crosby and Kunitz was devastating to the U. S. contingent which, as stated earlier, flew home empty-handed after getting crushed by Finland.
With 24 games left for the Penguins when they restart play on Thursday, there is still plenty of time for the team to try and work past the national pride feelings that Sochi instilled. 
But these players are all very competitive and did not make it this far in their sport by not having a burning competitive rage. How well Bylsma is able to rally himself and his team and get them to turn that emotion toward the common goal of bringing the Stanley Cup back to Pittsburgh will determine the level of success the Penguins have come May. Some grudges are not so easily buried, but winning dulls all pain.

May 2013 was the lowest point  of Real Madrid’s recent history. Having just lost the league by a whopping 15 points and being humiliated by Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, the Copa Del Rey final presented an opportunity for redemption for the club, to salvage something from the season.
What followed was an embarrassing loss at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, their home ground, to fierce city rivals Atlético Madrid. Manager José Mourinho promptly left the club by mutual consent after three turbulent years of managing the club. 
The club was thrust into uncertainty. Superstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo was being linked with a transfer back to his former club Manchester United.
To restore some decorum in the dressing room and to make a run at La Decima (Madrid’s tenth Champions League title), Madrid hired Carlo Ancelotti, a manager renowned for his management skill and winning two Champions League titles with A.C. Milan. 
Even Ancelotti’s Madrid took a while to get going. Ronaldo’s extraordinary form in the latter months of 2013 meant that Madrid were cruising in the Champions League group stage, but struggling in the league and six points off the top of the league. 
World record-signing winger Gareth Bale injured himself just after reaching top form. Madrid were shipping goals at an alarming rate. Defensive midfielder Sami Khedira was ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn ACL and MCL. 
Things were looking bleak for Los Blancos and the possibility of trophies this season was turning into a pipe dream. At the turn of the year, however, a new Madrid was born. 
They have probably been the best team besides Bayern Munich since, and Ancelotti can take a lot of credit for that. What exactly has changed?
One of the biggest changes from the Mourinho era was the sale of midfielder Mesut Özil and the subsequent signing of Bale. 
Özil was Madrid’s chief playmaker and was considered by many to be as important to Madrid as the likes of strikers Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.
However, Ancelotti considered his lack of effort on defense to be detrimental to the team, and with a switch in formation to 4-3-3 from 4-2-3-1, there was no place to utilize Özil’s talents. Madrid struggled without the influence of Özil and the spark he so often provided to create several goals. 
With midfield general Xabi Alonso out through injury, midfielder Luka Modrić and Khedira started in midfield and the likes of new signing Asier Illarramendi or Isco took the third. 
Isco’s initial form upon arriving was blistering, and he was being hailed as the next big thing at Madrid. Ancelotti saw through the hype and decided to drop Isco from the starting 11 as he struggled with faster defenders and was prone to defensive lapses in midfield. 
The return of midfielder Alonso helped matters, and Madrid got more comfortable with their new formation and playing style.
The masterstroke, however, came at the turn of the year. With Khedira now out and Asier Illaramendi not settling as well as hoped, Ancelotti decided to play forgotten man Ángel di María in midfield. Bale’s injury meant that Ancelotti began starting homegrown winger Jesé on the right flank. 
These two personnel choices have paid off handsomely for Madrid, as they give the team a liberty in tactics which was previously not available. 
When attacking, Madrid can play as a 4-3-3 but a de facto 4-1-2-3 with di María and Modric pushing up and Alonso holding fort or spraying long balls out wide. It gives the team greater attacking impetus, while also freeing up the wingers to try and beat their man on the outside rather than cutting in, something which Ronaldo, Bale, and Jesé are very capable of doing. 
With two players in the central positions, the cutting in of the wingers to take a shot on goal also has a renewed surprise effect, especially since each of the midfield three, as well as Ronaldo, and Bale have fantastic long shots.
When it comes to defending, di María makes a huge difference. When playing a 4-2-3-1, the number 10 and the striker are not expected to track back, while the wingers are. However, with Ronaldo being on the left wing and not a player who likes to play through the middle, it tends to leave three players up front and Madrid becomes vulnerable. 
To rectify this problem, when defending, Ancelotti changes the formation of his team from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2, with Ronaldo switching to a secondary striker and di María manning the left flank. Di María’s incessant running puts pressure on the opposition and the winger on the other flank is expected to do the same. 
This results in deadly counter attacks when possession is won back, similar to the lightning-speed counters seen during the league-title-winning season under Mourinho. 
The defensive stability provided by the extra man behind the ball means there is less pressure on Modric and Alonso to do the dirty work, and they can shield the back much better. 
This strategy has had extraordinary results in 2014. Madrid have played a total of 14 games this year, winning all but one of them — a creditable 1–1 draw at Athletic Bilbao, a team that has not lost at home this season — and with just three goals conceded overall. 
The defensive pairing of central defenders Sergio Ramos and Pepe has blossomed again, and the full backs have been rotated so effectively that it rarely even matters which one steps out on the pitch these days. 
With the impending return of young defender Raphaël Varane, the Madrid defense is only going to get stronger. The biggest trickle-down effect of this tactic has been that Madrid finally have a blueprint on how to approach games. 
When squad rotation comes into play, the basic tactics and positions are already laid out for the role players, such as Isco and Illaramendi. 
Madrid have conceded no goals in cup competitions this season as a result, with goalkeeper Iker Casillas showing his pre-2013 form again. Atlético Madrid, who had beaten Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in the league again earlier this season, were soundly thrashed 5–0 over two legs in the cup, with Jesé scoring in both legs of that matchup.
Jesé has been a revelation since the start of the year, deputizing superbly for Bale, and even making his own case to be a starter in the team. His scoring form has been phenomenal, with him scoring at nearly a goal a game for a part of January. 
Ancelotti has not been afraid to use talented players from Castilla, such as Álvaro Morata in the earlier stages of the season when Benzema was slacking, and now Jesé, in light of Bale’s injury and Ronaldo’s subsequent suspension. 
Over the last two months, Jesé has been the starting winger for Madrid in every game and, while his game time is likely to diminish now that Bale is back and Ronaldo has completed his suspension, he has given Ancelotti a welcome selection headache, able backup and firepower on the bench, and a new dimension for his team’s attack. 
Jesé is a player capable of playing either on the wing or as a lone striker, due to his exceptional ability with the ball and his superb finishing. He seems to be the natural successor to Ronaldo a few years down the line and could become the next striker Raúl of Real Madrid, a homegrown legend.
Ancelotti’s Madrid in 2014 have been nothing short of sensational, and with Champions League now returning, it remains to be seen whether he can accomplish the goal set out for him at the beginning of the season — to bring home La Decima. 
Madrid are entering top gear as the business end of the season approaches — they are in the Copa del Ray final and have a three-point lead at the top of the table. It is getting harder and harder to bet against this team winning every competition there is this winter.

It was an up-and-down weekend for the 19th-ranked men’s tennis team as they went on the road to face upper division 
competition.
On Saturday, the Tartans held a semi-home game against Division II opponent West Virginia Wesleyan College (WVWC) in Monroeville, Pa. 
The Tartans were the all-around better team as they systematically crushed WVWC 9–0. Of the six singles matches, only junior Will Duncan needed a third set to get his victory. 
None of the other singles players let an opponent register more than four points.
For doubles, it was more of the same with the top two pairings each winning 8–2. 
Sunday was a different story as Carnegie Mellon traveled to Boardman, Ohio to face Division I Youngstown State University. 
Facing a Division I school caused problems for the Tartans, and they ultimately fell 5–2, as all three doubles matches are counted for one point in Division I scoring.
“Our doubles also needs some work but it’s improved tremendously from the fall season,” first-year Kenny Zheng said in an email. 
The only Tartan points in singles play came from two first-years. Zheng won in straight sets 6–3 and 6–2, but first-year Kunal Wadwani required a bit more effort.
For doubles, the Tartans had a chance to steal the point with their first pairing winning, but both other pairings fell in tiebreakers. 
“An adjustment we’ll have to make in future matches is to start off with more energy as the lack of energy really hurt us in the beginning of the Youngstown match,” Zheng said in the email.
This was a tough weekend for the Tartans, but this experience against tougher upper division opponents will hopefully come in handy as the team prepares for the heart of its schedule and, ultimately, the University Athletic Association Championships in late April.
“We’ve got a few big matches coming up over spring break. We have a lot of work to do but we’re excited for the opportunity to play some of the top teams in the country,” Zheng said.

On Friday, the men’s and women’s track teams attended  Ohio State Tune-Up in preparation for next week’s University Athletic Association (UAA) Indoor Championships at Brandeis University. 
The men’s team had a good day, finishing second-place as a team, losing only to host Ohio State University. The women had several outstanding individual performances as well.
For the men, first-year Andrew Chang set a school record in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.11 seconds and grabbed a third place finish in the 200-meter dash.
First-year Kyle Weaver came close to breaking a school record, missing the pole vault record by a centimeter. He ultimately finished in sixth place with a jump of 4.52 meters.
The Tartans’ long-distance running was their strength, with junior George Degen winning the 3,000-meter run and juniors Elliott Watson and Ben Walker placing first and second in the 1,000-meter run.
Continuing Carnegie Mellon’s junior dominance, Thomas Vandenberg took first place in the 800-meter run with his time of 1:53.38, putting him third in the nation to go along with his top-ten national ranking in the 400-meter dash.
For the women, it was all about their new first-year talent. Sommer Farber set a career best in the triple jump, flying 9.76 meters and placing sixth. A pair of first-year runners, Rebecca Fortner and Ariel Tian, performed well in the 200- and 400-meter dashes, respectively.
The one upperclassman standout for the Tartans was junior Sasha Spalding, who had a season-best throw in the shot put of 10.44 meters.
It remains to be seen how the team and Vandenberg will continue into the UAAs and Vandenberg’s bid for NCAA Championships.

The Carnegie Mellon Basketball teams went on the road this week to face University of Chicago in a Friday women’s and men’s doubleheader. The Tartans went 1–1 on the evening with the men coming within two seconds of a Carnegie Mellon sweep.
The women started the matchup and held steady with the Maroons through the first half. For the first 10 minutes, the Tartans were playing an in-and-out offense with all of their points coming on layups, free throws or three-point shots. Senior guard Jacquie Shaw started to open up the game, giving the Tartans a four-point lead about four minutes in on an easy transition layup and foul, with the additional free throw making it a two possession game.
This run was quickly answered by a Maroons three-pointer, and the score was stuck at 14–13 for the next several minutes as both teams missed shots and suffered from turnovers. In an attempt to get things going, the Maroons implemented an unusual full-team substitution with all five players on the court going to the bench. This did not have the desired effect, as both teams were still mired in poor shooting and sloppy ball handling.
Both offenses finally started showing signs of life in the later stages of the first half, with the Maroons opening up a five-point lead after back-to-back three-pointers only to be answered later by back-to-back three-pointers by junior guard Gabrielle West. 
After another layup and one from Shaw, West followed up with two more quick threes to stretch the Tartan lead to six. The Maroons pulled back to within one with under 30 seconds to go in the half after a layup and their own three-pointer, but West drilled her fifth three-pointer of the half with under two seconds to go to give Carnegie Mellon a 41–37 lead going into the half.
Coming out of half, the Tartans extended their lead with early points from first-year center-forward Lisa Murphy and junior forward Liza Otto. Junior guard Chandler Caufield and West each hit a three-pointer to give the Tartans their first double-digit lead.
The Maroons continued their rapid-fire, three-point offense, hitting three straight to keep the game within reach. The Tartans kept up with the blistering pace, keeping the lead until two minutes were left in the game when a pair of Maroons free throws finally tied up the game.
They pulled out an 84–77 victory with the help of five of six free-throw shooting down the stretch from Shaw and Otto. West’s torrid three-point shooting tied her own school record as she finished with seven made three-pointers and a team-leading 23 points.
For the men, the road trip was a good chance to clear their head, at least to start the game. Fourteen points by junior forward-guard Seth Cordts, including four three-pointers in the first nine minutes, helped the Tartans open up a fast double-digit lead.
Chicago started pulling back in with a three-pointer and a powerful dunk, but back-to-back threes by first-year forward Jack Serbin and senior guard Rashaun Riley pushed the lead back to 10. A series of layups by senior forward-guard Christian Manoli gave Carnegie Mellon a 14-point lead with under three minutes to play in the half.
The Maroons tried to close the lead, but a three-point shot by senior guard Asad Meghani and another Manoli free throw gave the Tartans a 42–38 lead going into half time.
Chicago came out on fire, forcing several bad Carnegie Mellon free throws and quickly cutting the lead to five. Manoli and Cordts continued carrying the team as they combined for nine points for the Tartans coming out of the half and managed to push the lead back to 10.
The turning point for the Tartans was a foul and subsequent technical foul by junior center-forward Matt Loebbaka. Loebbaka has shown a bit of a temper this season and had his passion spill out on to the court on more than one occasion. This time it really cost Carnegie Mellon as Chicago hit four free throws and used this swing in momentum to finally mount their second-half charge.
The Tartans interior defense fell after this point as they gave up easy layups left and right. The complete lack of rim protection meant that the Carnegie Mellon offensive, which had been clicking up to this point, was no longer afforded the easy transitional baskets used to set their tempo, and they were forced to constantly set up out of the half-court offense.
Ultimately, the Maroons took the lead with just under two minutes to go in the half. The Tartans attempted a comeback with Manoli regaining the lead with 28 seconds left on a jump shot, but a Chicago three-pointer with just under two seconds remaining ended Carnegie Mellon’s dream of a clean sweep with the men falling 79–77.
For both teams, this weekend was an example of the play they have been capable of, but for the men it was also an example of the inconsistent and occasionally undisciplined play that has cost them several wins this season.

Herbert A. Simon, one of the founders of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science and winner of both the ACM Turing Award in 1975 and the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978, said in a 1971 lecture that “in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” 
It was Simon’s work in the late 1960s and ’70s, when computer science was still a nascent field, that inspired Bruno Ribeiro, a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Computer Science, to research how social websites fare with respect to how much information they produce versus consume.
In his paper, “Modeling and Predicting the Growth and Death of Membership-based Websites,” Ribeiro created a mathematical model that predicts the rise and fall of membership-based websites, including Facebook and The Huffington Post, as well as smaller, more niche sites like TeaPartyPatriots.org and OccupyWallSt.org.
“This idea started when I read this Herbert A. Simon lecture; he gave a lecture in 1969 about the role that computers play in what we call the ‘market space of attention.’ At the time, people thought that computers were going to help them with the ’60s information overload,” Ribeiro said in an interview. “A website keeps our attention only if it thinks more than it speaks; if it receives more attention than it gives others.”
According to the abstract of Ribeiro’s paper, his models rely on six years of information about the daily active users (DAU) for 22 membership-based websites, including “online social networks, grassroots movements, online forums, and membership-only Internet stores — well balanced between successes and failures.” Ribeiro noted that his research looks at not just how many members these websites have, but how many active versus inactive members there are. “The model is more interested not in the number of users, but rather if they are active users or not. Nobody thinks that MySpace is a great website — it has many millions of users, too, but no one goes there.”
“Websites rely heavily on user-generated content,” Ribeiro said. “For instance, when you go on Facebook, you see what your friends did — you comment, you like, and then you can also share something. Facebook allows you to create content that captures a larger share of attention from your friends, so they will also create content that captures a larger share of activity from you, creating a feedback loop of attention that attracts users.”
Ribeiro’s model relies on a complex series of reactions that describe mathematically how users interact with each other and attract new users through the content they generate. Ribeiro stressed that the success of membership-based websites is heavily tied to how much attention users have to give to a website in relation to how much attention they are receiving from their friends and other users. “The attention that you’re willing to dedicate to Facebook and other websites is a limited resource, and it will eventually stabilize,” Ribeiro said. “On the other hand, if your attention is less than the attention of your friends, this will create a negative slope that drives the website to its death.” Ribeiro’s paper predicts that Facebook has years of remaining popularity, in direct contrast with the widely publicized Princeton University research paper, “Epidemiological Modeling of Online Social Network Dynamics,” by Ph.D. students in the university’s mechanical and aerospace engineering department John Cannarella and Joshua A. Spechler. They predicted the impending decline of the social networking giant, which just celebrated its tenth anniversary. 
While Spechler and Cannarella write in their paper that Facebook is “just beginning to show the onset of an abandonment phase,” Ribeiro writes that “one of the most remarkable predictions of our model is the long term stabilization of the DAU of self-sustaining websites,” including Facebook. Ribeiro hopes that his research can serve as a basis for further research on the interplay between membership-based websites and social capital.
“Social capital,” Ribeiro said, “is a very vital and well-studied area, a field where the idea is that you can make people do things for you like with money or wealth, but not using money, just using social capital.”  
Ribeiro thinks that membership-based websites could use users’ desire for social capital to build their active user base. 
“A way to make sure you do something is to make sure you’re gaining if you do something [on the website] and losing if you don’t. A great example is the way if a friend of yours posts something on Facebook, this person expects that you will help spread, or like, or do something about it to spread the news. In that sense, the website is using your social capital to generate activity.”
Ribeiro recommends that those who are interested in his research also look to Herbert Simon’s works. “It’s amazing; it really gives a sense of how to think about the future.”

Bone regeneration, the renewal of lost or damaged bone, is an important life process, yet it can also be harmful. Pathological bone often forms after orthopedic surgery or amputation and can lead to further complications in recovery. Jeffrey Hollinger, professor of biological sciences and biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Bone Tissue Engineering Center, is leading research to develop polymer-based treatments to eradicate pathological bone formation in soft tissue.
Despite his current position, Hollinger did not always plan on a career in biomedical engineering. Originally studying to be a dentist, Hollinger joined the Army where he began in general dentistry and eventually worked in oral surgery at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).
Hollinger obtained his Ph.D. in oncology through the army, after which he became the director of the bone program for the U.S. Army Institute of Dental Research. The team’s research involved disassembling bone and analyzing its structure. They determined that bone contains organic and inorganic components along with cells, and investigated the use of synthetic polymers seated with inorganic compounds.
Hollinger notes that much of their success came from the extensive funding they acquired. “We had money, we had people, and we had five thousand square feet of lab space,” Hollinger said. “Most of the ideas failed, but we published a lot and we were successful at getting Department of Defense grants. I think I was dead and gone to heaven.”
After retiring from the Army, Hollinger moved to Oregon and worked as a professor at the Oregon Health & Science University and the director of the Northwest Wound Healing Center. There, Hollinger continued his research with bone regeneration. “We had grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as corporate grants,” Hollinger said. “We worked with organic matrices. We had a strong organic chemistry group, as well as a strong inorganic chemistry group.”
In 1999, Hollinger attended a Gordon Research Conference — a prestigious, international scientific conference — at the Holderness School in New Hampshire and was invited to give a seminar at Carnegie Mellon on tissue engineering.
“I had never heard the term tissue engineer before ... I don’t consider myself an engineer,” Hollinger said. Hollinger explained that his seminar, despite being geared more toward medical students, still contained engineering concepts. “I explained how we took apart bone and discovered it was made of collagen, an inorganic component, and cells. I think it resonated with them because engineers take things apart to make them work better.” After his lecture, Hollinger was offered a position at Carnegie Mellon as a professor of biological sciences and biomedical engineering. “I had never worked with engineers before,” Hollinger said. “It took some getting used to.”
Today, Hollinger is part of a research team at Carnegie Mellon that is responsible for investigating ways to prevent heterotopic ossification, the formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton. The researchers are investigating the use of nanostructured polymer composites, small structures made of multiple components, to deliver unique RNA into cells where heterotopic ossification occurs.
The research has many potential applications, namely with regards to amputation and bone trauma. Heterotopic ossification is highly prevalent in military personnel who sustain bone injuries or require amputations, as well as civilians who have major surgeries such as hip replacement operations. In these instances, it can cause pain and discomfort at the site of injury. The elimination of heterotopic ossification could improve recovery in patients who undergo these types of procedures due to bone trauma.
Although Hollinger did not originally intend to conduct the research he does now, he has the potential to greatly affect the future of bone trauma treatment. “It is really the work of my students,” Hollinger said. “I have had terrific students from undergraduate to graduate … it has been the highlight of my career.”

While many of us curse in frustration when our sleek, advanced laptops occasionally crash or when our touchscreen smartphones sometimes lose signal, there are people in developing countries and individuals with disabilities that do not even have the luxury of the technology we take for granted. While there are many organizations with goals to provide aid and relief to communities in need, Carnegie Mellon is tackling this global issue in a unique way: through technology.
TechBridgeWorld — a research group founded by associate research professor at the Robotics Institute M. Bernardine Dias — aims to use innovative technology to create solutions for sustainable development. “We build partnerships with underserved communities in the U.S. and around the world to create culturally appropriate technology that adheres to each community’s vision of progress, and to inspire and train future researchers and technologists,” said Ermine Teves, TechBridgeWorld project assistant, in an email.
To celebrate their 10-year anniversary, the research group hosted a biennial TechBridgeWorld Interactive last Thursday in the Newell-Simon Hall Perlis Atrium. The event raised awareness of global development needs and showcased TechBridgeWorld’s research to the campus community. Sponsors for the event included the Robotics Institute, Diyunu Consulting, LLC, the President’s Office, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the School of Computer Science, the Heinz School, and Google.
Aptly named, TechBridgeWorld Interactive was designed so that participants could actively learn about TechBridgeWorld’s mission through different games and challenges. 
TechBridgeWorld Interactive focused on two specific themes: navigation for the visually impaired, and literacy. The theme of navigation for the visually impaired was explored through different activities and poster presentations along the left side of the Perlis Atrium, while the theme of literacy was demonstrated through another row of presentations along the right side of the Perlis Atrium.
The first challenge for the theme of visual impairment required participants to wear goggles that simulated the sight of an individual who is completely blind in the right eye and partially blind in the left eye. Another visual impairment challenge involved attempting to give directions to a blind person. Participants were given the map of a hotel and had to describe how to get from the entrance to a specific room in the hotel as if they were giving directions to someone who was blind. This challenge made it evident that simply telling someone who is visually impaired to turn left or right is insufficient; successful navigation requires describing nearby familiar sounds or smells, or a specific number of steps to take. 
Also on the left side of the room was a solution to aiding the visually impaired. The project was called Wrist Ranger and is the product of a Small Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG). The members of the research group were sophomore electrical and computer engineering and robotics double major Clayton Ritcher, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Nora Shoemaker, and junior electrical and computer engineering major Vivek Nair. Their research advisor was Dias. According to their poster, the motivation of the project was “to find an effective way to provide the visually impaired with spatial feedback of their surroundings.” The device is essentially a wristband with sensors that can use haptic feedback to inform users of how close the wristband is to an object.
The right side of the Perlis Atrium included challenges and presentations for the issue of literacy. In the first challenge, participants had to watch videos in different languages, such as Arabic, Chinese, or Spanish. The purpose of this exercise was to give the participant a feeling of how confused one might feel while in a country that predominantly speaks an unfamiliar language. The second literacy challenge asked the participant to label the United States, Bangladesh, Uruguay, Ghana, Qatar, and Tanzania on a world map. These are all countries in which TechBridgeWorld has partners.
After these challenges were a number of poster presentations by the students of the course 15-239, Software Development for Social Good. “Last year, the course partnered with TechBridgeWorld and our existing projects to produce free and open-source software products of real and immediate value, from assisting the blind to teaching English to migrant workers,” Teves said.
Students in this course are given the task of creating educational games for audiences with specific types of needs. For example, sophomore computer science major Abdel Bourai, master’s student in mechanical engineering Reese Deng, junior computer science major Madeline Horowitz, and junior electrical and computer engineering major Erik Pintar created the game Dream Explorer for students of the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. The team designed their game using the knowledge that the deaf students were especially perceptive to spatial distances. In their game, the player had to explore a planet while looking for flying bats and were asked educational questions whenever a bat was captured.
Another group, whose members were senior computer science majors Benjamin Choi and Isaac Lim and junior computer science majors Nivedita Chopra and Kechun Mao, is working with Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) to create a game for their Adult English Literacy program (RAEL). This game, called Jump!, was designed to teach English to migrant workers in Qatar and required the user to interact with different characters in the game by filling in the blanks for incomplete sentences using correct grammar. By answering these questions correctly, the user gains various power-ups such as speed or higher jumping abilities. All of the 15-239 projects presented at TechBridgeWorld Interactive are still prototypes.
TechBridgeWorld is grounded at a university that is a world leader in technology innovation and has partners all across the globe. With such a strong community behind it, TechBridgeWorld has the potential to revolutionize technologies for communities in need, such as developing countries or individuals with disabilities.

Time is a relative concept — a human invention created to keep track of our existence. In a universe that is approximately 13.6 billion years old, for an Olympic athlete, milliseconds of the universe’s existence can be the difference between achieving life-long dreams and disappointment.
Last week in Sochi, the difference between gold and silver at the 2014 Winter Olympics men’s 1500-meter speed skating event was a remarkable .003 seconds, according to BBC. Measuring races with this extreme precision is a daunting task that is made possible by state-of-the-art technology.
Omega SA, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, is the official timekeeper of the Olympics for the 26th time. Using new technology in a three-part system, this company aims to ensure that the true winners will be standing on the podium at the end of the races.
Timing Olympic races can be complicated. As racers line up at the starting line, they eagerly wait for a visual or auditory cue to begin the race.
As described in the Smithsonian magazine, the ancient Greeks had a system of ropes, one at the racers’ knees and the other at waist level that would be dropped one after another signaling to the racer that the race was starting. Surprisingly, this system would have been fairly successful in preventing a racer from jumping the gun — or in this case, the rope.
In 1948, the traditional gun loaded with blanks to start the race was connected to an electronic system that launched a laser beam across the starting line which would be triggered by an athlete’s movement and was accurate to one thousandth of a second.
However, the traditional gunshot sound used to start races reaches each racer at different times, giving the nearest athlete an unfair advantage of a fraction of a fraction of a second.
According to BBC, last week in the men’s 1500-meter speed skating event, Poland’s Zbigniew Bródka and Koen Verweij of the Netherlands both crossed the finish line at one minute, 45 seconds flat. However, after a closer look, Bródka was awarded the gold for finishing .003 faster.
In these situations, according to Omega SA, they have developed a three-part system to always determine the correct winner. When the race is started, a sound is played, a light flash is emitted, and a start pulse is given to the timing device — all simultaneously. Racers wear incredibly lightweight electronic sensors called transponders on their legs to accurately record their times. Throughout the race, these transponders provide data of the racer’s distance and time.
At the end of the track there are two photoelectric cells similar to lasers that must both be triggered by the athlete’s skates to record the finishing time. This data is combined with a Scan’O’Vision photo-finish camera that far exceeds the power of the human eye. The camera provides the final ruling on the winner.
Omega estimated that it measured more than 650,000 times, distances, and scores using 230 tons of timekeeping, scoring, and data-handling equipment and more than 70 kilometers of copper and fiber-optic cables.
This system is utilized for many different events including downhill skiing, bobsled, and speedskating. 
The combined use of technology has changed sports timekeeping in the Olympics forever.

This week at Pugwash, the topic of discussion was drones — more specifically, the moral implications of using drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), for military and surveillance purposes.
First discussed was the utility of drones. One argument is that drones lead to far lower civilian casualty rates. While foot soldiers can accidentally execute civilians during raids, a drone can directly target an enemy and avoid the confusion that may occur with ground soldiers. Additionally, drones do not have families, so losing a UAV is purely an economic issue, much different from losing a soldier. This positivism toward UAVs caused an immediate stir among Pugwash. Some members rebutted that a drone may be more algorithmic than a human, but it uses missiles to take out enemies. Thus, while a human can accidentally kill a civilian located near a target, a drone would definitely kill every civilian near the target. In terms of preventing unnecessary civilian casualties, this point does not make drones preferable.
Slate magazine quotes statistics which show that drones lead to less civilian casualties than ground soldiers, but these statistics cannot always be trusted because it is unclear in some cases who is considered a nearby civilian.
The ability to attach cameras on drones poses another advantage. The cameras do not allow fighters to commit atrocities without some form of video evidence being released. A human could remove a camera from their head before committing a terrible act, while a drone could not — that is, unless said drone was being controlled by someone wishing to commit such atrocities. In this case, the use of the drone could make matters worse, as the human controller would have the ability to cause harm without having to experience such carnage in person. Would this detachment reduce the self-moral questioning that accompanies committing lethal acts in person? Is a drone the perfect type of killing machine?
Next, surveillance drones in the United States were discussed. The concern was raised that the propagation of such UAVs will lead to a society where we are consistently being watched. 
Furthermore, unlike a security camera, a surveillance drone can follow people. Is this type of society one we want to inhabit, or is it a small price to pay in return for the propagation of a technology that could deliver books to citizens through Amazon 20 minutes after an order is placed? Additionally, an increase in surveillance will reduce the possibility of being wrongly convicted of an action. It was discussed that if one is a good, law-abiding citizen, they should have nothing to hide. An objection was raised that there may be more justice, but there would be less forgiveness. If one makes a mistake, it is written in stone. This issue already occurs in the online world. Do we want to extend this hyper awareness to our physical world, or is this Orwellian utopia a nightmare?
As with many topics of Pugwash meetings, there was no definite answer to the objective morality of drones. However, there was a collectively deeper understanding of the controversy surrounding UAVs.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that meets on a weekly basis to discuss the implications of science, technology, and medicine in society. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on drone regulation.

Region in the brain gives dogs ability to detect emotions
Researchers from Hungary may have uncovered part of the reason dogs seem so attuned to our feelings. Specifically, scientists have identified particular regions of the dog brain that may help dogs identify different emotions in our voices. This region works very similarly to the voice-detection device in human brains. For the experiments, dogs had their brains scanned by an MRI while listening to over 200 human voices and dog sounds.
Training dogs to sit still in a scanner for 10 minutes was an immense task in itself. Researchers used typical training methods such as treats and praise, but also used more experienced dogs to serve as models for younger dogs. Once inside the MRI, the dogs had headphones that emitted noises from humans, dogs, and other objects like a phone. The findings were published in Current Biology.

Deadly virus is spreading among British bumblebees
Honey bees may be the culprit in the alarming rate of viral infections in Britain’s bumblebee population, according to a recent study published in Nature by Mark Brown and Matthias Fürst of the University of London.
Deformed wing virus (DWV) can be transmitted to bumblebees by two methods. Although DWV can be transmitted between worker bees without issue, a mite can serve as a carrier and infect bee pupae. Infection can result in young bees with severe deformities, including bloated abdomens and crumpled wings.
Researchers believe the virus originally started in honey bee populations and then moved on to wild bumblebees; genetic analysis of the virus inside both species indicate that the virus is the same. The study found that the virus was found in 11 percent of wild bumblebees.

Solar DNA tests detect cancer without electricity
Engineers at Cornell University have developed a device that needs only sunlight, a smartphone, and a DNA sample to diagnose Kaposi’s sarcoma, a common AIDS-related cancer. The device, called KS-Detect, is currently being tested in Uganda. Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a herpes virus and is tested in laboratories using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects the presence of the virus. PCR requires precise temperature conditions to work properly.
KS-Detect uses a special lens that captures the sun’s ray in a small disc of light where the edges are cooler than the center. The DNA sample moves through an etched channel in the devices and alternates between different temperatures. A special dye glows blue if there is detection of the herpes virus in the sample, and the attached smartphone is able to read the results.

Elephants observed to show empathy toward each other
Although elephants have long been observed to show care toward each other, a recent study confirms the notion that elephants can express empathy and even console each other. Researchers from Thailand and the United States compared elephants’ behavior during times of stress to times when little upset them. The researchers observed Asian elephants in a large, 80-acre reserve in Thailand. They found that if an elephant was stressed by some outside cause — such as an angry elephant or a loud dog walking by — other elephants would come over and soothe the worried elephant. These helper elephants would display similar emotions and caress the worried elephant with their trunks. Comparing these stressful situations to a control, the researchers deduced that elephants can recognize distress in fellow elephants.

Iron deficiency may be linked to higher chance of stroke
Recent findings by scientists from Imperial College London indicate that an iron deficiency — a condition which two billion people worldwide have — may increase stroke risk by making the blood “stickier.” Scientists looked at blood samples of patients and found a correlation between iron deficiency and increased risk of stroke. Upon further examination of the platelets, they found that the platelets from low-iron individuals were much more likely to clump together under certain triggers.
The researchers believe this predisposition to clumping may be one of the reasons for increased stroke risk, although further research is required to confirm this link. 
In the future, these researchers hope to study whether the platelets will become less sticky when the iron deficiency is treated.

Europe to launch hunt for Earth-like exoplanets in 2024
The European Space Agency has recently announced the Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, which is intended to discover more Earthlike exoplanets. 
PLATO will begin in 2024 and will endeavor to find hundreds of rocky planets in habitable zones. PLATO will utilize the transmit method, which looks at the dimming light of a star once a planet is in front of it. This process can be time consuming because it requires the observation of many stars. To bypass this issue, PLATO will use 34 smaller telescopes in order to have a large field of view.
The mission will be launched from French Guiana and will operate approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.

This week, go to a party with no limits, no boundaries, and no compromises — specifically, composer and producer Andrew Lippa’s stage musical The Wild Party, performed by the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama. Filled with nonstop action and song, The Wild Party lives up to its name as it tells the story of a tumultuous relationship between two 1920s vaudeville performers over the course of one crazy night.
The Wild Party stars senior musical theatre major Claire Saunders as Queenie, the irrepressible vaudevillian beauty. Wrapped in a scintillating silver dress, Saunders absolutely dominates her place in the spotlight, bringing out Queenie’s strong personality as well as the character’s more vulnerable side. Starring opposite her is senior acting major Brian Muller as Burrs, Queenie’s darkly passionate but abusive lover who becomes increasingly desperate as he fears that Queenie will leave him. Muller’s performance is a difficult balancing act that evokes both sympathy and revulsion for the character.
Senior musical theatre major Zanny Laird portrays Kate, a prostitute and professional party girl who tries to seduce Burrs. Laird, who goes above and beyond in providing the energy needed for the role, is always fun to watch whenever she appears on stage. Finally, senior acting and musical theatre double major Daniel Bellomy is Black, a mysterious gentleman stranger who, despite being the opposite of the explosive Burrs, catches Queenie’s eye. Bellomy is smooth, dapper, and emanates an air of enigma as he seduces Queenie during the course of the play.
While the performances are top notch, the best part of the production is assistant professor of dance Tomé Cousin’s mesmerizing choreography. It is a perfect mix of anarchy, sexuality, and elegance — the very embodiment of a party in the Roaring Twenties. Like Jackson Pollock’s drips of paint, dancers flip and turn, tumble and twist, frisk and rumble as they weave among each other. There is always something to look at; at times it becomes almost overwhelming.
The choreography is at its best at its most ferocious. For instance, in the sequence “The Apartment,” when Burrs assaults Queenie, Saunders is roughly and continually thrown onto a bed like a doll. While it is clear that this is only stage action, it nonetheless brings about a sense of danger and apprehension. The lively party sequences are just as well executed; the amount of activity and motion make it feel like a party thrown by Jay Gatsby although there are only a dozen actors on stage. Acts like “The Juggernaut” and “A Wild, Wild Party” feature exuberant, flawless dancing in which the partygoers move as one cohesive whole.
Further accentuating the choreography is the dusky, sensual lighting. Deep, saturated hues and shades create intense moods — from a sweltering New York City apartment in the summer to a hazy daze of drunken blue. Furthermore, a rotating stage is used in certain acts, such as “Queenie Was a Blonde,” “A Wild, Wild Party,” and “Come with Me,” to show off more of the amazing choreography and focus the audience’s attention on the central action.
Of course, a party is nothing without music, and The Wild Party brings a mixture of hot jazz, high swing, blues, and gospel, although it veers from actual 1920s music toward more like something you would hear in West Side Story. Nonetheless, it still has the brassy flavor and bravado necessary to complement the action on stage. The music never stops; each song blends seamlessly into the next, as if the whole show is simply one extended piece of music.
The songs themselves span across a range of moods. “Out of the Blue” expresses Queenie’s desire to renew passion into her love life. “An Old-Fashioned Love Story” is a hilarious piece sung by a desperate lesbian looking for love. “Look at Me Now” and “Life of the Party” display both the light, fun-loving and darker, attention-seeking sides of Kate’s character. “Two of a Kind” is an adorable love song between a boxer and his girlfriend. “What Is It About Her?” is Burrs’ song of his deep, dark obsession with Queenie. “Let Me Drown” is about forgetting your worries in a bathtub of gin.
The Wild Party also features beautiful vintage-inspired costumes. Although many costumes bear the trademark feathers and sequins of the ‘20s, the crisp, dark colors of the costumes have almost a Gothic feel to them, which tonally reflects the appending danger and dark end to the story.
The Wild Party is essentially a modern take on the 1920s, but it remains true to the spirit of the era. It is raunchy and relentless, and rides on a wave of chaotic energy toward its dark, accusatory ending. The School of Drama’s production is truly a feast for the eyes and ears, and kicks off its centennial year with a bang. The Wild Party will be playing in the Phillip Chosky Theater at the Purnell Center for the Arts through March 1.

Are there times when you feel the need to go shopping, but are discouraged by the terrifying idea of relying on the Port Authority to get there? The endless wait for the bus and the ensuing hour-long ride makes the process of physically going shopping extremely difficult for most students. They often wait until breaks or visits from parents to fulfill their shopping needs. While most people will find this waiting perfectly fine, shopping addicts, such as myself, would wholeheartedly disagree.
What if you need something on short notice? Online shopping is a common practice used to assuage this issue. While online shopping is a widely-used solution, it  requires background knowledge in order to be done smartly and efficiently.
There is the option of ordering clothing items from the websites of physically existing stores, but there are some problems associated with this choice. Stores that solely function as websites generally offer free returns on purchased items and do not have a minimum price necessary to attain free shipping. In contrast, those that operate as brick-and-mortar stores have a minimum amount for free shipping. An added benefit of shopping online is the opportunity to find clothing that is unique. After all, you don’t want to wear the same Urban Outfitters sweater that you’ve already seen 10 other people wearing on campus. Fortunately, outlined below is a guide to shopping online that covers a range of stores to suit any style.
Let’s say you’re a fan of the beachy, bohemian style of clothing found at stores, such as Free People and Brandy Melville. Long, flowing maxi skirts, billowy blouses, and floral kimonos are the way to go. In that case, check out www.threadsence.com, www.shopplanetblue.com, and www.saboskirt.com.
Out of the three websites listed, the one that comes closest to Free People is ThreadSence. While the concepts behind the designs found on ThreadSence are similar to Free People, the clothes are not the cheap replicas that other stores offer. The clothes on the ThreadSence website are not as overpriced as Free People, and are of decent quality. There is also a wide variety of clothing, as opposed to a few sweaters or skirts.
Planet Blue shares this characteristic, as well as the bohemian vibe, with ThreadSence. However, the style portrayed on the website is more reminiscent of the beach, with comfortable wide-legged pants and slouchy sweaters. Blouses with intricate cutouts and designs make it possible to also find fancier items at Planet Blue. This website is known as a favorite among celebrities, including the actress and boho-trendsetter Vanessa Hudgens, as well as her High School Musical co-star Ashley Tisdale. A physical store for Planet Blue exists, but only in Southern California, which is a little far from Carnegie Mellon’s campus. The store’s popularity among celebrities also means that it’s quite pricey. One shirt generally costs over $100, but their sale section is nice to go through occasionally.
Sabo Skirt is another worthwhile bohemian store. Based out of Australia, Sabo Skirt offers clothing that is beach-inspired, featuring bralettes, crop tops, and thin sweaters and knits. There’s less variety in the style of the clothing, but the website is reputable. Keep this store in mind, but wait for warmer weather before you place an order.
Though it has gained significant popularity, the bohemian style is still — as one might expect — not everyone’s favorite. Maybe you prefer your clothing items to possess a quirky or vintage feel, like those found at Anthropologie. In that case, the online shopping sites www.shopruche.com and www.modcloth.com are for you. Founded right here in Pittsburgh, ModCloth is the more well-known of the two. While the headquarters for ModCloth are located in this city, it is still an online-only. Polka-dot dresses, blouses with cute Peter Pan collars, and leggings with quirky patterns are among the clothing available at ModCloth. Another benefit of the website is its overwhelming variety.
Ruche is a smaller, and more elegant version of ModCloth. Many of the clothing items on both websites are the same, and there is a heavy amount of overlap between the two, but the clothing on ModCloth seems more childish. The same company that owns Ruche also owns ThreadSence, but the clothing is quite different. Ruche’s winning quality is definitely its array of printed shirts and blouses found on the website, which are similar to those found at Anthropologie without being blatant copies, but are much cheaper.
Making the transition from vintage to preppy comes with stores such as J. Crew and Francesca’s Collections. While you could make the trip to Walnut Street and deal with the possibility of returning empty-handed, you could also avoid moving at all and do the same thing from your laptop. Websites to check out for something different include www.jackwills.com, www.reddressboutique.com, and www.shophopes.com. Most similar to J. Crew is British-based clothing store Jack Wills, with puffy vests, shirts, and fitted cable-knit sweaters. It can be quite expensive, with the cheapest sweater at $90, but the clothing is also very good quality. Red Dress Boutique and Hope’s are both very similar, and together bear a strong resemblance to Francesca’s Collections. They stray from the elegance of J. Crew, but remain bright and preppy.
If some of these stores sound appealing to you, check them out. You can get your shopping done without even leaving the couch.

There’s no business like show business, and nobody knows that better than the School of Drama. In celebration of its 100th birthday, the School of Drama threw a party for its students, alumni, and faculty to reconnect over dancing, desserts, and drinks at the Purnell Center for the Arts this Saturday following the evening showing of The Wild Party.
The party was a production; the lobby was transformed into a spectacle of bright neon lights and loud music to set the mood for festive networking and reconnecting. It was the first in a series of anniversary parties, with celebrations in New York City and Los Angeles later this year.
The School of Drama has plenty to be excited about. Founded in 1914 as the first degree-granting theatrical program in the United States, the school was part of an effort to develop a higher level of serious, professional theater by producing classically trained actors, stage technicians, and directors that could take the art to new heights.
Since its founding, the School of Drama has changed as the theater and entertainment sector has grown dramatically and come to take a different place in society. After all, 100 years ago, moving pictures were new, electronic lights in theaters were exciting, and the forerunner of absurdist theatre, playwright George Feydeau, was in his prime. As the turn of the century allowed more time and money to be spent on entertainment, theaters on Broadway were just beginning to gain momentum, and the first films were being produced in Hollywood. American theatre was taking off. Theatre of the past — low-level community entertainment in churches, nightclubs, and small stages — was being transformed into high-class productions to entertain a new class of people.
The School of Drama has played an integral role within this evolution of theatre, and continues to be a powerhouse within the entertainment world. In an age of entertainment, we are surrounded by movies, performances, and TV shows. The School of Drama works to allow its students to understand the changing role of entertainment in society, and to be a part of it.
Equally important as developing their excellence, designers and directors are helping young actors make a break in a notoriously cut-throat job market. With events such as the Centennial, the School of Drama builds connections in show business. It helps that finding famous School of Drama alumni is really no more difficult than watching an awards show. This past year alone, no less than eight Carnegie Mellon alumni brought home Tony Awards, and two more won Emmys. While more people have heard of the famous actors that are alumni, such as Matt Bomer (BFA, ‘00) of White Collar and Zachary Quinto (BFA,’99), designers and directors have had at least equal achievements in pushing productions to new levels.
For a program with such deep legacy and such a strong network of alumni, the focus now is on what the future holds. Peter Cooke, the head of the School of Drama since 2009, has talked about pushing the capacity of the School of Drama by embracing Carnegie Mellon’s interdisciplinary approach to work with the more technical side of the university.
The Centennial celebrations speak to the School of Drama’s focus on fostering a close community of students, alumni, and faculty raising the next generation of performance.

“I’m Andrew Jackson, I’m your president, let’s blow the roof off!” (Cue intense rock music.)
Take one glance at a musical’s poster promising “sex, democracy amd rock and roll,” and you instantly know this play doesn’t take itself too seriously. The Pittsburgh Playhouse production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, an unorthodox play that briefly ran on Broadway, premiered at the Point Park University’s Rockwell Theatre on Friday.
The idea behind the musical is as far-fetched as it gets. The musical re-imagines seventh president Andrew Jackson as an emo rock star. The plot loosely follows Jackson’s rise to the presidency, with plenty of live rock solos and over-the-top dance acts in between. However, the musical is not for the faint of heart or for younger audiences. Every scene is chock full of swearing, sexual innuendos, and concert-level lighting. Some jokes rely heavily on racial stereotype as well. For those who aren’t overly sensitive to such elements, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is a roller coaster of a musical full of energy.
The play features a huge cast of characters. It’s easy to forget who’s who, especially if you lack a basic historical understanding of Andrew Jackson’s life. There are two prominent characters that stand out the most — Andrew Jackson himself (Reed Worth) and his wife Rachel Donelson (Brittany Dorazio). Both have strong singing voices that suit hard rock and emotion-laden moments. Most of the actors are local theatre students from Point Park University with the exception of seventh grader Dom Masciola, who plays Jackson’s adopted son Lyncoya.
A historically accurate timeline of Jackson’s life is included in each playbook, which lets the audience compare what they see on stage against the actual events. Jokes are taken to the extreme, with varying results. For instance, when Jackson swears vengeance on the Native Americans for killing his family, a crew of scantily clad men dressed in stereotypical garb dance to the “Sugar Plum Fairy” song. In another case, Jackson and Rachel cover each other with blood in some strange ritual of professing their love for each other.
Although it is obvious that the play takes itself very lightly and that these moments are for quick laughs, such moments could be unpopular with the wrong crowd. But here and there, tasteful history jokes are mixed in with pop culture references. Jackson uses an iPad for Indian treaties, complete with Siri. Jackson’s political campaign is turned into a rock tour, featuring the band “Andrew Jackson and the Populists.” At one point, Jackson unforgettably says to Rachel, “Sometimes when I’m on the battlefield suffering from dysentery and diarrhea, I think of you” in order to prove his love to her. 
There are ample jokes poking fun at slavery, diseases, and the practice of bleeding out. The play could benefit from having more of these moments, as they are entertaining for both history fans and the general audience.
The second half of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson — which focuses on Jackson’s struggles as the President — is considerably less crazy than the first. The jokes aren’t as offensive, and character struggles and moral issues become the focus, leading to a surprisingly somber ending to the play.
The set itself is impressive, accurately resembling a concert bar. But the set can sometimes distract from moments of the play that are supposed to occur at a battlefield since the set is never changed until the second half of the play. Lighting is also notably well done for the small production. At exciting moments, colored lights flash as a fog machine churns along. However, minor microphone issues did interfere with the overall flow of songs and dramatic plot points.
For the right crowd, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is an exciting musical sensation that’s rough around the edges. But it could easily offend, so those with strong opinions about the subject matter should steer clear. The play will be showing until March 2. Tickets start at $18 or $20, depending on the day of the performance.

Turning a passion for something like computer science into a viable career is not difficult. Turning something like music into a viable career, especially in such an uncommon form as the brass quintet, is much harder. But that’s what the members of Carnegie Mellon’s ensemble-in-residence C Street Brass are doing.
“What you see on stage is such a small part of what goes into it all,” trumpet player and advanced performance certificate in trumpet student Kyle Anderson said during an interview following the release of Wop De Wop. Trombone player and second-year trombone performance graduate student Gabriel Colby was also present. Wop De Wop is a collaborative EP between brass quintet C Street Brass and electronic artist Jakeisrain, a sophomore music technology and philosophy double major at Carnegie Mellon named Jake Bernsten. C Street Brass also includes trumpet player and second-year trumpet performance master’s student Scott Nadelson, French horn player and advanced performance certificate in French horn student Eric Damashek, and bass trombone player and second year-bass trombone performance master’s student Hakeem Bilal.
While at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where the five band members originally met, the musicians were aware that their art form held a limited number of opportunities. “The brass quintet as an art form … it’s relatively young, but it’s almost been played out already,” Anderson said. “And so the encouragement to find a niche, something a little more different, was always encouraged by our earlier teachers, but then when we got here, it’s like, you actually need to do it.... It hit us pretty hard, that we needed to start branching out a little more if we wanted to do this.”
Colby added, “It’s not that we don’t believe in the art form — because we do — it’s knowing that, and doing something with the knowledge. There’s so much new technology. There’s more possible.”
The band members wanted to leave Baltimore after graduation but also keep playing together. “We knew a kind of standard path that groups kind of similar to ours go through — or professional groups — is that they align themselves with a university,” Colby said. “So there are all kinds of residencies, all different kinds, that mean different things ... we were like, well, why don’t we just propose that we could be resident ensemble somewhere?” They applied to three different programs and got into all of them, but Carnegie Mellon was their first choice.
“Everyone has other things that they do, but we’re all passionate about making this work,” Colby said. “We’re trying to do everything,” Anderson added. He explained that C Street Brass puts a lot of effort into maintaining their classical presence in Pittsburgh, while trying to build up a repertoire of electronic brass music with Jakeisrain. On top of that, he said that the band members are “learning these insanely difficult, modern compositions that don’t have a place in the rock hall or the concert hall, but we’re learning them anyways because we need to know them if we’re ever going to pass that information along to our future students.” All of the practicing ends up taking at least five hours a day, every day, and both Colby and Anderson pointed out that sometimes it’s much more than that.
Both Anderson and Colby cite the closeness of the band as part of the reason this project works at all. “It’s also kind of two-sided, because we’re really together musically, like playing-wise and sound-wise. Gabe will schedule gigs, Eric and I will write arrangements … Hakeem will look pretty,” Anderson said with a grin. “But no, he does the Facebook page, and Scott does the website.… We’re all actively participating, which is something that keeps the motor running.”
Colby said: “We’re also just trying to become better musicians, and it’s like, these shows are so much fun; our goal is to make the audience have a good time, but at the same time, you need to grow as a musician, and so we work on these insane pieces, that it’s sort of like a rite of passage to become a virtuoso on your 
instrument.”
Carnegie Mellon is a place that prides itself on its ruthless enthusiasm, and its commitment to its various disciplines. As a university with a heavy technical focus, many of those disciplines translate easily into traditional job opportunities. C Street Brass is an example of a group of young, talented musicians who are making a less traditional passion a viable possibility for themselves.

The cultural phenomenon that is Twitch Plays Pokémon (TPP) began unassumingly last Wednesday when an anonymous Australian opened a new stream on the game streaming service Twitch. The idea was simple: using the chat window, users could type in basic Game Boy commands — “left”, “right”, “up”, “down”, “a”, “b” and “start” — and a bot would input them into the game. There was a simple timer above the command scroll, and the fundamental idea was to see how long it would take to crowd source through one of the original Pokémon games, Red Version.
Things started simply enough when a group of around 3,000 users beat the first gym before the first day mark. There were initial hiccups that were to be expected with any Internet-based crowd sourcing. Trolls spammed the “start” command, which completely bogged down progress. In response, the creator throttled “start” usage stating that he wanted to interfere as little as possible but would step in if necessary.
Things were moving well, with a small community popping up, until TPP players hit their first big obstacle, HM01 Cut. This move is required to go through the game, but must be taught to a Pokémon after being acquired. This process is relatively simple for a six-year-old child playing the game, but the seven-button sequence was the first real obstacle faced by TPP.
From that point on, TPP has just been a series of challenges such as using Cut, navigating a tricky ledge path, and getting through the Team Rocket Hideout. Up until this point, everything had been accomplished through controlled chaos with several strategies being determined to help navigate the swelling masses through difficult tasks all while combatting the ever-growing lag.
But unlike these previous challenges where maybe everything could be accomplished with a little bit of “hive-mind” strategy and patience, the Rocket Hideout was different. To navigate to the Lift Key necessary to operate the elevator, players must navigate through a complex arrow puzzle. One false move out of 30 or so restarts the puzzle. After the better part of the day of struggle and frustration, the creator stepped in. A new form of control was implemented: democracy. In this method, all of the commands were tallied over a 10-second period and then acted out over the next 10-second voting period. Users could string together commands such as “left2up3” which would have the player move left twice and up three times during the 10-second period. This change infuriated much of the following because of the dullness. 
People were watching and playing not to see efficiency, but to see the story that this randomness had created. By this point, there was an entire canon surrounding the game. The random nicknames created by random, or anarchy, control had led a personification to the Pokémon, such as the Rattata nicknamed JLVWNNOOO, or Jay Leno, and a Charmander nicknamed ABBBBBBK, or Abby. There was also a religion spawned by the frequent attempted use of the Helix Fossil in battle or while walking around, which led to religious overtones being pushed through the metagame, such as the over-leveled Pidgeot being dubbed Bird Jesus.
One of the most controversial moments had come just before entering the Rocket Hideout when a group of players decided to get a free Eevee. At this point, there was an open spot in the Pokémon team being saved for Lapras because of the need of a Pokémon who could learn HM02 Surf to progress in the game and the fear that accessing the PC to exchange Pokémon would end in heartbreak, as the risk of releasing Pokémon was very high given the random actions of the group.
Eevee was not hopeless, however, as it could be evolved into the Surf-learning Vaporeon with a purchased Water Stone. But the stream was not nearly this precise and instead bought a Fire Stone, creating the rather worthless Flareon, who was quickly deemed the False Prophet. A civil war erupted on the stream and led to Abby and Jay Leno both being released in an attempt to deposit the False Prophet, who was also released.
Because of this growing narrative, which wouldn’t have happened under democracy control, the creator made a concession. Players could now vote for the control scheme — anarchy or democracy — with a 75 percent majority needed to swap from one to the other. Many recent players like the ease of democracy, but the anarchists staged a passive protest by spamming the command “start9”, which caused the character to enter the menu nine consecutive times. After about a day of struggle, democracy became a last-hope. Players utilized democracy only to navigate the most complicated puzzles such as the step-limited Safari Zone.
TPP has become an Internet phenomenon. At its peak, there have been over 120,000 logged-in active users capable of inputting commands and, as of Sunday night, nearly 26 million unique visitors to the stream. As with all Internet things, it spawned its own subreddit, which has further intensified the culture and was ranked the 36th most active subreddit. The subreddit drew in over 66,000 users in under a week. It came with its own live update stream that reached over 20,000 viewers.
Pokémon is still a popular game — the new X and Y versions came out last year — but it has become a purely strategy game for most people. But TPP isn’t about Pokémon. As the creator put in the first line of the description, TPP is a social experiment. We have seen an entire subculture, complete with religion, politics, and mythos arise in under a week.
4chan summed it up best: “[over 45,000] people just staged a micro-protest by repeatedly voting for a passive action on a[n] online cooperatively controlled Japanese RPG from [1996] in order to change the method of control. Living in the future is weird.”

We know that robots can do all kinds of amazing things for us, but what do they do when we’re not looking? An exhibition titled The Secret Life of Robots offers “an unpolished look into the unseen, and often mundane, lives of robots,” according to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The display opened at the SPACE Gallery in Downtown on Friday evening.
Local artist Toby Atticus Fraley drew inspiration from his sketchbook in the creation of the display. “Robots assembled from pieces of Americana illustrate mundane everyday rituals, acts of daring, and precious milestones,” Fraley said in a press release. “These scenes of great joy and crushing sadness cover the beginning to the end of a typical robot’s life span, celebrating and revering the beauty in the everyday.”
This whimsical collection of expressive robots was a pleasant reprieve from the more somber subjects of other galleries. Fraley combated the cold, mechanical monotony typically associated with robots — using the down-home comfort of their settings. The quirky robots made the relatable, humdrum scenes intriguing and delightful. The knickknacks and décor of the robots’ homes transported viewers to the more wholesome era of the ‘50s. For the opening of the gallery, DJ Gordy Greenawalt amplified the experience with sounds of doo-wop and swing.
Fraley makes mixed media sculptures and clockwork pieces on a day-to-day basis for his clients, but chose to represent his own ideas in this recent gallery. Most of the robots grew unique personalities as he built them, a modern twist on finding the figure in the clay, Fraley said in an interview. “The eyebrows — that’s where they really start getting their personalities.” Using materials that he finds in flea markets in the summer and on eBay in the winter, Fraley’s robots revitalize worn-down baubles with true American resilience.
While some of the scenes are static, others have moving parts that enhance the lifelike aspects. Among other moving scenes, an elderly robot welcomes viewers as he wavers back and forth while reaching for his glasses, and a father robot puts on a puppet show for his child. Fraley admits that there was no real formula as to which scenes had motion and which scenes had none; he simply chose to animate whatever scenes spoke to him. “There were some that I wanted to have move, like the lady reaching for the cat food, but I just didn’t have time,” Fraley said.
The Secret Life of Robots is an engaging display for viewers of all artistic tastes and backgrounds. Viewers can enjoy this free exhibition through April 27.

Dear Matt and Ryan,
Did you know it’s no longer last Friday? I had no idea. I’ve been binge-watching the new season of House of Cards since the moment it came out. HAVE YOU SEEN IT? HOW CAN YOU WATCH THAT JUST ONCE. THE FIRST EPISODE JUST STARTS AND THEN [redacted for spoilers].
Sincerely,
[also redacted for spoilers]
Dear REDACTED,
So, we kind of lost you there and you didn’t really ask a question for us to answer. But you did mention how you “lost track of” this week. First order of business, email everyone. All of your professors, maybe your advisor too. Let them know what happened and hope they understand. Make up any of the work you missed. Get notes from your friends. No friends? Make some. Hopefully you didn’t miss anything terribly important, and you seem lucid now, so hopefully you’ve already started catching up.
The other problem that could arise is a fear that everyone you meet will eventually use and backstab you. And we can’t really help with that. If you start looking in shadows and staying indoors, you might want to seek help.
I mean, really, we probably aren’t out to get you. Probably.
Matt & Ryan
Dear Ryan and Matt,
YOU GUYS.
SUNLIGHT.
WARMTH.
IT’S HAPPENING. SPRING IS FINALLY HERE.
TIME TO PUT ON MAH BOOTY SHORTS AND PICK UP THE LADIES.
YEAH WARMTH,
Happy Emotions Readily Energize, Clear & Open Mind Especially Since The Heat Eradicated Snow, Umbrellas Nonessential
Dear HERECOMESTHESUN,
Slow down there, cowboy (or girl). You’re gonna scare this weather off! Finally, for the first time in far too long we have a couple of half-decent days and you have to go and get up in arms about it. We’re not out of the woods yet — spring doesn’t start until late March (after our spring break, ironically), so we’ve got a while until we can start expecting days like this all the time (or, at the very least, not entirely out of the realm of possibility). But that does mean we still have time to work on our spring booties and we can all pick up dem ladies. So get out there! Hit the gym! Do some yoga, some crunches and maybe go for a run while we can see pavement! Get off that couch now that you’re done watching the new season of House of Cards, and sculpt that bootay!
This message totally not brought to you by that Healthy Campus initiative,
Ryan & Matt

Bad Words
Thursday, Feb. 27
7:30
Guy Trilby (Jason Bateman) has nothing going for him in life. He is a 40-year-old eighth grade dropout who is still bitter about losing the spelling bee. In order to exact revenge, Trilby finds a loophole in the rules and decides to compete against kids literally a quarter of his own age. In a twist of fate, he meets Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand), a young Indian boy who is also competing in the spelling bee. Weirdly enough, the two become friends as Trilby shows him the wild side of life in this black comedy.
This is an advance screening of Bad Words, which will be released later in March. 
Gravity
Thursday, Feb. 27 — 10
Friday, Feb. 28 — 8, 10, 12
Do you know what’s worse than being in the middle of this awful Pittsburgh weather? Being stranded in outer space. In one of the most ambitious films of the year, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer who is sent on a mission with Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer. However, things go catastrophically wrong when a cloud of space debris destroys the Explorer, detaching Stone from the shuttle and sending her into the vast blackness of space. The struggle for survival makes for the most suspenseful 90 minutes of your life. Gravity is a very realistic experience thanks to its incredible special effects, cinematography, and acting. 
The Butler
Saturday, March 1
9:30, 12
Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) is a White House butler who has served eight presidents during his 34-year tenure. From the Civil Rights Movement to the Vietnam War, Gaines has been a front stand witness to some of the most violent and trying times in American history. Director Lee Daniels takes the audience through a wonderful journey through seemingly distant memories of our country’s history imbued with heartwarming performances from the film’s ensemble cast. The Butler is a film that’s unafraid of showing the struggles of American history, as well as the beautiful endurance of the amazing presidents — and the people serving them — behind it.

This fall, Carnegie Mellon upperclassmen will have a new option for housing: Clyde House.
Director of Housing Services Tom Cooley has confirmed the new housing location, stating that the residence will be a “Global Living Learning Community” in a renovated building located diagonally across from Shady Oak apartments at 624 Clyde St. The building will have three floors, with a possible lower level, and will house 28-34 efficiency apartments.
There will be five community spaces located in the building: one dedicated study lounge, three common areas, and one kitchen with an island-style counter in the center.
The application for living in Clyde House describes the building as “an apartment style residential community for students with a global curiosity, who are committed to deepening their own intercultural competency, and who have an interest in developing a mutual understanding of their responsibilities to be active global citizens seeking to bring change to the world they can influence.”
Apartments will house two to three people in a style similar to that of the Residence On Fifth. The building is scheduled to be fully renovated by Aug. 1, and the application to apply to live in Clyde House is separate from normal housing selection. The application is currently live at http://bit.ly/1gXqYPI.

Reddit co-founder and open Internet activist Alexis Ohanian visited Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday on his tour promoting his new book, Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed. Ohanian sat down with The Tartan to talk about the tour, student entrepreneurship, and net neutrality.
The Tartan: You’ve done bus tours to protest SOPA/PIPA and now to promote your new book. Why opt for touring the country on a bus?
Alexis Ohanian: Yeah, it really doesn’t scale as well as the Internet does. One, it’s an excuse to get a bus and drive around the country with friends. And two, it’s a way to really meet and feed off of the energy that’s around all of these campuses and all of these cities where all of these start-ups are taking off and getting started. 
I like to think that it’s also a more effective way to get the message out, especially to college students who I think don’t get to hear this stuff very often, and it’s the lecture at least I always wished I had when I was in school.
TT: What do you want college students to take away from your tour?
AO: I want them to get started building stuff and doing stuff and they don’t have to wait to graduate to do that, and those are the things — having ideas and doing them — that’s what entrepreneurship comes down to. That’s something that makes you not just a great founder who I want to invest in, but also a great employee or someone I want to work with. 
So even if you have no interest in starting a company, having the experience of having ideas and doing them, that’s muscle to exercise because that’s what people are going to want to see. That’s what makes you different. I was a history major. That’s what makes you stand out from the other thousands of history majors who are all going for the same job.
TT: What do you say to someone from Carnegie Mellon who’s aspiring to start a company or run with an idea but has to consider student loan debt and other pressures and doesn’t want to risk it?
AO: Well, this is a real problem. There is a much bigger issue with student loan rates, the cost of tuition; those are some huge problems that need to be resolved. That’s a separate thing; that’s not really my forte. I can’t begrudge anyone who opts to get a job instead of creating one for themselves. 
But, I always recommend these are the skills right now that are going to help you if you want to get a job. And let’s say you’re all worried about student-loan debt and you need to have steady income. That doesn’t have to be your everything. What I mean is, there are plenty of people who get paid educations by working at start-ups, or even by working at large companies like Google and Facebook where they can meet their co-founder there one day. They’re paying the bills, but I hope they’re also not depriving themselves of that side hustle, that thing you’re doing on nights and weekends, that passion project. 
That’s the thing, whether it’s an Etsy store or whether it’s an iOS app, that’s the thing that can actually become something much bigger. And the risk — there’s almost no risk. In most of these cases there’s actually no cost, just time. Obviously different students have different amounts of freedom to invest that time, but once you’re fortunate enough to get that job, don’t starve that part of you that is still interested in making and doing things. 
It’s not just a little hobby — I mean, it could be — but now it has the potential to be so much more. I’m not even just saying that your Etsy store has to turn you into the next Ralph Lauren. I don’t know if that analogy works. But even if it’s something that gives you satisfaction or keeps you making things and doing things and feeling great when some random person in Australia buys the thing you made. Maybe it is enough income to pay for the cable, and then it’s enough income to pay for the rent. Who knows? 
At the very least, it’s nourishing this part of you, this passion, that I feel like most people historically would spend they’re entire lives putting off, until they could finally afford to do it. The generation before us and all previous ones were very well known for that kind of self-sacrifice, or at least just determination to take that career job and do what they really love later. 
I think the one advantage to a failed — recovering, but a pretty broken — economy, and a lot of broken promises, is that we’ve pulled the veils from our eyes way earlier than most people do, and realize “Hey, you know what, maybe I should try do this thing that I really care about, and why not spend the time now during my best years to get into knitting, or coding, or swamp boat sailing.” And there’s this resource called the Internet that’s going to provide you with a stage and a library for all of those things. Literally all of those things have communities to learn and share with and from.
TT: How do you attempt to educate politicians and the layman who may be uninformed about the Internet and how certain types of legislation can affect it?
AO: Well, it’s a lot easier to convince uninformed people than it is to convince politicians. It turns out the Internet is this amazing resource for everyone who has access to it. The reason we did the documentary Silicon Prairie is because I wanted to show off the fact that, like, there’s a farmer in rural Missouri right now who’s getting 90 percent of his customers from the Internet, and he doesn’t even check his phone more than twice a week, three times a week. It’s not just hipsters in skinny jeans starting start-ups and college students getting help on term papers. Everyone is affected by it. 
When you understand how rich the Internet economy is, how deep it runs, in so many aspects of society through so many people, it becomes really obvious. Like, can we imagine the United States without electricity? No, that would be pretty hard. Likewise, we can’t really imagine being without an open Internet. The cost would be so grave, so serious. The problem is these politicians have very, very big interests in being re-elected, and the money that gets them there is provided by people who don’t necessarily have the interest of the public in mind. 
SOPA/PIPA was one where we triumphed. Net neutrality is one where we the people are definitely on the ropes. The Trans-Pacific Partnership continues to live around, which would be another big blow. There will continue to be threats. It’s not like, “Hey, we’re done." It’s, “Hey, we need to double down.” And so I think the way I’ve been able to convince the most people is just by telling stories, by sharing what’s happening in their neighborhood, by coming to events like this. Half of these events are at schools, but the other half are at co-working spaces, or we did a couple at small business luncheons. I will go anywhere people wanted to hear me on this tour, because people need to know. That’s people in power, and that’s also just citizens.
TT: What is your opinion on Sunday’s deal between Netflix and Comcast?
AO: Oh yeah. That makes me sad. It’s a sad precedent, especially in light of Comcast and Time Warner’s seemingly imminent merger — let’s hope antitrust gets in the way there. 
I’m a Netflix shareholder, so I totally understand the value of Netflix making this deal. It makes total sense; they’re building a moat, it gives them a great relationship, and it’s going to mean better service for a significant amount of the market. The thing is, even as a Netflix shareholder, I don’t want Netflix to ever get complacent. I love House of Cards or Orange is the New Black, this stuff is amazing, but I want to know that, in a year, Netflix is going to be looking behind them, going, “S***.” Or maybe they won’t be paying attention. But I want there to be a hundred other companies trying to dethrone Netflix, to be the next Netflix, to be the better Netflix. Because that’s better for everyone. 
I realize I’m basically saying this against my own self-interest as a shareholder, but that’s how innovation happens when there’s an even playing field for competition. Netflix has done a great job innovating, but I don’t ever want them to be complacent. So things like this worry me because it sets this precedent where maybe a few years from now there’s an upstart that can’t necessarily get going because they don’t have access to the same market or the same bandwidth.
TT: In an increasingly tech-based world, and coming out of the Great Recession, do you think we need more programmers, more coders, more technical people and increased technical education, or do we need more entrepreneurs and people who start things?
AO: I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive. To answer the first part, yes, we need more technical people. You know that Estonia, based largely on how successful Skype was, built by Estonian developers, that was a tenth of the entire country’s GDP when eBay bought it. That was like a decade ago, it was f****** Estonia, they were behind the Iron Curtain two decades earlier. They’re now pushing for K-12 education in computer science in public schools. They’ve gotten the message. They know how much value that can bring.
Obviously solving the education problem is big and complex, and there’s already so many failings, but coding is the new fluency. This is the most valuable skill of this century. If you want to be a founder of a company, and not even just a tech company, but like a founder of a company, because I’m telling you software is going to play a role. If you have things or are involved with things that turn on, it’s going to have code. And there are so many people — let’s pick on the historians — even as a historian, let’s say I ended up going the road of being a historian, just knowing some basic scripts, any kind of automation would have made me a 10 times better historian because I wouldn’t have to sit there changing every file name to “1234” and then “12345.” It can have a transformative value.
Now it’s a huge problem to solve. But what I guess is most exciting that there’s almost limitless demand right now for people in the economy who want this skill. And when you combine that with the fact that it’s also going to enable people to start creating things — and this goes with the entrepreneurship thing — it shouldn’t just be about having this new skill, it’s basically giving someone a skill that let’s them be their own wizard. Not just have ideas of something they want in the world, but actually have the ability to make it. 
So I think everyone should learn how to code. Not everyone is going to end up being a founder of a company, but the skill of being entrepreneurial, having ideas and going through with them — that skill is so important. Everyone should be imbued with it. Because once you have that, once your brain has been wired for that, all these problems, obstacles, all these things start looking like things you can hack. Because you realize, “You know, I don’t actually know how to publish a book,” or, “I don’t actually know how to use Final Cut,” but you realize there’s a resource here, a vast resource full of amazing people who have done this, solved this problem, been along the way before that I can learn from. 
Because it’s so empowering, I want people to think about being entrepreneurial regardless. They don’t have to start companies, but that’s what makes them great employees, that’s what makes them great citizens.
TT: Thank you so much.
AO: Sure thing.

On Feb. 11, an email was sent to the campus community about a case of tuberculosis (TB) on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, affecting a visiting researcher at the Heinz School.
The email, sent by director of Health Services Anita Barkin, said, “at this point, it appears that the individual’s contacts are limited to a small number of Heinz College community members.”
On Feb. 10, the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) contacted Health Services regarding the researcher who had contracted the disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website, tuberculosis is caused by a bacterial infection which attacks the lungs, “but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal.”
Last Thursday Dr. Barkin reported to The Tartan, “we have tested all of the close contacts and there are no additional active cases found.”
The individuals who were tested were identified as close contacts by the diagnosed person, and have all had negative results on their first-round test.
After eight to 10 weeks, they will be screened once again. “You can convert from negative to positive and it doesn’t mean you’re contagious,” Barkin explained, noting that without symptoms of active TB, an individual may have latent TB, which can be treated with medication.
Madelyn Miller, director of Environmental Health and Safety, said, “We followed Allegheny County’s guidance and our own guidelines,” revealing that they spoke with the diagnosed individual as well as the people who had been in “close, constant contact” with the person.
“To send out a mass communication would have been ineffective,” Miller explained. “We had to do this on a personal level. We were being ultra cautious, and contacted anyone who he could have breathed or coughed on.”
Barkin’s email warned, “It is important to know that you can only contact TB bacteria if you spend time near someone with TB disease,” adding, “the TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings.” It is not possible, however, to contract the disease from exposure to clothes, glasses, utensils, handshakes, toilets, or other surfaces with which people may touch.
Miller recalled that the university underwent a desktop drill simulating a meningitis outbreak in August, similar to a the recent outbreak at Princeton University. 
“It was clear that we could handle a meningitis outbreak, which is much more contagious than tuberculosis,” Miller said.
If anyone has questions regarding the TB case or wishes to be tested they should call Health Services at (412) 268-2157.

Two Carnegie Mellon seniors recently gave 20-minute speeches about their experiences at the university. Hosted by Student Senate, the inaugural session of the “First Lectures” series took place on Thursday, Feb. 21 in Porter Hall. Senior chemistry major Lukas Ronner and senior chemical engineering major Michelle Ruiz were the two seniors selected to speak in the first installment of the “First Lectures.”
The “First Lectures” was originally the brainchild of first-year economics and statistics double major, Vaasavi Unnava, a member-at-large in Student Senate. The title is a clear allusion to the title of the late Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture. In his lecture and subsequent book, Pausch discussed his journey through life and the dreams he accomplished.
The Last Lecture, which is distributed to incoming freshmen at the university during Orientation, had a strong impact on Unnava. According to Unnava, one of the book’s lines made her pause: “It’s not about how to achieve your dreams, it’s about how to lead your life.”
Unnava stated she wanted to hear seniors’ first lectures of the rest of their lives, and went to Student Senate with her idea.
In the first part of the event, Ruiz talked about her odyssey at Carnegie Mellon. She talked about how she changed during her time at the university, saying, “Freshman year is when you realize you’re not in high school. And the sophomore transition is about what you’re doing in life. My freshman year, I struggled academically. But I learned I was not the smartest, no longer the most involved student on campus. When I had a GPA below a 3.0, I was shocked. This confident lady was a wreck. I had a low self-esteem of all sorts, and that was not like me.”
But Ruiz did not let her first semester deter her. “I was surrounded by mentors who said, ‘Stop it right there; you’re not alone.’ I sat in the front row and discovered the magic of [Hunt Library].”
Ruiz urged students to take advantage of their time at Carnegie Mellon, saying during her speech, “There’s more to CMU than books; there’s opportunity.” Despite her struggles, Ruiz had three internship offers by the end of her first year.
Ruiz obtained an internship from ExxonMobil, where she met a valuable mentor, Greg. “Greg pushed me for so many semesters,” Ruiz said. “After a couple years, he’d say ‘GPA is really important, but what happens here is more important.’ ”
Ruiz said that her sophomore year taught her to “value in quality not quantity;” that she was “not true to my potential to overextend myself,” and that “quitting is okay when setting long-term goals.”
Ruiz communicated three lessons that she had learned to the audience: “be humble,” “use small hiccups to propel you to where you want to be,” and learn that “every experience is a learning experience.”
Ronner presented to the audience next. When students first come to Carnegie Mellon, he said, "If you were like I was ... your validation depended on your ability to out-compete other people. And that mentality is so absolutely messed up.”
Ronner reflected on where this mentality comes from by looking back to the first grade: "Think about it though. In school, people were separated into two categories only — smart, and dumb," Ronner said. "I look back and I wonder why it couldn't just be, 'oh, physics just isn't his strongpoint.’ ”
Ronner stressed that students do not have to be geniuses to make a difference in the world. He used the invention of the mammogram to illustrate this notion. In the past, doctors resorted to harsh methods, like slowly poisoning patients or performing harsh surgeries, to extract breast cancer cells. Then, German surgeon Albert Salomon proposed that patients be regularly checked to catch cancer in its early stages. Thus, the mammogram was born. "Because it doesn't take a genius to think of that. And it’s no less useful," Ronner said.
Ronner wants to change the grade-driven mentality harbored by students. “When I stopped worrying about the competitiveness, when I stopped thinking about my status in relation to my peers ... the grades came,” Ronner said. “Because a happy mind is an attentive one. Because work gets accomplished best when I’m de-stressed and thinking clearly. Because sleep makes you happy.”
Ronner concluded his speech, "I’m standing up here because I figured out that the world is yours, as long as you learn to look at it on your own terms ... As long as you stop seeing yourself as an absolute."
Ruiz, born in Ecuador and raised in Miami, Fla., is a sister in the sorority Tri Delta and community adviser for Donner House. 
She has also served as a Sexual Assault Advisor and a SafeZone adviser for members of the LGBTQ community and has been involved with organizations like the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and Dancer’s Symposium. She will work in Virginia for ExxonMobil after graduation.
Ronner is from Haddonfield, N.J., and has been a resident assistant, Orientation Counselor, and Scotch’n’Soda member in the past, and is currently chair of Student Senate.
Unnava said that it was difficult to choose the seniors who would speak in the lecture series. “There were 31 nominations, which wasn’t expected,” Unnava said in an interview. “We put together a rubric based on novelty, clarity, organization, impact, and depth. We assembled scores and looked at the top 20. It was really hard to make that decision because everyone was really good. And then, we had to find our top six and tried to get the event logistically together.” 
For seniors not selected, Unnava said, “We put together a video of things they learned.”
Unnava said, “Kids that are there want to get things done and want to make an impact on their community. They’re not afraid to say, ‘Hey, let’s start something new.’ ”

Students of the Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences filed into the University Center’s Rangos Hall Saturday morning, wearing neat business casual attire — for the most part — after an email from Siriana Abboud, sophomore psychology and French double major, warned that “Wrinkled is good for raisins, but not for respect.”
Abboud was one of the organizers of Under Construction: Building Your Future, the second annual Dietrich College career-building event. Under Construction began at 10:30 a.m. and lasted until 5:30 p.m., and included a keynote speech, panels, and a networking session complete with hors d’oeuvres.
Students reported to Rangos Hall first for a welcome by the Dean of Dietrich College John Lehoczky. 
“Today, this Under Construction event is a whole new approach to building your career, whether you’re a sophomore, junior, or senior” Lehoczky said. “Today we have over 60 H&SS alums, who have come back just to support you.”
Lehoczky stressed that the Dietrich College alumni who returned to Pittsburgh for the event were the key to Under Construction’s success. “Not only do [these alumni] represent a huge range of different career paths — from advertising to international development to health care to creative arts and entertainment — but most importantly they are H&SS graduates,” Lehoczky said. “They understand your college experience and your career search dilemma. They fully understand the challenges, because they faced exactly those challenges when they were students here. They are volunteering to be resources for you.”
Lehoczky also introduced Under Construction’s keynote speaker, Terry Babcock-Lumish (H&SS ‘97). Babcock-Lumish graduated from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences with a B.S. in policy and management. She is currently president of Islay Consulting LLC, “an economic, policy, and political consultancy she founded in 2005 to meet the needs of innovative global clients committed to effecting positive change, from local to global,” according to the event’s program.
Babcock-Lumish broke her advice into three discrete lessons. Babock-Lumish’s first adage was “semper gumby,” meaning “always flexible.” Babcock-Lumish warned students against planning their lives down to the moment; she stressed how important it is to adapt to unexpected circumstances. 
Babcock-Lumish gave the example of meeting her husband as an unexpected event that changed her life. “He was not in the plan,” she said. “We can’t plan for everything in life, like falling in love with someone that was geographically inconvenient, who also has a turbo career and their own timeline.”
Babcock-Lumish next advised students to look past how they're represented on paper and worry more about following their passions. “The reality is, we’ve got to fall in love with you in two dimensions with that résumé, before we can ever meet you and invite you to the interview to fall in love with you in three dimensions," Babcock-Lumish said. 
The keynote speaker’s last lesson was a simple reminder that undergraduates and alumni alike were still “under construction,” comparing them to the construction site that was the University Center when she graduated in 1997. “Regardless of where we are in our lives, in our careers, we are all under construction,” Babcock-Lumish said.
After the keynote speech, Dietrich students engaged in lunchtime discussions with Dietrich College alumni at tables that were divided by industries. 
Following the lunch and keynote speech, Under Construction attendees went to two panels they had chosen when they registered, on topics ranging from technology to editing and publishing to public health, health policy, and health professions. In each of these panels, a few alumni spoke about their experiences and how undergradutes can get started in the field.
The next piece of Under Construction was a student internship panel, in which five undergraduate Dietrich students, including sophomore international relations and politics major Noël Um, senior economics and professional writing double major Zaneta Grant, junior professional writing major Lauren Williams, senior economics major Michael Shin, and senior ethics, history, and public policy major Lara Dorko, spoke about their own internship experiences.
Finally, students networked with alumni back in Rangos Hall while eating finger foods.
Sanjana Baldwa, sophomore psychology major, said she thought Under Construction was a good effort on behalf of Dietrich College to help students network and see what they can do with their degrees in the humanities and social sciences. “I really liked all of the different alumni; I think it was really cool to hear all of their different stories, and see what they do,” Baldwa said. “It was a good event for networking — just things to look out for and people to reach out to if [students] need a mentor or something.”
Editor’s Note: Noël Um is assistant news editor of The Tartan, and Lauren Williams is a staffwriter.

Budget Change Discussion
Last academic year, Student Senate allocated $16,500 in its budget for the Arts Pass Program. The program is running a deficit because of two events at Phipps Conservatory: the corpse flower blooming and the Winter Light Garden Flower Show. Students receive free admissions to Phipps Conservatory under the program.
Coordinator of Student Activities Tim Leonard asked Senate for an additional $4,500 to cover the $9,000 deficit that the Arts Pass program is projected to run this year.
A motion was made and passed to raise the Arts Pass Program line item in Senate’s budget to $21,000 to meet Student Activities’ request.
Special Allocation: CMU in Haiti
CMU in Haiti is a new organization that is planning a spring break trip to Haiti to build communities and form a long-lasting communal bond. Nine students and two professors will be traveling to Haiti from March 9–14. CMU in Haiti requested $5,500 to cover their travel and lodging costs.
Because the two professors going on the trip do not pay the student activities fee, which funds Senate’s special allocations, a motion was made to reduce the allocation to $4,500 — since each traveler accounted for $500 of the request — which Student Senate then granted to CMU in Haiti.
Arts Pass Program Presentation: Tim Leonard
Coordinator of Student Activities Tim Leonard gave a presentation to Student Senate to ask that they pass a recommendation to increase the Arts Pass Program line item in next year’s Senate’s budget to $26,000. A motion was made to decrease the recommendation to $21,000, the amount granted to Arts Pass Program this academic year after the vote to increase the line item earlier in the meeting.
To guarantee the sustainability of the Arts Pass program, a motion was made to request that a plan for sustainability be provided to Senate when the allocation is dispensed next semester. Senate passed the recommendation; although this recommendation does not allocate any money, it requests that next year’s Senate stay true to the recommended budget.

It’s a well-documented fact that artists don’t get paid well for music that people stream online. The actual magnitude of this problem was recently made more public when alternative rock group Camper Van Beethoven released a picture of their royalty check. One of their songs got played over a million times and their payout was a bit more than $16. That should be astounding to everyone.
As an amateur musician in a band myself, I can attest to the amount of time and energy artists put into creating songs. I’ve sat for hours listening to my singer record 121 takes on a vocal track because he wasn’t satisfied with his performance. Imagine that process repeated over the 20-30 tracks that professionally produced songs have. It’s an absolutely laborious process. Bands will often spend months in the studio trying to perfect their sound.
Then, when tracks finally get out of the studio, some poor soul has to sit there mixing for hours and hours on end. Mixers will listen to the same song thousands of times, often sitting alone in a windowless room late at night, slowly watching their sanity slip into effect inserts and automation data to make the artists sound the way they want to.
After mixing is finally done, the track has to be mastered. Now the process is even more nuanced and delicate, because changing the decay on your reverb effect by less than a tenth of a second will drastically alter the way the track sounds. That’s why albums usually take upward of ten months to go from a songwriter’s ideas to serenading ears.
Imagine putting all that love and care into something, and then having it turn out really well. It’s popular, people want it, they use it one million times, and — after everything — you only get $16. That’s nuts. President Obama is pushing for higher minimum wage laws to nominally help low-skilled workers, but these laws will mainly help to boost the salaries of union workers, since union wages are often calculated as a multiple of the minimum wage. But union workers have an average hourly pay rate of $23.75. In an hour, they make almost 150 percent of what Pandora pays an artist for streaming one million songs.
While I don’t want to minimize the positive effect that Pandora and other streaming services have had on making discovery of new music more accessible, they have to start paying artists a bit more for use of their intellectual property. As streaming becomes more popular and increasingly few people buy music — instead opting for Spotify — artists aren’t going to earn a decent living from their music. Indie bands could possibly be a dying breed, leaving us only with music that record labels heavily subsidize and promote, which would be a terrible state of affairs for the quality and diversity of music.
A friend of mine is an incredibly talented musician who has taken to simply giving his music away. He told me that it was basically impossible to make any money from online distribution, so the best he can do is get more music in more people’s ears so that they pay for his live show. We don’t need to leave talented artists behind like this. The music industry needs to find a way to get artists more money from the online distribution of their intellectual property.

In the Feb. 2 issue of The Tartan, I wrote an article entitled “Ukraine must join EU to ease unrest” about the anti-government protests, popularly called Euromaidan, raging through the streets of Ukraine’s capital city of Kiev.
In the two weeks since that article was published, a lot has happened: the Sochi Olympics, the Kiev police’s use of live rounds, a truce after the deaths of scores of protesters, a subsequent uneasy truce between the government and the opposition parties, the breaking of that truce, President Obama’s unexpected personal condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Union sanctions in Ukraine, and — on Saturday — the pressure mounted by the opposition protesters was too much for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and he soon fled toward the Eastern part of Ukraine, labeling the Euromaidan's efforts a "coup." All of these events have left the nation’s future leadership in question.
According to Time magazine, fresh fighting broke out on Feb. 20 across the Maidan Square, where much of the ground has been blown to rubble. Any Google image search will yield a public square resembling a war zone. 70 protestors were reported dead as of Thursday. The protesters seemed to be adamant even in the face of death.
Former heavyweight champion boxer and current leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, Vitali Klitschko, has called for early presidential elections to force reform through a new executive leader. The Ukranian parliament seems to have listened to Klitschko, as they have declared Yanukovych constitutionally unfit for duty and have established a May 25 election for his replacement, according to kyivpost.com.
However, even if recent events signal that Yanukovych is out of the picture, the opposition parties — for which Klitschko appears to be a figurehead — are by no means unified. They contain nationalists and radical factionalists seeking total government reform, as well as more moderate politicians seeking unity.
There has been much confusion surrounding the upcoming elections, with Yanukovych fleeing the capital to the more pro-Russian eastern border of Ukraine. Yanukovych later appeared on television, stating “I do not intend to resign. I am the legitimately elected president,” according to Time magazine.
With this announcement, the streets once again descended into chaos, with protesters chanting “Ukraine is not Russia”. Finally, former Ukrainian prime minister and archrival of Yanukovych — Yulia Tymoshenko — was freed after years in prison following a controversial court case. Thus, another key power player has entered the fray. Especially concerning is that Tymoshenko is in a separate political party than Klitschko, which could place the leaders in opposite corners if a power vacuum arises. The very question of Ukraine’s unity — beyond regional preferences for the European Union (EU) over Russia or vice versa — has been thrown into the air.
On Thursday, President Barack Obama said, “Our approach in the United States is not to see these [issues] as some cold war chessboard in which we’re in competition with Russia,” according to The Guardian. Despite President Obama’s statement, the events in Ukraine and subsequent actions by other nations are all skirmishes revolving around the chessboard of international politics. All around, intricate moves are being pushed into play.
Unlike the Cold War, this chess match isn’t a clash of democracy and communism; however, it is still a clash of ideology — power for the government versus power for the people. 
Ukraine is a curious state, both in its demographics and geography. Ukraine, with 45.5 million citizens, is the seventh most populous country in Europe. Additionally, it is situated on the Black Sea and occupies a sizable coastline. It clearly has the potential, in manpower and natural resources, to be an economic powerhouse in Eastern Europe. Russia sees this potential, as does the EU, and so there exists a tug of war between the two for influence over the nation.
According to The Telegraph, it is no secret that much of the corruption that Ukraine is rife with, including Yanukovych’s unnaturally long reign, has been due to Russian meddling. Putin, as proud and aggressive as ever, is mounting one final push to make his EU counterparts lose hope of gaining Ukraine as an ally. Russia consumes the majority of Ukrainian trade and bailed Ukraine out of bankruptcy back in December. Ukraine’s survival during the past year has been dependent on its Eastern neighbor. Russia has taken advantage of a large — albeit unstable — state and maneuvered itself into being Ukraine’s biggest client and, at some points, ally.
Putin is not surprised at the violence of Euromaidan — especially since much of his foreign policy has contributed to it. Moreover, it is no coincidence that much of this Russian aggression has occurred with the Sochi Olympics. Russian lawmakers have been using media attention from the games as a screen for their conduct in Ukraine.
What does this accomplish for Putin and Russia? First, Putin’s capital inflows into Ukraine have effectively frozen any sort of Association Agreement, or trade deal, with the EU. Yanukovych’s rejection of such an agreement was what first incited the protests. Second, Putin has restored Ukraine back into its realm of influence, which imploded after the Soviet Union fragmented and started to diminish once again leading up to the failed Association Agreement.
Moreover, there is no better way for Russia to defend its interests against its foe, the United States. By exerting its influence over Ukraine, Russia staves off the creation of a pro-U.S. and Western region.
There have been calls for Western nations to impose sanctions and financial bans on Russia, effectively strangling Russian capital flows. Unfortunately, not only are assets hard to track on such a large scale, but such sanctions would lead to even greater tensions between Russia and the EU with the United States. 
All in all, Russia has been tugging strings carefully throughout the Sochi Olympics to protect its interests and increase its power outside of Moscow. For now, Ukraine teeters back into stability. Perhaps after the elections — assuming they are conducted fairly — Ukraine will be able to stand by itself with less influence from Russia.

The Olympics are meant to be a time during which the world puts its differences aside and comes together in a joyous manner to celebrate healthy competition. However, as the final whispers of this year’s Sochi Olympics die down, many questions are being raised concerning the corruption associated with history’s most expensive Games.
According to The Huffington Post, this year’s Winter Games have cost upward of $50 billion — a cost higher than that of all previous Winter Olympics combined. For a country with significant economic problems and government expenditures of only $376.2 billion in 2011, this vast spending is concerning.
With this high-roller attitude, Russia is trying to impress the world and hide the fact that it is still a developing nation. It has tried to hide its issues with shiny, state-of-the-art complexes, but members of the media are quickly discovering many of the problems faced by Sochi’s citizens that Russia has been unable to cover.
As The Huffington Post describes, many journalists entered their hotels only to find half-finished buildings. In some hotels, the water was a bright yellow hue and clearly unsafe to drink. Journalist for Canadian publication The Globe and Mail Mark MacKinnon even tweeted, “Ok, so my hotel doesn’t have a lobby yet.” Though many rooms did not contain heat, Internet, or other basic commodities, each did offer an authoritarian portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Sochi bid its spot for the Olympics quoting an estimated budget of $12 billion. How has its budget more than quadrupled since to $51 billion?
As it turns out, the most expensive games in Olympics history may also be the most corrupt. According to Business Insider, as much as $30 billion may have been stolen from the “already inflated budget.” 
According to Russian opposition figures Boris Nemtsov and Leonid Martynyuk, Putin funneled contracts to many of his friends, causing the Olympics’ sports complexes to be built without competitive offers. Nemtsov describes this embezzlement as “a real threat to Russia’s national security.”
The fact that half of the budget may have been stolen represents much of the corruption the Russian government still faces in the post-Soviet era. Add to this the anti-gay propaganda laws enacted by Russia before the games, and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics has turned out to be one of the most controversial games in history.
Despite the controversy, the fact that Russia held this year’s games may encourage closer ties with the United States and other Western nations — a welcome accomplishment in this post-Cold War age. However, while Russia has come far from its Soviet Union decline, it stills faces many of the issues of a developing nation. 
Russia’s international affairs may have benefited greatly from the Olympics, but by spending extravagant amounts of money on sports complexes when its citizens are in poverty, the nation has turned away from helping the people within its borders.

Giving America a raise is highly controversial these days. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Democrats wish to raise it to $10.10 by 2016. Republicans, true to recent form, are rejecting the proposal outright.
A wall of partisan noise has drowned out the economic facts underpinning this proposal. Let’s review them. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) states that this hike in the minimum wage will boost earnings for about 24.5 million Americans over the next three years. Consequently, nearly one million Americans will escape poverty.
However, the hike will also cost another half a million Americans their jobs, according to the CBO. This statistic has Republicans incensed. 
They argue that the government’s imposition of a higher minimum wage on the marketplace — essentially, a higher base price for labor — will increase the prices of goods and services. Consumers will then buy less. Consequently, businesses will have to fire low-wage workers in order to maintain their profit margins. Additionally, in some industries, the higher price of labor will incentivize businesses to automate those jobs, decreasing hiring.
Republicans propose, instead, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). It incentivizes low-wage workers to seek work instead of welfare by giving them a taxpayer subsidy to lift them out of poverty. Unlike the federal minimum wage, however, the EITC does not use the muscle of the federal government to arm low-wage workers with bargaining power when they try to increase this wage. 
Additionally, economists warn that for every 10 percent increase in the EITC, high-school educated workers lose 2 percent in wages, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution. This consequence occurs because the EITC encourages more Americans to work, thus keeping the cost of labor low. The EITC is a good first step, but should be implemented alongside an increase in the federal minimum wage, which would counteract the reduction in wages created by a higher EITC.
Democrats are buoyed by the prospect of lessening poverty and reducing income inequality. Common sense dictates that improving the lives of 24.5 million Americans — a million of them dramatically — far outweighs the predicted loss of half a million minimum-wage jobs.
In fact, Democrats respond in two ways to that prediction.
First, they argue that a predicted loss of 500,000 jobs is not certain. Twenty years of economic data, gleaned from comparing states that raised their minimum wages above the federal level to states that did not, suggest that business owners do not automatically respond to a higher minimum wage by laying off workers and not hiring new ones. Rather, they pay these higher minimum wages from the money they save from reduced labor turnover, higher productivity, and a slowdown in wage increases higher up the scale. As Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez explained to reporters at the White House, the American economy shall gain “the efficiencies of paying a fair wage.”
Second, Democrats argue that a higher minimum wage will boost demand across the economy. The more low-wage workers will earn, the more they will spend. Greater demand for goods and services will create more well-paying jobs. This effect is the Henry Ford effect. Ford doubled the daily wage of his workers to $5 so they could buy a Model T. In doing so, he sparked the rise of the American middle class. Democrats call on business owners to embrace this logic and join them in pushing for a higher minimum wage. Even if hiking the minimum wage sheds 500,000 jobs, unemployed Americans will quickly find higher-paying jobs.
A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 73 percent of Americans, including 53 percent of Republicans, supported raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10. Our social contract asserts that if we work hard, we should be able to put a roof over our heads, food on the table, and clothes on our backs. The current federal minimum wage translates to an annual income of $15,080. This income is a state of poverty, and no one who works a full-time job should live in a state of poverty. It is time America got a raise.

In a daring and progressive move, Facebook recently unveiled more than 50 customizable terms for users to label their gender. Previously, users had been limited to the gender binary of male or female, as well as the option to refuse answering altogether. 
Now, users have their pick of terms with which to identify, including variations upon transgender, genderfluid, genderqueer, and agender. Each person is also given a choice of preferred pronoun: his, hers, or theirs. For a social media giant, this step is unprecedented in support of the trans* community that should be celebrated, despite certain drawbacks.
Facebook’s new gender options are an enormous victory for the trans* — and, by extension, the LGBTQ — community. According to ABC News, Facebook software engineer and out trans woman Brielle Harrison has stated, “There’s going to be a lot of people for whom this is going to mean nothing, but for the few it does impact, it means the world.”
This statement couldn’t be more apt. With the highest rates of violent discrimination and attempted suicide in the LGBT community, “T” remains the most stigmatized letter of the acronym, according to Slate magazine. Considering this extreme prejudice, the number of people who identify under the trans* umbrella is difficult, if not impossible, to accurately measure. To a trans* minority, however, being free to self-identify on such a major social media site will be invaluable.
Additionally, Facebook’s decision to recognize non-cisgender identities could encourage people to educate themselves about the gender spectrum. It is more important now than ever to raise public awareness and acceptance of gender identities outside of the traditional binary. Other social media venues would do well to follow in Facebook’s example and not simply by including the ambiguous “other” in their list of options.
Of course, the company has garnered criticism for its decision. As must be true with any progressive step forward, some have criticized Facebook for going too far in blurring the lines of gender; others counter that Facebook didn’t go far enough. From a practical standpoint, expanding gender options may complicate censuses and directed advertising, just by virtue of there being more variables. 
However, the trans* community shows that anything that divides the world into man versus woman is terribly limited in the first place.

Last Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon hosted its first ever Three-Minute Thesis competition. The contest challenged Ph.D. students from multiple disciplines to distill the essence of their theses into three-minute presentations to give to an audience of non-specialists and be judged.
The Three-Minute competition, besides being an interesting venue for members of the campus community to see the research being conducted by graduate students, also hints at a larger problem facing academia at the moment: accessibility.
Public perception has never been kind toward academics. Professors and Ph.D. candidates have often been viewed as closed off, working on projects that can’t be explained without a seminar course on the jargon of their subject area. This distance between academia and the rest of our society has proven to be more damaging than beneficial.
America has a long-held grudge against academic culture. In our elections, we tend to value the triumphs of the common man while underplaying the accomplishments of the educated. 
For a long period of our history, the highest level of education one could reasonably expect was a high school diploma, which may have contributed to a sense of disdain toward those who had the good fortune and opportunity to further their studies. 
Now, with rising standards of education and national and global problems which require the backing of scientific research and investigation to solve, this distance must be eliminated. Academics must work to break down the barriers between them and the public, and members of the public must be willing to accept this.
Of course, there are highly scientific and mathematical topics which are difficult to discuss with those outside of the field. However, as a whole, academia should focus on becoming more inclusive, rather than exclusive. 
The Tartan encourages initiatives such as the Three-Minute Thesis competition that work to soften the divide, making technological innovation and scientific progress accessible to the general public. It is only through this shift in rhetoric and attitude that we can work on making meaningful differences for our society.

It has always been the goal of the Olympic games to overcome divides in international politics and at least for two weeks develop a spirit of international cooperation and unity. 
Why, then, is it that NBC continues to be allowed to marginalize a large swath of the American population by limiting access to this international event? NBC’s decision to require a cable subscription to view the games means that many are not able to join the international community in enjoying them. This disadvantages  lower socioeconomic class families who cannot afford a cable subscription, as well as a population of young adults who increasingly turn to the Internet over television. 
Preventing certain demographics from watching the Olympics seems to contradict the mission of the games and therefore begs the question: why does the international Olympics committee allow this practice to continue? 
NBC makes some of its coverage available online and supplements it with advertisements; why can’t this practice be adapted to all coverage?
People love to gather around a game. Nothing has made this sociological phenomenon more evident than Twitch Plays Pokémon, a movement in which people across campus and across the world have been coming together to root for their favorite childhood video game.
This kind of response is exactly what the Olympics are supposed to be about: the coming together of different groups over the love of the game. If the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was truly committed to this goal, they would place stricter regulations on those networks given the right to broadcast. 
Why the networks covering the Olympic Games don’t embrace the success of live streaming events online is an enigma. It has become clear through the runaway popularity of Twitch Plays Pokémon that people in our age demographic will gather together to watch and socialize around free online streams. 
The IOC should promote the use of online video to promote the goals of community upheld by the Olympics. Offering access to those without cable subscriptions, even in an ad-supported form, would be a large step toward achieving that goal. 
The best way to achieve the international unity that the Olympic games strive for is to make coverage of the events easily accessible to everyone. But in the mean time we can all watch Pidgeot go for gold.
