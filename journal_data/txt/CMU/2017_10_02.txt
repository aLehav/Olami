Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team traveled to Bethany, WV, on Saturday to play the Bison and came away with a 45–14 victory in a Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) contest. Carnegie Mellon improves to 5–0 over and 3–0 in the PAC while Bethany is now 0–5, 0–3. The Tartans’ 5–0 start to the season marks its best since 2006 and is just the 12th time in program history a team has started the season with five straight wins.
Senior wide receiver John Prather tied the school record for most receptions in a game, finishing with 10 catches for 122 yards and added a career-best four touchdowns, all in the first half. This marked Prather’s eighth 100-yard career game and third this season. Junior quarterback Alex Cline threw for a career-best five touchdowns and passed for 127 yards on 11-of-22.
Senior Stanley Bikulege moved into third on the school’s all-time tackle list after totaling five tackles. He now has 240 tackles for his career. The defense was led by junior cornerback Ethan Anderson with nine tackles, five solo. Senior linebacker Quentin Wolfe recorded eight tackles including five solo, and first-year safety Chandler Stacy ended with seven tackles, four solo. The first-year also added a 40-yard interception return for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter.
Bethany outgained the Tartans 296–238, but Carnegie Mellon capitalized on the Bison’s three turnovers and 20 penalties for 205 yards. The Tartans  were also perfect from inside the red zone, converting all five opportunities.
Cline tossed five first-half touchdowns, four of them going to Prather. The tandem started the game’s scoring with a 28-yard strike at the nine minute mark of the first quarter. Four minutes later, the Tartans made the score 10–0 on a 33-yard field goal by senior punter and kicker Tyler Kohman.
On the first play of the second quarter, Cline hooked up with senior wide receiver Tommy Mansfield on a five-yard touchdown reception, which made the score 17–0. The seven-play, 37-yard scoring drive started following a fumble recovery by senior defensive lineman Neal Baranosky which was forced on a sack by Anderson and sophomore Michael Lohmeier.
Carnegie Mellon senior linebacker Sean Graff intercepted the ball on the first play of the Bison’s ensuing possession which led to Cline and Prather’s second scoring connection of the game, 9-yard strike to make the score 24-0. The two struck again for scores from 14 yards and 5 yards out before the end of the half, as the Tartans went into the half with a 38-0 lead.
Bethany held the Tartans to a three-and-out on the opening possession of the second half and then marched 80 yards on six plays for its first score of the game. Two minutes into the fourth quarter Stacy’s interception return made the score 45–7 before Bethany’s backup quarterback threw a 20-yard touchdown for the final score of the game.
Carnegie Mellon will return to Gesling Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 7 to face 17th-ranked Washington & Jefferson College.

Alejandro Villanueva is many things to the people of Pittsburgh: starting left tackle for the Pittsburgh Steelers, a part-time graduate student at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business, and most recently, the focal point of a media storm launched on Friday night by President Trump. Prior to the Pittsburgh Steelers game last Sunday, head coach Mike Tomlin released a statement confirming that he and his players would remain in the locker room during the anthem after the National Football League (NFL) released a statement of unity and support. When it came time to start the anthem, the Steelers dutifully began to exit the field — save for Villanueva. He was photographed standing at the front of the tunnel to the locker rooms, the only Steeler participating in the anthem.
NFL players kneeling during the anthem is comparatively old news, as Colin Kaepernick began kneeling at the start of the 2016 season to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Various other players participated, but the focus remained on Kaepernick. Now out of the league, Kaepernick’s protests and motivations have fallen behind the words of Trump, NFL owners, and sports reporters nationwide.
Within hours, Villanueva became a symbol against the protests, which were performed in some form at every single Sunday game. The Army veteran’s jersey swiftly became the highest selling jersey in the NFL. Yet in an interview after the game, Villanueva claimed he was following his teammates when he got stuck behind other personnel on the field. Although his plan was to remain hidden in the tunnel, he found himself still on the field as the anthem began, and chose to remain. Later, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was quoted that he regretted the team’s decision to remain in the locker room.
On a weekend where the NFL tried to push unity, the tension between Steelers teammates reflects the tension now brought between fans of the NFL. The protests were never about unity at the beginning, or the flag, or disrespecting the military. They were, and always have been, focused on the real issues of racism in the United States. After the Steelers game, a fire chief in Washington County, PA leveled a racial slur at Tomlin on Facebook, and people were reportedly covering Steelers flags in swastikas. In the span of a weekend, professional football dramatically reflected the state of race relations in America right in the faces of the general public. Outcries of keeping politics out of sports persist, as if including the anthem in and of itself is not a political statement. But sports fans were not prepared to face the harsh reality that came to light. By exercising their first amendment right to free speech, the black athletes kneeling for the anthem were defamed in the media by the President of the United States.
And yet the original focus has been lost. Postgame interviews speak of protesting the anthem or protesting the flag, ignoring Kaepernick’s original statements when the protests first began. The NFL, similarly, cushioned themselves in stating that any actions during the anthem would be in solidarity and unity, as if they were not protests at all.
Surely it was not the Steelers’ intention to reflect centuries of turmoil in the few minutes it takes to sing the national anthem. And yet, as the displays continue into the newest weekend of football, it does not seem that any of this is going to stop quietly. The President inserted himself into sports, and now sports are responding. Like it or not, the NFL can no longer be depoliticized, but even as it strives to be a singular league, it does not look like it will ever truly be united either.

The 12th-ranked men’s soccer team opened up University Athletic Association (UAA) play against New York University (NYU) on Saturday. The Tartans won 3–1, advancing to 7–1–1 for the year (1–0 in the UAA) while the Violets move to 5–2–1.
Both sides started the game aggressively, with NYU taking their first shot within the first minute of play. In the third minute, junior forward Anthony Guili attempted a shot blocked by NYU’s goalkeeper. On the rebound, junior midfielder Zack Masciopinto successfully scored his fifth goal of the season on a header to give the Tartans the early 1–0 advantage. Shot attempts stopped until the 29th minute after an NYU shot went wide. In the 32nd minute, junior midfielder Jamie Wheaton’s shot was blocked by the goalkeeper. In the 34th minute, sophomore midfielder Elliot Cohen also made a shot that was saved by the opposing goalkeeper. No further shots were attempted in the half.
In the second half, the Tartans regained the offensive. In the 51st minute, a corner kick from Guili was deflected by junior defender Greg Bellwoar into the net for his second goal of the season, putting the Tartans up 2–0. In response, NYU proceeded to make a goal in the 56th minute, cutting the Tartan lead to 2–1. The Tartans then went back to pressuring NYU’s defense, with Masciopinto attempting a shot that hit the post and sophomore midfielder Jack Painter following up on a shot that had to be saved by the goalkeeper. In the 66th minute, Masciopinto managed to get the ball around the goalkeeper to make his sixth goal of the season, putting the Tartans up 3–1. The Tartans continued to keep up the pressure with Masciopinto attempting another header off a corner kick in the 73rd minute and Wheaton having an attempt go wide in the 74th minute. Senior forward Ryan Stinebaugh’s header shot in the 81st minute missed, as did sophomore midfielder Cooper Tubiana’s header shot in the 83rd minute. NYU attempted to rally for a comeback, shooting in the 87th, 88th, and 89th minutes. The first went wide, the second was saved by junior goalkeeper Alec Lam, and the final one went high.
The Tartans will next host Penn State Behrend on Tuesday, Oct. 3 at 7 p.m.

As junior defender Emily Tolmer sprinted down the soccer field after a day of classes, she realized her exhaustion. After the ordeal, she sat on the benches and looked over at her similarly exhausted teammates and knew they were the reason she pushed herself so hard. The new fitness standards that the women’s soccer team implemented this fall force players to train harder — both mentally and physically — in order to make the team.
“This year, there was more of a mindset that everyone was to earn their position on the field. It wasn’t based off of any of your past achievements or anything that you’ve done; it was basically a clean slate where you had to come in and work to earn your position,” said Tolmer.
The new fitness standards made training more competitive this year. The standards consisted of shorter times for traditional training requirements, including the beep test, full-field sprints, long sprints, and shuttle sprints. The challenge of these new standards forced players to overcome both physical and mental barriers and helped foster the respect they had for each other.
“I think having respect for each other is just trusting different players on the field and every teammate. I know in the past our team has dealt with a lot of injuries or just personal change on the field and I think that everyone is working so hard [that] it makes you comfortable playing on the team and knowing that anyone who steps on the field has earned their position on the team. We demanded so much more from each other than in years past,” said Tolmer.
While, of course, every team’s goal is to win nationals, the women’s soccer team believes that their new training standards will help them to accomplish this goal. In order to make it to nationals, the team has to first either win their conference or, when compared to other teams, perform well based on their record, schedule, and teams played. If these requirements are met, the team is able to play in the NCAA tournament and has the opportunity to make it to the final four.
“The goal is to win a national championship. This season [when] we were expected to come in a lot more fit than… in the past, we could immediately start training at our top speed and level, which has led into our game speed,” said first-year midfielder and defender Hannah Anderson.
While the team has found the new standards to be helpful in preparing for both their games and the championship, they believe that fitness is only one of many aspects players need to grow.
“We’re holding each other accountable to a higher level of play in all aspects: fitness is just one. We always say we’re not a track team, we’re a soccer team that just happens to work really hard on fitness because that enables us to focus more on our play,” said Tolmer.
This mentality was important to keep in mind as the team opened University Athletic Association (UAA) play against New York University on Saturday. The Tartans earned a 1–0 victory against the Violets.
Senior forward Haili Adams put in the game winner and her seventh goal of the year in the third minute. Senior defender Katie Strycharz played a ball along the sideline to sophomore forward Ryan Casey who raced down to the goal line. Adams was there to loft a shot over the keeper to the far post.
First-year goalkeeper Carolyn Botz was credited with the win and shutout after making two saves.
The women’s soccer team remains confident in their ability to make it to the final four. Until then, the team is taking this season weekend by weekend but keeping the championship in the back of their minds.

The third week of the football season was quite eventful — both in real life, and in The Tartan’s fantasy football league. With some stunning performances from unexpected players, and several disappointments, we had both a blowout and a nail-biter. My team still has not managed to win a single game, living up to its name. I started the season confident, but now I’m contemplating if I should make it my goal to lose every single game in attempt to keep my dignity. Here are the highs and lows of this week of fantasy football.
Team Andah over Third-String Team 182.7–106.4
This week I faced off against staffwriter Josh Andah’s team, getting handed not only my third consecutive loss, but easily the worst one, getting blown out by a whopping 76.3 points. Maybe I need to start using Andah’s strategy, which is no strategy at all. Andah’s hands-off approach has proven effective. After lackluster performances last week from Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Chicago Bears running back Jordan Howard, Andah’s commitment to them payed off, giving him 65.1 points between just the two of them. All of his roster performed well, earning him the most points by any team so far this season.
On the flip side, my team was hindered by an underwhelming week from many of my key players, including Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who carried my team last week, and Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper, who has failed to live up to my expectations. But worst of all was a detrimental negative six points from the Baltimore Ravens defense, my hometown team. The blowout wasn’t as bad as it could have been with breakout weeks from wide receivers A.J. Green of the Cincinnati Bengals and Brandin Cooks of the New England Patriots. I suppose there’s always next week.
Yes We Cam over Justin Tucker Must (not) Die 125.9–124.8
Getting her third victory to stay undefeated and at the top of the standings, Editor-in-Chief India Price won by 1.1 points, and needed fantastic performances across the board to pull past Contributing Editor Lula Beresford’s team. New York Giants star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. had his first great game of the season, with nine receptions, 79 yards, and two touchdowns, adding 28.9 points to Price’s total score. Despite throwing two interceptions, Giants quarterback Eli Manning still earned 22.6 points.
After losing in week one with the lowest league score, Beresford has become a real fantasy football threat, putting up a fight against the reigning champion. Her team was bolstered from 20+ point-performances from four players, including Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers with 24.8 points. However, her titular player underperformed, with one sole point. Beresford’s team is a force to be reckoned with when the roster plays to expectations, and it’s definitely one to watch out for.
Easy Breesy over Drop it like it’s Crock 134.5–114.2
This week, Sports Editor Ian Tanaya triumphed over Publisher Jade Crockem with consistent scores from several players. In a smart strategy, Tanaya replaced his starting running back from last week, DeMarco Murray of the Tennessee Titans, who scored a measly 3.8 points last week, with Chiefs rookie running back Kareem Hunt, who has been a breakout star in real life and in fantasy football. The only negative statistic in the box score was Raiders wide receiver Michael Crabtree in the flex position with 1.7 points. Many of Tanaya’s bench players put up better numbers, and I expect a roster shuffle next week.
Though this was the second loss in a row for Crockem, her team has some bright spots to give some hope for the rest of the season. Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson returned to form after his injury last week, scoring 23.2 points. Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald had the team’s best performance of the week with 13 catches, 149 yards, and a touchdown, totaling 33.9 points. If some of her other players, like Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten and Miami Dolphins running back Jay Ajayi, can rebound next week, Crockem has a chance to salvage the season.

We need to be more accepting of those who “turn the world to glass.” Like Ralph Waldo Emerson says in his essay, “The Poet,” the ideal individual in society is unconventional and deviates from the norm in order to expose society to the realities of the world. However, people like these, including the authors of many controversial yet important texts, are people we often need but do not want in our lives, so we try to silence their voices and society’s access to their bold claims.
Last Sunday, Sept. 24, marked the beginning of the 35th celebration of Banned Books Week. Started in 1982 by Judith Krug, a past employee of the American Library Association (ALA) and former director of ALA’s Office of Intellectual Freedom (OIF), the goal of the week is to bring awareness to the books that are challenged or banned in public libraries in America.
But books aren’t banned anymore, right? Many people probably assume this to be true, especially living in the United States, a country so proud of its Constitution and the freedoms declared under the First Amendment. However, if anything, book challenging and banning are becoming more prevalent and problematic.
Challenges, filed by people trying to prohibit books and other materials in their libraries or mandatory school curricula, mostly stem from concerns including “sexually explicit” content, “offensive language,” age inappropriateness, LGBTQ representation, and “religious viewpoints,” according to studies conducted by the OIF on reported book challenges. Of the hundreds of challenges filed and reported in 2016, more than half of the materials that were challenged were actually banned and removed from those particular libraries’ circulation. According to OIF data, bans previously were only implemented, on average, for 10 percent of total yearly challenges. The book bannings of 2016 are a concerning escalation from the norm.
With arguments about how society is becoming too “politically correct,” free speech and censorship have been the focal point of many discussions. People are worried about their ideas being suppressed in favor of more diverse and inclusive perspectives, yet fail to realize that they themselves often treat opposing people in the same way. In fact, the OIF reported that, “of the 2015 Top Ten Most Frequently Challenged Books, nine of them contained diverse content... includ[ing] content by or about people of color, LGBTQ people and/or people with disabilities.”
In the divided and polarized society we live in, we must learn to recognize our differences and the rights granted to us under the First Amendment.
While people may have conflicting viewpoints, none really have the right to silence others’ voices or restrict access to materials just because they clash with their values or beliefs. This year, Banned Books Week’s theme was appropriately named “Our Right to Read,” and encouraged people to express their opposing views on problematic literature, instead of immediately pushing to ban.
Most, if not all, of the concerns leading to book challenges are subjective, merely a matter of differing opinions. Everyone should be able to freely choose to read as they please and not restrict others’ access to education and broader perspectives.
Several years ago, the Library of Congress created an exhibit entitled, Books that Shaped America. Among the 100 titles included on the list, 30 of them have been challenged or banned. Truthfully, this makes a lot of sense. The most influential works are typically the most controversial — they make such a big impact because they leave us reeling from their words and the messages within. They open our eyes to new perspectives and make transparent the bitter truth of our reality (or the harsh realities of the past), which we try so desperately to ignore or forget.
Restricting books is not the solution. Facing conflict and dissent is easier said than done, but it’s the only way society will ever come close to being where it should be. Because even if we have differing views and our ideal societies don’t seem to align, we all essentially want the same things: respect and acknowledgement. Whenever we shut others down, nobody wins — resentment only grows, and the chasm between each side widens.
As Banned Books Week comes to a close, we must remember that although officially over, the celebration doesn’t have to stop. We should
continue to carry out the values that the week has taught us and become well-informed, vocal members of society. Rather than shutting each other down and shying away from dissonant opinions, we must strive to educate ourselves through literature and conversation.

Friday night I found myself backstage at Stage AE surrounded by black leather-clad, heavily makeup-ed, world-class musicians. These were not just any musicians, they were the members of Marilyn Manson’s band. Among them was Tyler Bates, a highly sought-after rock guitarist who has proven himself a master at creating astounding musical narratives.
Bates is a life long musician who transitioned from the world of touring and live performances into a prolific career composing television and film scores. He has created musical landscapes for films such as Dawn of the Dead, 300 and more recent blockbusters including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1. and Vol 2, John Wick, and Atomic Blonde. Throughout his career, Bates has forged partnerships with countless artists, including film directors Zack Snyder and James Gunn, and musician Marilyn Mason. Currently on tour with Manson in support of their latest album, Heaven Upside Down, Bates spends his time delivering killer guitar performances, composing music in makeshift hotel room studios, and trying to get some sleep. Humble, immensely talented, and fully enamored with his craft, Bates hopes that this new album will excite and impress fans and that he can continue to craft stories through composition both on screen and on stage.
You’ve worked on numerous projects as a producer, composer, and musician. How do you see those roles as similar to or contrasting each other?
I would say all three roles overlap. For film composition I need a serious degree of production skills and for production, my work is informed by my experience as a musician. Everything has started to intersect in my life, so all of my projects, no matter what role I’m approaching them from, are about understanding my collaborators and telling their story through music. The core is about storytelling and emotion, and that carries into every space I inhabit.
What does the physical process of composing for the screen look like? Is the score informed by the movie or is the movie informed by your music?
Every single project is a triathlon. And each one is constantly evolving, with certain scenes getting compressed or drawn out and the score changing to fit those adjustments. So it might end up being a 90-minute score, but there were well over 100 minutes of composition that changed as the process went on. And that’s the crazy thing; I might end up producing more hours of music for one film than most musicians produce in their entire career.
And the give and take between the visuals and the composition differs project-to-project and person-to-person. For Guardians of the Galaxy, I worked with James Gunn who I’ve known for years and collaborated on tons of projects with, so we were able to approach the process a bit differently. I actually composed the score based off the script and certain pre sketches, so I was writing to the film sequences before they even existed. The actors would act with ear buds in so every one would move to the tempo and the emotion of the composition.
You’ve worked on incredibly distinct and unique projects with talents in both the film and music industry. How would you describe your creative process, and how is that process informed by collaboration?
I’m always open. My creative process is never the same twice, and it’s never about just making music. It’s about creating a conversation. It’s about understanding people. Music is a vehicle, it’s how I get through things, so I’m always looking for projects that teach me and challenge me where I can continue to grow and maintain some relevance.
I never really know what to expect because there’s always some new direction I’m able to take my work. Recently I worked on the composition for the Guardians of the Galaxy attraction at Disney California Adventure, and I got to work with their team of Imagineers. The spirit they brought was definitely not Hollywood, and I found it really refreshing. We got to work in a team, so I knew that I needed to bring my skills and point of view to the work but that ultimately we had a job to do and we would do it together.
So when it comes to collaboration I would say it depends on what you’re working on. If you’re working on an indie film versus a project for a large studio, the experience is completely different. The size of the team changes, so the whole process and feeling changes. But I try to make my collaborators feel comfortable so that they can feel what I’m trying to convey even if they don’t have a technical understanding.
What do you look for in a collaborator, and how do you go about forming those partnerships?
I just ask the universe to bring good people into my life. I don’t know if life is too long or too short to work with people you don’t like, but I have had the good fortune of working with people who elevate my game. I mean, James Gunn is a genius. Zack Snyder, Rob Zombie, both geniuses. And I’ve been lucky enough to work with them on multiple occasions. Ultimately, I like to work with people who are excited and striving.
That’s why I’m so appreciative of all my time working in film and television. That process of iterating and meeting deadlines is what gave me the ability to articulate ideas quickly, and that’s what has allowed me to collaborate with people like [Marilyn] Manson. Those experiences gave me the stamina and capabilities needed for us to work well together, and I didn’t have that before working in the film industry.
Could you elaborate on what it’s like working with Marilyn Manson and how it may be different from other collaborations?
Well, [working with Manson] is different because there’s nobody else like him. And it’s different than my film score work because no matter what, I will always love to write, record, and play rock music. Rock music is hurting so badly right now, and Manson is the last bastion of real icons, so I want to do my part to help the cause. We’re like brothers; the first time I met him I never would have expected to be writing or playing with him, but somehow it works. He challenges me and we feed off each other’s energies.
You’ve worked on such a diverse range of projects across different mediums and genres. Is there a certain tone you’re trying to convey in all your work, or does it change depending on the project?
I think the me of it, whatever project it is, is identifiable. People who know me can recognize my guitar playing or sense it’s my work immediately. So in a sense I think there is a signature in all my work. I’m looking through the lens of my life experience, and that authenticity and sincerity is what I hope is transcendent to the audience. I’m trying to convey emotion, not an impression of emotion, in all my work.
What advice do you have for young artists?
Be in touch with your spirit, and pursue your art for that reason and purpose it gives you. It’s easy to get jaded to the value of your work, especially when certain industries aren’t paying as much or there isn’t as much demand. But you can’t pander to the climate of the industry. You can change things. You just have to be willing to do whatever it takes so you can do what you love. Music has been my whole life; it’s all I’ve known. I’ve had other jobs, but they were never instead of music, they were so I would be able to keep doing it. Ultimately, I would say a backup plan is a bad idea. Because if you have one, you’ll take it.

With a delivery both straightforward and dynamic, author Susan Perabo read the second chapter of her latest book The Fall of Lisa Bellow to a rapt audience in Danforth Conference Room last Monday. A Professor of English and Writer in Residence at Dickinson College, a small liberal arts college about a three-hour drive away in Carlisle, PA, Perabo has published numerous works of fiction over her career, in both literary magazines and as four books. The Fall of Lisa Bellow is her second novel, and her other two published books are short story collections.
Prior to her reading in Danforth, Perabo visited an introductory fiction course where she talked to students about her craft, her writing process, and her experience as an author. In her introduction to the students in the course, Perabo mentioned her surprising evolution into being the author she is today. She was initially interested in film, and in the course of studying film at college took a writing course to help with her screenplay skills. From then on it became a passion, and she eventually went on to get her MFA.
Her work, particularly her short story work, seems a little at odds with her confident, no-nonsense demeanor. Her work in Why They Run the Way they
Do, a recent short story collection, explores deeply emotional themes of infidelity, loneliness, and coming to terms with a life one might not have envisioned for oneself. Her characters are always complex, and a bit acerbic, and their emotional lives seem to pop off the page. Perabo said it herself that she wouldn’t define herself as an “emotional person,” or a person who wears their heart on their sleeve. This contrast between her more stoic public persona and the intimate and vulnerable character portrayal in her writing makes reading these works all the more fascinating.
Her newest novel seems to continue her thoughtful and emotional examination of her characters’ lives and ways of thinking. The Fall of Lisa Bellow follows a middle-school aged girl Meredith and her mother Claire as they recover from the abduction of Lisa Bellow, a classmate of Meredith’s who was kidnapped in front of Meredith in a sandwich shop. Due to the use of these two protagonists, the book is as much about Meredith’s process of coping with the tragedy and her coming-of-age story wherein the horrific event of the abduction features so prominently as it is a thoughtful rendering of a mother who is trying to navigate the process of supporting her daughter through a life so completely altered by something out of her control.
The chapter she read to the audience on Monday — an audience made up of English professors, students, and other interested parties — mapped the inner dialogue and thought progression of Claire. In the chapter, Claire is thinking back to when Meredith’s brother Evan was being bullied in elementary school, and how angry and overwhelmed it made Claire feel. How does Claire handle it when her children encounter adversity? What are her instincts? How does she cope with the challenges facing her offspring?
The chapter essentially took place solely in Claire’s head. She feels the urge to curse at the students who called her son a “porker,” despite Evan’s assurances that he’s fine. She demonstrates restraint, but it is not without significant effort. The chapter ends with a scene where Claire has her son’s bully as a dental patient, and causes him unnecessary and profound pain during a superfluous dental examination. The scene made me viscerally uncomfortable, a sentiment shared by audience members during the question and answer portion of the event after the conclusion of the chapter.
When asked about her use of individuals from her life as a basis for fictional characters, Perabo stated that no person on the page was a representation of someone she knew, and that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to do justice to a living individual through a fictionalized account. However, she mentioned, she remembers feeling intense anger and confusion when her children faced undeserved nastiness in school. While she never went to the lengths that Claire did, in developing the character of Claire Perabo tried to imagine what type of person would actually act on her feelings of frustration with a stranger’s child. Thus the dentist section was born. In imagining what sort of person might have the opportunity to lash back out to a young offender, she fell upon dentistry as this sort of opportunity for her character.
During the question part of the afternoon, Perabo talked further about her writing process, such as having an ending in mind prior to beginning, or at least close to the beginning of a narrative, as well as her first published piece, and her editing process. Unlike some fiction writers, Perabo does very little research, and instead likes to get the story on the page, and then during revisions, fill in the vague depictions with accurate descriptions and terminology. Though of course an endlessly challenging endeavor, Perabo’s visceral, thoughtful, and introspective narratives seem to demonstrate a more clinical process than an overwhelmingly emotional one.
When thinking about flighty and emotionally unstable authors of fame and fortune, getting to see Perabo’s genius coming from a place of intense thoughtfulness and non-neuroticism was a privilege.

Questions on how we consume and present art on the oppression of people of color have moved to the forefront of conversation in the art world as a result of the election and the turbulence of our current global climate.
Recently, white artists such as Dana Schutz have come under scrutiny for their use of the history of violence against black bodies in their art. Turning non black audiences into spectators of people of color and excluding artists of color from these spaces can perpetuate the tendency of American society to profit off of racial violence and exploitation. How do we curate and share the work of artists of color without falling into that trap?
While the function of gallery spaces is a place for the dynamic current conversations of art, museums like the Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) are a place to learn the visual language to understand art as a broader field. Art museums create a cultural history, and the items preserved in museums are what generations to come will reflect on when understanding our current views of our past. And it is the place where future generations will see how we ask questions about the relationships between race, oppression, and art.
This summer, an exhibition entitled 20/20 opened at the Carnegie Museum of Art. The exhibition is a collaboration between the Carnegie Museum of Art and The Studio Museum in Harlem to bring together the work of forty artists — twenty from each venue — created over the past 100 years. The gorgeous, white wall spaces of CMOA are filled with an expansive array of artists from various periods in art history and at different levels of the art industry. Documentary photographers, leading contemporary artists of color, and outsider artists of color are brought together in this exhibition on the narrative of racial politics and black identity in America.
With the huge range of work and seriousness of subject matter, the curation is ambitious. Each piece is paired with a longer museum label explanation, and each section of the exhibition comes with a title and explanation of the curatorial choices. The viewer’s movement through the gallery is key to the narrative of this exhibition. Although it is not strictly chronological, it feels conscious of an unfolding historical narrative. The subtle growth of strength and subjectivity of black voices in the work as the exhibition progresses serves as the framework for this curation.
The first room open with the centerpiece of Pennsylvanian artist Horace Pippin’s “Abe Lincoln’s First Book,” a piece which paints Lincoln with the visual language of sainthood. The surrounding work in the first two sections entitled “A More Perfect Union” are intended to discuss historical context, with artists of color working to come to terms with the history of slavery and oppression. The inclusion of one of Jasper Johns’s American flag pieces was odd, given that Jasper Johns was a white artist, as was the central focus on the glorification of Lincoln, because of their turned focus on White America. The museum states it intended to question national identity and democracy; the voice of the paired statements is anthropological, an outsider looking in. It relies on the idea that the viewer sees American identity and Blackness as exclusive ideas and asks the viewer to explore that conflict.
The jump from this perspective into the sections of “Working Thought” and “American Landscape” was then at once jarring and natural. The work in these spaces was dedicated to the discussion of class, violence, and exploitation. Artists such as Kara Walker, David Hammons, and Titus Kaphar vary in degrees of abstraction and modes of expression, but all in all it is an exploration of trauma perpetrated by the American economy.
Walker’s folksy silhouettes portray graphic violence against black women while "Black Wall Street" by Noah Davis is a remembrance of the incredible violence of the 1921 race riots against an affluent black community. This section tries to cover so much, and the matter of factness of violence on black bodies feels uncomfortably contained in these vignettes of history.
This part of 20/20 builds into the central exhibition of the Teenie Harris and James VanDerZee documentary photography segment entitled “Documenting Black Life.” Both these exhibitions begin to demonstrate the struggle of building identity through violence and class struggle, but this section focuses on the nostalgia of intimate moments that would have otherwise been forgotten by history. The Pittsburgh and Harlem communities presented in sepia film and older generations of clothing played with this narrative of history lost, hidden, or ignored.
It was unexpectedly startling to enter the final sections, “Shrine for Spirit” and “Forms of Resistance.” The enormous portrait of Michelle Obama by Collier Schorr that was published in T: The New York Times Style Magazine was the piece that articulated the feeling of these sections. These rooms were dedicated to the unabashed, intensely personal focus on the self. These works focused on activism, honoring the identity and culture of people of color. They shared the interactions of artists of color and media from their first person perspective. But the Michelle Obama and Kerry James Marshall portraits as end pieces had the biggest impact. Contrasted in the same room with Ellen Gallagher’s mixed media pieces with magazines and Lorraine O’Grady’s performance stills where she flays herself with a cat-o-nine-tails in a beauty pageant character, these pieces stood out in emotional resonance.
It was because Michelle Obama’s portrait had the only black woman given a name and understood as a person and cultural icon who was not in this exhibition because of her connection to exploitation and violence. A regal, accomplished, and beautiful black woman who is so beloved placed so prominently in the exhibition with admittedly complicated symbols of wealth was powerful. In contrast, the vibrant, joyful portrait “Untitled (Gallery)” by Kerry James Marshall of a black woman relaxed in her own space was important because it allowed for the more intimate, ordinary person parallel to the Michelle Obama photograph.
The effect of these portraits in the final room would not have been the same without the documentation of struggle and trauma we saw previously. It was important as well that the ending of this exhibition wasn’t through rose colored lenses, and that it didn’t stick to a chronological order — it recognizes that the fight for equality is ongoing. The collections allow the viewer to see how the artists of color choose to play with Western artistic traditions versus to create their own. It parallels the tension of existing within a white dominated society, and the questions of how to move forward.
The Carnegie Museum of Art and all white cube gallery spaces were created with a literal manifesto of whiteness connecting to sophistication. But exhibitions such as 20/20, and society as a whole, are working to transform these kinds of elitist institutions into something more inclusive. The people who come to this exhibition are likely to be middle and upper class individuals open to racial discourse, and some of the messages of industry and oppression feel overly subtle as if trying not to offend. The desire for a nationalistic sentiment is present throughout the gallery spaces, but the question about American identity is presented as confused as we feel it today.
This exhibition, though imperfect, was ultimately successful. The discomfort with these questions of consuming violence and oppression, being a spectator in the room where you learn about the complexities of identity and racial politics in this country, is important. The exhibition is not only about grief and trauma, but also about hope and agency. It allows for the black artist and subject to be the primary voice and announces a commitment to understanding these stories. 20/20 is open until the end of the year. In this time in our history, with the national dialogue about neo-colonialism and NFL protests and class conflict ever-present, it is important to hear the voices of artists of color and sit with your questions.

Part of becoming part of the over-twenty-one world is finding your bar aesthetic. Are you a classy wine bar person? A clubbing kind of person? Me, I’m a dive bar person. Give me cheap drinks, smokey air, and a pool table, and I’m a happy camper
This week we trekked out to Polish Hill for what Pittsburgh Magazine has labeled the best dive bar in the city, Gooski’s.
The location: The location was my least favorite part of this bar. What looks like a long but doable trip on two busses from campus during the day turns into an odyssey at night when busses run less regularly. Also, the trip there was a little nerve wracking as a girl traveling alone. Once in Polish Hill, Gooski’s is tucked away on an otherwise unassuming street.
There’s not much else going on in the area, but that gives the bar a “hidden gem” feel. It’s a smokey hole in the wall with graffitied walls illuminated with dusky red lights. A chalkboard behind the bar reads, “Southside called, they want their douchebags back.”
The drinks: They’re cheap, they’re strong, and they’re served by a no nonsense bartender with a dry sense of humor. What more could you want?
This is not the place for fruity cocktails with a dozen ingredients. The bar is fully stocked but the only menus (written on the walls) are for their plethora of microbrews, so this isn’t really the place for exploring drinks. Go in knowing your go-to cocktail. This bar is cash only, so that’s another way you’ll need to come prepared.
The vibe: We were at Gooski’s on a Thursday, so the crowd was mostly from the neighborhood and pretty relaxed. Gooski’s is divided into two rooms, a slightly cramped front room with the bar, and a larger back room with ping pong and a pool table, as well as a stage for music acts on the weekends. As the night wore on, the front room filled up and became more boisterous, though the back room remained pretty empty and quiet. On a weekend, the place seems like it would get pretty rowdy.
The music is all jams from the ‘80s, the walls are covered in sassy commentary, and the bathroom graffiti is downright hilarious.
At the end of the day, Gooski’s is a classic dive bar, with all it entails. You’re gonna be around some fun and eccentric folks, might play pool with some new friends, and you’re definitely going to reek of smoke by the time you get home.
Lit or Nah: We’re going to go with Lit. It’s got a very clear vibe, and it does it well. If you want a no-nonsense dive, this is it. Unfortunately, it’s a bit too out of the way to justify the trip. If you happen to be out the way in Polish Hill, it’s 100 percent worth hitting up. But, alas, it’s not the convenient neighborhood dive I’ve been dreaming of.

Hi Ruth, 
I have a serious question that needs answering. Most people are familiar with the scenario of liking someone romantically and having them not feel the same way back. You're either casually friendzoned or just straight up rejected. It's totally not fun, but at least it's not nearly as confusing as the less common conundrum that I'm currently experiencing. 
What do I do when someone I just want to kick it with doesn't feel the same? Like c'mon, man. I don't want to fluff your nut, I just want to be your friend, so why don't you feel the same way?! I might be coming off a bit too strong, but I just want them to know I think they're really cool! Or maybe I'm not coming on strong enough? I just can't figure it out... I mean, who wouldn't want to me by friend? I give good hugs and I'm always down to buy you a cookie from ABP.
Anyways, please help. I just want to be friends!
XOXO,
Platonic Admiration Only
Dear PAO,
You know, I’ve been writing this column for nearly a year now, and I’m honestly surprised that I haven’t yet had to answer “how do I make friends.” Which, if we’re honest, is not exactly what you're asking, but hang in with me for a bit.
The big secret on making friends, or at the least getting people to think positively about you, is to find a connection. Literally any connection. That old small-talk joke about how people just complain about the weather? That counts. Is something happening on the Cut? Counts. Do you both have a shared professor who neither of you like? Definitely counts.
Look, people like people that they have things in common with, especially if it’s easy to hold a conversation with that person. Of course, you ideally won’t  just talk about the weather for the rest of your acquaintance, but that’s what being an interesting human being is about. (You’re an interesting human being, I promise. Everybody has something they’re passionate about, and passion is what makes people interesting.)
Once you’re ready to move past the small-talk phase, assuming you guys haven’t already sort of fallen into a friendship, all you really need to do is start inviting them to things. Things you think they’d be interested in, obviously, but don’t be discouraged if they say no.
The first time they might think you're just being nice, so you might want to invite them to a few things before you rule them out. (If they keep saying no and not offering to reschedule or don't have any legitimate excuses, then maybe you should give them the space to come to you. They could just be going through a busy period in their life, but you shouldn't be putting in all the effort.)
But here's the thing — it sounds like you've already done all this. You've chatted with them, you've asked them to hang out, and they just seem... uninterested. Well, I hate to break it to you but you can't force anyone to be friends with you. I know, I'm sorry. 
Even if they seem really cool and you really want to hang out with them, if they don't feel the same, there's really nothing you can do. Friendship isn't all that different from love in that way. 
If someone doesn't want to befriend you when you've been nothing but a decent person to them, it's going to feel like a rejection of you as a person, but it's really not. It can't be, not if they don't know you that well. Sometimes that's just how life plays out. It's kind of a bummer, but you shouldn't waste effort on someone who you're getting no response from. You deserve better.
Keep hugging,
Ruth

On Sept. 28, the Worlds Within exhibition presented a panel discussion with Rob Kesseler, Worlds Within artist and Steve Tonsor, Director of Science and Research at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The accomplished presenters discussed how the relationships between artists and scientists have evolved into partnerships and presented cases of the avenues for the intersections of these two disciplines they have seen, as well as potential avenues of collaboration in the future.
Kesseler began the talk with his story. At the start of his interdisciplinary career, he spent much of his time struggling to get his work published, one of which was a book of photographs of pollen. One primary obstacle is getting scientists to collaborate with him and the interdisciplinary work he was describing. A large focus, he contended, was the benefits that initiatives give to scientists, both tangible and intangible. Through some struggle, he established a book deal with a small publishing firm. His first book, titled Pollen: The Hidden Sexuality of Flowers, is colorized microscope electron images. This work was only possible because Kessler found a scientist excited to work with him: Madeline Harley, a pollen researcher at Kew Gardens with a background in interior design and a passion for the beauty of the images of pollen she was making for her research practice. That was the start of a series of books he decided to dedicate himself to. Her story, like the others, centers around the idea of giving experimental projects a chance to benefit both artists and scientists. Kesseler later worked with artist exchanges for an institute in Portugal, a hub for contemporary art that embraces creative direction and interdisciplinary minds. He performed assignments that required color additives, such as slicing extremely thin plant stems and colorizing them for various tests. He explored the process by manipulating the colorizing method, applying it at various points throughout the lab that scientists would not otherwise apply, thus showing scientists a way to look at a process like they never have before.
This thinking was put into practice at the Royal Microscopical Society, where programed outreach to kids was created to get children interested in science as more than just lab work. Showing that projects like these are as much art as they are science gets the foot in the door for them to be understood, an important step to allow outside parties to take the work more seriously and allow support for that type of work to be established.
Tonsor presented next, with an interesting take on reasons to think outside traditional parameters. Having worked at the Carnegie Museum of National History, he is not shy in applying science to philosophy. His quest for the sublime, for example, is continuous and significantly affects his personal philosophy of discipline exploration. His anecdotes include a moment where he saw moths flying beautifully in the moonlight. With a fervent enthusiasm to natural sciences, he started experimenting his quest by dissecting things, literally. However, his path into science rendered him trapped in a process of strict discipline. Tonsor talked about Kant and the sublime, the scientific method where a theory is explicable. The traditional method of scientific thinking is an idea or theory that runs through trials, with the individuals attempting to falsify it by testing it with different variables, a rational principle that includes a concrete goal. But the really great theories, he argues, are not rationally created. They are created arational by nature, which scares scientists, but should not consequentially be ignored, he argues. That is why a lot of scientists who make a lot of impact were involved with art in their lives. His own initial experience with artists, he admitted, was at first thought of as ridiculous, but because he felt like he lost the sublime and wanted to get back in touch with it, he expanded his perspectives and started appreciating the practice and the avenues it crosses with science, where it addresses things one cannot explain.
Tonsor encourages people to think arationally and interact with the pool of the unknown instead of strictly sticking to the scientific method since this approach can allow artists and scientists to benefit each other.

For most of us, crossing the street is as routine and simple as eating and drinking. But for people who are visually impaired or who have other disabilities that impede their ability to move freely, crossing the street can be a stressful experience at best in a traffic system not always designed with their needs in mind.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, with the help of a $2 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), are aiming to change this situation by researching smart traffic signals that can communicate directly with smartphones and adjust green-light times to accommodate those with disabilities who would require longer times to cross an intersection, or warn the user if the traffic signal detects that he or she is moving outside the intersection.
One of the project’s leaders, Stephen Smith, a professor of robotics, revealed the thought process behind the idea of using smart traffic signals to better accommodate those with special needs in an interview with The Tartan.
“I began thinking about the idea a few years ago after giving a talk on our traffic signal control work to the Golden Triangle Council for the Blind, and hearing their perspectives and problems on pedestrian navigation through intersections,” recalled Smith.
Thus, when he heard about the Accessible Transportation Technology Research Initiative (ATTRI) sponsored by FHWA, he seized the opportunity to start exploring the idea of using technology to mitigate the issues that special-needs pedestrians face at intersections.
“My group had already been working in the area integrating adaptive signal control with emerging “connected vehicle” technology, where vehicles equipped with dedicated short range communication (DSRC) radios communicate directly with the intersection, and extending direct communication to pedestrians with disabilities seemed like a natural idea,” explained Smith.
Smith and the team involved in the project aim to develop a mobile app that can run on a smartphone equipped with DSRC capability, which will facilitate the main part of the communication between pedestrian and intersection traffic signals. They also hope to integrate this communication feature with Surtrac, a system combining artificial intelligence, traffic theory, and real-time traffic data to optimize traffic signal control to reduce waiting times, congestion, and pollution. Surtract was also developed in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute and led by Smith with support from the school’s Traffic21 and Metro21 initiatives. Surtrac already has shown tangible benefits: according to a university press release, in Pittsburgh, Surtrac has “reduce[d] travel time by 25 percent, braking by 30 percent, and idling by more than 40 percent.”
“Most basically, the app will encode and allow communication of the pedestrian’s personal crossing constraints (namely travel speed) to the intersection, and the signal control system will ensure that the pedestrian is given sufficient green time to cross,” Smith explains.
Additionally, the app will also make use of the smartphone’s GPS system to monitor whether the pedestrian is crossing outside of the crosswalk and whether it is necessary to further adjust the traffic signal timing based on the pedestrian’s progress through the intersection. The team also plans to use route information from the pedestrian’s smartphone to streamline their travel by anticipating the user’s arrival at certain intersections.
Smith says the team plans to do field testing with volunteers from the local blind community in the East End of Pittsburgh, where the Surtrac system has already been deployed, and eventually develop a system that can work for people who have other disabilities as well. It could be useful to many people who live in suburban areas where pedestrians are infrequent and signals do not always accommodate them.
Since smartphones do not generally have built-in DSRC capabilities, the testing will require outfitting a DSRC sleeve to the testing subjects’ smartphones, but future phone models could integrate such a feature if it proves useful, according to Smith in a university press release. Ultimately, the driving force behind the project is integrating modern technology into our infrastructure in order to improve safety and mobility for pedestrians with disabilities.

Welcome back, students of Carnegie Mellon! After a summer full of new and fulfilling experiences, whether they were internships, research positions, or relaxing at home, we are already back in the swing of things and ready to start off the semester while continuing to put our hearts into the work. As your student representatives for the 2017-2018 school year, we have strategized on how to provide the most enriching student experience at Carnegie Mellon. The student body executives, along with members of Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly, were elected to tailor the student experience with the needs of our growing community. We are incredibly excited to share with you all the new initiatives that student body government has to share for this semester.
Student body government has identified four main pillars that demonstrate our priorities for this school year: mental health awareness, fiscal transformation, collaboration, and diversity. Students with a passion to improve each sector were appointed to the Student Body President’s Cabinet to spearhead the initiatives of each pillar. The mental health awareness pillar focuses more on providing students with a more accurate understanding of the demands of their courses as well as figuring out how to make wellness a more viable option. Fiscal transformation deals with the finances of the university and making university transactions more transparent to students. The collaboration pillar aims to unite student organizations and provide greater entrepreneurship opportunities to students. Finally, the diversity pillar focuses on the inclusion of students of all backgrounds. To accomplish the goals of each pillar, we are working with university administration and entities, such as Counseling and Psychological Services and the new Center for Diversity and Inclusion, to meet the needs of the entire student body.
If you have any questions regarding the pillars, please contact the respective chair. Their contact information can be found below:
Mental Health Awareness Chair : Michael James, mrjames@cmu.edu
Fiscal Transformation Chair: Tiffany Lu, tclu@andrew.cmu.edu
Co-Collaboration Chair: Simran Jobanputra, sjobanpu@andrew.cmu.edu
Co-Collaboration Chair: Christie Chang, cchang2@andrew.cmu.edu
Diversity: Kameron Bradley, kwbradle@cmu.edu
Other notable points of contact for student body government include:
Student Body President: Neal Choudhary, sbp@andrew.cmu.edu
Student Body Vice President: Pulkita Dua, sbvp@andrew.cmu.edu
Student Body Vice President for Finance: Gaby Cach, sbvpf@andrew.cmu.edu
Student Body Vice President for Organizations: Hannah Nourie, sbvpo@andrew.cmu.edu

The name change from the Department of Statistics to the Department of Statistics and Data Science was marked by some interesting statistics of its own. Applicants to Dietrich thinking about studying statistics have doubled since 2013, and the number of undergraduate statistics majors is four times the size of what it was in 2010, and twenty times the size of what it was in 2003.
This change was prompted not by an abrupt shift in what the Statistics Department does, but rather was meant to reflect the shifting state of the field. “Because our approach to statistics encompasses the essence of what data science is and can be, we have decided to change the name of the department to the Department of Statistics and Data Science. We feel this name more accurately reflects the department’s position on the leading edge of research and education in a data-rich world,” stated Richard Scheines, the Dean of Dietrich, and Christopher Genovese, head of the Department of Statistics and Data Science in a Dietrich-wide email.
As “big data” becomes more and more central to the work of the Statistics Department, the work done by the department is also on the cutting edge of the technological atmosphere prevalent at Carnegie Mellon, as evidenced by the degree in Statistics and Machine Learning offered jointly by the Department of Statistics and the Department of Machine Learning in the School of Computer Science.
The Statistics Department at Carnegie Mellon has always somewhat defied classification. It is housed within Dietrich, and as such, takes a uniquely social-science-geared approach to statistics. “Our statisticians and data scientists exemplify the Carnegie Mellon approach to the humanities and social sciences, which infuses foundational and deep research across disciplines to take on and offer solutions for issues that are important to the world today,” stated Richard Scheines in a university press release. Some knowledge of statistics is required for all Dietrich students, so a change in the mission of this department touches dozens of majors in this university.
The distinction between data science and statistics is sometimes blurred, but often statistics tends to veer more into the realm of the theoretical, while data science tackles the interpretation of large data sets. The Department of Statistics and Data Science has long pursued both, even before the re-brand. “For the past 50 years, we have made a big impact in both statistical theory and applying those theories to real problems and real data in fields from genetics and astronomy to sports and finance,” stated Christopher Genovese.
The real world application of theoretical and technical concepts is a cornerstone of both the philosophy of our university and the practice of data science, so this approach fits easily into the larger mission of the department. “Our curriculum is designed to give students a taste and a wide variety of experiences of what it is like to do statistics and data science in the real world. We take problems that are real — from research, industry and government — and put them straight into the classroom,” said Rebecca Nugent, director of undergraduate studies.

Carnegie Mellon University’s first-year class of 2021+ has a majority of women for the first time in the University’s history, marking another milestone among the top universities that are bridging the gender and minority gaps in certain fields. 51 percent of the class of 2021+ are women, and specifically the proportion of women in Carnegie Mellon’s six undergraduate colleges continues to increase.
Interim president Farnam Jahanian, interim provost Laurie Weingart, and Dean of Admissions Michael Steidel suggest that Carnegie Mellon’s progress in attracting more women in the last few years is the result of strategic academic and professional planning within each college, as well as the whole university’s endeavor to prioritize building a sense of community based on diversity and inclusion.
This year especially, women make up 57 percent of Tepper School of Business’ undergraduate class, which is not just noticeably high among top-ranked national business programs but also a personal feat for the college itself, since this percentage is 12 percent higher than the already-increasing rates from last year.
Robert Dammon, Dean of Tepper, explained that Tepper is distinguished as a business school, because it is at the crossroads of business, technology, and analytics. Recently, Tepper’s academic programs as well as its allocation of resources has helped drive specific niches in the college to increase inclusion and teamwork-based projects.
Tepper’s Community Conversations is just one of the undergraduate initiatives taken by the college across its undergraduate, masters, and doctoral-level programs. In Tepper Community Conversations, undergraduate students, faculty, and staff members discuss opportunities and methods to enhance learning experiences. The construction of the David A. Tepper Quadrangle provides physical, localized learning spaces for school-based and professional collaboration.
In a university press release, Steidel states, “As we look at the factors that helped attract this record-breaking class, each college and school has its own story to tell.” Women make up 49.8 percent in the freshman class’s computer science program and 43 percent of the freshman class’s engineering program. Also, Mellon College of Science has its largest first-year class ever with 285 students including interdisciplinary scholars, and Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences was recently hailed for its growing number of students, particularly women, in its most popular field of statistics and data science.
All this happens as Carnegie Mellon admission rates show increased competition as incoming SAT scores remain high, but it is important to remember that numbers can only tell us so much. Any school should not merely count or recite the numbers of its women or other minorities; this is only considered an advancement if paralleled with progress to build a better community. As seen in the case of Tepper, Carnegie Mellon should be celebrated for its dedication to “de-bias” certain programs, monitor how underrepresented groups succeed, and prioritize inclusivity in all settings.

Every 98 seconds someone in the United States is sexually assaulted. Going through such harrowing events can have severe emotional and psychological impressions on the victim. In most cases, perpetrators of these acts are able to walk away freely without punishment for their actions, thus silencing the voice, dignity, and rights of the people they have sought out as prey. 
Rather than working to fight for these victims, Secretary of Education Bestsy DeVos has decided to focus her efforts on giving the accused of such crimes, who she argues are treated unfairly, due process and a larger voice in the matter. The newly proposed Title IX guidelines to be implemented at colleges supposedly seeks to make investigations into sexual assault allegations more equitable for both the accuser and accused. These new guidelines remove the two month time limit on investigations, allows the accused to appeal the accusation against them, and raises the “preponderance of evidence” to a “clear and convincing evidence” standard.  
But many are worried these new guidelines limit the rights previously held by victims of sexual assault, making allegations against the accused harder to prove, and thus making it increasingly difficult for survivors to seek the justice they deserve. 
The restructuring of Title IX practices onto college campuses is one of many changes made by the Trump Administration to initiatives made under President Obama’s Administration. Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 states that “no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” In the Obama-era, the Office of Civil Rights asserted that this law should be applied to all schools to protect girls and women, usually the victims of these crimes, from sexual assault or harassment. This has led to the creation of Title IX offices at many universities that train students and faculty members on how to respond to allegations of sexual harassment or assault while also strengthening the university's actions in response to such allegations. 
Carnegie Mellon University has adopted its own Office of Title IX Initiatives and a sexual harassment and sexual assault policy to foster a positive living and learning environment “that promotes the confidence to work, study, innovate and perform without fear of sexual harassment or sexual assault.” This policy lays out detailed procedures to address complaints and identify instances of sexual assault and provide students with resources to deal with their effects.
The most controversial part of Obama’s original Title IX assertion was that schools were told to adopt a “preponderance of evidence,” which places more emphasis on how convincing evidence is over the amount of evidence presented to decide if a student is responsible for an act of sexual assault.  Instances of sexual assault usually take place in private rooms, without outside witnesses, making proof beyond a reasonable doubt difficult to gather. This lower burden of proof set forth by the preponderance of evidence standard takes this into account and allows for an increase in actions taken by school officials in response to sexual assault allegations.
Many critics of this act, such as DeVos, have argued that Title IX’s enforcement at schools lessens the point of view of those accused, thereby ignoring their first amendment right to freedom of speech. Last year, an open letter by 21 law professors argued that although “sexual harassment represents unacceptable conduct, and those found responsible should be appropriately sanctioned,” the Office of Civil Rights has “unlawfully expanded the nature and scope of institutions’ responsibility to address sexual harassment, thereby compelling institutions to choose between fundamental fairness for students and their continued acceptance of federal funding.” Since colleges stood to lose access to student federal aid if they didn’t implement this act, the lawyers argue that this led to colleges choosing to side more heavily with victims of sexual assault, thus downplaying the accused's side of the story.
“The union bosses made it clear: They care more about a system — one that was created in the 1800s — than they do about students," DeVos said in a speech given at Harvard University. "Their focus is on school buildings instead of school kids. Isn’t education supposed to be all about kids?” 
Even if the Office of Civil Rights’ actions were an administrative overreach that placed the behavior of universities under strict federal scrutiny, it led to a quick and immediate response by school officials to listen to the “kids” at their schools. These actions made students feel more empowered to come forward after being assaulted, to make known the ordeal they had to live through, thus, to some degree, giving them back the power that was taken away from them by such an act. Raising the level of evidence to be presented takes those rights away from students, and limits the progress that has been made to make instances of sexual assault known.
But just because a school has to take sexual assault allegations more seriously, doesn’t mean that school officials should feel compelled to implicate the accused student to make it seem that they are being proactive. A 2010 study conducted at Northeastern University indicates that the prevalence of false allegations is between two percent and 10 percent with a disproportionate amount of those accused and punished for committing acts of sexual assault being men of color. 
The point of Title IX is for universities to be made aware that such acts are taking place on their campuses and to take allegations of sexual assault more seriously. According to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), women in college are three times more likely to be victims of sexual assault than those not attending a university, but only 20 percent are likely to report this, believing that it is a personal matter that they are compelled to deal with on their own out of fear of retaliation and shame. Harboring such thoughts can often lead to depression and thoughts of suicide. How can we make progress to let assaulters know that their actions have consequences if we don't give victims a safe and supportive outlet to share their experiences?
Many universities, such as the University of Colorado, have chosen to stick to the guidelines put in place during the Obama-era. In a statement made by Holly Hippensteel and Jamie Edwards, representatives of Carnegie Mellon’s Office of Title IX Initiatives, the university does not plan for these new guidelines to immediately impact sexual assault prevention and response efforts at the university, but is moving forward to develop a new policy through public comments. 
“We remain committed to providing support, resources and information to individuals in our community who have been impacted by these issues and to providing fair, prompt and thorough investigations and resolution to community members who seek resolution through the University,” Hippensteel and Edwards said in a statement. 
Schools should be responsive to acts of assault that take place on their grounds. Students have rights, and it is the duty of the university to assure students that their rights will not be violated, to assure students that they will listen to their students’ concerns and do all they can to deal with the matter. Sexual assault is simply not a crime that lends itself to providing proof beyond a reasonable doubt, when it is well known that such clear proof is not always obtainable. It is, first and foremost, a violation of a woman’s civil rights.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective. Find previous installments @thetartan.org.
There are about 13,000 students at Carnegie Mellon. They come from dozens of different countries and have very different cultures. They have lived very different lives, with different experiences. They study different topics and have different passions.
I knew all of this way before my Masters program started. After all, these are well-known facts that you can easily find on Carnegie Mellon's Wikipedia page.  The university is proud to hold a large, heterogeneous community, and eager to repeat it in public announcements or Facebook posts. Besides, many universities in the United States or worldwide have an equally rich community. Still, this was a shock.
It was a positive shock, mostly. In the French school where I graduated, only 500 students were admitted every year through a national competitive exam. Before taking it, we studied for two years in classes especially designed to prepare students for this exam, along with thousands of other students throughout the country. All of us followed more or less the same program — it focused on science and a whole lot of math. All of us did the same exercises that we found in the same books. And eventually, for those entering this school, all of us had very similar undergraduate courses despite our respective majors.
In other words, we did not have different backgrounds — each student knew about everything the others did in the school and throughout the two years before. There were some international students, of course — but only a hundred, coming from a small set of countries used to sending students in that specific place. A lot of them even came to France before to do that same two-year training program.
Imagine how new the Carnegie Mellon experience is for me! In my own graduate program in computer science, I have met people who have little in common with me. Some of them are American and come from different states, where they usually had typical undergraduate programs in computer science — but not all of them: one majored in linguistics. In either case their last four years were not like mine. Some of them are Indian, and by talking to them I learned that the Indian selection system for scientific higher education had similarities with the French system — which I never would have guessed before. Some of them worked a couple of years before joining Carnegie Mellon, while my professional experience sums up to two small, mandatory internships. And we came here with different hopes and goals in mind.
And when I widen my horizon to other departments or schools, it’s even way more impressive. I have met MBA students, math students and professional musicians, whose backgrounds have nothing to do with mine — which is great! If you haven’t had the chance yet, I recommend you take any opportunity you have to leave your college or department and meet different kinds of people. And the idea that despite all that separates us we are all Carnegie Mellon students is really amazing.
There is just one small problem. If Carnegie Mellon University students are so different, if we come for such various reasons, to get educations that don’t look alike, then what exactly are Carnegie Mellon students? Let’s imagine that in ten years I meet a fellow alumnus who was at Carnegie Mellon at the same time as me, but I don’t know personally. I honestly don’t know what we could talk about, what common memories we could share and smile about. Obviously what courses we followed or which professors we knew wouldn’t serve as common ground. So only a few anecdotal points remain. How the campus was. What you thought of Pittsburgh. A few funny emails, maybe. And memes on Facebook groups.
I think that isn’t enough. A university should build a community, and a community is built on things to share. Although a less diverse community may not be very rich or interesting, an overly-diverse one has trouble even existing, because it lacks common ground. I am exaggerating, of course: we still have Carnegie Mellon’s motto to share, “My heart is in the work.” Admittedly, we all work a lot — which also has a drawback, as stated in this column’s previous issue. Still, I believe we could share more than that.
But we won’t make compromises on student diversity just to have more in common, will we? Of course not — that would be a terrible and stupid sacrifice. So how do you build common ground when you lack common background? Well, the answer lies in the question: by building it. Actively. Through university-wide events, or non-academic projects we could all take part in.
Such things already partly exist. Orientation, for example, is a great initiative — but is only one week long. There are also a lot of student associations, and a couple of traditions: the Fence, the Spring Carnival, etc. Some day this column will tackle them specifically and reflect on how traditions could be more involving for students. In the meantime, this article’s point is: participate. Build common ground, and if there isn’t enough, make more. And to start with, don’t forget to leave your own college sometimes. Not to enhance your resume, but just because in ten, fifteen, twenty years, this will constitute your Carnegie Mellon identity.

It was less than two weeks ago when Senate Republicans announced another strategic push to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act (ACA): a promise that they had made to their voters back in 2010, when the ACA was first signed into law. “[The Graham-Cassidy Bill] would repeal the pillars of Obamacare and replace the failed law’s failed approach with a new one, allowing states and governors to actually implement better healthcare ideas by taking more decision-making power out of Washington,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), on the Senate floor. 
Developed by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the "Graham-Cassidy Bill" was to essentially apportion some federal funding allocated under the ACA to states in the form of federal block grants, giving states more flexibility and discretion to use healthcare funds. Two main problems threatened the success of the bill, however: the Sept. 30 deadline and the need for at least 50 votes from the chamber. 
Last Tuesday, Sept. 26, less than 24 hours after Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) declared her opposition, the Graham-Cassidy Bill was announced dead, not even putting the legislation up for a vote on the floor. “We’re coming back to this after taxes,” said Graham. “I believe this is the most important thing I can ever do for the country — working with my colleagues — is not to just repeal Obamacare but to replace it with a system closer to where you live, controlled by people you can vote for.” 
In addition to Collins, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) were responsible for the Republican leadership’s final decision to scrap the bill — with three Republicans opposing the proposal, the leadership had no confidence to put the bill up for a vote. “I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,” said McCain in a statement on Sept. 22. “I believe we can do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried.” 
McCain has referenced to something very important here: bipartisanship. While it has been a common phenomenon to vote along party lines when it comes to issues like healthcare, McCain — who now seems to be playing the role of the moderate, pragmatic conservative — has shown us that he cares more about the content and impact of the legislation than the passage of the bill itself.
Regardless, President Donald Trump expressed his discontent for these Senators. “We were very disappointed by a couple of Senators, Republican Senators I must say,” he said. “At some point there will be a repeal and replace, but we will see whether that point will be now or shortly thereafter. But, we are disappointed at certain so-called Republicans.” 
Democrats, on the other hand, celebrated. “From one end of America to the other, the Graham-Cassidy bill would have been a health-care disaster,” commented Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “Our colleagues had no choice in the face of opposition from one end of the land to the other.”
This, in fact, is far from the first effort by Republicans to repeal the ACA. From the American Health Care Act to the Better Health Care Reconciliation Act to the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act to the numerous proposals drafted by individual Senators, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly pursued a replacement for the ACA in the past few years. As a matter of fact, the ACA is, indeed, in need of serious reform. According to The New York Times, insurance premiums are set to rise in 2018 due to insurers “citing the Trump administration’s hostile policy messages as a substantial reason for higher prices.” So, the question is, why hasn’t Congress found a solution yet, seven years after the passage of the ACA?
“You know, I could have, maybe, give you 10 reasons why this bill shouldn’t be considered,” stated Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) in a phone call with reporters discussing the Graham-Cassidy proposal. “But… Republicans campaigned on this so often that we have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign. That’s pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.” 
Frankly, Grassley — though heavily criticized for the above statement — said it all. In too many situations, especially when dealing with polarizing issues such as healthcare, the prevailing attitude of politicians — both left and right — is that they desperately need to get legislation passed regarding their campaign promises, regardless of the “substance of the bill.” Yes, it is important for representatives to keep their word and fulfill promises. However, shouldn’t we expect policymakers to be equally considerate of the quality and the impact that their bill will have on the American people? 
Perhaps, this is the reason why Congress has yet to replace the ACA with a more sustainable solution. When it comes to decisive issues like healthcare, a rushed bill simply won’t do. As such, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has recently shed light on the lack of long-term thought put into many of the recent “replace and repeal” efforts, including the Graham-Cassidy proposal itself which was projected to leave millions more without comprehensive health insurance.
In this regard, we go back to what McCain mentioned: the most tenable and balanced solution requires bipartisan dialogue. This healthcare impasse is neither political sustainable nor economically viable. Voting across party lines and rushing bills through the Senate floor should no longer be condoned: we ought to expect higher standards of our representatives. Politicians, on both sides of the aisle, should stop treating policymaking as opportunities to add new items to their resume. In essence, Congress should never pass bills just because they were promised; Congress should pass bills because they can make a positive, lasting impact.

In an effort to gain some brownie points with veterans and out of anger from a rejected invitation to the White House by Golden State Warriors basketball player Stephen Curry, President Donald Trump tweeted calling for the firing of players who protest during the anthem at National Football League (NFL) games. In response, the Steelers, along with other teams, did not take the field during the anthem, resulting in angry fans who saw the act as disrespectful to the military. However, these protests across the NFL aren’t about disrespecting the American flag and our military, they’re about racism and police brutality.
While Steelers president Art Rooney issued a statement claiming that Steelers did not want to say anything political by not standing for the anthem, the team certainly said something. Football fans cannot expect the NFL to stay out of political issues when the President of the United States calls for the firing of certain players. The Steelers did not take the field to respect the rights of their fellow teammates, not to disrespect the military.
The Steelers claiming that they did not take the field during the anthem to avoid making a statement is the just organization trying to appease angry fans. As someone who has family who served in the military, I was raised being taught that the flag is symbolic of the sacrifices made for this country. I cannot imagine a time where I would kneel during the anthem. However, I acknowledge that symbols, like the American flag, can be open to more than one interpretation. For me, America has treated me well. But, this is not the case for a great amount of American citizens who are still overcoming racial barriers. I have never taken offense to anyone kneeling during the anthem, and I never will. For them, America has not been well. For them, the flag stands for institutionalized racism and the obstacles they face for something as arbitrary as the color of their skin. Colin Kaepernick, the player who began the movement last year, even decided to take a knee instead of sitting after a conversation with a veteran last year. There is nothing more these players could have done to make it clear that kneeling is a way for them to bring light to issues and generate a discussion, not show disrespect for the military. 
Protests during the anthem are not violent, and peaceful protests should be encouraged in a democracy. No one is harmed when someone kneels during the anthem. NFL players have a large following, and this following can be used as a platform to bring social justice issues to light. While Kaepernick has essentially been blackballed from the NFL, his protest from last year has been a success. It is the next season, and not only has the conversation continued, but other players have also joined them movement. If we fail to legitimize nonviolent protests, we only leave violent protests as an answer to injustice.
Steelers fans are so upset about the protests that they are burning jerseys and cancelling season tickets, but no one had such a violent, negative reaction when Ben Roethlisberger allegedly raped two women. In fact, he still remains the team’s quarterback, and Steeler fans had no issue buying tickets to support him or the long list of other men accused for sexual and/or domestic assault. Steelers fans are just hiding behind the veil of “supporting the military” to mask their true intention of silencing activists who want to bring an end to racial injustice.
In order to bring change and end racism, we need activists in the NFL to generate these conversations, even if they make us uncomfortable. Steelers fans who wish they could watch a game without “politics” need to acknowledge the privilege they have that racial issues are something they can turn on and off, because people who experience racism do not get that option: it’s something they have to deal with from the day they are born until the day they die.

The Fifth Amendment has been rendered obsolete. Apple’s new Face ID is an example of human ingenuity but one that raises a whole host of questions about our privacy and mass surveillance. 
There are two main concerns legal and privacy experts have expressed with Face ID. The first and foremost is exactly how much leeway law enforcement has in accessing the data on our phones. The second is whether Face ID could be a prelude to mass government surveillance.
In 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruled in Riley v. California that it was illegal for law enforcement to search a cell phone without a warrant. Our right to be safe from unlawful search and seizures is protected under the Fourth Amendment. However, a warrant was issued to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in October, 2014 which essentially allowed the LAPD to treat an arrested suspect’s biometric information as physical evidence and not testimonial evidence. 
Even though this distinction is seemingly insignificant, one important legal precedent is that physical evidence is not protected under the Fifth Amendment. One’s biometric information is under the same category as DNA, which one can be compelled to give. Worse still, arrested suspects are legally required to provide fingerprints and mug shots, the very biometrics used for Touch ID and Face ID. This dangerous precedent was further supported with an additional ruling by a Virginia circuit court judge in late 2014. Under the ruling, it was established that law enforcement cannot force anyone to give up their passcode as their passwords are protected under the Fifth Amendment; however, biometric info is not and suspects can be forced to provide their fingerprints for Touch ID. 
According to Orin Kerr, a research professor at George Washington University Law School and the Director of the Cybersecurity Law Initiative said, “From a legal perspective, I don't see any difference.” Since there isn’t a definitive landmark case precedent set by the SCOTUS in terms of biometric information protection under the Fifth Amendment yet, Apple’s new Face ID definitely seems like trading more utility in exchange for less overall benefit.
Face ID not only utilizes a two-dimensional scan to unlock the iPhone but also makes a mathematical model of one’s face by projecting over 30,000 points on their face and recording a three-dimensional (3D) model. Another caveat adopted by Apple has been to ensure that Face ID only works if our eyes are open so that one can’t unlock your phone if you’re sleeping merely by holding it up to your face.
Yet there isn’t a mechanism to detect micro-expressions in Face ID that is capable of detecting whether you’re under duress and someone is forcing you to unlock your phone. Therefore, law enforcement or anyone else can simply hold up the iPhone X to our faces to unlock them.
The one coup there is in terms of protecting oneself from unlawful search and seizure of one’s personal data is a nifty feature Apple has introduced in iOS 11. If you press the power button on your phone five times, that will disable Touch ID and Face ID, requiring your passcode to enable them again. Or, one can simply power off their phone, and on restarting, your passcode is required to re-enable Touch ID. 
Another concern industry experts have professed focuses on how secure Face ID is going to be. For instance, Samsung’s “extremely secure” widely touted facial recognition unlock system in the flagship Galaxy S8 was easily fooled by a mere picture. Even though this will not be the case with Face ID due to the 3D facial models iPhones will store, there are certainly other ways Face ID could be spoofed. Apple has acknowledged that twins can unlock phones and that Face ID won’t work perfectly for children 13 or younger “because their distinct facial features may not have fully developed.”
This concern has spread to the financial market. After all, many banks and retailers were only convinced to accept Apple Pay after they saw how secure Touch ID was. Since we don’t yet know how secure Face ID is, Apple’s decision to move Apple Pay from Touch ID to Face ID will remain up for debate.
After Apple unveiled Face ID, U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Sub-Committee on Privacy, Technology and the Law sent a public letter to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, and outlined questions he had about Face ID technology and how Apple’s hopes to protect individual consumer data, specifically one’s “faceprint.” If someone’s password is compromised, they can simply change it. On the other hand, if someone’s faceprint is stolen, they can’t change their faces.
Another concern Franken had was about the database Face ID was developed with. Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice-President of Worldwide Marketing, claimed that Face ID had been fine-tuned using over a billion images of faces. Senator Franken is understandably curious how Apple was able to obtain access to or able to develop this database and whether the database had sufficient samples from a plethora of ethnicities, genders, and ages.
Franken has requested Apple to make their strategies for protecting their customer’s biometric data public and to make the process more transparent. In addition, he is curious as to how Apple will respond if asked to divulge biometric data when faced with a warrant, especially when Apple claims that this biometric data isn’t being stored in the cloud or on Apple servers.
Apple has attempted to stave off any claims of Face ID being utilized as a tool for mass surveillance or the claim that Apple is creating a massive database of facial scans which it can then sell to third parties or one the government can commandeer the use of by heavily promoting their secure enclave. Schiller assured the audience when introducing Face ID on the iPhone X, that unlike Samsung, all iPhones with Face ID will store all the secure data locally, in a secure enclave built into the phone itself, encrypted to such a degree that Apple itself does not possess the key to decrypt it. 
Let’s give Apple the benefit of the doubt and assume that their enclaves are indeed secure and hack-proof. That still doesn’t protect the average consumer from the biggest customer of their personal data — the government. Recently, Apple had a huge public disagreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over providing the law enforcement agency with blanket access to all Apple devices. Apple refused.
The only reason Apple prevailed over the FBI, however, is because they challenged the FBI in the courts and won. That will not always be the case. It is inevitable the government will at least attempt to gain access to the huge database of biometric data Apple has the potential to retrieve from their iPhones. Currently, Facebook is the world leader in facial recognition; however, Facebook only controls the software. Apple has unified both the hardware and software for facial recognition in the world’s most popular and ubiquitous tech.
Another concern is that certain applications will be granted access to one’s biometric information and many third-party applications already do so for Touch ID. Apple now has the additional responsibility of ensuring that even though the aforementioned third-party developers can access the biometric info stored in the secure enclave, they can’t store or further distribute it.
In fact, Edward Snowden tweeted that, while it’s good  Apple has a “panic disable,” Face ID normalizes facial scanning and makes it mainstream, which has an extremely high potential for abuse and misuse.
A database of biometric info storing even the most basic information has the potential for strangers and law enforcement to identify someone with a simple picture. In addition, facial recognition can be utilized to track someone in real time, a prelude to George Orwell’s "Big Brother."
As revealed by Snowden, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the therein established FISA courts, the government can issue as many secret warrants as it deems fit. This is especially worrisome as this tactic has already been tried with Yahoo to order them to make a program to scan all their emails for keywords specified by the government.
Even if Apple appeals any order by the government to create a database of their customer’s biometric data, there’s always the chance that SCOTUS or the FISA courts will simply side with the government in the interest of national security. Certainly, national security is an important concern for the government, however, that does not mean that that certain government agencies should have blanket access to all consumer data.
Big Brother is watching.
