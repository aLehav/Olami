The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team traveled to St. Louis this past Sunday to face University Athletic Association (UAA) rival Washington University. The Tartans went into the game on fire with an incredible nine-game winning streak and added a tenth game with a 2-0 win over the Bears. The Tartans had lost to the Bears last year at home, so the team was eager to take back a victory.
As they have typically done this year, the Carnegie Mellon men brought the pressure on their opponents early. In the third minute of the game, Carnegie Mellon received their first scoring opportunity off a corner kick but failed to capitalize. Shortly after, a second corner kick was given, and this time the Tartans made sure to get on the scoreboard first. Senior forward Ryan Heuler swung in a dangerous ball which met the head of fellow senior Jon Simon, whose shot was initially saved by Washington goalkeeper John Smelcer. However, senior forward Ricky Griffin was quick to react and scored off the rebound.
The Tartans kept the pressure on after their first goal, and immediately came looking for a second. Senior playmaker Keith Haselhoff came close twice, but unfortunately the Washington goalie was able to save both. The dangerous Carnegie Mellon attack was finally able to break through again when Griffin notched his 15th goal of the season off a lofted shot from the right side of the box. Griffin's two-goal performance was rewarded with his third straight UAA Athlete of the Week honor. Griffin now leads the UAA with 37 points and 15 goals, and is tied for first with fellow senior Tartan Ryan Browne with seven assists.
Carnegie Mellon is now ranked ninth in the NSCAA/Adidas Division III Rankings, which makes them very good contenders for a high seed in the NCAA tournament. However, the Tartans will first have to finish off strong in UAA conference play before they can assure themselves a postseason spot. The men will look to cap off their undefeated home record this weekend when they host Brandeis University (Friday at 5 p.m.) and New York University (Sunday at 11 a.m.) at Gesling Stadium.

Sophomore Jeremy King was the man of the hour for the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team, who last Sunday hosted national finalist Amherst University and defeated them 5–4. King won the deciding match against number 2 Amherst 5–7, 7–5, 6–3 while both teams anxiously looked on. The win will push the Tartans into the top ten in the NCAA rankings and brings their record to 3–1 for the season. 
The match started off with doubles play, where the Tartans soon found themselves overpowered. The first doubles duo and ITA champions, seniors James Muliawan and Niko Ljuboja, lost 8–6 after a tough battle. Second doubles, consisting of juniors Alex Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart, did not have as much luck either, and dropped their match 8–5. However, the third doubles team of King and first-year Duke Miller lifted the team's morale by easily topping their opponents 8–3. 
With the Tartans trailing 1–2 after doubles, they kicked their intensity up a notch to win four more points. Nemerov added one point at first singles, beating his opponent 6–3, 6–4. Miller and senior Jon Spero each overcame their opponents in close matches, with scores 6–7, 6–1, 6–2 and 7–6, 6–4, respectively. Muliawan and MacTaggart, despite their efforts, lost their matches to tie the score at 4–4. 
The lone Tartan still in a match was King. After dropping the first set 5–7 and rallying to win back the second 7–5, the fate of the match rested in the outcome of the last set. With assistant coach Mike Belmonte planted on King’s court and the rest of the Tartans loudly voicing their support, King was able to get an early three-game lead in the set and go up 4–1. After a two-game drop, narrowing the gap to 4–3, King regrouped and closed out the set 6–3 to win the match for the Tartans. 
This win is the most significant for the Tartans, and a positive indicator of outstanding results to come. 
“We definitely believed we could beat them right before the match, especially with our preparation,” King said. “We went out and played some tough [doubles] and we kind of just knew that we would pull through. It was probably the most exhilarating win in the men’s tennis history.”
Spero shared King’s excitement. “You have to fight hard to beat top teams, and we did that after being down 2–1 in doubles and losing four first sets,” he said. “I think we earned this one, and it feels good to know we’ll be moving into the top 10 in the country.”
After an exciting end of the fall season, the Tartans will resume play in the spring.

The past two weeks have been busy for the men’s tennis team, who competed at the ITA Southeast Regional Championships in Virginia, where seniors James Muliawan and Niko Ljuboja captured the doubles title. A week later, the men’s team fell to Division I Duquesne University 3–6 to bring their season record to 2–1.
In Virginia, the Tartans did not have as much luck with the singles tournament, with only two players — seventh-seeded junior Alex Nemerov and ninth-seeded first-year Duke Miller — surviving until the quarterfinals.
Doubles play saw better luck, with three Tartan teams making the second day of the tournament. Muliawan and Ljuboja got off to a rough start, barely scraping by in the first match 9–7 before rallying to win their second match 8–1 against a Washington and Lee team. Sophomore Jeremy King and Miller teamed up and upset the first-seeded Johns Hopkins team 8–4 and then crushed a W&L team 8–1. Nemerov and senior Ravi Raghavan were the third duo to make the quarterfinals, beating out teams from W&L and Hopkins 8–5 and 8–6, respectively.
During the second day of the tournament, Muliawan and Ljuboja defeated another Hopkins team 8–6 to make the semifinals. King and Miller had an easy victory 8–3 to advance to the semifinals as well, only to be defeated by their teammates 8–6. In the other half of the draw, Nemerov and Raghavan dropped an 8–1 decision to the second seed from Salisbury University.
In the finals of the doubles tournament, Muliawan and Ljuboja battled for their second ITA doubles title. The pair had teamed up during their first-year year to win the title. After starting slow, the two found themselves down a set 6–1. The duo fought back and took the second set 6–3. The resulting tiebreak was a nail-biter as the lead ping-ponged between Carnegie and Salisbury. Finally, Muliawan and Ljuboja were able to take a three-point lead before closing out the match, 10–8. The two will travel to Mobile, Ala. this week to participate in the ITA National Championships.
“It feels pretty good, and brings back lots of memories,” Muliawan said of his previous wins. “It’s really good playing with Niko, and it’s been a good partnership.” Muliawan also won the ITA singles tournament last year, making him a three-time champion.
After a quick recovery from the weekend, the Tartans teamed up to face local Duquesne University, hoping to repeat last year’s win. Muliawan and Ljuboja lost by just a few points, 9–8(8) at first doubles. The lone doubles point came from the team of Nemerov and junior Bobby MacTaggart, 8–3. The score stood at 1–2 after doubles play.
However, singles play did not yield the expected results for the Tartans, who needed to take five out of the six matches. The two remaining points would come from MacTaggart, who upset his opponent at first singles 4–6, 7–5, 10–6, and Nemerov, who overpowered his opponent 6–4, 6–4 at second singles.
Senior Jon Spero offered his insight on the loss. “We had the opportunity to win all three doubles but were unable to do so.... I also had a set point in the first set so it was really a few points that separated us from a win,” he noted. “This match was really meant to be a warmup for Amherst and I think it served its purpose. Everyone knows they need to pick their play up a notch and hopefully we can do that.”
The Tartans faced number two Amherst University at home on Sunday, Oct. 11. Check online Monday for scores and results.

The Tartans woman's tennis team had their first two dual matches of the season as they steamrolled their opponents on Saturday. They first shut out Case Western Reserve University, 9-0, before doing the same to Oberlin College. The victories kept their momentum going after a very successful ITA Regional tournament.
The Tartans' first blowout victory began at noon on Saturday against fellow University Athletic Association member Case Western. The ITA Regional champion doubles team of sophomore Laura Chen and junior Ashley Herrick opened up the competition with an easy 8-1 win over opponents Erika Lim and Emily Pham. Sophomores Courtney Chin and Cze-Ja Tam followed suit with their own victory, 8-4, before first-year Christina Brant and junior Kelly Hart shut out their opponents 8-0.
Singles play yielded equally favorable results for the Tartans against their in-conference opponents. Chen and Chin, who faced one another in the finals at the ITA tournament, kicked things off with victories at first and second singles respectively. First-year Alex Tapak battled to victory in her match up, 6-4, 7-5 and junior Jen Chui, Liebowitz, and Hart each won their singles matches as well, with Hart once again shutting out her opponent, 6-0, 6-0.
Senior Alisa Liebowitz shared her opinion of the sweep against Case Western. "Case's lineup was stronger this year, and it was a good test to see if we could step it up a level in our first dual match. One thing we need to work on however, is the mental aspect of our games. We tend to get a lead but a times let the opponent start to come back."  
Three hours later, the Tartans did away with Oberlin, once again with relative ease. Each doubles team — Chen/Herrick, Chui/Tapak, and Brant/Tam — won their respective matches by 8-3 scores. Playing at first singles this time, Chin outdid her opponent 6-4, 6-0 before Chen followed with two 6-1 set wins to take her second match of the day. Chui and Tam continued the success with wins and Hart ended her successful singles day with another dominating victory 6-2, 6-0. Liebowitz and Brant also won their matches to secure the shutout victory.
"I think these matches are a good indicator of favorable results to come," Hart said about the two 9–0 shutouts. "We've been working really hard during practice, and it's nice to see it pay off. I think we all played pretty decently today."
Chen also shared her teammate's excitement. "We have been focusing on working on little things during practice, such as short crosscourt angles and moving forward during doubles. I think this gives us an extra edge," she commented. "Hopefully we can keep up this success next semester when the spring season starts."
The woman's fall season will come to an end after Chen and Herrick travel to Alabama Oct. 15-18 for the ITA National Championships. The tennis team will resume competition in February.

On Saturday, the annual Carnegie Mellon Cross Country Invitational took place at Schenley Park. The invitational was a huge success, with 18 teams and over 300 athletes participating. Despite the fierce competition, Carnegie Mellon’s runners rose to the top. Both teams placed first overall, with the men scoring 29 points and the women scoring 54 points. The men competed in an 8K and the women raced a 5K.
The depth of talent present on the men’s team shined through at the Invitational as five of the Tartans finished in the top 10. Junior Dan Addis finished third overall with a time of 25:56.13, followed closely by junior J.P. Allera (26:02.99) and sophomore Matt Jacob (26:04.41), who placed fourth and fifth. Junior Nate Bussiere earned eighth place with a time of 26:30.39, pursued by senior Dario Donatelli, who finished ninth in 26:35.15.
Allera was pleased with the results for the men’s team. He said, “I feel like the team performed pretty well this week. We didn’t have a big gap between our runners. We don’t have [2009 graduate] Brian Harvey anymore, so we don’t have any guys really far up [in the rankings], but we all finished right around the same time, which was really nice; our spread was really low. I think this was a good race to get us in a postseason mood. We set the bar for the next few weeks.”
One thing that made the Carnegie Mellon Invitational especially fun for the men’s team was the opportunity to compete against the Carnegie Mellon alumni team. The alumni proved to still be a talented group, and the team placed second in the Invitational. There were several noteworthy results from the alumni team, including those of former Tartan standout Harvey, who took first place in the 8K with a time of 25:26.48. Alumnus Ryan Anderson also performed well, capturing sixth place and finishing in a respectable 26:12.17. On racing his former teammates, Allera had this to say: “It’s always nice to see them and see how in shape they are. After they graduate, some of them keep running — Brian is obviously still in great shape — but a lot of them really can’t run anymore, so it can be funny sometimes, too.” 
The women’s cross country team also reached new heights at the Invitational when they defeated two Division II teams to steal first place. In the 5K, five of the women were able to finish in the top 20. First-year Emily Wobb once again led the Tartans, attaining fourth place with a time of 19:02.79, followed by junior Courtney Baker, who finished in 19:28.68. Junior Danielle Morse (19:59.55), sophomore Cassie Wallace (20:10.31), and first-year Jackie Altshuler (20:34.29) rounded out the top five for the Tartans, earning 11th, 13th, and 20th place respectively.
The Tartans will compete in the Oberlin Invitational next Saturday in Oberlin, Ohio.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team carried over its momentum from previous matches to triumph over Mount Union College 4–1 last Wednesday, bringing their overall season record to 5–4–1.
The Tartans opened the game strong, setting the tone with a goal off a corner kick by junior Alice Mayfield just five minutes into the game. With the ball rolling in favor of the Tartans, sophomore Elsa Wu followed suit four minutes later and scored the second goal of the game with an assist by Mayfield to bring the score to 2–0. It was Wu’s team-leading fifth goal and 10th point on the season.
Halfway into the 13th minute, junior Emily Overstreet started play with a corner kick, and 15 seconds later, sophomore Nicole Bayley scored the team’s third goal. The Tartans kept their defense strong, with the first of three saves by Anya Rosen just a minute later.
Mount Union finally broke through the Tartans’ powerful defense with 15 minutes to go in the period with a goal by Raider Ashley Kuhn to bring the score to 3–1. This did not hinder the Tartans, however, who continued to push back against Mount Union to keep the score at 3–1 until the end of the first period, during which Rosen recorded two more saves.
The second quarter saw its fair share of action from the Tartans, with Wu kicking things off again with an attempted header. Mayfield garnered her second assist of the game, and first-year Lissie Arndt shot the ball past Mount Union’s goalie two minutes later to give the Tartans a three-goal lead, 4–1. The two teams continued back-and-forth play for the rest of the period, but neither team relinquished any further goals.
“I think we really came together and played as a team. Everyone contributed so we were not depending on just one person,” observed Bayley. “Our game has improved greatly, but we still need to work on putting a full 90 minutes together. We have the opportunity to beat [Washington University in St. Louis] and end up as one of the top teams in the UAAs.”
The Tartans also played Sunday against number 18 Washington University in St. Louis at 1:30 p.m. Check online Tuesday for results.

The Tartan football team played against the Allegheny Gators this past Saturday at Gesling Stadium. They battled for just under three hours and forced the Gators to play their best. Despite their diligent efforts, the Tartans fell just short of victory with a final score of 38–35. Their season record stands at 4–2.
After just about 10 minutes, Allegheny had already taken the lead with a 63-yard drive and a subsequent 32-yard field goal by the Gators’ kicker Ryan Zipf. But the Cardinal and Gray struck back immediately. Two senior Tartans, Phil Pantelone and Brendan Howe, came up clutch with an 81-yard drive and a 3-yard touchdown followed up by junior Elliot Carnevale’s extra point, making the score 7–3 just before the end of the first quarter. 
As the second quarter came to a close, the Tartans were able to hold on to the 14–10 lead over the Gators after a touchdown by first-year Jake Nardone and a rival touchdown by Allegheny quarterback T.J. Salopek.
The Tartans and Gators battled closely in the second half, struggling back and forth to keep the lead. The Gators came out of the gate ready to score after halftime. They capitalized on a Tartan fumble, making a 17-yard run to score another 6 points, followed by a successful field goal.
The Gators followed it up with some challenging defense shutting down the Tartans with a three-and-out. With the ball in the hands of the Gators again, the Tartans were unable to stop the 17-yard run by Brian Tambulin causing them to slide further from the lead at a score of 24–14.
But the diligent Tartans fought on, led by Howe, who caught a glimpse of sophomore running back Chris Garcia, and got the ball to him from 62 yards away. This narrowed the gap for the Cardinal and Gray to 24–21. This was not the end of the roll for the Tartans. After a tough defensive stop against the Gators, Pantelone found another sophomore for an 8-yard touchdown — this time in Zach Gallup — to take the lead back for the first time since the first quarter, at 28–24. But the Tartan lead didn’t last long, as the Gators scored another touchdown just five minutes later, making the score 31–28.
Again, the lead went further in the favor of the Gators due to a Tartan fumble, making the score of the game 38–28. The duo of Pantelone and Gallup connected again to keep the hope of the Tartans alive, making the score 38–35 with 3:35 to play. After a Tartan unsuccessful onside kick and a quick fumble recovered by the Tartan sophomore Ray Johnson, the Tartans were set for victory on the 27 yard line. However, the Gator defense was just too tough, sacking Pantelone twice and maintaining their lead to shut the Tartans down with a final score of 38–35.
The Tartans suffered a loss, but played a great game.
“It was pretty disappointing, and I thought we didn’t do a good job of controlling the ball. We could have pulled it out at the end, but we didn’t do a good job of protecting the quarterback,” junior wide receiver John Staso said. “We have a real tough game ahead of us against a good team, and we need to stay focused.”
In two weeks, the Tartans will travel to play Wittenburg in Springfield, Ohio.

Sports fans, we all have that friend, and you know who I’m talking about: he’s the “number one Steelers fan,” but doesn’t know anything about them other than the fact that the they just won the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh is just the ultimate sports town, he says, seeing as the Penguins just won the Stanley Cup too. But he’s the one who heckles you for staying true to the Pirates even though they haven’t had a winning season for 17 years because “his” Phillies won the World Series last year; it doesn’t matter that he’s never been to Philadelphia in his life. Oh, and no matter that Pittsburgh doesn’t have a basketball team — the Los Angeles Lakers just won the NBA championship!
We all know him — the fairweather fan, or bandwagon fan.
But as annoying as bandwagoners are, and as much as I dislike them, I admit that they add to team spirit.
Hailing from Los Angeles, I have been brought up a Lakers fan. However, as great a city as Los Angeles is, it doesn’t have a football team. But when I arrived at Carnegie Mellon last year, the Steelers just so happened to win the Super Bowl six months later. Without hesitation, I hopped on the Steelers bandwagon and (safely and not destructively) rioted in celebration.
As much as I hated the Lakers’ fairweather fans when I was back at home, I have a new perspective now that I am coming from the other side. After the Steelers won, they gave me a reason to watch professional football, as well as another reason to be proud of my adopted hometown. Rooting for the same team has allowed me to connect to other fans, be they hardcore third-generation Steelers fans or bandwagoners like myself.
So my suggestion to you, the Carnegie Mellon student population, is to jump on a bandwagon! And I have the perfect wagon for you to jump on: Tartan athletics.
Carnegie Mellon is known for its intense team spirit, if you count the computer science department as a team. Contrary to the overwhelming recognition academics receives, support at athletic events is lacking, even though we have all reasons to be loyal to our athletes.
Currently, our football, tennis, soccer, volleyball, and cross country teams are doing exceptionally well. We have even fostered several University Athletic Association players of the week. Despite our athletic teams’ accomplishments, event attendance is laughable. It seems like the only people in the stands are those who personally know or are related to an athlete.
The Student Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC) has taken note of this display of poor attendance and has instated the Tartan Rewards Program, which promotes event attendance through giveaways, prizes, raffles, and even a “SuperFan” banquet that will be held at the end of the year. Hopping on the Tartan athletics bandwagon doesn’t sound so bad now, does it?
Pittsburgh is the city of champions. Carnegie Mellon nurtures its students to become champions in their respective academic fields. Tartan athletics can combine the two to create a dynamite school spirit that will resonate throughout your college experience. Therefore, attendance at such events should be part of every Carnegie Mellon student’s life. Although Tartan athletics obviously cannot compare to the grandeur of Division I sports, going to games promotes school spirit and shows support for your classmates — not to mention getting you out of those windowless computer clusters.

As the Carnegie Mellon Tartans football team looks to maintain their longstanding streak of winning seasons, they are getting some profitable help from outside linebacker and punter Richard Pattison in securing their victories. Last season, Pattison was named to the University Athletic Association Special Teams First Team, as well as being selected as Academic All-District. Recently named the UAA’s Special Teams Athlete of the Week, Pattison consistently performs to get the Tartans in good position to end up on the left side of the final score.
A junior from Rocky River, Ohio, Pattison has been playing football since the fifth grade. Although he has played basketball his entire life and considered playing in college, Pattison took his inspiration from his favorite professional team, the Cleveland Browns, and joined the Carnegie Mellon squad. Pattison is able to perpetuate his first love of basketball by playing for his fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, in the intramural league and in pickup games during the football off-season. When he’s not studying, honing his football skills, or waiting for the chance for a comeback from the Beta LeBrons’ second place finish last year in intramurals, Pattison enjoys watching comedy movies with friends to laugh away some of the stress of a busy college schedule.
Pattison is also becoming a member of Tau Beta Pi, which is the national honors engineering fraternity. 
As a chemical engineering major, Pattison cites that being a Carnegie Mellon student athlete makes him wish there were more time in a day to balance academics and athletics. When all of his hard work pays off, Pattison notes that he would like to repay his parents for their continuous support even while he is currently away from home to attend school and focus on football. Until then, Pattison can take pride in his achievements on and off the football field and enjoy the friendships he values with his classmates, fraternity brothers, and teammates, while keeping the goal of another winning season for the Tartans in the forefront.

The Carnegie Mellon volleyball team got off to a rough start as they traveled to Rochester, N.Y. last weekend for the opening round robin of University Athletic Association play. The team played New York University on Saturday and third-ranked Emory University in their first match Sunday but fell 0–3 to both teams. 
Their luck improved later in the day against the University of Chicago, when they triumphed over the Maroons 3–2. The Tartans’ record for UAA play currently stands at 1–2.
The team was up against NYU to open up the first tournament of the UAA season. After the Tartans started off the first set up 7–3, the Violets rallied back, sending the Tartans to a 22–25 loss. Carnegie Mellon went on to drop the next two games 12–25, 16–25 to wrap up the match. Junior Caroline Size led the attack with a recorded seven kills while junior Cameron Griffin led the backline with 10 digs.
To start off Sunday, Carnegie Mellon dropped a harsh decision against Emory 0–3 with the scores of 23–25, 13–25, 14–25. Seniors Jess Brackin and Megan Killeen each recorded a total of seven kills in the game. Senior setter Sam Carter also finished the game with 29 assists and three digs. Junior Aislinn McCloskey also played well with seven kills.
In their second matchup on Sunday, Carnegie Mellon found their way to victory over the University of Chicago 3–2. After losing the first game 19–25, the Tartans brought it back by winning the next two games 25–18 and 25–22 to take a 2–1 lead. Chicago pushed back at the Tartans’ win in the fourth game 25–21, but the Tartans were able to pull it out in the end, finishing game five 15–9. McCloskey led the attack with 12 kills, followed by Carter with a total of 40 assists and 12 digs.
Griffin was optimistic about this past weekend despite injuring her elbow on the first day’s match. “I felt that my team really stepped up their play in order to help me out. We really came together on the second day of the tournament, and we played as a cohesive unit,” she observed.
Carter tried to bring up the team’s energy as she worked to “fire up the team by focusing on and calling out positive and crazy plays.” Carter also believed her team played well this weekend, saying, “We still passed — set and hit with a lot of success — but we need to focus on perfecting everything since our conference is full of teams that lead Division III volleyball.”
The Tartans hosted Thomas More College on Sunday Oct. 11 at 2:30 p.m. They will head to New York City for the second UAA round robin on Oct. 17–18.

There was a flurry of excitement last week as the 2009 Nobel Prizes were announced. The awards in the science categories were given to researchers who made profound contributions to research in their respective fields. Presented here are small glimpses into the discoveries made by each of these researchers.
The Nobel Prize in physics: Awarded to Charles K. Kao, Willard S. Boyle, and George E. Smith
The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to three researchers for two different contributions. According to the award statement, Charles K. Kao was awarded half the prize “for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication.” Kao provided the basis for making usable optical fibers. Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith share the other half “for the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit — the CCD.” This sensor is highly beneficial as it is present in most high quality cameras. 
These two contributions originate from vastly different approaches to the scientific process and shed light on the various ways in which science can leave its mark on society.
Kao’s contribution is one derived from years of meticulous work on an already well–established technology. Optical fibers had been around for decades when he made his breakthrough in the 1960s. Indeed, there was already a large market for them in various short range applications. According to Carnegie Mellon physics professor Randall Feenstra, “the fibers available had too many impurities and so the light would be attenuated (lose much of its energy).” Kao determined after extensive research that this was due to the fact that the glass was not pure enough. This was the push that got the snowball of innovation rolling. After this, the obstacles in the way of useful optical cables fell steadily. These days, most of the information on earth travels by similar cables. The Nobel committee showed real insight in choosing Kao for this prestigious award.
In contrast with Kao’s steady progress, the CCD — or charged-coupled device — was invented in an hour-long brainstorming session at Bell Labs. Boyle and Smith wanted to come up with a better form of computer memory so that the funding to their department would not be cut, but they were sidetracked by this idea. 
According to Feenstra, a CCD is “a silicon device that is light sensitive and records charge.” All high quality professional cameras use CCDs to capture images because they have extremely high resolution (they can pick out fine details) and provide very accurate images. Indeed, they are responsible for the incredible pictures coming from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
Another interesting fact is that the Nobel Prize oscillated between highly theoretical and practical results. Last year, it was awarded for a highly theoretical (and extremely important) discovery about the universe. This year is the other end of that oscillation, given to three men who changed the way light impacts our lives.
The Nobel Prize in medicine: Awarded to Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider, and Jack W. Szostak
The 100th physiology or medicine Nobel Prize was awarded “for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.” This is also the first time in history that more than one woman has claimed a Nobel Prize in the sciences. Although many researchers had observed that the ends of chromosomes — telomeres — served as a protection of sorts, no one was quite sure what exactly these telomeres were. All they knew was that they basically acted like caps at the end of the genetic data. Using DNA-sequencing methods, Blackburn showed that telomeres were simply a collection of repeated DNA sequences.
She and Szostak then took an organism that lives in a pond, a tetrahymena, and discovered that the organism’s telomeres protected it from yeast. Because yeast is evolutionarily very different from the pond-dwelling organism, the two researchers concluded that the telomeres’ defensive behavior expands beyond that of just the tetrahymena, and is a biological feature of most other organisms as well.
Blackburn, along with Carol Greider, continued to do research and experiments that tried to understand exactly how telomeres were made from one DNA replication to the next. As stated in an article in USA Today, in 1984, on Christmas Day, the two women found evidence to show that an enzyme named telomerase is what adds the telomeres to the end of chromosomes.
This discovery served as a possible solution to how extra DNA could have been added to the end of chromosomes during DNA replication. This telomorase enzyme is now known to provide a template with which DNA synthesis at the ends of chromosomes can take place. Because of this discovery, it is now understood that telomerase can delay the aging of cells and that if the ends of chromosomes become shorter, the cell is getting older. This gives insight into dangerous cells, such as cancer cells, which have telomeres that do not seem to shorten.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry: Awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz, and Ada E. Yonath
The Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz, and Ada E. Yonath “for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome.” 
The three were each independently responsible for decoding the innermost workings of the ribosome, which is an integral part of the cells that make up our bodies. These ribosomes create the proteins that form the basis of the building blocks of life, DNA and RNA.
Using a method called X-ray crystallography that uses X-rays to analyze the atomic structure of entities, the three laureates independently constructed precise 3-D models of the ribosomes. This allowed other researchers to study them in much greater detail, opening up many new opportunities. One area affected greatly was that of antibiotics. Indeed more than half of all antibiotics target the ribosome of bacteria. Greater knowledge of ribosomes enables antibiotics to be significantly more effective.

Regenerative medicine is an innovative and promising method for disease treatment that combines many different fields of study to facilitate our body’s natural ability to heal. The importance of regenerative medicine has prompted many institutions to give grants to scientists and researchers to further the knowledge and applications of this breakthrough treatment. One such organization is the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have received monetary awards to continue their work on regenerative medicine. The NIH chooses its recipients based on research that will explore potentially groundbreaking and innovative advances for medicine.
Surgeries today are beset by tissue rejection, infection, and other complications. With regenerative medicine, the cells of an individual can be used as a means of treatment, effectively eliminating rejection; some researchers even foresee tissue and organ growth without having to perform surgery.
Already, there are major fields of research within the study of regenerative medicine. It could help a person born with a disease that prevents the proper functioning of a major organ by growing organs in a laboratory from the cells of the afflicted patient. Tissues, such as those found in heart valves, can also be engineered in hopes of repairing and maintaining tissue function with minimal surgery. Regenerative medicine works on a cellular level to replace cells lost from accidents and other diseases and afflictions. 
Ipsita Banerjee, professor of chemical and petroleum engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, received the $2.2 million New Innovator Award for her work in the growth and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. One objective of her research is to come up with a treatment for diabetes through the study of pancreatic islet cells, which have an active role in the regulation of insulin. As regenerative medicine encompasses many fields of science, Banerjee is taking a mathematical approach in studying the differentiation of these cells and the genes involved in regulating differentiation. She said, “The lab experiments will provide the dynamic trend on the process of differentiation, which will be used by the mathematical models to capture and predict the regulatory mechanisms controlling the process.” 
Banerjee hopes that her research will be applicable to the differentiation of other cells. “The end product of my research will be a rigorous mechanistic understanding of the process of differentiation ... but the developed methodology will be general enough to be applicable to any other lineage-specific differentiation,” she said. Currently, researchers use their knowledge of organ development to recreate differentiation of stem cells in vitro, or in a laboratory, and this method is largely trial and error. Banerjee’s work will help researchers understand how pancreatic islet cells are derived from embryonic stem cells. “Our integrated approach will provide mechanistic details of the functioning of embryonic stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cells, and the predictive model will lay the foundation towards an informed decision-making in generating pancreatic islet cells of improved functionality.” Keeping the main focus of her research in mind, Banerjee said, “In summary, the impact will be in generating fully functional pancreatic islet cells which can be transplanted for treatment of diabetes.” Another researcher at the University of Pittsburgh is Eric Lagasse, whose work involves lymph nodes. 
According to a press release from the University of Pittsburgh, he received a $2.9 million Transformative R01 grant for his research.
Lymph nodes are important in the trapping of foreign particles in the body. Lagasse’s research will be important in fighting diseases that impair the immune system, such as AIDS.
There is no shortage of research in regenerative medicine, and many researchers are working to discover innovative ideas that will accelerate our knowledge in the medical field. In the next five years, NIH is hoping to put together a total of $348 million in awards to researchers, although the cost of all the research will definitely be greater due to the large number of researchers working in the field of medical science. 
With so many people working in this field, it is apparent that regenerative medicine is truly the next revolutionary step in health care.

It is hard to argue that flying home for mid-semester break has gotten easier since Sept. 11. Security is tighter, lines are longer, and anybody with a standard tube of toothpaste could be a potential terrorist. In a few more years, however, these inconveniences may be only bad memories, thanks to a project under development at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This project, known as the Future Attribute Screening Technology, aims to revolutionize security screening in airports, stadiums, and other potential terrorist targets.
The Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST), formerly known as Project Hostile Intent, aims to detect potential security threats based on behavioral factors. Instead of trying to find bomb components in a suitcase, future security screeners will be able to identify telltale signs of deception, including subtle reactions to nervousness and aggression. FAST consists of an array of sensors that work together to detect possible signs of hostile intent. Almost all of these sensors are commercially available, but the complete array and the software that makes it all work, are being developed by the Human Factors Division of the DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate. Work on the system began in 2007, and tests have been conducted throughout the past two years. 
More realistic tests with a more compact array and random subjects have recently been conducted, and researcher Daniel Martin claims that results have turned out “significantly better than chance,” according to an article published Oct. 6 on CNN.com. The FAST system is in many ways the technological successor to the polygraph. Both are based on the premise that physiological reactions are indicative of psychological attitudes. By combining data from all the available sensors, analysts — be they human or software — should be able to identify individuals who match certain suspicious profiles. According to a May 2007 Department of Homeland Security newsletter, FAST involves two main processes: developing models that match physiological cues to threat level, and the actual creation of the hardware suite to detect these cues. 
The combined system would be able to identify threats without a human screener, thereby eliminating both time and subjective bias from the screening process. One of the stated goals of the project is to perform this task “without ever impeding the flow of travelers.” While both of these tasks are on the cutting edge of science, DHS researchers have made significant progress. Model matching algorithms, particularly those dealing with human physical responses, have been at the forefront of machine learning research for several years, with many advances happening here at Carnegie Mellon. The individual components of the FAST system, while available by themselves, have not previously been used in such a complex environment, and researchers also had to combine the data from these sensors into a meaningful result.
Proponents of FAST and similar technologies believe that the future of security screening lies in being able to screen people, not their belongings. Their goal is to make screening more accurate and more rapid while reducing the controlled chaos that is an airport security line. These supporters hold that the variety of data sources will eliminate most false positives. As with any new technology, particularly new security Technologies, FAST has no shortage of critics. Any system that collects the amount of data FAST does has significant privacy implications. While members of the project maintain that no data will be saved about an individual after screening, this does not satisfy skeptics who worry that what equates to a detailed medical examination is being conducted without the necessary safeguards. 
Furthermore, some experts believe that the premise of physiological detection is invalid. In an interview for the same CNN.com story, Carnegie Mellon’s Stephen Fienberg, a university professor in the statistics and machine learning departments, said, “I haven’t seen any research that shows that those measures from the autonomic nervous system ... measuring blood pressure, measuring breathing, measuring heat on the face, are at all related to intent.” Researchers aim to begin field testing in 2011 and hope to start implementing the system within five years.

In hemispatial neglect syndrome, according to Husain et al.’s definition in the journal article Hemispatial Neglect, patients are less aware of the stimuli on one side of their body, but may not necessarily experience any sensory loss. This common but difficult-to-treat illness has forced doctors to gain more insight into the behavior and anatomy of their patients.
The most common type of neglect is that of the left visual field and occurs after damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. Neglect of the left side is more common because there is redundant processing of the right visual space by both right and left hemispheres of the brain, whereas most of the left space is predominantly only processed by the right cerebral hemisphere. Thus, if the left hemisphere is damaged, the right hemisphere can take control of the right visual space, but if the right hemisphere is damaged, there is no way for the brain to process stimuli in the left visual space.
Hemispatial neglect usually occurs after brain injury, and the patient goes through a variety of debilitating behaviors. These behaviors include the person’s inability to orient or respond to stimuli in the visual field opposite to the side of brain damage or lesion. Soon after a right-sided parietal lesion, the patient may not respond to the entire left side of their world. This causes the person to completely ignore the left side of their world as though it did not exist. The person will engage in behaviors such as only brushing the right set of their teeth, only combing the right side of their hair, or only dressing the right side of their bodies. They will not eat food that is on the left side of their plates and will only read half of a compound word (such as reading “cream” when they see “ice cream” or “ball” when they see “football”).
Neglect can be easily tested using simple bedside tasks. For example, from cases reported in Halligan and Robertson’s Spatial Neglect: A Clinical Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment, simple tests like asking a patient to draw, copy, read, divide a line in half (line bisection), or cross out specific targets on a page (cancellation), will let the doctor know whether the person has neglect. 
If a patient is asked to draw a clock, the patient will draw all six numbers of the right face of the clock. They will only copy half of a flower when given a picture of a whole flower. Also, if given a full page of horizontal lines and asked to cross vertically through all those lines, they will only cross through the lines on the right side of the page.
According to Freksa, Stiehl, and Zangemeister in their book Visual Attention and Cognition, currently there are three main hypotheses trying to explain neglect. 
The first hypothesis is that neglect arises because central mechanisms in the brain fail to construct an internal representation of one side of space. The second hypothesis suggests that neglect occurs after a failure to attend to stimuli in the region of space opposite to the hemisphere of damage because the person has difficulty disengaging attention to targets on the same side as the damage. The last hypothesis is that hemispatial neglect can happen due to the person’s inability to sustain movement toward or in the impaired visual field.
From previous studies, vestibular (the region of the inner ear that helps with balance) and optokinetic (movements of the eyes) stimulation may temporarily reduce the amount or severity of visual neglect. However, these treatments are not applicable for long-term relief. 
Recently, Vallar et al. displayed that transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) can be used to improve hemispatial neglect. TENS stimulation affects the nerve fibers that go to the brain, thus giving rise to more sensory input that goes to the brain. 
Therefore multiple modalities (vestibular, optokinetic, and somatosensory) are potentially capable of helping to treat neglect syndrome, although much more work needs to be done to find a definite treatment.

Skin cancer could be hereditary
A study conducted by scientists at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia shows that skin cancer could be hereditary. Previously it was known that patients who had family members with skin cancer were more likely to develop skin cancer themselves. However, researchers were unsure of whether living in similar environmental conditions caused skin cancer or whether it had a genetic link.
The recent study tested the presence of skin cancer in identical twins and in fraternal twins. The results showed that in four out of the 27 tested pairs of identical twins, both the twins developed skin cancer. On the other hand, only in three pairs out of 98 tested pairs of fraternal twins did both develop skin cancer. These results showed that skin cancer has a genetic link.

Researchers develop  cocaine vaccine
Scientists at the Yale School of Medicine have created a vaccine that could potentially help cocaine addicts. The vaccine causes the body to produce antibodies against cocaine. 
Thus, when cocaine is ingested by the addicts, the antibodies could destroy the cocaine and prevent it from ever reaching the brain. Thus cocaine consumption will not cause the addicts to become high. The researchers hope that if the users do not get high with cocaine, they will eventually stop taking it.
The researchers later conducted a study with the vaccine and found that 53 percent of the users who had achieved the desired antibody levels reduced their cocaine consumption by half.

Modified stem cells grow blood vessels
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have added some extra genes to stem cells to enhance their ability to produce vascular tissue. 
The stem cells were removed from the bone marrow of mice, and, using specially developed nanoparticles, the gene for the vascular endothelial growth factor was inserted into the cells.
In mice, these cells allowed the development of new blood vessels near the site of an injury. The scientists believe that more work needs to be done in this area before human trials can be conducted.

H1N1 harms more than seasonal flu
According to a recent study conducted on swine flu, one-fourth of the hospitalized swine flu patients needed intensive care and 7 percent of the hospitalized patients died. These numbers are slightly higher than those of patients with just seasonal flu.
Another fact that makes swine flu different from seasonal flu is that nearly half of the hospitalized patients are children and teenagers. The elderly are not as vulnerable to swine flu as they are to the seasonal flu. Only five percent of the patients admitted in hospitals because of swine flu were above the age of 65. This is very different from ordinary seasonal flu in which the elderly are the worst affected.

Dinosaur prints found in France
Footprints belonging to the sauropod dinosaur were discovered near Lyon in France. These are the largest dinosaur prints to be found to date. 
The tracks spread over hundreds of meters and researchers plan to carry out more investigation in the nearby area to find out whether it could be the largest space inhabited by dinosaurs.
The footprints are circular depressions surrounded by a layer of limestone and are around 1.5 meters in diameter. This suggests that the dinosaurs were probably 25 meters in length and may have weighed more than 40 tons.

NASA carries out moon crash 
NASA’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission, was carried out successfully on Friday and generated a good amount of data for NASA to analyze. The main objective of this mission was to check whether there is any water on the moon.
NASA spent nearly $79 million on the mission. Two spacecraft were sent down into a crater on the moon, and the scientists wanted to test whether the impact with the inside of the crater would expel any water. Scientists said that after Friday, all of LCROSS’s controls were working fine. 
The spacecraft also hit a shadowed area in the crater like the researchers had expected.

Scientists find clue to ear evolution 
Paleontologists believe that studying the fossil of an ancient mammal, Maotherium asiaticus, may help us understand how the middle ear in humans and other mammals evolved. 
An article on this subject was published in the journal Science.
In reptiles, a piece of cartilage called Meckel’s cartilage hardens after birth and connects the jaw and ear. In mammals, this structure is present in fetuses, but disappears later in life. 
Maotherium shows the presence of this structure, indicating that it lies in the middle stage of development between reptiles and mammals. 
Other characteristics of Maotherium, however, indicate that it is a mammal and shows features distinct to mammals.

Scientists see new ring around Saturn
Scientists from the University of Virginia have discovered a huge new ring around Saturn. The results, published in the journal Nature, indicate that this ring is the largest to be seen in the solar system.
The ring marks out the orbit of one of Saturn’s moons, Phoebe. Phoebe has an orbit with a radius of around 8 million miles. Scientists believe that objects colliding with Phoebe caused the formation of a large amount of dust. This dust could have caused the formation of this ring. 
The scientists believe that this ring is most similar to Jupiter’s rings, found in the orbits of two of Jupiter’s moons: Thebe and Amalthea. 
The team used NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope to see the ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the plane of the other rings of Saturn.

With the recent amount of unending media attention and popularity being thrown at Pittsburgh, Hollywood executives are finally discovering everything that this city has to offer.
Pittsburgh has it all: a thriving arts scene, triumphant sports teams, family-friendly neighborhoods, buzzing urban centers, and a rich history. Point blank, as far as cities go, Pittsburgh is pretty charming. However, while all of the amazing qualities of Pittsburgh have always been evident to the locals who have had the privilege of living here, it seems as if others around the world are only just starting to catch on.
Recently, Pittsburgh has been getting a lot of attention. Through constant coverage of the G20 Summit, people have unintentionally rediscovered the city. CNN reporter Jordan Valinsky phrases it well. “Ten years ago, you couldn’t mention the words ‘posh’ and ‘Pittsburgh’ in the same sentence without a collective laugh. Not anymore,” he said. Activity within the Pittsburgh art scene has been extremely conspicuous. Outside of the usual symphonies, cabarets, and musicals that have become token attractions of this city, there has also been a recent flood of “foreign” artistic activity: Hollywood has discovered the ’Burgh.
This newfound media attention is spreading like the swine flu during first-year orientation week. It has extended within all artistic genres: music, film, performance, and even visual art. It seems as if a variety of intrigued artists want to see just what Pittsburgh has to offer them.
Pittsburgh has always boasted a pretty impressive visual arts scene. From world-renowned displays like those at The Andy Warhol Museum to one-of-a-kind contemporary exhibits like those of the Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh has always been a notable hub for the visual arts. But, according to the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, the “call for artists” has never been as well-received as it is now.
In the music scene, more artists seem to be making Pittsburgh a usual stop on their various national tours. Popular mainstream artists like Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, and Daughtry have all made Pittsburgh a destination for their 2009 fall tours. And while more unknown underground artists will always find a home here in the ’Burgh, this recent musical magnetism has only added to the torrent of attention that has been directed toward Pittsburgh.
Popular unconventional talents are also bringing their acts to Pittsburgh stages. Magic shows by David Copperfield, international orchestras, and blue-collar comedy acts have all found a home here in Pittsburgh. With over 30 active venues and theaters in the city alone, there is always some form of art to see or partake in.
“In the Pittsburgh art scene,” said Alina Narvaez, a first-year in the BHA program, “there is always something to do, even outside of the Carnegie Mellon bubble. Whether it’s a new exhibit at the Mattress Factory, a concert downtown, or a new installation at The Andy Warhol Museum, something is always happening.”
The film industry has also found refuge in Pittsburgh. Just recently, Academy Award-winning actor Russell Crowe visited Pittsburgh to film scenes for his latest project, The Next Three Days, at the Allegheny County Jail. In a screenplay written by Paul Haggis, Crowe plays a man whose life is turned upside down when his wife is accused of murder. So far, directors have named Pittsburgh the project’s sole filming location. But this is not an acting debut for the city. Apart from being a popular film setting itself, many of the films which ostensibly take place in Washington, D.C., Memphis, Tenn., or New York City were actually filmed right here in Pittsburgh.
With its quaint suburbs and towering urban features, Pittsburgh truly is a director’s dream. Pittsburgh has been featured in blockbuster films like Flashdance and Dawn of the Dead, along with more recent releases like Silence of the Lambs and Robert Downey Jr.’s film Wonder Boys. As it goes, Pittsburgh has a rich cinematic history and has been a staple location in over 60 smash hits released in the past two decades.
Just recently, the Internet was abuzz when Pittsburghers discovered the recent arrival of actor Jake Gyllenhaal and actress Anne Hathway to the city. Pittsburgh has been named the shooting site of their newest project, Love and Other Drugs, a film about a young salesman trying to survive in the cutthroat business of pharmaceuticals. Based on Jamie Reidy’s memoir Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman, the salesman, played by Gyllenhaal, struggles to hawk a male performance enhancement drug. The movie production is centered in Squirrel Hill.
Similarly, actor Denzel Washington and actress Rosario Dawson will also be visiting Pittsburgh to film for their newest project, Unstoppable. The film is about a railroad company that frantically attempts to stop an unrestrained freight train full of combustible liquids and poisonous gases from destroying an entire city. It is rumored that producers have already begun shooting scenes in the Strip District.
Pittsburgh has also made its mark in the world of broadcast television. The CBS show Three Rivers is a medical drama that takes place right here in Pittsburgh. The show is about the complex world of medical transplants, and the world’s most established fictional transplant hospital just happens to be set right here in Pittsburgh.
All of this publicity has inspired some positive advances in the city’s dedication and attention to the arts. New theaters have been opening up, arts-based program expenses have been increased, and museums have been experiencing a constant influx of new exhibits from various artists wishing to display their work. If anything, it is truly the people of Pittsburgh who have recognized the benefits reaped from having Hollywood in the ’Burgh.
In an attempt to encourage these positive advances, groups like the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council have made it their goal to encourage artistic development in the city, and they aim to achieve this through a series of loan programs distributed to those businesses and corporations involved in the education and development of the professional arts.
While the rest of the nation, in light of the recent economy, has been forced to make sacrifices and cutbacks to their arts programs, Pittsburgh has been fortunate enough to be able to do the opposite. This is a city that has truly embraced the arts scene as one of its most beneficiary attractions. With all eyes on Pittsburgh, standing center stage, the city has only one thing to say: Hollywood, here we come!

Last Wednesday, a group of people gathered in the front of Margaret’s Fine Imports in Squirrel Hill — young and old, male and female, tea connoisseurs, and newcomers to the art of brewing the world’s second-most consumed beverage — to learn about tea from a master. At 7 p.m., Margaret Harris, the owner of the shop, stood behind the register, which served as a teacher’s desk, in an apron bearing the phrase: “Many have eaten here; few have died,” and began class.
Harris’ own story is as unique and vivid as the tea that she sells. Harris left her homeland, Poland, in 1985, while it was still under Communist rule. In Poland, Harris had a medical degree and was a registered nurse, but since her arrival in North America, she has opened a number of craft, candle, and — most recently — tea stores. Harris has been in the tea business for seven years and has taught others about tea for three years. By the end of October, she plans to offer gourmet deli meats and cheeses in her store as well, with some products coming all the way from Hungary and Poland. Because of her history in medicine, Harris has an extensive knowledge about the health benefits of each tea, which she includes in her classes.
Types of tea
The lecture began with introductions, and everyone voiced their favorite type of tea. Preferences ranged from Earl Grey — Harris’ favorite — to chai, and Harris’ informational lecture mentioned them all.
There are four types of tea: white, green, oolong, and black. Green tea is made solely of tea leaves, and since tea has eight to 10 times more antioxidants than any other plant, green tea is extremely good for one’s health. Green tea leaves undergo very little oxidation — the process that causes autumn leaves to turn dry and brittle after they have fallen. White tea is a form of green tea, but it is made up of only the buds and first leaves of the plant. Oolong is a traditionally Chinese or Taiwanese tea, and there are many kinds of it with various levels of oxidation. Black tea is a common Western tea that undergoes the most oxidation among the types of tea.
A type of tea that doesn’t contain parts of the tea plant is a tisane. Tisane is an herbal tea that originates from both China and the Middle East. It can be made from dried flowers, like chamomile, or seeds and roots. Another type of herbal tea is rooibos tea, which is made from a red tea bush in Africa.
Making the perfect cup of tea
During class, Harris also outlined the steps in making a good cup of tea:
Step one involves choosing a tea leaf. Leaves are always better and more natural than the ground up contents of tea bags.
Step two concerns the tea water. Tap water or filtered water is fine for tea brewing, but distilled water is definitely not. Using distilled water will cause tea to taste flat.
Step three is about temperature. For regular tea, steep at 210°C, and for green tea, at 180–185°C. All tisanes should be steeped in boiling water.
Step four is all about the timing. Black tea should be steeped for three to four minutes, while green tea should be steeped for only two.
Tracing the roots of tea
Harris also briefly described the history of tea. Most tea comes from the tea bush plant, or Camellia sinesis. One legend says that Emperor Shen Nung of China was resting in his garden one afternoon when a sudden gust of wind blew several leaves from a tree into a pot of hot water nearby. When the emperor drank the resulting mixture out of curiosity, he found that he enjoyed the drink.
Tea was first brought to England by the Portuguese, although the Dutch were also major distributors. Contrary to popular belief, tea did not become popular in England until the 18th century, when Queen Anne chose tea over beer for her breakfast — yes, downing a beer for breakfast was actually common back then. Another common misconception is that “high tea” refers to the famous British tea served in the afternoon with delicious cakes and sweets. Actually, the correct name for this famous tea, understandably enough, is “afternoon tea,” and it was invented by the Duchess of Bedford, who thought that the gap between lunch and dinner was unbearably long. High tea refers to the tea that workers would take with their dinner at the end of the day, at their “high” dinner table — as opposed to the low tea tables of that time.
A cup a day keeps the doctor away
Tea has a special importance in Harris’ life. “I think I had my first cup of tea when I was one day old. It was probably fennel tea, which they give to babies to relieve colic,” she revealed to her audience at the beginning of class. Tea has been scientifically proven to be an anti-bacterial substance and contains fluoride, so it is actually good for your teeth. Women who drink tea often have a higher bone density, and tea also speeds up the metabolic process: Oolong tea increases the speed of metabolism by 10 percent, so it actually helps people lose weight. 
But aside from health benefits, Harris sees tea as a way of creating friendships and understanding other cultures. “Knowing tea helps you to know people,” she told her class as she poured out samples at the end of class, including oolong and red tea brewed to perfection.
Through her class, Harris explained how tea influences many fields: geography, history, politics, medicine, and especially friendship. Her store, as well as her life, are testaments to this statement.

Tina Fabrique brought down the house as the title character in Ella: The Musical!, the show currently playing at the Pittsburgh Public Theater. Fabrique’s soaring vocal range and exquisite rendering of jazz songs — made standards by the late Ella Fitzgerald — left one wondering why the show wasn’t titled Tina: The Musical!.
A production created by a native Pittsburgh Public Theater director, Rob Ruggiero, and Dyke Garrison, Ella is essentially a one-woman show, taking place during the rehearsal of a concert on the French Riviera late in the singer’s career. On a stage empty save for a standing microphone, Fabrique spoke to the audience like they were all old friends, letting them in on the memories and emotions of the modest singer. Known as the “good girl” in the music business, the darker notes of Fitzgerald’s life are highlighted in this production, which weaves the singer’s broken relationship with her son and rocky marriage with a fellow musician into the silky smooth renditions of songs like “The Man I Love,” “Night and Day,” and “Blue Skies.”
“Blue Skies” is reprised on several occasions in the musical, and as the context evolves, Fabrique transforms the lyrics into a bluesy lullaby, and then a joyful ditty with a vibrant scat. Fabrique carried the two-hour production effortlessly. It was only when she discreetly turned her back to the audience to gulp down water during instrumental breaks that the audience could realize that, in actuality, this was hard work. A Broadway veteran, Fabrique joins the cast of Ella after performing in Ragtime, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and Harlem Song, among others. George Caldwell, another Broadway veteran (The Full Monty) is both musical director and onstage pianist and conductor.
The ensemble also includes Rodney Harper on drums, Ron Haynes on trumpet, and Harold Dixon, who plays Ella’s manager Norman Granz. Each musician doubles as a man in Ella’s life — bathed in the spotlight, he leans into his microphone and delivers a line to melt or break Ella’s heart — before returning to his instrument. This playful dynamic between song and story keeps the plot alive, even when Ella’s life takes a turn for the worse and the audience is left wondering if she will be able to pick herself up and keep going. When she collapses on stage during her concert performance in France, weeping while her elegant sequined dress sparkles in the stage light, it is hard to untangle her personal sadness from her role as a stage performer, the very problem with which Fitzgerald struggled her entire career: where her music stops and her life begins. She is never able to completely love anything more than her career.
It is this ambition and drive coupled with loneliness and heartache that make Ella a sympathetic character, but an exasperating one at that. When she leaves her son at home with a nanny while she and her husband leave to pursue their independent musical projects, the audience is torn between wanting Ella’s career to flourish and for her son to be well-cared for. Viewers would want to like the singer as much as they like her voice, but the production’s revelation of Ella’s true colors leaves her polished legacy a bit tarnished.
Ella: The Musical! will be playing at the Pittsburgh Public Theater through Nov. 1. Tickets can be purchased at the box office or by calling 412.316.1600. Upcoming plays include Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes and Arthur Miller’s The Prince.

Autumn is finally here: The leaves are slowly turning red, and you can feel a crisp wind when you step outside. Pittsburgh has a lot of rainy days, but this new, cool weather is a nice break from the city’s hot and humid summers, and as the temperature drops, people are beginning to bring their sweaters and coats out of their closets, and everyone can’t help but wonder about this fall’s fashion trends. The economic recession has affected the fashion industry greatly, but many designers are trying to work with this downturn, and from this arises the more tamed fashion trend of this fall — simplicity is the way to go.
Neon colors
According to Elle magazine, the New York fashion week for fall/winter 2009–2010 featured plenty of neon colors, and it was a similar case in the Milan and Paris fashion weeks as well. With plenty of colorful options for this fall — ranging from reds, oranges, and violets, to indigo blues — there is a color for everyone. To really give an accent to your wardrobe, you can get a vibrantly colored coat in indigo blue or violet; or if you are feeling a little less daring, you can spice up your outfit with a pair of neon-colored shoes or a bright bag. 
Chunky sweaters
While this fall’s hot color seems to be vibrant neon, what about texture? Texture is often missing from the palette of fashion trends in the colder months, but this year is different: Texture, in the form of chunky knits, is a prevalent feature this fall. You can try to wear a chunky knit scarf or hat, or you can explore more with a knitted sweater or even a coat. Chunky sweaters are good investments because they can be a great fashion statement and keep you warm at the same time, especially during Pittsburgh’s snowy winter.
White shirts
With the recession, there is an increased emphasis on the basics of fashion. Vogue stylist Stephanie LaCava chooses white shirts as one of the fall wardrobe’s staples in Vogue’s October issue. While white shirts sound trivial, the varieties are endless: cotton with stretch, fitted silhouettes, cuff to sleeve details, collar variations; but they work with every outfit, from under cardigans and jackets to over wide leg trousers or skinny jeans. LaCava picks Thomas Pink’s Rose-Marie shirt priced at $150 and available online at Thomaspink.com. If you want a more affordable variety of white shirts, try American Apparel — their oxford long-sleeved button-up shirts are $54.
Leather
It’s no great secret that a simple leather jacket has become a widespread wardrobe staple over the last few winters, and this year is no exception. In fact, leather has been taken to a new level this year, and the New York, Milan, and Paris fashion weeks featured everything in leather: pants, skirts, shorts, coats, capes, vests, and even leggings. If you are brave enough to try the leather leggings, wear them under a large sweater with some suede booties. Biker leather jackets are also in this fall. If the biker jacket is too plain, try wearing a shorter, bolero-style leather jacket instead. According to Style.com, wearing a simple outfit with an emphasis on the bolero jacket works well for this season. If you want some edgy and trendy jackets, check out www.topshop.com, where famous British model Kate Moss has her line on sale.
Camel coats
If you are planning on buying a winter coat this year, get a camel or neutral-colored coat. These coats are timeless fashion pieces and they go with almost everything in your wardrobe. The neutral coat, especially in a camel color, is a lasting fall classic because it has so many possibilities. It looks good with any bottoms, from your everyday jeans to fancy skirts. You can also accentuate your coat with vibrant scarves and neon accessories.

On Oct. 5, Conde Nast, publisher of famous magazines like Vogue and The New Yorker, announced in its memo that the November 2009 issue of Gourmet will be the last for this 70-year-old magazine. Gourmet is a magazine about food; about how food centers our lives; how just like culture, people, and thought are the backdrop of society, they are the plate for food. This announcement will have many repercussions, mainly in the landscape of food journalism and in the lives of people who are hooked on this magazine.
The memo from Conde Nast was not personal; it was just business. Looking back, the newer issues of Gourmet, especially the issues published this year, are thinner compared to those of 2007. With an increasing number of food magazines and Internet blogs, people can just use Google to troubleshoot their cooking dilemmas — all for free! It is no wonder, then, that Gourmet’s readership has taken a hit.
Many people are of the opinion that Gourmet is out of date. The magazine has become irrelevant in a day and age where more space in the supermarket is given to boxed, packed, and frozen food than fresh produce. Ultimately, the closing of Gourmet is a reflection of the fact that people prefer a quicker way to cook. Gourmet is not full of quick meals that compromise on flavor but contains recipes for those who enjoy cooking and are not looking for shortcuts. In this magazine, recipes are well-experimented, so one always ends up with a delicious meal.
More than being just a magazine containing recipes, Gourmet understands food for what it is and what it should be. While many critics say that Gourmet is too fancy and only praises chefs who cook a $700 meal, they forget that, at the same time, Gourmet also features cheap street food from around the world. This is not to say that the magazine covers every income level, but 
shows that it realizes the true potential of food. At a certain level, Gourmet is almost like art.
With all the glory that Gourmet gets for dining and talking to Michelin star chefs, the editors remember that it’s about food and not about the convention. In 2008, there was an issue dedicated to Italian-American food. The concept was deemed as not traditional, not real, and therefore not good food. But Gourmet thinks of food as a reflection of changes in the culture and the way people are living. Americanized Italian, or Americanized Chinese, cuisine is just like any other cuisine, and it evolves.
The New York Times surprised me when it described Gourmet as “sexy, well-read, globetrotting.” I always think of the magazine as rich, complex, and comfortable — I can read it anywhere and immerse myself in reading about how turkey gravy is velvety smooth or how the wine “was just a country white, but poured with a generous hand from an endless bottle.” I did not grow up reading Gourmet as many people did, but when I chose to study food, Gourmet was my textbook.
Numerous James Beard Awards, a.k.a. the Academy Awards of the food world, do not guarantee the success of what The New York Times called the foodie’s New Yorker. Food lovers are saddened by the pre-manufactured, processed, and unemotional relationship Americans have with their food, but this relationship can be altered, and when the right moment comes, I believe that Gourmet will come back.

In a post-zombielyptic world, who better to have taking names and kicking ass than a Twinkie-loving man, a neurotic-to-the-core college student, a rebellious young woman, and her pre-teen sister? Anyone, you say? Well, probably, but they definitely wouldn’t be as entertaining.
Zombieland is a hilarious film that stars three of the best young actors of the last few years, along with one grizzled movie veteran, creating a surprising combination that works well together. Leading man Jesse Eisenberg has received rave reviews for his roles as a neurotic and hopelessly awkward young adult in more than a few movies now. He both stars and narrates as the character Columbus and explains that he has survived because he follows a strict set of rules since the beginning of zombie-time-all-the-time on Earth. His rules include cardio, beware of bathrooms, don’t be a hero, and check the back seat, all of which are hilariously displayed during the film.
Woody Harrelson, who admitted to initially being hesitant to join a zombie film with a first-time director (Ruben Fleischer), plays Tallahassee, the grizzled zombie killer who has made it his life goal to find the last remaining Twinkies on the planet. Harrelson is hick-tastically hilarious and unabashedly honest to anyone and everyone. He’s the perfect fit for his role.
Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin round out the cast as Wichita and Little Rock, sisters who act as con artists to help them survive in the world they’ve found themselves in. While it is clearly Eisenberg and Harrelson who steal the show, these two provide some great moments and act as strong characters in a film that hands out (non-zombie) speaking lines to very few people. Each actor has his or her fair share of witty one-liners and laughable moments. Not one of them burdens the others by dragging their feet — a solid quality for any film.
Our four heroes and heroines, named according to their intended destinations, travel across our great — well, not anymore — nation in search of various things. For Columbus, it’s his parents; Tallahassee can’t get enough of those Twinkies; and Wichita and Little Rock just want to be kids again at an amusement park. Along the way, we learn more about each character’s past and how they got to where they are today. In addition, some wonderful antics ensue at gas stations, supermarkets, and mansions, where our lovable cast kills zombies, acts inappropriately, and — fingers crossed — finds love, all in a nicely wrapped-up hour and a half.
Zombieland opened across the United States on Oct. 2, garnering $25 million in its opening weekend, and has not
lost any steam since — getting many people talking about its potential. The horror-comedy has even impressed critics, who are usually tough on zombie flicks. But it is clear that this one is different. Cary Darling of the Dallas Morning News perhaps summed it up best: “When it comes to genre filmmaking, Zombieland, a grisly comedy about yet another attack of the ravenous undead, does just about everything right,” she said.
And she is right. Not once did this film feel forced, nor did it ever slow down. It was consistently suspenseful, hilarious, stupid (in a very good way), or surprising (also in a good way). The phrase, “Never a dull moment,” definitely applies. Zombieland was good because it borrowed just a little bit from all the best zombie flicks of the last 25 years and still retained a great sense of originality in its structure, characters, and storyline. Go see it for the following reasons: It is one of the best movie experiences you could hope to get nowadays; it has the absurdly entertaining “zombie kills of the week”; it shows four people bonding over the virtual ending of human life on Earth (how can that not be hilarious); and, above all else, it is a solid comedy film. Oh, and did I mention it has a surprise and absolutely hilarious cameo from one of the best comedic actors of all time? Yeah, go see it for that too.

New music and fresh artists are being churned out every day, but it’s hard to know which songs are must-haves and which albums have made it big. These two musicians have released second tries onto the scene that might just be worth a listen — at least some of them, anyway.
Kid Cudi — Man on the Moon: The End of Day
Kid Cudi arrived out of nowhere in 2007 with the release of “Day ’n’ Nite,” a lonely anthem that received mass appeal due to its introverted lyrics and catchy beat. Finally, after two years of collaborating with famous hip-hop artists, Kid Cudi has delivered a full-length LP, now in stores, named Man on the Moon: The End of Day (MotM).
MotM is a concept album, or at least Kid Cudi wants the audience to see it as such. Interspersed within some tracks are pointless monologues that are reminiscent of a more serious Kanye West “Skit” or Wu-Tang interjection. All they tend to do is break up the song’s tempo and rhythm, as the monologues add nothing conceptually to the lyrical content of the album. Every rapper seems to do these monologues during their first LP, but I think that instead of focusing on creating an artificial narrative throughout his album, Kid Cudi should have paid more attention to his songs.
Initially, MotM seems utterly lost in a conceptual nightmare that prevents the listener from making sense of the album. However, the album finally finds its place when “Cudi Zone” begins. The song is a perfect mix of uplifting music that brings Kid Cudi out of his depression, and throughout the rest of the album, the beats are mainly fresh and light-hearted. Afterward comes “Poke Her Face,” a lewd mockery of Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face.” Rappers Common and Kanye West provide excellent raps on top of the catchy beat.
Immediately following is “Pursuit of Happiness,” 
perhaps Kid Cudi’s magnum opus of the album if one ignores the older, but excellent, “Day ’n’ Nite.” It deftly mixes the rapper’s binary personality — the playfulness of the public Kid Cudi and the downtrodden, introspective Kid Cudi. He sings: “I’m on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain’t always gonna be gold/Hey/I’ll be fine once I get it, I’ll be good.”
Kid Cudi’s pursuit of happiness involves doing what he does best — striving for creating a noble way of going through life without hurting other people. While “Day ’n’ Nite” reveals an attention-seeking, shy person, “Pursuit of Happiness” bares the evolution of Kid Cudi’s thought process.
Initially, MotM seems to be a disastrous collection of disjointed motivations and goals, but at the end it all comes together to form a vague semblance of direction. Kid Cudi’s only problem is the vast expectations placed on him, as evidenced by the numerous collaborations with other artists for his first LP. Nevertheless, if he continues to make albums, he might finally complete his pursuit of happiness, and, maybe, we’ll have some great Kid Cudi albums.
Ken Flagg — The End of Suffering
Carnegie Mellon alumnus Ken Flagg (CFA ’98), will be releasing his sophomore album, titled The End of Suffering, on Nov. 3 with Eclectic Records. The End of Suffering is a very eclectic album, mixing several different styles of music to create an indie album that is vaguely reminiscent of a combination of the early version of Ted Leo and the band The Shins.
The lyrical theme that runs throughout the album is universal: love. After singing through the first half of “Blinded,” the track changes into a Sufjan Stevens-esque instrumental; and with horns and woodwinds blasting, Flagg creates a cacophony of sound that elevates the acute listener onto another plane. Flagg continually adds layer upon layer of different sounds until the track reaches a quite good climactic finish.
“When the Sun Sets in the Eastern Sky” is a fantastic closer to the album: a mellow song juxtaposed with eerie lyrics. Flagg sings “as the flesh melts off our bones/we will both be dead but not alone” without much emphasis or noted distress. With a catchy beat and cool tone of voice, Flagg catches the listener off guard while listening to the lyrics.
Flagg’s style indicates that his music will remain fresh for years to come, though in a couple of the songs, he fails to create a unique sound. The End Of Suffering is an album full of one-off gems, in some of which emotion is quite spectacularly displayed. Whether the true Ken Flagg is The Shins, Ted Leo, or Sufjan Stevens, it is quite easy to see a very bright future for him as he further hones his style and music.

Music comes to me as a mental picture or as a story, but rarely as sound; I hate describing songs in terms of genre or artist; and musical performances, for me, are much more about visual showmanship than audible resonance. So, it should come as no surprise that film scores and soundtracks are my musical forte.
Ever since Zach Braff put together that music-heavy film Garden State, I’ve loved film soundtracks. Garden State was the film that put The Shins on my radar. The movie’s claustrophobic traffic sequence backed by “Don’t Panic,” made me love Coldplay — for better or worse. The music was like the film; it spoke to a generation. Maybe when the film played Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Only Living Boy in New York,” one realized that Garden State was trying a little too hard to bring The Graduate to a new audience, but it didn’t matter. 
Later in life, “Ping Island/Lightning Strike Rescue Op” by Mark Mothersbaugh was the song that got me into electronic music. Coming from Wes Anderson’s The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the song was not what one would expect for a daring rescue op, but when that song hit its stride, the film was so funny it was fierce. That song, along with the rest of the soundtrack, captured Anderson’s offbeat sense of humor perfectly. I wish the rest of his soundtracks had ended up half as good.
To me, this is all about Hollywood’s gradual appreciation for the power of a film score. When Radiohead’s Johnny Greenwood got tapped for There Will Be Blood, I jumped a little, and when I saw Greenwood’s score working its onscreen magic, I leaped for the rafters. His soundtrack carried that film for me in ways that Daniel Day Lewis’ acting never could. I was changed. So I cried a little when I heard about the Twilight soundtrack.
In the first Twilight film, I was more than a little hurt that Radiohead’s “15 Steps” was reserved for the end credits, but when Thom Yorke signed on to make music for the sequel, I teared up. Then I thought: Yorke, have you no sense of pride? Hopefully, the film won’t butcher the soundtrack, and as much as I try to keep an open mind, I’m more than a little nervous.
So, instead of ruminating over what looks bad, I want to end by talking about a film score that is bound to do well. I’m talking about the score recorded by Karen O and the Kids for Where the Wild Things Are. The soundtrack is already streaming on the Wild Things’ website, and let me say, being a kid never sounded so good. If you don’t already love the film’s director, Spike Jonze, go see Wild Things — I guarantee that it will be worth it.

When deciding whether or not to study abroad, my decision was simple. I had spoken with many other college graduates that had regretted never having done it, so I figured I would. When deciding where to go, my decision was simple again. There were many options, but I figured, why not go to Africa? It was somewhere I never saw myself going on vacation later in life, and being a black American, I wanted to know what it felt like to be in the place many dreamed about, but would never go to. I entered this situation in a very confident manner, but I was soon confronted with experiences that challenged me more than I ever thought I would be. I was taken out of my comfort zone from the moment I got to South Africa.
Durban reminds me a bit of the cities at home. The beaches are extremely beautiful and like nothing I have ever seen. Going to the beach after class is very popular, so I am about five shades darker from lying in the sun all day. The city center, on the other hand, is extremely congested and reminds me a bit of New York City. The downtown has enormous shops and outside vendors, but, partly because of the sheer volume of people, pickpocketing is extremely common. I have gotten into the habit of not carrying anything when I’m out in the center and putting my money and valuables in a money belt. There are some suburbs that are safe, but I have found that all houses, no matter what neighborhood, tend to have very high gates around them. 
I have been taking classes that I thought would benefit me because I hadn’t been able to take them at home, but I never realized how much at home I would actually feel in the South African classroom. In every one of my classes — English, marketing, anthropology, and political science — we discuss the United States. We never stop discussing it, and in some situations it is all we discuss. The United States is looked at as a model and pioneer in many fields, and students here at the University of KwaZulu-Natal tend to be taught the “right,” or American, way of doing something and how South Africa fits into that picture. It has actually left me in some slightly uncomfortable situations where I am called upon to speak for a nation of 350 million people, when in some cases my own opinions aren’t even firm.
The best part of my experience here has been getting to know the people. I love just talking to the students. I go to school with people from all over the world, and somehow, 21-year-old college students always have something in common, no matter where they are from. I have learned the most from students my own age. They have been more willing to provide me with full disclosure about their lives because they are less traditional than their parents and are willing to share the good and bad about their culture that others may try to hide.
I have, unfortunately, found out why South Africa, for many, has simply been known for violence and AIDS, and is now known for xenophobia as well. Somehow, in this past week, everyone has been rioting and protesting against something. I have learned that some people have a lot of resentment toward the United States, despite the fact that it is idolized, and I have, unfortunately, been a target of some of these angry feelings.
Many here in Durban watch America on television. They see Beyoncé and Laguna Beach and think that every city is like California and that Americans have more money than can be imagined and live in gorgeous condos. I have had to try to show people a more whole picture of what our country is like, that it has gated communities and ghettos, and even though the dollar is expensive, not everyone has very many to spend. I have learned that rationality is relative, and it has been a struggle to separate myself from the situations I have been put into and to try and look at them objectively.
It seems that in every class, the topic of AIDS comes up in some way or another, and even though it is a large problem here, a lot of the students don’t seem to view it as such. When I asked some of my friends in the dorm if they get tested, they said no and shook their heads as if to say, “Would I ever do that?” I explained that at my home, friends will sometimes go to get tested together, not necessarily because they’re afraid, but just for good measure.
I have been here for a little more than three months, and my trip is almost over. So even though many of my friends have just started their experience, I am reflecting on mine as though it has ended. I have very mixed feelings about experiences in Durban. Don’t get me wrong — I would not rather have gone to Australia, or Italy, or France, but that doesn’t mean that it’s been all good. I have been welcomed with open arms by some people and rioted against by others. I have had the time of my life one week and feared for my life when walking down the street in the next. Being in Durban has opened my eyes to a nation, although famous, that I didn’t know much about. All I knew about South Africa before coming here was apartheid and AIDS. But since being here, I have been able to truly see the toll these issues have taken on the people. As much as we all may look the same, we live in two completely different worlds. It’s been a difficult experience, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.

Dear Prerna,
I am very excited. Wait, I am very nervous. No, excited. Maybe just a combination of both. Well, the thing is that I am going on my very first date. Ever. Yes, it may seem weird that I have never dated before, but I finally found a girl that interests me. We usually do math homework together and it’s fun. Anyway, I don’t know how to act on this date, what to do, or where to take her. Should I give her a good night kiss or not at the end of the date? I want this to be her best date. Help me, please.
—A Worried Wooer
Dear Worried,
Aww, it’s your first date! You should be excited and not nervous at all. After your first date, you’ll realize that along with the date comes the unnecessary hype. I’m going to tell you a big secret: Be yourself on this date. Your girl is waiting for a date with the boy she does math with, so give her exactly what she wants, and depending on the type of girl she is, plan your evening.
Usually, you would like to keep the first date simple, yet fun — a good way you both can get to know each other. Take her to the movies or out for dinner. I would recommend you keep schoolwork out of the topic. Compliment her at the beginning of the date, and give her your constant attention throughout, but don’t get imposing.
About the kiss, depending on how the date goes, you can make your move. Usually, the girl gives indications, so if she’s hanging around after the date or is being flirty, I think she’s ready for you to make your move. But remember: Slow and steady wins the race. If it doesn’t work out, come to me and we can find you a pretty lady.
Enjoy the date!
—Prerna
Dear Prerna,
I have a simple, yet much-debated, question — should I pay for every date? The thing is, I’m a gentleman — the holding-doors-open-and-picking-up-the-check kind of guy. Sadly, some girls think that it’s a bit too much. My problem is that I grew up in an environment that makes me think it’s necessary to be chivalrous. Also, nowadays I have noticed that when I don’t pick up the check, I am given dirty looks. What should I do?
—Old-Fashioned Fella
Hey OFF,
Being a girl, I can answer this question from the bottom of my heart: I’d love a chivalrous man. Who doesn’t like a man who holds the door open and is polite? However, over time I have come across many girls who find chivalry annoying and others who take it for granted. So I suggest that if you see a pretty girl holding a big stack of books and she looks like she’s going to fall over, ask her if she needs help. Don’t force yourself on her, but be the gentleman that you are. Every girl loves to be helped as long as she doesn’t seem helpless.
Also, on a date, I would recommend you use the line “Oh, let me get this one, and how about you get the next?” You’re subtly suggesting a second date, as well as saying that you are open to her paying for the meal next time, and not provoking her feminist side. You will definitely find that special girl who loves your chivalry and you just the way you are.
Good luck,
—Prerna

In a clear example of how lenient the times were, a columnist notes that Princeton has just this year instituted rules on where and when hazing can be performed. It is no longer allowed in first-year or sophomore dorms or university buildings. But if one wanted to, say, barrel roll a frosh down one’s personal flight of stairs, that would be perfectly acceptable.

Heavy rains this week left the football field in a soggy condition with both teams struggling to move the ball, though the Plaid eventually prevailed 7–0 to remain undefeated. It’s pretty unbelievable that there were days before turf.

Robert R. Birge is the new head of the chemistry department and hopes to revitalize it. Hailing from the University of California, Birge apparently had little difficulty adjusting to Pittsburgh life, saying “Pittsburgh is 100 times better than [Los Angeles].... I just wish they’d fix the pot holes.” Don’t we all, sir, don’t we all.

Carnegie Mellon students attended simulated debates and mock political conventions at Case Western Reserve University the past week. Sadly, the debate soon dissolved into a shouting match about the Steelers-Browns rivalry, which Case students clearly won in a landslide.

The new Miss Pennsylvania was crowned, and guess what? She hails from Carnegie Mellon! I would make a jab here about the attractiveness of people at Carnegie Mellon, but I fear the backlash may be too much for me.

Fareed Zakaria, CNN host and editor of Newsweek International, opened the Pittsburgh Middle East Institute’s second annual conference last Wednesday at the Carnegie Music Hall. 
A leading analyst of international relations, geopolitics, and the global economy, Zakaria discussed the growing significance of the Middle East on the international political stage. According to Zakaria, the real solution to the Middle East crisis lies within the changing socioeconomic fabric of the region itself. 
“The desire to combine modernity with authenticity is the real solution to the extremity and regress in the Middle East,” Zakaria said. 
With a keen eye toward Middle Eastern affairs, Zakaria has also penned several books, including The Future of Freedom and his recent best seller, The Post American World.

As part of the Emergency Awareness Day held by Carnegie Mellon Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), a mock dorm room was set on fire and extinguished by firefighters this afternoon on the Donner Ditch. Rick Caruso, fire safety manager for EHS, was on site to explain the risks of fires in dorm housing situations and precautions to take to limit fire risks.
The room was constructed with one wall open to the air and filled with the furnishings one would find in a standard dorm room. The fire was started by hand in a garbage can and quickly spread across the room. A ceiling-mounted smoke detector went off about 30 seconds after ignition, and after a minute had elapsed, flames engulfed the dorm room.
Three firefighters were on hand with a fire hose connected to their fire engine in the adjacent parking lot. They began extinguishing the fire about two minutes after ignition and had it completely defeated within another few minutes. The fire had totally destroyed the room’s contents, including melting a laptop and charring a mattress.
Other EHS events for their Emergency Awareness Day included a walk through a smoke-filled room, as well as AED and live fire extinguisher demonstrations.

Last week, an event titled Cardboard City took place on the Cut to raise awareness about homelessness in Pittsburgh. 
Every night, over 1000 people in Allegheny County find themselves without a bed to sleep in, according to a site created by the Carnegie Mellon Student Government Executive Branch. Homelessness is a problem both in Allegheny County and nationwide, with increasing numbers of individuals being put on the street due to job losses and foreclosures.
Hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Lambda Sigma Honor Society, the event was open to the campus community, both individuals and organizations, to help raise awareness. A free event, students were able to spend a night in a cardboard box to experience what it feels like to be homeless. 
“I thought it was a good way to raise awareness about issues that CMU students are usually insulated from," said Anna Goddard, a senior philosophy major and resident assistant. 
According to the site, even if students are aware of issues such as homelessness, many do not know how to help. The information on the site made helping out very easy and manageable for students.
Another member of Lambda Sigma and a participant in the sleepover shared why this was an important event to hold: “It is raising awareness [of] homelessness and how it still is an issue today. Most people overlook or are not aware of the fact that there still are a lot of homeless out on the streets of Pittsburgh, close to our campus," said Christopher DiAndreth, a sophomore chemical engineering major.
Student Government meant for the event to be informative and humbling, reminding students that while they are busy and consumed with schoolwork and extracurricular activities, there are many other people out there much less fortunate than they. 
The students were given breakfast the next morning, but were asked to leave laptops at home. Instead they brought sleeping bags, blankets, tarps, and other basic items that help in spending a night outdoors, though these are things that the homeless likely do not have.
Some students who could only spend a few hours at Cardboard City still supported the event by giving monetary donations that were directly given to a homeless shelter. To raise money, they raffled off items from local businesses and donated all proceeds from the raffle to Bethlehem Haven.
“I think it's a great idea in that everyone here on campus can get involved easily to help out and promote awareness and have fun doing so. For those who do sleep outside all night, it will be a reminder of how lucky we are to have a room, a bed, etc., everything that gets overlooked in our daily lives,” DiAndreth said.
Other Cardboard Cities have been constructed to raise awareness about the homeless in places like Chicago, Illinois, and Mobile, Alabama, where the project was founded. The title Cardboard City comes from the name of an area of cardboard boxes near Waterloo Station in London, England, in which homeless people lived from 1983 to 1998.
If interested in learning more about the event and getting involved in helping this cause, contact Julia Hanby at [SLANT12]jhanby@[SLANT12] or Robert White at [SLANT12]robert.p.white@gmail.com[SLANT12].

On Sept. 16, Google announced that it had acquired reCAPTCHA, a project first created by Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Luis von Ahn. Most would recognize the program as those distorted lines of text that one must type in to create online accounts and much more; they originate from a program called reCAPTCHA that is able to distinguish between a human and an automated user.
The first CAPTCHA, created by von Ahn and his Ph.D. adviser and Carnegie Mellon professor Manuel Blum, produced a randomly generated series of characters that a user had to type before accessing a web page or other online site to prevent spam, among other uses.
The current reCAPTCHA has an expanded purpose that the original did not: that of helping preserve the world’s pre-digital era books for generations to come.
“At some point, we realized that about 200 million of these CAPTCHAs were typed every day by people around the world, and the idea for reCAPTCHA came from trying to make good use of the time spent typing them. Two hundred million times a day is equivalent to [about] 500,000 hours every day,” said von Ahn, who wanted to harness this human effort for the useful project of digitizing old books and newspapers. 
The current method used to scan old texts is called OCR, or optical character recognition. A page is scanned into a computer as a digital image, and then OCR attempts to decipher the words, but it is not always right. “That program is not very accurate for very old books or newspapers because the ink has faded,” von Ahn said. That is where reCAPTCHA begins to solve the dilemma.
Words that could not be accurately identified by OCR are presented to a user along with a correct “control word.” If the user types the control word correctly, most of the time the user typed the unknown word correctly also. As may be familiar to users, the words often look distorted, as the reCAPTCHA program takes the image from the text, distorts the image in various ways, and then presents it to the viewer.
“Our goal with accuracy is to produce a digital file that is better than a professional human transcriber.... To achieve this, we need to combine the output of OCR software with the human answers from reCAPTCHA and decide, for each word, what the correct spelling of the word should be,” said Colin McMillen, a full-time programmer for reCAPTCHA.
To date, this process has digitized copies of The New York Times from its 150-year old archives, as referenced on the company’s website, and has maintained high levels of precision. “So far we’ve done very well on this front — even for very old and challenging documents, we get over 99 percent of words completely correct,” McMillen said.
The use of reCAPTCHA is spreading, chiefly as a result of its effective deterrence of spam, but also because it cannot be read by algorithms that worked on the original CAPTCHA, and because it has been beneficial and productive in digitizing the world’s literature. 
A reCAPTCHA also takes approximately the same time to solve as a typical CAPTCHA, so the benefits are real. Over 100,000 websites, according to a United Kingdom telegraph source, are known to use it, and individual users can also download an HTML code from the company’s website to protect their e-mail addresses.
In just one year, over 1.2 billion reCAPTCHAs were deciphered worldwide. 
Where Google will take the ingenious program remains to be seen. This is not the first time that Google has worked with projects that began at Carnegie Mellon. In 2006, the company also licensed the ESP game developed by von Ahn that allows for images to be labeled through online games. Its current name is the Google Image Labeler. Von Ahn, with such accolades as a member of Popular Science’s list of Ten Brilliant Scientists of 2006 and the MacArthur Foundation’s “genius grant” will continue his research at Carnegie Mellon and remain in Pittsburgh while he works with Google.
The dean of the School of Computer Science, Randal Bryant, commented that “it’s a natural fit for Google, who both have the resources to run the reCAPTCHA system on a much larger scale and have millions of books that have been scanned but not yet digitized.”

This past Wednesday, the coffee lounge in Baker Hall near Ginger’s Express was the setting for the Polyglot Café. The informal social was set up by the Modern Language Student Advisory Council (MLSAC), and was able to bring together over 50 students and faculty, who conversed about tales abroad and favorite classes over various worldly cookies and coffees.
Several members of the MLSAC spoke to the crowd, and at times some displayed their multilingual proficiency by sharing personal information in Spanish, Japanese, and Russian. They spoke about the modern languages department, majoring and minoring in a language, and the MLSAC itself. Projected on the wall behind the multilingual members was a slideshow of pictures taken from students’ recent trips abroad.
Along with the students — who wore name tags with their specialized languages — numerous professors and faculty were scattered throughout the room, ready and willing to talk about their area of instruction. 
And while there were dozens of students with experience in the eight languages offered (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish), several others attending the social had no experience with languages at the school.
Susan Polansky, head of the Department of Modern Languages, spoke of the benefits of learning a new language. “Students who pursue the study of world languages and cultures are especially well-equipped for communicating, working, and networking in our increasingly interconnected world,” Polansky said. 
“English may be considered the lingua franca in much of the working world, but the global corporate world ... is recognizing the importance of multilingual proficiency and its economic returns.”
Regarding chances to improve and enhance one’s language skills, Polansky said, “the more opportunity one has to do so, the better, including study abroad, study on campus, or a combination.”
While students may suspect a language class to be nothing more than an hour-long textbook lecture that can easily put students to sleep, MLSAC members assured their audience that language courses are far from this environment. More often than not, the textbook serves as just one of many resources used by professors to teach students not only about the language, but also its context within various cultures.
These new forms of communication can offer endless information, if a student is willing. “Languages are what you make of it,” said Nancy Brown, a sophomore majoring in ethics, history, and public policy. Though languages aren’t an official part of Brown’s academic career yet, she’s considering a minor in Spanish. Eventually, she’d like to spend a summer abroad in Granada, Spain.
Katie Dickson, a sophomore creative writing major, said that courses can be “very demanding” and often require a good deal of “outside studying.” Dickson is taking classes toward the Foreign Language and Culture Certificate in Italian, as it is not offered as a minor at Carnegie Mellon. 
Certificates are available in all languages of the modern language department, except Arabic. With her future knowledge of the language, working abroad in Italy is not completely out of the picture; she mentions that working for a publishing company dealing with translations would be an optimal career for her.
Studying a language as a minor can, in the words of Polansky, “build a student’s interdisciplinary strengths in an exciting and creative way, as it enhances communication skills and cross-cultural awareness.” She also adds that the studying and training in humanities “contribute to enhanced prospects for themselves and enriched fields of exchange and knowledge transfer for those with whom they interact.”
Opinions on the event were positive, and several people were pleased with the large turnout. “It was great to see interest in the activities of modern languages,” Polansky said. “I was delighted by the large attendance.”

The campus community has watched as Pittsburgh’s typical fall showers have delayed the progress of the reconstruction on Carnegie Mellon’s iconic art structure. Walking to the Sky was created by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Jonathan Borofsky, who earned his BFA in 1964.
The piece that has resided on the Cut since May 2006 is actually a copy of Borofsky’s Walking to the Sky, the first incarnation of which appeared in Rockefeller Center in New York City in 2004. It was moved to Dallas’s Nasher Sculpture Center in 2005, where photos of it were taken for Borofsky’s website. In 2008, another copy was installed in front of the Kiturami Homsys Company building in Seoul, South Korea, according to The Korea Times.
In an interview conducted by Carnegie Mellon Today in December 2006, Borofsky revealed that the first version was actually just one man walking upward, which he created for a 1991 exhibition in Kassel, Germany. “At the time,” he said, “I thought of the figure as pretty much representing myself, but also all of humanity.”
After creating a second version with one woman, he thought that the next version should include many people walking up toward the sky. When he was asked to craft a temporary sculpture in Rockefeller Center, he took the opportunity to create this work.
“When a sculpture like mine ends up at a particular public site, such as this one here at Carnegie Mellon,” Borofsky said in the same interview, “it is not my energy alone that has made this happen.... There have been many serious, knowledgeable, and well-intentioned people whose specific job it is to focus on what is best for Carnegie Mellon, now and into the future.”
Living in New York City, Jill Gansman, a trustee for Carnegie Mellon and an alumna from 1974, saw the sculpture in New York and commissioned Borofsky to make another as a gift to Carnegie Mellon.
“This is an inspiring work of art by one of our most acclaimed graduates,” said Jared L. Cohon, Carnegie Mellon’s president, in a news flash on Carnegie Mellon Today’s website. “We are delighted that it has come to our campus.”
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon, Borofsky went on to earn a master’s degree from Yale’s School of Art and Architecture. He then moved to New York, where he taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York until 1977, moving to the California Institute of the Arts until 1980.
He quickly became well-known in the arts world for his oversized sculptures, which became major features of many prominent European cities.
At the beginning of this semester, the 100-foot stainless steel pole was anchored to the ground by cables attached to large cement blocks. When the cables were removed later in the semester, the wind flexed the pole so that the top swayed several feet back and forth.
Every version of Walking to the Sky is set at a 75-degree angle pointing east. The new steel pole — which will be oriented in the same way — should be sturdier to prevent the bowing that worried much of the campus in recent weeks.

This past weekend, President Obama gave a speech to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender lobbying group and political action committee in the United States. While some critics viewed the speech as nothing more than recycled campaign promises, the HRC praised Obama and deemed him as their “strongest ally in this fight.” Here are some statistics about gay rights:
Percentage of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 who consider homosexuality acceptable: 62
Percentage of Americans in 2006 who considered homosexuality acceptable: 54
Number of Americans under age 20 who identify as lesbian or gay: 7.2 million
Year the United Church of Christ became the first Christian denomination to ordain an openly gay candidate: 1972

Writing for a newspaper, it is fairly obvious that freedom of speech is something that is important to me. I like having the ability to have opinions and write about them without having to worry about whether I’ll get in trouble for what I believe. I sometimes take this freedom for granted, and it is difficult for me to wrap my head around the thought that people in other countries do not all share this same freedom; in fact, some countries are taking steps backward in regard to free speech.
Recently, leaders of several Latin American countries have taken steps to limit the freedom of speech and freedom of the press of their citizens. According to a Tribune-Review article, in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez removed the licenses of 32 private radio stations along with two television stations and is threatening to shut down even more for supposed “technical reasons.” The article also gives the example of President Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, who wants to force all private media reporters to join a guild that is affiliated with his Sandinista Party, and of President Cristina Fernandez in Argentina, who is trying to increase the number of state-owned broadcasters while simultaneously decreasing the number of private ones.
These examples on their own would be disheartening enough — proof that in some countries, leaders are trying to minimize freedom of speech as much as possible. Freedom of speech is a vital component of any successful nation, because people must be able to challenge their government and must be able to make their wants and needs known, without fear of consequences. However, it is not just the limiting of freedom of speech in these countries that is something to question. What is even more worrisome is the motivation behind the decision to limit freedom.
Ortega’s push to have all private reporters join a guild affiliated with his own political party is the best example of the reasons behind the desire to limit freedom of speech in many Latin American countries — politics. By limiting what group media reporters can be affiliated with, Ortega now has the power to limit what they report about and what spin they give news topics. Even if the edict isn’t coming directly from Ortega — or any other president — he is still behind it. And this gives him direct control over what type of information every citizen of his country receives.
Freedom of speech is intended to give everyone the opportunity to speak up for what they believe in, not to feel like they have to conform to others’ beliefs, to gain support for an underdog of a cause by getting the word out. And there is no subject that needs freedom of speech more than politics. There will always be differing political opinions, and because of this, people will always want to express which one they believe is right — and should be able to do so. But it is not only the ability to have one’s own opinion that is important. In many South American countries, citizens are not happy with their governments and are trying to speak out against their leaders and stand up for what they want. Instead of listening and trying to make appropriate changes, however, South American leaders are trying to squash those unyielding voices so that they don’t have to change anything, so that the only news that is portrayed is good news.
In controlling the media, the South American governments can essentially have control over all aspects of these people’s lives. The government would be able to stop any reports of any dissenting political factions and would even be able to get the media to report false election results if they gained complete and total control. It’s a steep and slippery slope from limiting freedom of speech to taking it away completely, and neither action is the correct one for government leaders.
Instead of limiting the freedom of speech of their people, the leaders of South American countries should, instead, welcome it and work with their people instead of against them to help improve their country. People of dissenting beliefs surely have legitimate concerns and criticisms with the current government, both in South American countries and elsewhere. And only by listening to those concerns and criticisms will the country and the government be able to grow, rather than trying to maintain the status quo and becoming completely removed from the people they govern.
Although it is South American countries that are currently trying to limit freedoms of speech and the press, that does not mean that this lesson does not apply to other countries as well. All leaders should be reminded to really listen to their people and to keep in mind both what they think will be best for the people, as well as what the people want, when making decisions for their country.

Last Tuesday, the Carnegie Public Library of Pittsburgh voted on and announced the closing of four of its branches throughout the city.
Effective Feb. 3, 2010, the Beechview, West End, Hazelwood, and Lawrenceville branches will be closed to the public. Additionally, the Carrick and Knoxville branches will merge, fines and fees everywhere will increase, and the library board will implement other, more localized changes.
The seemingly sudden announcement to the public about the branch closings may demonstrate that even things we might consider immune from — or at least, isolated from — the economy are in fact at risk in these hard economic times. However, several members of the board explained to local news outlets that these changes were a long time in the works, possibly indicating that the economic recession may not be completely to blame for the weakening of the library system, but may rather have been the icing on the cake already baked with a number of problems.
While we in the Oakland community are safe — the Oakland branch is the largest and most notable of the Pittsburgh branches, and is supported by the close presence of Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh — the future of other neighborhoods is not so secure. Blighted neighborhoods like Hazelwood need whatever small elements of outside culture and education they have to stay in their community.
However, the changes to the Carnegie library system are quickly turning into food for political debates among those vying for office in the upcoming elections. For example, mayoral candidate Kevin Acklin has quickly admonished Mayor Luke Ravenstaal and the city of Pittsburgh for not contributing enough to the failing library system — the city currently gives $40,000 annually to the Carnegie Public Library of Pittsburgh — and has promised to increase that amount to $250,000 if elected.
Wild promises of an extra $200,000-plus — simply to win over voters early in the elections process — will not fix the system in the short term, and will not encourage outside donors to contribute before the four branches in question shut their doors in February.
We hope that the loud public outcry and protests that have erupted in the past week in reaction to the board’s announcement will be enough to turn the public library system around. While you still can, make sure that you visit the four branches that will be closing, or even just the Oakland branch next to Schenley Plaza. Experience the free culture that Pittsburgh has to offer before it’s too late for our shrinking city.

On Friday, the Nobel committee announced from their ivory tower in the far northern land of Norway that U.S. President Barack Obama would be this year’s recipient of the much-lauded Nobel Peace Prize. The committee chair was quoted in The New York Times: “The question we have to ask is who has done the most in the previous year to enhance peace in the world?” Apparently, in his nine months as President, Obama has done more to effect world peace than anyone else anywhere, even while attending fancy dinners at Phipps Conservatory and lamenting that he didn’t get any of Pamela’s pancakes.
I must start by saying that I was most certainly one of the majority of Pittsburghers who cheered when Obama took Pennsylvania in November’s election and once again when his victory in California cinched his seat in the Presidency. It also certainly cannot be denied that the rest of the world — especially Europe — was pleased to see Obama win, though many were likely disappointed they could no longer use their collection of eight years’ worth of George Bush jibes. They won’t underestimate us any longer.
The committee’s official reasoning behind the choice of Obama, according to the same New York Times article, was his commitment to nuclear disarmament and his efforts to engage the rest of the world in more constructive dialogue than that of his predecessor.
Both of these goals are, of course, very noble pursuits. After all, how useful is it for Random Country Number One to be able to say, “Random Country Number Two, we have enough arms to obliterate your population 3500 times”? Nuclear weapons have proven to serve nothing more than a potential threat to other countries since we slaughtered over 100,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki — as estimated in The Avalon Project of Yale’s law school — and crippled many thousands more, even years later.
But while nuclear disarmament is certainly a significant goal, Obama’s efforts have not changed much in the level of nuclear armament in the world. The Associated Press reported last Monday that Kim Jong Il said North Korea “is willing to attend multilateral talks ... depending on the progress in its talks with the United States.” So if Kim thinks Obama is nice enough, he will consider discussing the possibility of reducing its nuclear arms. That’s progress.
Obama has been selected for one of the most prestigious awards in the world based on this progress. But, of course, the Nobel committee insists that they did not select Obama based on his potential, but the work he has already accomplished, work like “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” along with his preference for negotiation and his vision of a cooperative world of shared values, an Oct. 9  New York Times reported.
This year’s Nobel Prize in medicine went to a group of scientists who discovered that the shortening of the ends of chromosomes is important in clocking the life span of a cell — information that may be significant in learning more about cancer cells, whose chromosomes do not shorten. Herta Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature for a series of works censored in her native Romania because of her depiction of the political landscape of the country.
In short, the other Nobel laureates this year deserved the award for groundbreaking achievements and significant contributions to their respective fields. Obama was granted an award because he has a commitment to making future changes. While I certainly did not evaluate the 205 nominations the committee received for their individual contributions, I can only assume at least one person on the list must have made an actual accomplishment worth noting.
Even Obama was surprised at his selection, saying “I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who have been honored by this prize, men and women who’ve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.”
While this humbling statement is the mark of a well-honed public speaker — and would be the correct thing to say even if Obama was certain he deserved the award — when the President himself says he doesn’t deserve the award, what can the rest of America and the world do but follow suit?
France’s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, referenced the award as “America’s return to the hearts of the world’s peoples.”
Others attribute the selection as the world’s relief to see Bush out of office. “From our standpoint, you know, we think that this gives us a sense of momentum,” said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley in a Fox News article, “when the United States has accolades tossed its way, rather than shoes,” referring to an incident in 2008 when an Iraqi reporter threw a shoe at President Bush during a news conference.
Regardless of why he was chosen, Obama’s award represents poor judgment on the part of the committee, who unanimously voted on the selection. As impressive and significant as Obama’s promises are, they are still just promises, and as most everyone recognizes, campaign promises are worth about as much as the paper they are written on. The only good thing that can be said at this point is that Obama intends to give all of his $1.4 million of reward money to charity.
Douglas McIntyre (drmcinty@) is the editor-in-chief of The Tartan and wishes he could have been awarded his master’s degree based on his potential contributions to the field.

The swine flu vaccine is here. Finally. After months of hearing about almost nothing but swine flu in the news, the whole scare will finally end — hopefully.
Now that this whole story should have a happy ending, people are complicating it by saying that the vaccine is unsafe. The reason? First, many people are skeptical about the usual seasonal flu vaccine and believe that it causes more problems than it solves. These skeptics view the swine flu vaccine in a similar manner and don’t want to have anything to do with it. Secondly, many worry that since the vaccine was created in such a hurry, it will have a lot of problems and that proper testing has probably not been done. Lastly, when H1N1 resulted in a major epidemic across the nation in 1976, the vaccine developed at the time led to major complications.
The first reason for people’s paranoia is somewhat understandable. I’ve heard lots of rumors about how the flu vaccine can cause slight flu-like symptoms such as headaches. Who would want to fall sick after taking a vaccine that is supposed to prevent that very thing from happening? Personally, I share the same paranoia, and after being offered a flu shot — for free in fact — I still refused it. Although I understand that many of the rumors associated with the vaccine are probably baseless, I’m still scared. What people should realize, however, is that H1N1 is not like the seasonal flu. Unlike the seasonal influenza virus, the young are highly vulnerable to H1N1. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since April, 76 children in the country have died because of swine flu. High-risk groups like children and pregnant women could therefore benefit greatly from the vaccine, and for such people, I think it is worth taking the risk of getting mild flu-like symptoms (although the CDC denies any problems associated with either the H1N1 or the seasonal flu vaccine.)
The second reason — that of the vaccine being developed in a hurry — was addressed by an article in The New York Times. The article says that normally it takes around five to six months to create a vaccine, and that’s how long it took to make this one. It also states that since there will soon be data of response to the vaccine from all over the world, this vaccine will actually be better tested than the usual seasonal flu vaccine. Case closed there, I suppose.
The last reason is what at least I believe to be one of the major causes for the mixed reactions to the H1N1 vaccine. In 1976, the strain of H1N1 that infected millions across the nation was far more lethal than the strain that has been infecting people now. When the vaccine was developed, it was linked to cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder that causes severe weakness of the nerves and can even lead to death. The CDC’s response to such queries regarding today’s vaccine and GBS is that today’s strain of H1N1, and consequently today’s vaccine, is different from the 1976 strain of the virus. The CDC also states that in the general population, one in 100,000 people develop GBS on their own regardless of whether or not they’ve received a vaccine. Two studies have shown that one in a million people are at risk of developing GBS because of the seasonal flu vaccine. Given this number, it is far more likely that a person will die because of complications associated with swine flu rather than GBS.
As of now, the vaccine is being administered to health care workers and high-risk groups. When it becomes available for use to the general public, I guess people will have to use their own discretion to decide whether to take it. Everything comes with risks, but in this case I believe that it might be worth taking the risk.

The college bubble may soon engulf even more of our lives, if President Obama and the Secretary of Education have it their way. They have proposed a lengthening of the required hours in a school day or in the school year. They believe that in this global economy, American test scores must compete with foreign ones, and more school is the answer.
Some flaws exist in this assumed causation, however. First of all, American students already spend more time in classes than do many of the countries that consistently outscore our students in standardized tests. The Brookings Institution estimated that the average U.S. student spends about 1146 hours in school each year, as opposed to Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, who all average about 900–1000 annual hours. Americans do, however, spend a lesser portion of the year in school, with more break times than competitive countries.
According to researchers, these extended breaks from school, such as the long-awaited summer vacation, have the potential to make or break a student’s education. While wealthier children often are cared for academically by their parents, disadvantaged children fall prey to problems of poverty and a lack of parental involvement, and fall behind in math and reasoning knowledge.
In a country where we continue to fail in our test scores, and where the high school and college drop-out rates are 30 and 45 percent, respectively, according to the Department of Education, there is no doubt that something must be done.
Especially in a time of a strained economy, the cost of adding more school time is not cheap. Programs that already exist in some Massachusetts public schools have shown to cost between 12 and 15 percent more that what is regularly allotted per student in most state budgets.
Many charter schools have implemented both longer school days, a school day every other Saturday, and a shorter summer vacation. It is true that these schools’ eighth-graders have shown to exceed their state district average scores. It is also true, however, that there are many other factors at play here. Students attending charter schools are often from more enriched societal backgrounds. Thus, a divide exists between higher- and lower-scoring schools. Part of the work that must be done should be in evening out the education gap.
The President and education secretary should also recognize that reducing the time students get to take for themselves is decreasing a whole other side of education: the life experience side. American students need their breaks to remember that there is a life outside of school.
It is clear that some change must come to American education. But, as of now, Obama’s plan remains unconvincing and the answer yet unclear.

Regardless of whether students have what they believe to be either the best or worst professor in their entire academic career, it is highly unlikely that they will ever fill out the Faculty Course Evaluation (FCE) for the class unless they’re offered some highly elusive and coveted extra credit.
But that doesn’t mean that the administration is going to leave the evaluations as is. The Faculty Senate recently voted to increase the number of questions on the FCEs to 10, a number that had been lowered just a few years before.
The FCEs have the potential to serve a valuable purpose to the campus community: providing information about classes and professors that could help future students select the most rewarding classes. They were originally created with exactly this intention in mind — Pi Kappa Theta fraternity decided back in 1968 that there was a need on campus for a way to evaluate classes and professors, and thus the FCEs were born and student-run for a number of years.
At present, however, the FCEs don’t serve the purpose that they are meant to. A very small number of students actually fill them out, or if they do, they’re filling them out to get a homework grade dropped, or because they want to cause that professor as much pain as possible, and not really putting any thought into accurately evaluating the course. And an even smaller number of students actually look at these evaluations when choosing between one class or another due to the limited amount of feedback that is available for each.
So instead of changing the number of questions back and forth between two and 10 every few years, perhaps the focus should be more about the FCEs in general and how to make them useful to the students and faculty again. Regardless of how careful the selection about the number of questions is, the FCEs are still irrelevant until students actually start caring about filling them out and reading them. The questions, while important, should not be the focus of changing FCEs; the focus should be finding a better process and vendor, encouraging students to fill them out, displaying the results in a better way, and explaining why they are useful to students and professors.

The pole is down.
Long live the pole.
With the un-eagerly anticipated resurrection of Walking to the Sky sometime this week, our campus will once again be graced by a large metal rod hovering over the Cut. This new one should hopefully not strike fear into the hearts of both campus administration and passersby as they stare at it swaying maniacally in the breeze. And isn’t that a relief?
While this year’s seniors may hold on to memories of pre-college visits in the days before the erection of Walking to the Sky, the piece has become central to the fabric of the public art scene on campus. You might ask, what public art scene? Is there more than this giant stick?
And while yes, that is the biggest piece, we should not forget about the G20 discussion space that grew out of the Fence earlier this year, not to mention the Fence itself, and of course the big brown wedge. That awkward thing that stuck up out of the ground was removed this summer, and while not actually art, it was covering broken art. But now — it is art again! That space has a newly installed … shack, complete with functioning lightbulb and not quite so functioning audio recording of digging, which seems to have not quite lasted 24 hours, probably a fortunate technical malfunction.
There are a few other random pieces of art on campus — the awkward snowman next to Doherty, the bizarre plant installation on the roof of the walkway between Doherty and Wean, and the backwards sentence on the outside wall of Posner Hall and the giant platform of numbers below.
Yes, this is the current variety of art that graces our main grassy spaces: a couple of cranes putting back up fake people frozen in their journey into the sky, something reminiscent of the entrance to a coal mine, and a few additional random statues and sculptures. Do we wish there were more? Of course. More variety, more projects that last a couple of months, weeks, or even just days (remember the photo boxes from last spring?) to create more interest, more discussion, and a broader discovery of the excellent artists that exist on our campus.
Maybe someday we will have that — art projects springing up out of the ground, creating controversy, dialogue, disappearing; and making way for new, more challenging, more controversial, more interesting pieces. But until then, we can keep taking pictures of those fiberglass mannequins.

All members of Carnegie Mellon’s Student Government are elected for one specific reason — to promote the interests, values, and activities of the Carnegie Mellon student body. Over the past month, Adam and I, as Student Body Vice President and President, respectively, have placed special emphasis on supporting and representing student interests.
Though not encompassing all of our activities, our promotion of the Tartan Rewards Program,  the G20 Awareness Fair, and efforts toward transparency have helped to direct the executive branch toward better serving Carnegie Mellon students.
Each initiative has been met with significant success. In the midst of the exciting and confusing time when the G20 was in Pittsburgh, the Student Government Executive Branch spearheaded the massive G20 Awareness Fair, which involved several student organizations, bands, and interest groups while offering a wealth of information to hundreds of students.
For the Tartan Rewards Program, we have worked to help the campus community better realize the benefits that come from supporting one another. In this same vein of supporting fellow students and organizations, we are also beginning to incorporate non-athletic activities into the program, as well as garnering student organization participation and support in hosting games as well as participating in small competitions. The program has proven to be a greatly successful venture as we push for a greater sense of community here at Carnegie Mellon.
Lastly, our transparency efforts such as the Mad Minute are new and innovative ways to offer lots of information about Student Government’s activities and campus happenings in a quick and easy way.
For the future, the Student Government Executive Branch is looking to continue to find innovative ways to improve the student experience at Carnegie Mellon, as well as working toward greater transparency and student government reform, boosting the Tartan Rewards Program, and promoting the expanded Loop Bus, which shuttles students on the weekend to various popular social destinations throughout Pittsburgh.
For more information, please become a fan of the CMU Student Government Executive Branch on Facebook, and we will be sure to keep you informed. There are literally dozens of new events happening on campus each week, and we are working to better your Carnegie Mellon experience through proper representation and hard work.

        We're testing a new look for The Tartan. Let us know what you think!
