The men’s tennis team travelled to the University of Mary Washington on Sept. 28 to battle it out in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Southeast Regional Tournament. 
The team went deep, with junior Christian Heaney-Secord and first-year Kenny Zheng making it to the semifinals, and sophomore Abhishek Alla taking home the singles title. Alla had to duke it out with two of his own teammates to obtain the coveted title.
In the quarterfinals, Alla faced teammate junior Will Duncan and beat him in an intense three-set match (4–6, 6–2, 7–5). “It was bittersweet — it was pretty early, and it was a good match,” Alla said. He explained how thinking of tennes as an individual sport is essential to winning.
“You have to do what you have to do,” he said. “No hard feelings.” However, beating Duncan was only the first step. Alla moved on to the semifinals, in which he defeated Zheng (6–4, 6–2). Finally, to win the ITA singles title, Alla crushed Ben Hwang of Johns Hopkins University (6–2, 6–1).
Commenting on Alla’s performance, Zheng said, “He was playing extremely well. I knew he was going to kill that kid in the finals.”
“I don’t really get nervous. I just knew I had to make a lot of balls and not make any unforced errors,” Alla said.
When he won, Alla was overjoyed that he would get to skip three days of school this week to play in the ITA National Small College Championships in Fort Meyers, Fla.
The Southeast Regional Tournament began with 64 teams. In order to be victorious, Alla had to win a series of six matches over three days. Alla emphasized that the hardest match was against his teammate Duncan, because “he was just that good.”
By the third day, most of the team had to head back to Carnegie Mellon for class and did not get to see Alla win the title. “It sucked that not everyone from the team was there,” Alla said.
Originally from Hyderabad, India, Alla has played tennis since he was 6 years old. “My parents wanted us to try out activities. We started playing tournaments, it got competitive, and we started traveling,” Alla said. He attended IMG Pendelton School, a boarding school in Florida, for his junior and senior years of high school.
However, attending Carnegie Mellon gave Alla his first opportunity to play on a team. “It’s just fun to be around [my teammates] — they push me to work hard,” Alla said. This sense of teamwork has become one of Alla’s favorite aspects of tennis.
Alla’s strengths as a player go beyond his technical ability.
“I have good defense and attack,” Alla explained, “but my serve is pretty weak. My movement consolidates everything.” 
Alla also manages to do one of the more difficult things for a tennis player to do: keep his cool. “I don’t get too emotional on the court. My opponents get frustrated sometimes,” he said.
Winning this tournament means that Alla has gained the title of All-American, a title Alla has been keen on earning this year. 
Advancing to the national tournament, which starts Thursday, he will face off against seven other regional champions from Division III.

The men’s soccer team’s 2–1 loss to the University of Chicago on Saturday ended with a frightening incident.
In the 90th minute, senior midfielder Jerome Reano chased a loose ball outside the Chicago penalty box, but as the ball bounced in the air and Chicago goalkeeper Brett Wiesen went up to punch it, Wiesen hit Reano’s head instead. Reano fell to the turf and laid there for 15 minutes before being carried off the field on a stretcher.
Reano entered the game in the 82nd minute after a Chicago goal gave them a 2–1 lead, and he made an immediate impact. The speedy midfielder chased loose balls and pressured a Chicago defender into clearing the ball over the goal line in the 87th minute for a Tartan corner kick.
Reano sustained a concussion from the play, and he received stitches to his ear. Although Wiesen was given a straight red card, the Tartans didn’t see any malicious intent — it was just a hard play.
“I think [Wiesen] was trying to get the ball, and I don’t think he expected Jerome to be as fast as he was.... It was a bad collision,” said head coach Arron Lujan.
“Obviously, they were both going for the ball ... but it was an ugly play to see,” said first-year Tristan Lockwood.
Outstanding play by Tartan midfielders gave the team a great chance to win despite sloppy play from the defenders and limited touches for senior forwards Max Tassano and Chris Wysocki.
Although the Tartans generated more scoring opportunities and possessed the ball better, Chicago’s tight defense made a big difference. “Their defense played well. They were compact and weren’t giving us much space,” Lockwood said.
Chicago maintained a high line of defense and was successful in limiting touches for forwards Wysocki and Tassano; when they did possess the ball, however, it was near the center line and often with their backs facing goal.
“Our forwards are players who show for the ball and want the ball at their feet. They’re not forwards who look to get in behind players,” Lujan said. “At times it became very predictable what we were going to do, and they were able to keep a really high line.”
The Carnegie Mellon defense, on the other hand, struggled to clear the ball and suffered from poor communication.
Chicago scored first in the 10th minute when Chicago’s Nic Lopez was left unmarked in the far post and headed in a corner kick.
The Tartans tied the score four minutes later when senior defender Ben Bryant’s free kick dipped perfectly into the back of the net.
Misplays from the back four continued, however. A poor clearance from defender Jakob Rohwer led to a one-on-one opportunity for Chicago in the 43rd minute, but goalkeeper Christopher Madden jumped from his line to make a close-range save.
Chicago’s Lopez also scored the final goal of the game in the 79th minute off another header.
Moments before, the Tartans had a great opportunity to score when Lockwood sent a cross to senior midfielder Mike Ferraco, who was free on the left side of the field. Ferraco took a touch back in and had a wide-open look at the far post, but he shot wide and high.
“We were just really hesitant in the back,” Lujan said. “We’ve been so solid there over the last eight games, that it’s really surprising that it would happen now.”
“We dominated in the second half, I thought. We just couldn’t finish, and we had a defensive lapse on that goal,” he said.
After a disappointing start to University Athletic Association (UAA) Conference play, the Tartans will move on this Saturday as they visit Washington University in St. Louis.
“It’s one game. We still got six games in UAA to prove ourselves, and we’re still positive going forward,” Lockwood said.

The women’s soccer team started University Athletic Association (UAA) Conference play Saturday with a 0–0 tie against the University of Chicago in a game they came close to winning.
“I think we outplayed them, but we didn’t get many solid opportunities,” sophomore forward Louisa Pendergast said.
The Tartans always seemed as if they were threatening to score, and they outshot the Maroons 11–2. Chicago, however, started off the game faster and had a few promising plays on the counterattack.
The Tartans were able to slow the game down, winning free kicks and corners toward the middle of the first half. They controlled the game from then on.
“UAA [play] is always a battle. They came out with a UAA mentality, and it didn’t take long to pick up on that,” graduate student goalkeeper Anna Albi said.
Their best scoring opportunity in the first half came off a corner when junior midfielder and forward Amanda So found the ball in front of the net, but her volley flew high.
In the second half, the ball stayed mainly in the middle of the field; a strong Chicago defense kept the Tartans out of their defensive third, for the most part.
A little fortune helped the Tartans get a great look on goal in the 74th minute. A shot by senior defender Rachel Contopoulos deflected to sophomore midfielder Allison McGugan, who was left unmarked inside the penalty box, but her shot curved over the net. As no one was marking her, she could have taken more time to get a better look on goal before shooting.
The Tartans also saw several chances in the first overtime period. After several crisp passes, Pendergast found the ball at the top of the penalty box. She took a touch to beat her defender and fired a left-footed shot that soared wide left over goal.
By the second overtime, the team seemed tired and failed to score the decisive goal.
After the Tartans’ slow start, their defense shut down the Chicago attack led by junior midfielder Sara Kwan. Kwan, who leads the Maroons with six goals and six assists for the season, was able to find open space in the beginning of the game and to make nice leading passes to her midfielders on the sidelines.
In the second half, the Tartans’ defenders quickly closed in whenever she touched the ball; with Kwan neutralized, the Maroons struggled picking apart the Tartans’ defense.
Albi said Kwan was the key player on their scouting report whom they knew they had to stop. “Our whole mid[fielders] did a great job of holding her down.”
Despite the tie, the Tartans proved they are ready for UAA Conference play.
“I think if we keep our defensive shape and work on our finishing abilities, we’ll be able to beat anyone,” Pendergast said.
Their next challenge comes this Saturday at Washington University in St. Louis.

The streak is finally over. The Pittsburgh Pirates streak of 21 losing and playoff-less seasons was days away from being sadly extended when the Pirates played their wild card play-in game against the Cincinnati Reds last Tuesday.
It has been an interesting season for the Pirates. The team, made up of journeyman veterans, unproven young players, and one star, has faced injuries, slumps, and last-minute trades. But nevertheless, this group of underdogs has turned into the ultimate feel-good story during this postseason.
Tuesday night’s wild card game showed why baseball is a better sport when Pittsburgh has a winning team. The sold-out, blacked-out crowd was deafening and had everyone talking about the state of Pittsburgh fandom. Twenty-one years of built-up energy was unleashed when Pirates fans finally had something to cheer for. The stadium nearly exploded with excitement in the second inning. Late August trade addition Marlon Byrd hit a solo home run to give the Pirates a 1–0 lead. Two batters later, free-agent acquisition Russell Martin was up to bat against Reds ace Johnny Cueto when the crowd took over. Deafening taunts of “Cue-to Cue-to” echoed through the stadium.
Reports have varied about what happened next. Pirates supporters believe that the chants caused Cueto to lose his cool and drop the ball on the ground while walking back to the mound. Reds manager Dusty Baker, who was fired after the loss, claimed that Cueto’s hand just slipped and the crowd was a non-factor. Either way, the result was the same. Martin and Cueto exchanged smiles at the situation; on the next pitch, Martin drilled the ball 405 feet to center field for a home run and turned the crowd loose.
After another Martin home run, the Pirates cruised to a 6–2 victory, allowing them to move on to the National League Division Series against the National League Central-winning St. Louis Cardinals.
The first two games of the series were complete mirror images of each other: Game 1, on Thursday in St. Louis, showcased a battle of strong pitchers with the Pirates’ A.J. Burnett facing off against Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright. It was shaping up to be a pitcher’s duel until the bottom of the third inning when Burnett lost his command.
The inning started with Burnett walking Wainwright, followed by a series of hits, home runs, walks, and hit batsmen. The inning took a turn for the worse when Burnett issued a walk with the bases loaded, and followed that up by giving up a single that allowed three runs to score after a throwing error by Byrd. Burnett gave up seven runs, while facing eight batters and not getting a single out in the entire inning.
After that point, the Pirates were unable to muster any sort of comeback and accepted the 9–1 beatdown. After the game, many Pirates faithfuls were afraid that the inevitable collapse the Pirates annually suffer had arrived, albeit this time in October instead of in July.
Rookie pitcher Gerrit Cole came to the rescue in Game 2, pitching a gem and succeeding where Burnett had failed. Cole went head-to-head with Lance Lynn and outdueled him, pitching six innings of one-hit ball. Cole also provided his own run support with an RBI single in the second inning to start off the Pirates’ run parade. They scored two more runs in both the third and fifth innings, followed by insurance runs in the seventh and eighth innings.
The previously dominant Cardinals offense was held to only four hits, as the Pirates bullpen — known as the Shark Tank — pitched three shutout innings to finish off Cole’s sterling performance. With closer Jason Grilli back from injury, the Pirates have debatably the best setup closer combination in baseball with Mark Melancon being named an All-Star for his great setup work.
The Pirates are now back home for two games with a chance to close the series and advance to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the winner of the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers series. One can only imagine how loud Pirates fans will get if their team makes it not only to the NLCS but all the way to the World Series.

Hundreds of fellow Tartans will be working the upcoming job fair as they look to distinguish themselves from other attendees and land their dream job. Kevin Collins, career consultant for the School of Computer Science and assistant director of the Career and Professional Development Center, and Chris Maloney, senior manager at Cisco and Carnegie Mellon alumnus, shared their insights on how to make the best of a career fair.
The biggest faux pas at a fair is talking about money. Collins stressed that asking about salaries and payment is “the worst thing a student could do.” 
Such questions should be asked further into the applications process, never up front. Something else to avoid: ignorance of the company a recruiter is representing. Failing to do one’s homework beforehand puts one at a huge disadvantage and often annoys the recruiter.
Maloney also stressed the importance of doing prior research on the company and how it functions. “Understand the company as a whole ... rather than focusing on specific things like press releases,” Maloney said. He added that simply reading the latest press release from the company was not sufficient. In many cases, the recruiters may not know what is going on in another branch of the company and may not even know about the press release.
If the students do not have enough knowledge of what the recruiters have to offer, the students appear unprepared or ill-suited for the job. This may cause recruiters to look to more informed students. 
A fair number of people are guilty of going to different booths just for the free stuff or “the swag,” as Collins put it. Google may have cool pens, but unless you are interested in a position at the company, it is best to avoid wasting not only your time (and the recruiter’s), but also avoid wasting time for those who are genuinely interested in working for the company.
One of the best ways to interact with a recruiter is to think like one, or rather, understand their mission at a job fair. 
Collins explained that job fairs serve as a way for companies to get a “quick assessment of candidates” and build upon their applicant pools. 
Collins also stated that job fairs “serve as a way for students to get on the company’s radar and for recruiters to remember them,” building a connection that aids in the application process. 
As Collins explained, the students that recruiters are bound to notice and remember are “those who have a really good sense of what they can offer a company and know what sets them apart from others.”
However, Maloney said that one of the worst ways to be noticed is to crowd around the booth while another student is talking to the 
recruiters. 
He said that most recruiters want to spend individual time with every single student. If other students are continuously pushing their way forward, it shows that they “don’t really respect [their] fellow students ... and that’s going to decrease [their] chances.”
“What you really have to be able to do is distinguish yourself and explain what makes you different from the other students,” Maloney said. “[You may stand out because of] your extracurricular activities, something innovative that you did as part of one of the projects, a patent that you had gone ahead and filed — those are all things that CMU students have come up and told me over the past five years.”
One way in which students can hone in on their strengths and make recruiters notice them is by practicing and perfecting the art of a quick pitch, also known as an “elevator speech” or “30-second commercial.” The Job Fair Success Guide located in the Career Center provides detailed examples and a checklist that can be used to perfect your pitch and get across who you are in the shortest time possible. An online version of the Job Fair Success Guide also exists on the website of the Career Center.
The guide suggests, among other things, that an elevator pitch make connections to the student’s résumé, reflect a familiarity with the company, and sound normal rather than forced (practice is suggested, of course). “It is all about selling yourself and knowing what works best for you,” Collins said.
Maloney described some of his most memorable encounters with students who were hired in previous years. In one such case, a student came up to Maloney and explained why working with Cisco was her dream job. She then went on to describe how the work she was doing in college was relevant to the kind of work Cisco was doing. Maloney explained that the student’s knowledge of the company and her enthusiasm were two key factors that helped her get the job.
The last thing to keep in mind is the current condition of the job market. As Collins stated, students “are conscious of the need for experience.” He added that “all people are being more proactive [about employment] at all job fairs, not just the [EOC/]TOC/BOC.”
Such realities mean that one should not be discouraged if attending the job fair does not result in employment. By speaking with career counselors like Collins, students can uncover many different opportunities available beyond those present at the fairs.
Also, one should remember that each of the fairs has a different audience and appeals to different skill sets. 
Although Cisco does look for applicants with basic programming skills, Maloney mentioned that the company has recruited a number of non-traditional applicants as well. In the past, Cisco has recruited students ranging from first-years to graduates, as well as students who are not enrolled in traditional technical programs, such as biology majors. 
Maloney explained that  while technical skills are important, the enthusiasm and motivation of the applicants are even more 
important.
“They’ve got to be people that are self-motivated ... and really put forth the effort and try to go the extra step to make a difference,” Maloney said.

The Siebel Scholars Foundation announced the recipients of the annual Siebel Scholars awards. This program, which currently consists of nearly 870 Siebel Scholars, recognizes the most talented individuals of business, bioengineering, and computer science graduate schools across the country.
Each year, five graduate students from Carnegie Mellon are selected and awarded $35,000 for their last year of studies. This year’s Carnegie Mellon Siebel Scholars are Jason Koenig, Anuj Kumar, Gabriela Marcu, Ishan Misra, and Mrinmaya Sachan.
Koenig was a computer science major at Carnegie Mellon who graduated in five semesters. During his time as an undergraduate, he was a course assistant for Principles of Imperative Computation and did research with computer science professor and current head of the department of computer science, Frank Pfenning, on the researching aspects of the subset of the C programming language used in that course. Koenig also worked on the lunar rover project and interned twice at Microsoft. After graduating early, he interned at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, working on cybersecurity and formal methods. In August, he returned to Carnegie Mellon for a fifth-year master’s in computer science. On the topic of the Siebel Scholars, Koenig said, “It doesn’t just cover tuition. There is a pretty big community of former recipients, which looks to be a great resource.”
Kumar is a Ph.D. candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII). His research deals mainly with developing voice-user interfaces for atypical users, such as children, low-literate users, or speakers of minority languages. In the past, he has worked at Microsoft and IBM, as well as at the University of California, Berkeley, and the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad in India. 
He also served as a program committee member at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Intelligent User Interfaces conference, and as a reviewer at the Conference on Computing Factors in Computing Systems and MobileHCI. “More than the award itself, I think it’s the recognition and the community that I’m very excited to be part of,” Kumar said. “When I look at some of the alumni, especially their past research, where each of them have landed, and what they are doing currently, it’s a bit overwhelming, but at the same time tremendously motivating.”
Marcu is also a Ph.D. candidate in the HCII. Her research involves various fields, such as ubiquitous computing, applied sociology, and mental health. Throughout the past two years, she has led a 10-person research team studying behavioral data consumption and sharing among stakeholders in special education, conducted fieldwork in schools and homes, and developed a tablet-based data collection system and visual analysis tools through action research.
Misra is a master’s student in the Robotics Institute. After spending his undergraduate years exploring many different fields of computer science research — including theory of computation, databases, networking, operating systems, and computer vision — he found his passion working with object detection and scene detection, which are both important for systems in which robots encounter unknown objects. 
He is interested in pursuing a future in research and is currently debating between applying for a Ph.D. or looking for a job. “The ‘Siebel Scholar’ title feels really nice,” Misra said. “It is a unique scholarship with a really strong community of past scholars and faculty to it. Even though the scholarship lasts only for one year, the nurturing community stays with you.”
Sachan is currently a master’s student in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon. Before coming to Pittsburgh, he received his bachelor’s degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His past job experiences include interning at the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo and working in the Information Management group at IBM Research India. The main topic of his research involves understanding the structure of social networks and the flow of textual information to better understand interests and relationships among people. “It is indeed a pleasure to be part of the nice cohort of really smart and motivated people,” Sachan said.
All five of this year’s Siebel Scholars show the amount of dedication and intelligence required for the award. In a few years, they will become a part of the vast Siebel Scholars network, serving as mentors for future scholars from Carnegie Mellon.

Carnegie Mellon University’s chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), which has historically built and competed with gasoline-powered cars, is transitioning to electric vehicles (EV) in preparation for the second-annual Formula SAE Electric event in June. This event is the newest division in SAE International’s Formula SAE competition. According to the Formula SAE website, a team of mostly undergraduate engineering students must “conceive, design, fabricate, develop and compete with small, formula-style vehicles” before the competition date in June. The students will act as contractors and build their car according to a fictional customer’s specifications. At the event, they will be awarded points based on their design, cost, and business plans as well as the vehicle performance.
With regards to the team’s motivation to transition to the EV competition, preisdent of Carnegie Mellon’s SAE competition team Carnegie Mellon Racing (CMR), Michael Spinelli says, “Our goal is to show that Carnegie Mellon electrical engineering and electric vehicles is a winning combination… .We want to push the industry boundaries.” Indeed, pushing the boundaries of their own organization with the introduction of electrical and computer systems in the formerly pure mechanical design has made them reach out to other engineering disciplines.
Electric power and gas power differ in many ways. According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, one of the major differences is that while gasoline-powered vehicles have hundreds of moving parts, EVs have only one: the motor. Instead of an engine, it is the motor that produces the force to move an EV. Foot pedals that control cables for accelerating and breaking in a gasoline-powered car now only control an electrical output. Additionally, a battery that stores energy replaces the gas tank, the controller controls acceleration and speed instead of a carburetor, and other mechanical-electrical systems replace what used to be purely mechanical systems.
To help with the design and programming of these systems, CMR has recruited  more electrical engineers than it ever has done. One person that joined the team as a result is Omar Skalli, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering double major, and the system leader for the accumulator (the battery). During their weekly general body meeting last Friday, Skalli began training members on how to safely collect data from the lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells. “Charge too little, they blow up,” he explained. “Charge too much, they blow up. So safety is of the upmost concern.”
Accumulator testing will take place at Carnegie Mellons’s ChargeCar garage for gasoline-to-electric vehicle conversion on Forbes Avenue. Eventually, they plan to evaluate most of the 100 or so battery cells while they construct their 80-plus cell battery pack.
With its new electric motor that should be able to exert up to 4,000 pounds of force, the car will theoretically reach a maximum speed of 120 mph. An attribute of motors’ high power-to-weight ratio is that they allow EVs to accelerate much faster than traditional cars; CMR is expecting its newest vehicle to be able to travel 75 meters from rest in only 3.7 seconds. Drivers selected from within the team can expect to experience up to two Gs of lateral force.
When asked about the one thing he would like people to know about CMR, Spinelli said that the greatest selling point of SAE is the real engineering. 
Brian Tang, the unsprung mass system leader and mechanical engineering master’s student, agrees. “It’s just good hands-on experience that lets you have full control over what you’re doing. There’s nothing restricting you from designing it however you want. It gives you the responsibility and the opportunity to test your skills,” Tang said. At CMR, this is especially true. “Right now,” he said, “there are not that many teams [in the EV competition], and it would be cool to set the standard. It’s like a new frontier.”
As the team begins to enter the manufacturing stage of the car, they must continue to work hard to stick to their timeline. If they remain on schedule, the car will begin rolling in the Morewood Gardens parking lot on Dec. 2. However, another exciting date comes sooner; registration opens next week and the car, known tentatively as “XXE” will receive its registration number from Formula SAE.
For the mechanical purists, all is not lost. In addition to their work on the electric vehicle, the team will continue to repair and run some gasoline-powered cars from previous years. Although these cars will not compete, having them running will provide valuable resources for driver training and data collection.

Most students at Carnegie Mellon have used, or at least heard of, open-source software. Examples of such software include the browser Firefox and the mobile operating system Android. Open-source software, in most basic terms, makes its code publicly available for modification and distribution by users. Proponents believe that creating an open community of programmers who modify software for their own uses provides the best possible experience for users, allowing them to customize according to their own needs.
One of the common misconceptions about open-source software is that it’s hard to make money using it. After all, since the code is distributed freely and can be modified by any user, why would anyone spend money on it? However, according to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), there are many ways to make money from open-source software. Groups can offer maintenance services related to the code, or license the trademark to make money from the code they write. The OSI is a nonprofit organization that creates a set of standards for open-source software.
The fact that open-source software can be used for commercial purposes is one of the main differences between “open software” and “free software,” which some people use interchangeably. Richard Stallman, a big proponent of free software, summarized the difference between the two in an article on gnu.org: “Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.” 
According to him, open- source focuses on developing the best possible version of software by harnessing the power of many developers creating many different versions of the software. However, free software is distributed at no charge with the code publicly available and with special attention paid to the ethics behind the software. For example, malicious software to track a user’s computer usage could be considered open-source as long as the code is made publicly available. However, that malicious software would not be considered free because it doesn’t respect the user’s right to privacy while using a computer.
According to an article published by Harvard Business School, there are many reasons programmers choose to work on open-source projects on their own time, even when they don’t derive financial benefits from such projects. These projects let programmers create custom versions of software that work well for their particular usage. Programmers are also used to working with this type of software from their student days, and many choose to continue working on such projects into their careers.
Working on a big open-source project is a good way to gain experience in a real-world coding environment, which many programmers value. Since open-source is transparent, it’s also easier for programmers to measure their progress against others; in corporate projects, it’s often hard to tell who worked on what.
A report by development-testing company Coverity found that open-source software has quality on par with that of proprietary software. That makes sense, considering the passion and talents of the many programmers who work on such projects. Many users take advantage of such products and are grateful for their price and quality.

Numbers set for climate change
The U.N. Climate Panel officially established a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions last Friday, which if not adhered to, could result in irreversible climate change. The panel found that once global temperatures rise more than 3.6˚F above that of preindustrial times, we will begin to witness the most dangerous effects of climate change. To keep below this level, no more than one trillion metric tons of greenhouse gases can be burned and emitted into the atmosphere. According to calculations by Myles R. Allen of the University of Oxford, this limit will be exhausted by 2040.

No sleep may lead to development of chronic conditions
According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the inability to sleep soundly may be linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, anxiety, and obesity in adults 45 and older. According to M. Safwan Badr of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, obtaining seven to nine hours of sleep is crucial to reaping the health benefits of sleep, particularly for those with chronic conditions. For this reason, Badr recommends that adults with chronic diseases who suffer from sleep disorders should undergo treatment, as resolving their sleep issues could significantly alleviate their symptoms.

Increasing amount of debris hazardous for space station
Human-induced pollution has recently extended beyond the boundaries of Earth. The probes, rockets, and satellites sent into space over the past few decades have accumulated into hundreds of thousands of pieces of fast moving debris. The international space station and its crew have come into multiple close encounters with this debris within the past few years. Because of its fast orbital speed, as little as one centimeter of this debris could destroy a spacecraft. Although the risk of the debris falling to Earth and doing any damage is relatively low, the collecting debris continues to pose a threat to the international space station.

Algorithm may be behind biological phenomena
Algorithms are the fundamentals of modern technology, but Probably Approximately Correct, a book by Leslie Valiant of Harvard University’s computer science department, suggests that their importance dates back much further. Valiant claims that algorithms permeate most aspects of biology, including evolution. 
Valiant argues that if the mutation of species occurred at random, then natural selection would have occurred at a much slower rate. He concludes that it is more likely that natural selection is supplemented by biological algorithms that help organisms adapt to their environment more efficiently.

Possible delay for rover proposals
NASA recently put out an open call for scientists to submit proposals suggesting science and technology instruments that will be put on the next Mars Rover, originally scheduled to depart in 2020. The goal of the new rover will be to find evidence of life suggested by Curiosity, and to test technologies that may one day enable humans to land and live on Mars. However, the Nov. 15 deadline for proposals may be delayed if the government is still shut down during this time period.

Centipede venom may fight pain
New research on mice show that a venom found in centipedes may eliminate pain as effectively as morphine. Researchers injected mice with the isolated compound, called Ssm6a, and found that the mice had fewer signs of pain when subjected to stimuli. The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Ssm6a works by blocking a pain channel in the body. Because the pain channel is in the periphery nervous system, drugs that block it would not cause side effects such as dizziness and drowsiness.

The 2013 VIA Music & New Media Festival, a week-long showcase of contemporary art, music, and lectures, occurred this past week from Tuesday to Sunday. VIA is a Pittsburgh-based creative collective founded in 2010 that produces year-round series of performances — but VIA’s biggest event is the festival, drawing artists from local Pittsburgh musicians to performers from Bulgaria and Berlin. VIA takes much pride in its integration with the Pittsburgh community, collaborating with the city in various ways, such as by taking over previously abandoned buildings for performances and exhibitions. VIA’s love for Pittsburgh is evident in the amount of work, planning, and dedication that must go into developing a festival with the wide variety of artists and performers seen in the past week.
Friday A / V Showcase
The street that hosted Friday’s A / V showcase was very dark, but the venue itself featured glass windows that revealed a bright white room and colors bouncing through from the darker rooms. Walking in, visitors could step onto a green platform run by TechShop, a business whose members can use tools like 3-D imaging and laser printers. TechShop took 3-D images of visitors that were then made into avatars, which were used in the art throughout the night.
The first dark room featured the musicians performing on a stage boundried by translucent screens. DJ Yung Moth and hip-hop collaboration Banjee Report, who shared the stage, were incredibly different, yet the room molded itself to accommodate them both. All of the musicians were flanked by a piece called “#h3DSpace-Greenscreen,” a collaboration between many groups — including TechShop and the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama — and video interludes by Casey Jane Ellison x Miss Daddie.
Yung Moth was a minimalist performer, an introvert on stage. She delivered what might have been a very flat performance if not for the moving images surrounding her. Yung Moth allowed her audiences to listen, taking a back seat to the art. There were wiggling worms made out of stomachs and an avatar dancing to a picture frame. The images were bizarre and somewhat random but exciting.
Banjee Report connected more with the crowd. While Yung Moth let the art wash over her — the projector literally covered her with images — Report moved and worked more in conjunction with the videos around them. Banjee was very high-energy, and its members were really quite good rappers. Especially captivating was the way they moved and danced around stage: As a group, they made a lot of strong images that worked well with the art around them. The green colors, the skulls, and even the profile of an elderly man that surrounded them worked with their gritty style.
Between the performances, an artist came through with an arcade game strapped to his back — a custom VIA game that involved moving a ball through different pieces of art.
In the next room was a collection of video works called Acid Rain Reflux. This piece used a combination of many media: digital video, cartoons, videos of real people, interviews, clips from movies, and occasionally pieces of text. Often a few were combined in one frame. For example, one piece showed a real girl moving through digital flowers. The text served as titles, summations, or just messages like “shine on you crzy diamond” or “Own this.”
These displays featured music, some vocal and other instrumental; most notably, there was a track of different intensities of the same pitch. At times it could hardly be heard, while other times it shook the metal tubes on the ceiling, the vibrations ear-crushingly intense. An avatar was projected on the opposite wall, her look bashful as she moved in distinct and unsettling ways: Watching the other wall, one could feel her staring.
A large conference room showed a video reel of a few different artists. These videos felt one-dimensional, and everyone moved through this room quickly. The atmosphere of the night was not patient, and the videos were repetitive and took a long time to build. They seemed too simple amid the energy of the other rooms.
The venue was untidy around the edges, but in a way that did not detract from the illusions of the night. The venue served the display well because the rooms flowed into each other and the dim lighting made every step seem adventurous and every shock to the senses very effective. A faint blue light illuminated everything, and wire fencing covered empty rooms and walls. Seats were available, but everyone just kept moving, sensing an urgency to move on to the next room. Everywhere, there was something new.
Saturday A / V Showcase
Saturday’s A / V showcase began much like it did Friday night — the popup venue came in the form of the former Family Resources building on Baum Boulevard. Because Vessel, one of the night’s performers, was delayed in Mexico City, the set times were reshuffled.
Local Pittsburgh performer Trogpite opened the performances with his intelligent-dance-music-influenced hard techno, a mid-energy performance that greeted arriving concertgoers with a chill, visual introduction to the night.
The night really kicked off with the Detroit-based duo ADULT., which consists of Nicola Kuperus on vocals and Adam Lee Miller mixing. Their infectious distorted synth-pop worked the audience into a sweaty, dancing frenzy, and ADULT. had no qualms about audience interaction. Kuperus slid off the stage and wove her way through the crowd, dancing with people. Upon returning to the stage, she wryly summed up the entire VIA experience: “You guys are such good dancers, but seriously very sweaty and hot.” Near the end of their set, a random audience member hopped onstage and danced by himself, prompting the perplexed but amused Kuperus to remark on his flexibility while Miller laughed to the side. Their set remained on the same high-energy level until they thanked their audience and disappeared from the stage.
Up next was Vessel, fresh and excited despite his delay in Mexico City earlier that day. He followed ADULT.’s more danceable set with an intricately textured and multilayered house-inspired performance. The visuals, which took a backseat during ADULT., came back in full force with Vessel, thanks in part to a screen between the stage and the audience that allowed for another layer of projections to emerge. His set gave the audience a much-needed break from dancing and an opportunity to explore the other rooms of the venue, which featured independent art, film projects, and a jousting competition with multicolored flashlights instead of swords.
After Vessel’s set, the energy picked back up with the Bulgarian DJ KiNK. The sweat that evaporated in the hour that Vessel played returned with a vengeance thanks to the high-energy, beat-heavy dance music KiNK introduced to the venue. KiNK himself was a joyous performer, taking short breaks from mixing on his computer to pump his fists in the air and greet the audience with a wide grin that did nothing to hide how thrilled he was to play. His show combined two elements of the sets before — vigorously energetic music like that of ADULT. and the visual-heavy performance of Vessel — into a wholly unique and thrilling set.
As KiNK’s set came to a close around 2:30 a.m., the hordes of people who had attended events all week and danced all evening started to peel away to catch a much-needed break. The final performer, Berlin-based Hunee, played to a smaller, lower-energy crowd, which allowed for a more intimate set as the night wore on. The venue closed at 4 a.m., but the night didn’t end there — those who were still in the mood to dance could go to the Men’s Room afterparty at Hot Mass to dance until 7 a.m. and watch the sun rise.
VIA as a whole pushes boundaries and reinvents what it means to make art. It’s nothing short of a blessing that the experience continues yearlong, and it doesn’t end with the festival. VIA provides more than just a week (and a year) of good shows — their gift to their audience is the fierce sense of Pittsburgh pride that permeates every venue, exhibition, and performance.

”The whole town’s talking witchcraft! They’ll be callin’ us witches, Abby!”
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama opened its 2013–14 season on Friday with the American classic, The Crucible. Directed by Carnegie Mellon faculty member and alumnus Tony McKay (A’69), the show features a strong cast led by senior acting major Brian Muller with a deeply moving performance as antihero John Proctor. The Crucible grabs your attention and holds it tight until long after the house lights have gone up.
Written in response to the Joseph McCarthy scares of the 1950s, during which countless careers in entertainment and elsewhere were cut short by accusations of Communist leanings and intent to sabotage the American way of life, Arthur Miller’s classic The Crucible tackles head-on the horrific consequences of what happens when humans get caught up in the fervor of groupthink. Taking the story of a literal witch hunt as inspiration — the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 — Miller lays bare what exactly hysteria and wildly pointing fingers can lead to. In this case, it leads to the death of numerous innocent people whose word was simply too weak against that of their accuser.
John Proctor is a respected farmer who, unbeknownst to the pious Puritans of Salem, has had sexual relations with his former servant girl Abigail Williams, played by senior acting major Taylor Rose. When Abigail and her friends are caught dancing naked in the woods by her uncle, Reverend Samuel Parris (senior acting major Jimmy Nicholas), one of them takes fright and goes into a stupor that is mistaken for a bewitching. Parris’s suspicions balloon into a murmur of witchcraft that continues to grow as each of the girls begins claiming that they were bewitched in order to avoid trouble for breaking strict Puritan law.
As names continue to pour forth from the mouths of the girls, the residents of Salem have cause to watch all they do lest they are accused of witchcraft by a neighbor who covets their land or wishes to settle some long-standing score. All defense before the court is worthless; the accused are deemed false in all they say unless it be a confession of their crimes and a list of further names to be accused, in which case they are spared the guaranteed death penalty that comes with the crime of witchcraft.
Abigail, sensing the power she now holds in accusing her neighbors of witchery, decides to use her newfound saintly status to accuse Proctor’s wife Elizabeth, played by senior acting major Bridget Peterson, of conspiring with the devil so that she may finally fulfill her dream of being with John Proctor. Proctor, realizing this, tries to mount a defense against Abigail and her lying followers, but finds that the truth is not so well received when it causes men to realize they have been fooled.
The Crucible perfectly combines an intense and gripping plot with equally interesting characters, providing a highly entertaining spectacle as well as provoking thought. The cast is fantastic, especially senior acting major John Stoker’s portrayal of Reverend Hale, a man who comes to Salem riding high on the power of the word of God and finally leaves broken and questioning all that he had previously poured his life into. Senior acting major Thomas Moore’s portrayal of Judge Danforth perfectly exhibits the kind of blind stoicism that this supreme man of the law is supposed to show. Mary Warren, the poor girl who spends much of the play trying to navigate the murky waters between right and wrong, is given a great shot of life by senior musical theater major Mary Nepi. Mary’s moments of mental anguish, many of which involve breaking down into hopeless tears in the face of Abigail’s immense power, are riveting to say the least.
The stage design lends itself greatly to the overall mood of the play. Long columns representing trees surround the raised wooden platform on which much of the action takes place, with the black of the rear of the stage suggesting an endless dark forest. This effect drove home the isolation and, above all, the fear that the people of Salem had of what may have been lurking among the trees in this strange land. 
In addition, throughout much of the play, villagers could be seen silently sitting against the trees, paying close attention to the words being spoken. In this forest, you had better watch what you say; in the Puritan village — as in the social media outlets of today — someone is always behind a tree listening.
The Crucible is a play that, when done well, can be near the most riveting thing one can see on stage. I confess that being exposed to it when I was 14 years old was what showed me that acting and the theater could do a lot more than merely provide entertainment. The first scene is one long fuse that slowly builds up to an explosion. By the end, the show has driven its characters into having to choose between their principles and their lives in an atmosphere where doing what is inherently right brings condemnation. The accused are forced to answer the question: Which is more valuable, your life or your good name?
The Crucible will be playing at the Philip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center for the Arts through Sunday. Tickets can be purchased at the box office.

As you approach the Carnegie Museum of Art, one of the first things you’ll notice is what appears to be a gathering of brown sticks draped in brightly colored paper.
This attraction welcomes visitors to Carnegie International the Carnegie Museum of Art’s newest exhibition, featuring 35 artists from 19 different countries. In addition to bringing world cultures to Pittsburgh, the Carnegie International exhibition brings new perspectives to both history and moments in everyday life.
The exhibition premiered Friday night with a private gala and continued throughout the opening weekend with other festivities, including performances from the artists themselves. Scattered throughout the museum are pieces labeled “2013 Carnegie International,” indicating their introduction to the museum this year. In addition, some pieces are making reappearances from past Carnegie International exhibitions. Though this event may not be very organized, the culture brought by the pieces at this exhibition makes the visit worthwhile.
The first installation in the Carnegie International is a large sign, introducing the 35 artists who are part of the exhibition. Upstairs, another sign indicates that parts of the exhibition are located in the Scaife Galleries. This area, currently being celebrated for its recent renovation, displays modern pieces that highlight events from both present and past and put them in a new light. Particularly eye-catching is the work from Croatian conceptual artist Mladen Stilinovic. 
Also on display is an essay written by Stilinovic, interestingly titled “The Praise of Laziness.” But before you start calling this guy your new role model, realize that Stilinovic’s reason for praising laziness is that it produces great works of art — one of the new concepts introduced by the Carnegie International. A room whose walls are lined with dictionary pages that have the word “pain” scribbled next to each word, with the definition of the word lightened to the point where it was almost invisible, is yet another example of Stilinovic’s work on display.
Walking through the Modern and Contemporary Room, visitors are exposed to paintings and various works from different time periods, including Georges Rouault’s “The Old King.” The descriptions to the sides of the paintings are helpful, since what may seem like a painting of a king holding a flower is actually meant as a display of power contrasted with fragility. Another, simply titled “Hoeing,” is a depressing image of flat shapes against a dark background to show the struggles of the poor in the South.
Following the modern and contemporary artwork is the postwar abstraction room, featuring abstract pieces from artists such as Phyllida Barlow and Rodney Graham, who gave a musical performance on Saturday. Barlow’s featured piece at the Carnegie International is a tilted cube covered with a collage of multicolored shapes, which morph painting, sculpture, architecture, and object into one. Another set of interesting pieces is On Kawara’s “Today” paintings. On each painting are three different — apparently meaningless — dates painted in the same font. Ironically, his piece was supposed to show how every day is meaningful, and that every day should be remembered.
Another exhibit, called the Playground Project, though still a part of Carnegie International, is a refreshing change from the rest of the exhibition’s artwork: It features artwork from children who attended summer camp at the Carnegie Museum of Art among other playground art. 
Considering that it’s sitting right outside the museum, the piece most familiar to outsiders is the Lozziwurm, the orange and yellow tubes that sit outside the Carnegie Museum of Art. The structure was initially designed in 1972 by Swiss artist Yvan Pestalozzi and is still being created by the original Lozziwurm manufacturer, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In an effort to make the museum’s entrance appear friendlier, curators ordered one from the manufacturer and brought it to the museum as a playground for children. Interestingly enough, the Lozziwurm comes in a kit that can be assembled in a variety of ways, and has openings through which children can climb. The Lozziwurm, though placed outside, is still a part of the Playground Project; the rest is situated inside the museum.
The rest of the Playground Project exhibit might seem cute to some and creepy to others. Televisions showing videos of children at play are scattered throughout the exhibit, in addition to photos of unique and artistic playgrounds from around the world. The museum also displays some of the children’s artwork, and has arranged the pieces together to create something new. Though this section of the Carnegie International is somewhat strange, it is intriguing as well, especially the section in which children had to add shapes to a normal photograph, such as that of a building, in order to make it into a playground.
Though it may initially seem intimidating to have to find your own way through the exhibits featured in the Carnegie International, you will eventually get lost in the maze of art until returning to the beginning. Instead of confusing viewers with complex meanings, these pieces all have something to teach, or at least have something to say. The Carnegie International will be open until March 16, so there is time for everyone to see it.

Students, faculty, and even some children came to the Wean 7500 lecture hall last Thursday to hear “How to Read J.R.R. Tolkien,” a part of the Carol Brown Lecture Series sponsored by the English department. Giving the lecture was Michael D.C. Drout (DC’90), who currently teaches Old and Middle English, science fiction, and the works of Tolkien at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass. The lecture addressed the reasons why Tolkien works have remained a mainstay in popular culture, and Drout discussed the ways in which Tolkien managed to make parts of his works seem genuinely old.
Tolkien is “easy to read,” Drout said, “It’s part of popular culture, not literature.” When polled, a high percentage of readers claimed that reading Tolkien was a different experience than authors like James Joyce, because it did not require the same in-depth thought process.
Drout described how Tolkien uses the least knowledgeable character as the main point of view — for example, the hobbits in The Lord of the Rings — and what Drout calls the epistemic regime, in which characters make casual references to events and people that the main character and the reader do not understand. These elements work together to create the sensation that the reader and main character are sharing experiences and feelings.
Drout also discussed how Tolkien was able to create the impression that his works are part of a larger “textual tradition” by using broken references, which he compared to physical ruins. “Gaps and inconsistencies are the most interesting parts of a text,” he said, referring back to missing pages and sections from works like Beowulf, and pondering whether readers would enjoy these works as much if they understood every single reference.
The use of the least knowledgeable character, the epistemic regime, and the impression of a textual tradition all work together to “entwine the past and present together” and create a sense of nostalgia in Tolkien’s works. 
The textual tradition serves to distance the reader from the text and enforces the “absolute pastness of the past”; at the same time, the desire to understand it creates the “intense love for the unrecoverable past,” Drout said.
Drout seemed a natural lecturer, punctuating his discussion with jokes and anecdotes about his time here at Carnegie Mellon — he even managed to throw in a story about his booth-building days with Phi Kappa Theta. At times, he took on a more personal tone, emphasizing his close relationship with English department faculty — most significantly professor Peggy Knapp, whom he cites as the reason for his career focus. These casual references to his personal experiences circled back to his main points about nostalgia and cultural references.
The lecture was able to pinpoint aspects of the text and writing style that make Tolkien’s works enjoyable, without taking away the joy of reading — something that literary analysis often does. All you wanted to do at the end of the lecture was pick up one of the novels to really see how well Tolkien pulled off the sense that his stories were part of a larger cultural context.
Drout is the author and editor of six published works, as well as numerous articles, essays, and book contributions. He has also released audio recordings concerning language and literature.

After giving an artist lecture in McConomy Auditorium last Thursday, renowned contemporary Japanese artist Yasumasa Morimura showed his work in a retrospective solo exhibit titled Yasumasa Morimura: Theater of the Self, which opened last Friday night at the Andy Warhol Museum.
Walking the line between photography and performance art, Morimura’s work creates photographic reconstructions of famous people, paintings, and photographs, created through a combination of restaging the setting and creatively using Photoshop. What makes Morimura’s work unique, though, is that he himself becomes the subject within each image, so every piece is a self-portrait.
Walking into the gallery, there is a peculiar sensation that you are surrounded by different versions of Morimura’s face. The artwork is both the photograph and the creative performance that generated it, a process that often includes an entire restaging of the setting, elaborate stage makeup, and intricate costumes.
In this retrospective, Morimura’s work is categorized into three major series: Actors, Requiem, and Art History. Actors is a collection of photographs in which Morimura has taken on the role of famous actresses like Marilyn Monroe, playing with conventional gender roles and ideas of beauty.
From a similar but more historical standpoint, the series Art History restages famous European and American paintings, again with Morimura substituted in. An example is the “Mona Lisa: Pregnancy.” This version of the “Mona Lisa” is a play on the original in which Morimura as Mona Lisa is pregnant, with the fetus visible in a round stomach.
Requiem, Morimura’s most recent series, explores and comments on contemporary history by restaging famous photography. The focus here seems less on the individual and more on society, as Morimura takes on controversial figures from Hitler to Einstein.
By combining known imagery with his own, Morimura is able to subtly distort images and effectively challenge the viewer’s assumptions about what they are seeing. Morimura demonstrates how simple changes in context and subject can transform the way we view an image. Through his work, he is able to communicate ideas and explore the subject matter of identity, gender roles, and history. At times a little humorous, Morimura’s work is more provocative and beautiful than disturbing.
Yasumasa Morimura will be on display at the Andy Warhol Museum through Jan. 12.

Mahatma Gandhi is often attributed with saying, “Be the change you wish to see in the world.”
Taking inspiration from the life of Gandhi, Carnegie Mellon students from OM, a campus organization for Indian spirituality and culture, worked with the Pittsburgh nonprofit Moving the Lives of Kids Community Mural Project (MLK Mural) to create a mural of Gandhi on the side of Indian restaurant Coriander in Squirrel Hill on Sunday.
The mural is the grand finale to the Two Weeks of Peace and Gandhi’s birthday celebration that occurred all over campus through service projects, free hugs, lectures, and a screening of the film Gandhi in McConomy Auditorium.
“Initially we wanted to make it a service project by working with a student group, but we decided instead to make it an event for OM and CMU students to do to celebrate the end of Gandhi Week,” said sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani, who coordinated the mural painting.
The design for the mural was chosen through a contest by OM that sought submissions from talented Carnegie Mellon students. The winning design was submitted by senior art major Adelaide Cole, who was inspired by the intricacy of henna designs, the Indian art of ink-drawing on hands. Cole chose to use color symbolically, with orange fading into blue to symbolize the unity of people: She described orange as representative of the universal skin color, while blue is a symbol of peace.
MLK Mural is a Pittsburgh-based group of people who identify as both artists and community organizers. Through mural painting, they reach toward the goal of community progression by strengthening and bringing communities together.
A multifaceted organization, MLK Mural launches projects that range from working with youth groups, painting commissioned work. The organization also hosts a summer work program for at-risk teenagers to teach life skills such as collaboration in work settings. Muralist Kyle Holbrook of Wilkinsburg, Pa. started MLK Mural in 2007. It has since expanded to projects across the nation with offices in Pittsburgh, Miami, and Atlanta. Holbrook says, “The murals let people take pride in their neighborhoods. People will tell me how they change where they walk just to see the mural because it makes such a difference.”
Over the last six years, MLK Mural has created over 260 murals in Pittsburgh alone, including 13 this past summer. It’s an impressive feat, but more impressive is the number of young people that have been involved in the projects, which is well over 5,000.
A delicious lunch was provided by Coriander and a rough sketch of Gandhi was well under way — the energy grew as local kids and volunteers eagerly picked up paintbrushes to join the effort.
Editor's note: Adelaide Cole is a staff artist for The Tartan.

Writer Heather Sellers addressed a room full of avid listeners in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center on Monday — several of whom were friends, literary colleagues, and students she met in classes she had lectured in earlier that day. But as far as Sellers could tell, she could have been talking to a group of total strangers.
Sellers has prosopagnosia, or face blindness, a rare disorder that impairs the brain’s ability to recognize faces. Though her diagnosis came relatively recently, Sellers’s disorder has become a central topic in the work she has created since, including her memoir, You Don’t Look Like Anyone I Know.
Sellers was almost theatrical in her description of the disorder. Her distinctive sense of humor — purposefully spacey in tone yet still sharp and intelligent — kept listeners laughing and engaged throughout her presentation.
In the years before her diagnosis, Sellers knew something was wrong, but couldn’t quite identify the disconnect. Something finally clicked, however, when she stumbled across the words “face recognition” in a bookstore. After a number of doctor visits and tests, she at last had her diagnosis. While her reaction was in part relief, the biggest hurdle lay ahead: “coming out” to her friends and colleagues about her face blindness.
Delving into her personal trials with the disorder, Sellers discussed the disadvantages and even a few advantages to her condition. For the most part, prosopagnosia has presented a unique set of difficulties for her, inhibiting her socially and even costing her at least one close friendship.
But this disorder has also been somewhat advantageous, she says. Scientifically speaking, more attractive faces have more in common with each other — meaning that growing up, Sellers was always drawn to the social outcasts who were more distinctive in appearance, a quirkier group of people. As a result, Sellers reflected, she had a more interesting and diverse group of friends.
At one point, Sellers opened a copy of her memoir and read a passage in the same theatrical voice she used to discuss face blindness: She adopted a friend’s deep Southern drawl as she recreated her “coming out” as face blind over the phone to him. Her dramatic flair, both literary and vocal, kept her audience riveted and entertained.
While the topic of prosopagnosia is fascinating — and Sellers spoke about it engagingly and eloquently — it was somewhat disappointing that so many of the questions from the audience addressed her face blindness rather than her craft. Despite the exhaustive questions, Sellers answered each with clear enthusiasm, making an effort to immerse her listeners in her own experiences with face blindness.
Between Sellers’s dynamism as a speaker and her energetic sense of humor, the talk could easily have continued for double its allotted time. After the reading, curious audience members flocked to Sellers as they waited for refreshments to arrive.

Dear Ryan & Matt,
My roommate’s parents came to visit over the weekend. Somehow they got my number and friended me on Facebook and now they’re always texting me and chatting me asking how I am and how classes are going and if I need anything. I asked my roommate how often he hears from them, and he said maybe once a month. I’m kinda creeped out. How do I handle this?
Sincerely,
A Doted On, Parents Too Eagerly Demonstrative
Dear ADOPTED,
That is seriously one messed-up situation. Are you sure they aren’t evil witches in disguise or something? Have they invited you over to their place for Thanksgiving and/or winter break? If so, they could be planning on having you as the roast beast. Ask your roommate if he’s had friends disappear in the past, particularly around times when his family has eaten a very large meal. If you trust your roommate, then brave a trip to his home because, hey, that’s what friends do. Just know that they could be playing you to get a taste of your sweet, sweet human flesh.
On the other hand, you totally don’t have to be nice to them. They’re not your parents after all.
Have you ever tried Soylent Green? It is delicious.
Ryan & Matt
Dear Ryan & Matt,
Every night since last Thursday I’ve been forced to sleep on a friend’s floor because my roommate has been with some new guy. Last night, I went to the bathroom, and when I got back the door was locked! I can take a hint, but this is getting crazy. When does it end?
Help,
Every Night Obliging Uncouth Girl Having Sexual Encounters… XTREME
Dear ENOUGH SEX,
I feel for you; there was one time in Vegas…. Wait, I don’t know if I can go into details. The most important thing is not to freak out. Don’t retaliate violently, unless of course you come back and your bed is the one messed up. Be gracious, and you are liable to be afforded the same respect later on. I recommend thanking the hallmates who hosted you, possibly with baked goods. People love chocolate, and maybe they will help you sexile your roommate once or twice.
You’re sure your roommate didn’t just forget that sock on the door?
Ryan & Matt

Carnegie Mellon released its annual Security and Fire Safety Report last Tuesday. The document — emailed to the campus community by University Police Chief Tom Ogden — describes the current safety and fire policies, provides emergency resources for students, and details crime and fire statistics.
The release of this report complies with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crimes Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires the university to publish crime and fire statistics from the past three years by Oct. 1 of each year.
The report provides details on how members of the Carnegie Mellon community can contact police and emergency services, the location of police crime logs, the location of emergency phones on campus, as well as many other resources regarding crime and fire safety.
Regarding crime statistics, the report mentions that “Under the Clery Act, ‘Professional Counselors,’ such as the counselors in CAPS, are not considered to be campus security authorities when acting in their professional capacity and are not required to report crimes for inclusion into the annual disclosure of crime statistics.”
“The department’s crime prevention strategy… relies on the dual concepts of eliminating or minimizing criminal opportunities, whenever possible, and encouraging community members to take responsibility for their own and others’ safety,” the report continues.
In the reported crime statistics, the most prominent crime was burglary. There were 25 documented cases of burglary in 2012, compared with 21 in 2011 and 13 in 2010.
“Thefts have historically been part of life in an open environment,” Ogden said about the high number of burglaries. Ogden attributes the higher number to increased reporting of crime. “We’re seeing a lot more people who normally wouldn’t report thefts reporting,” he said. 
Ogden went on to describe that the university has partnered with the University of Pittsburgh to track down thieves, and is using plainclothes officers and cameras to catch perpetrators. He described one incident where Pitt sent pictures of two people who had been stealing from their locker rooms; the two were located and apprehended on Carnegie Mellon’s campus that afternoon stealing from the locker rooms in the University Center.
“We’re making good progress on the recent laptop thefts, and have made three arrests,” Ogden added.
The most striking increase was in the number of “forcible” sex offenses, which spiked to 15 last year, compared with five in 2011 and one in 2010.
The report noted, “In 2012, there were 15 separate forcible sex offense incidents. Due to duplicate reporting to different law enforcement agencies, there were 17 total reports (i.e. two incidents were counted twice). In addition, the forcible sex offense statistics for 2011 have been amended to add 1 on campus incident in a residence facility.”
Ogden remarked that “we’re seeing a steady increase in reporting [of forcible sexual offenses] nationwide. Sex assault is one of the most underreported crimes.”
He described that the victim works closely with counseling, student activities, and the police to decide the course of action to take. “The victim, with a lot of support, makes the decision,” he said. 
As with the burglaries, Ogden thinks that the higher number of sexual assaults in the report come from increased reporting rather than an increase in crime. “I don’t think there’s [been] a dramatic increase in sexual assaults, but there’s been an increase in reporting.”
In response to concerns about sexual assault, the annual report provides contact information for programs such as Rape Aggression Defense (RAD) and Self-Defense Awareness & Familiarization Exchange (SAFE). RAD is “designed specifically for women” and is described in the report as “a nationally recognized twelve-hour course that teaches women the skills that can help prevent or survive a violent attack.” The report also notes that “in partnership with the Athletic Department, the University Police Department also offers RAD as a 3-unit course to all registered students.”
SAFE is a “nationally recognized educational awareness program that provides teenage and adult women with information that may reduce their risk of exposure to violence and introduces them to the physical aspects of self-defense,” the report says.
SAFE is offered as a two -hour course on a by-request basis to small groups on campus.
The report also notes that last year there were 42 liquor law arrests, 17 disciplinary actions with respect to liquor laws, 10 drug law arrests, 73 disorderly conduct charges, and 17 cases of vandalism.
Ogden spoke of the $30,000 grant the university received from the Liquor Control Board to educate and curb liquor law violations. The grant — which was awarded to Jason Hendershot, a sergeant in the Carnegie Mellon University Police — will be used to begin a two-year alcohol education and enforcement program called Realize Alcohol Influences Decision making, or RAID.
There were four fires recorded on campus in 2012, three of which were unintentional and attributed to cooking, and one which occurred in a trash can in Morewood E-Tower.
Rick Caruso, fire safety manager for Carnegie Mellon’s environmental health and safety department, confirmed by email that “there have been no major changes to the university’s fire policy since the last Security and Fire Report was issued.”
Alex Frantz, a sophomore drama major and resident assistant in Morewood Gardens, said, “As an RA, I am familiar with the Annual Security and Fire report. It is a resource that we were familiarized with during training.”
Frantz added that “the contact list provided at the bottom of the sheet is a really good snapshot of just some of the resources available. I would say that all students should have these numbers programmed into their phones, just because you never know what you will need when. Probably the most important of these [numbers] is the campus police.”
“I’m only concerned because everybody here is so busy,” Ogden said with respect to nonemergency reporting. 
Ogden is worried that students put off bringing up issues, rather than informing the police as soon as they occur. In the case of an emergency, Ogden urged students not to hesitate to call University Police. “Just call. You’re not bothering us.”
The 2013 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report can be viewed and downloaded from http://www.cmu.edu/police/images/2013asr.pdf.

Carnegie Mellon students gathered on the Cut Friday night to participate in Carnegie Mellon’s Relay For Life, organized by the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Colleges Against Cancer.
Relay For Life is a fundraising walk to raise money for the American Cancer Society, held overnight to show that cancer never sleeps. The event is meant to celebrate the lives of survivors, remember those who have been lost to cancer, and to fight back against the disease. Over 5,200 communities in 20 different countries hold their own Relay For Life event each year. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Relay For Life kicked off at 7 p.m. with the opening ceremony, and welcomed senior international relations and politics major and president of Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Colleges Against Cancer Gabby DePasquale along with senior professional writing major and Relay For Life chair Raina Bradford-Jennings. Junior global studies major Emma Livne followed with an emotional and inspiring speech about her battle with acute myeloid leukemia this past year and finding “strength in the embrace of others.”
Over 300 people on 27 teams participated in the event, setting up tents on the Cut and walking laps on the surrounding paths. Campus organizations such as clubs, sororities, and fraternities were present, raising money through online donations, sponsorships, fundraisers, and the sale of items such as popcorn, apple cider, cookies, and handmade jewelry.
“I think it’s great that so many organizations on campus are getting involved in one cause,” said first-year economics and statistics major Theo Peterson.
DePasquale also appreciated the support from other campus organizations. “We are honestly so thankful for everyone who has come out; we couldn’t have asked for a better turnout. Everyone has been so amazing,” she said.
The night was filled with events and entertainment, including a team captain relay race, dodgeball tournament, limbo competition, and yoga, as well as performances by Dancers’ Symposium, Chak de Bhangra, a cappella groups including Joyful Noise and Counterpoint, and various other Carnegie Mellon organizations. 
“It’s fun; it’s a really great experience” said senior chemical engineering major Lizzy Ha.
During the somber Luminaria Ceremony, paper bags decorated with the names of those who have fought cancer were placed around the path. Each bag represented one person and was lit from within by a candle or glow stick.
“These candles represent love and respect for those who have battled cancer,” said first-year electrical and computer engineering major and luminaria chair Celeste Neary. Participants took a silent lap to remember those who have been lost to cancer.
So far, Carnegie Mellon’s Relay For Life has raised $16,330 for the American Cancer Society, and will continue to fundraise until Dec. 31. Last year, the event raised a total of approximately $24,000.
“This campus has really just shown its support tonight, and we are really, really appreciative and humbled,” Bradford-Jennings said.
Colleges Against Cancer will continue raise money and awareness throughout the year.
“We do smaller events throughout the year to get cancer education more present on our campus,” Bradford-Jennings said.

Carnegie Mellon community members gathered in Rangos Hall last Monday to voice cycling issues and concerns to Lou Fineberg, program director of Bike Pittsburgh. Bike Pittsburgh, a nonprofit advocacy organization, aims to create a bike-friendly culture and infrastructure in Pittsburgh.
Participants raised a multitude of concerns including the safety and efficacy of bike lanes, how best to address aggressive driving, the practice of taking versus sharing lanes, and pollution.
Bike lanes, though widely believed to be a sanctuary for cyclists on busy thoroughfares, often instill an attitude in drivers that if bike lanes are available bikes must not be on the road. 
Unsafe bike lanes, like those that have now been removed from Liberty Avenue, compound safety issues for bikers who choose the street over dangerous bike lanes. In response to these concerns, Fineberg underscored that Pittsburgh is still “really in the infancy of bike improvements” and suggested that concerned citizens write letters to city and state governments to address both poorly placed bike lanes and their marked absence on many busy streets.
Fineberg offered concrete strategies to ease the aggressive driving characteristic of Pittsburgh’s car-dominated transportation culture. Fineberg advocated that cyclists faced with aggressive driving should call 311 or even 911 in extreme cases.
“People who use their car as a weapon should have 911 called on them,” Fineberg explained. Fineberg also spoke of starting social media campaigns to raise awareness about the perils of aggressive driving for cyclists and pedestrians.
The practice of taking as opposed to sharing lanes is unfamiliar to many drivers. However, state traffic laws grant cyclists the right to take an entire lane if there are two lanes running in the same direction. Fineberg advised that cyclists “make conscious decisions as often as they can,” and that cyclists take a lane whenever the opportunity presents itself. 
He counseled cyclists to consider what is “the safest I can be” and let that serve as the standard for navigating car-cyclist relationships. 
Several participants also discussed the potential health consequences of exposure to exhaust pollution during cardiovascular activity. Although some researchers assert that exhaust poses equal risk to drivers, Fineberg countered with studies by Athletes United and Scientific American, which found adverse effects of cardiovascular activity in polluted environments. 
He also proposed Bike Pittsburgh’s Better Bikeways Vision, which would distance bikers from exhaust emissions as a possible solution. In the short term, Fineberg reminded participants that, “as long as it’s not a business district, you are allowed to ride on the sidewalk.” He also noted that a small number of cyclists have taken to wearing face masks during their commute to protect themselves from exhaust fumes.
The discussion also briefly touched on pedestrian-cyclist relationships — a subject of particular interest to Carnegie Mellon students who choose walking as their means of transportation on campus. Pedestrians question the presence of bicyclists on campus walkways.
“This campus is small enough — students do not need to bike down walkways to make a 10-minute passing period. Bicyclists on walkways endanger students on foot,” first-year chemical engineering major Sage Yort said.
First-year electrical and computer engineering major and avid bicyclist Maya Lassiter advocated for students who want to ride their bikes to class. “As a cyclist, I would like to see the school establish separate bike lanes and pedestrian pathways,” she said. 
Bike Pittsburgh’s forum offered an opportunity for concerned cyclists to discuss their budding presence in a largely car-dominated transportation culture, as well as advice and resources for experienced riders and students who may be considering joining the wheeled ranks of Pittsburgh’s cyclists. 
Fineberg is optimistic about establishing biking culture in Pittsburgh. He believes that the success of such a  culture depends largely on the implementation of bike-sensitive city planning, such as the inclusion of properly placed bike lanes.

Students and faculty gathered in Rangos Hall to learn how to make their mobile devices more secure and learn about mobile device security from several different cell phone vendors last Wednesday.
The Information Security Office (ISO) hosted the exhibition of mobile device security. According to their website, the ISO “collaborates with the campus community to protect Carnegie Mellon from and to respond to threats to our electronic information resources and computing and networking infrastructure.”
The ISO is focusing on mobile device security to honor October’s National Cyber Security Awareness Month.
According to a campus-wide email sent out by the ISO advertising the event, for the first time, a majority of Americans have smartphones — 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. The email read, “Cybercriminals are now targeting these devices to steal data and commit fraud.”
The event, which lasted six hours, featured tables set up by several prominent cell phone carriers and software security companies, including T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, and Symantec.
Nancy Zuzak, a senior advantage program representative at T-Mobile, said that the event aimed to teach students how to make their smartphones more secure. “What we were invited to do today was help the students and the faculty understand ways to address mobile security on their smartphones.”
T-Mobile, Zuzak said, recently launched more security features for its devices. Zuzak also highlighted some basic safety tips, such as protecting smartphones with a password and using applications that can alert the user to a phone’s location if it’s lost or stolen. 
“It could be something as simple as using an application called LookOut, which is a free application, so you can find your smartphone. We also highlighted that one of the best practices is to password protect your device,” Zuzak said.
Dennis Csordas, a business development manager for T-Mobile, mentioned an application that users can install on their phones that “takes a picture of the person trying to unlock your phone and sends it to you in an email. And if you lose it, it makes a siren sound.” 
Even if a mobile device user just loses his or her phone between couch cushions, Csordas said, an application like this can save time and effort by broadcasting the phone’s location via GPS and with noise. 
The ISO also provides mobile device security tips on its website. It recommends, for example, that users password-protect their devices, report lost and stolen devices, regularly back up data, and follow safe cell phone disposal practices.
The ISO even recommends installing antivirus software on mobile devices. “Mobile devices can be just as susceptible to viruses as desktop computers,” according to the ISO website. “This is new terrain for hackers but industry analysts expect viruses, Trojans, spam, and all manner of scams to grow as the mobile device market grows.”
Some students don’t worry about mobile device security due in part to the efforts of the ISO.
“I feel it’s pretty secure, especially on CMU campus. It’s a secure area; our school is technologically advanced. So, it’s not something I really worry about,” said sophomore biology and psychology major Leslie Tay.
Carnegie Mellon’s University Police were also at the event; officers registered students’ laptops so that if they were ever lost or stolen University Police would have the the serial number.
“We take the serial number down, and we mark on the back in invisible pen. That way we have it on file if your laptop’s ever stolen or lost,” said Michael Ufheil, a member of the Carnegie Mellon University Police’s Crime Prevention Unit. “We can check either with local pawn shops, or, if City of Pittsburgh Police come in contact with it, they know to check with us, and that way they’ll see that it’s from Carnegie Mellon and they’ll get a hold of us and we’ll get a hold of you,” he continued. 
The event featured talks throughout the day about mobile security from many of the attendees, including Apple, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Google Glass.

The officer observed that the male student was unsteady on his feet, and determined that he was intoxicated and in need of minor medical attention. The student was taken to the hospital, and later cited for underage drinking.
Hit and Run 
Sept. 30, 2013
University Police responded to an incident on Frew Street after a male reported that his vehicle, while legally parked on Frew Street, was struck between 5:30 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. There was damage to the left side of the victim’s vehicle; however, the officers and the victim could not determine who had struck the black sedan. If anyone has pertinent information, please contact University Police.
Saxophone Theft 
Oct. 2, 2013
A student summoned University Police to Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall about a theft. The victim stated that he had secured his saxophone in a vestibule in a first floor classroom in the building at 8 p.m. on Sept. 30. When he returned at 1 a.m. last Tuesday, his saxophone was gone. This investigation is ongoing.
Public Drunkenness 
Oct. 4, 2013 
University Police responded to the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Devon Road just after midnight last Friday after receiving a report of a nude male lying in the road. Upon arriving, police confirmed that the male was nude and not a Carnegie Mellon affiliate. The male, who the police confirmed was intoxicated, was transported to the hospital by city medics and will be cited for open lewdness as well as public drunkenness.

Ex Officio Report
At this week’s Senate meeting, Amy Burkert, vice provost for education, and Janel Sutkus, director of institutional research and analysis, presented their respective campus initiatives.
Burkert, who has been at Carnegie Mellon for over 20 years, talked about several university initiatives to promote student wellness and an overall better student experience. 
One such initiative, a mini course called Thrive@CMU, which teaches students how to handle stress and take care of their mental health, was introduced to the curriculum this semester.
Sutkus talked about health initiatives within the university and showcased a survey that will be sent to students this year to gauge their sexual, physical, and nutritional health.
Special Allocation: Filmmaking Club
The Carnegie Mellon Filmmaking Club requested funds from Senate to make a short film, Steel Town. Nicholas Hurt, a senior business administration major and president of Filmmaking Club, made the organization’s case in front of Senate. 
The Filmmaking Club has received funds from several other sources, including the Graduate Student Association, the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and a Kickstarter formed by the organization.
Senate voted to allocate $2,000 to the Filmmaking Club. Steel Town will premiere at the Shot for Shot Student Film Festival, which is hosted by the Filmmaking Club and held during Spring Carnival.
Special Allocation: Public Communications for Researchers

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) announced last Friday in an assessment of the state of the climate system that it is “extremely likely” that mankind has caused climate change. In a 2007 assessment, the same U.N.-sponsored panel called it “very likely.” Their assessment of a diverse array of factors, such as ice and snow volume, sea levels, and greenhouse gas concentrations, led them to conclude that global warming is manmade. While this information isn’t new, it is still jarring.
Even more concerning is the question of how man will cope with global warming. Surely mankind — creator of the wheel, discoverer of electricity, and inventor of the computer — will be able to cope with this challenge.
Global warming is a fact that has been proven again and again; therfore, it must be addressed immediately. This current climate trend is not an Earth-warming cycle, because carbon dioxide levels are higher than ever. People have never dumped so much waste into the atmosphere before because they have never before used so much fossil fuel. 
Even by the skeptics, however, the fact that people are destroying the environment cannot be rejected. Deforestation in Southeastern Asia, environmental monetization by China, and American reliance on oil all contribute to the fact that people are depleting resources at an unsustainable pace while destroying delicate equilibriums that hold the planet together. In light of all the effects of human consumption of natural resources, the dire impacts of global warming are only a small step away.
The IPCC says that action must be taken now. Their reports indicate that climate change could easily exceed the 3.6˚C limit change that the U.N. has concluded the world must remain below in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, according to CBS News. Beyond this point, there may be no return. 
Of course people, myself included, have the tendency to procrastinate. The carbon in fossil fuels that people have burned into carbon dioxide will stay in the atmosphere for centuries, and it can’t exactly be caught and stuffed somewhere. People cannot simply stop burning carbon immediately, either; they are finding gas reserves everywhere, and they are highly dependent on oil. Newly developed techniques of getting oil only increase the rate at which people can use fossil fuels. 
Each year that people delay cutbacks, they lower the probability that the IPCC’s goal of remaining below a 3.6˚C change will be reached. The probability of reaching that goal would have been 67 percent had governments started passing laws ordering emission reductions in 2011, and the reduction would have needed to be around 3.7 percent a year, according to theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss in The New Yorker. If cutbacks begin in 2015, the reduction will have to be around 5.3 percent a year, says Krauss. The point is that action needs to be taken now.
It is worth clarifying that the people discussed in this article only live in countries where resources can be harnessed and used. What about the other half of the world, where clean water is hard to come by, and connecting to electricity is a near-miracle? Have people collectively diminished their chance to improve standards of living? 
A conundrum that faces policy-makers, economists, financiers, and scientists is how to develop the emerging markets in nations that have not yet reached the technological sophistication of countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. 
How do countries of the first world help others develop without further damaging the climate and its fragile balance? The storms and floods that global warming bring will affect the agriculture of developing nations, where agriculture is perhaps one of their main industries. Without a sustainable agricultural sector, a country cannot advance in terms of productivity and standards of living. People in countries of the first world have a moral obligation to aid those they have affected. They have to save what they can, not only for future generations, but also for the people in the present they have impacted.

Texas state Senator Ted Cruz and the GOP have been widely condemned by the media and the public over the government shutdown. Surprisingly, much of that criticism has come from within the GOP itself.
The GOP has always prided itself on its strong political unity, as characterized by former President Ronald Reagan’s 11th Commandment — thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican. However, over the past few years, deep fissures appeared between the radical Tea Party and moderate Republican wings, and these fissures have only become deeper with the debt limit debacle.
The marriage between the Republican Party and the Tea Party was once fruitful. Some say that politics are about winning over powerful minorities to sway elections; the Tea Party can be considered such a minority. The energetic party has enough electoral power to change elections; in many ways, the Tea Party has reinvigorated the Republicans. However, there are signs that the honeymoon is ending, and once it is over, the GOP will realize that the Tea Party is a political dead end. To retain political relevance and the moderate majority, the GOP needs to divorce itself from the Tea Party.
The fact is, the GOP can survive without the Tea Party, but the Tea Party cannot survive without the GOP. As one of the two major parties in America’s political system, the GOP lends an air of legitimacy to the Tea Party. It brought prominent Tea Party members — such as Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, and Ted Cruz — into the national spotlight and gave them the funding, coverage, and connections to further their political careers.
The problem with Tea Party members, as evidenced by the debt limit situation, is that they are best suited as ideologues and should not actually be given legislative authority. Tea Party members want the kind of radical, sweeping social and political change that a democratic government is simply unable to realistically deliver. When they don’t get their way, even the dullest of political minutiae must become a Braveheart-esque last stand against the forces of big government.
The radical conservatism they espouse and the theatrical tactics they employ do not resonate with much of the American population. A Gallup poll conducted this year shows that only 22 percent of Americans support the Tea Party. In contrast, Occupy Wall Street, a more liberal movement, had twice the support from the general public, according to the New York Daily News. However, the movement was never fully accepted by the Democratic Party the same way the Tea Party was incorporated into the Republican Party; eventually, Occupy Wall Street faltered. More likely than not, the Tea Party’s fate would be the same if it were cut off from the Republican Party.
In the long term, the GOP needs to move toward greater inclusiveness so that it can willingly accommodate the diverse American public. If not, it will be dragged down by the Tea Party when it eventually sinks.

Since its debut, news companies have praised the iPhone 5s and one of its newest features: the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. In its review of the device, tech blog SlashGear describes the scanner as “the first biometrics system that actually stands a chance of succeeding in the mass market.”
Apple is not the first to pioneer biometric security, but because of the company’s widespread success, other companies tend to follow in its footsteps. Because of this trend, more devices with fingerprint scanners will soon be on the market.
Apple’s Touch ID system offers great convenience to the user. Strenuous password typing has been replaced with a simple touch of the finger. However, with great convenience also comes great risk: The fingerprint is perhaps the most sensitive information that we have ever placed into our mobile devices. Imagine the power that an individual, corporation, or government body could gain if it had the potential to access a larger number of Americans’ fingerprints than it currently has.
In a press release dated Sept. 10, Apple promises that Touch ID will provide an extremely secure experience. It states, “All fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely in the Secure Enclave inside the A7 chip,” and “it’s never stored on Apple servers or backed up to iCloud.” These statements sound promising, but after the recent leaks released by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden surrounding its surveillance measures, can we truly believe every word Apple — or any technology corporation for that matter — tells its customers?
I hope to think that the answer is still yes; however, many people remain skeptical, including hacktivist group Anonymous. According to a video recently released by Anonymous, the deal between AuthenTec — the biometric scanner company that creates the Touch ID sensors — and Apple is questionable, due to AuthenTec’s past connections to the government and a recent FBI biometrics project.
Anonymous points out in the video that AuthenTec entered the market as a spin-off company of Harris Corporation, which receives an annual $6 billion from the government. In addition, the current chairman of AuthenTec, Robert E. Grady, served as deputy assistant to George H.W. Bush. Grady also did work at the Carlyle Group, a Washington D.C. management firm that invested $910 million in Booz Allen Hamilton — the intelligence firm that employed Snowden. Because of this, it is undeniable that the manufacturer of these biometric scanners has connections with the U.S. government and military.
Anonymous also leaked documents that revealed the FBI’s alleged “Next Generation Identification” plan, which would create a fingerprint database of citizens “for use both domestically and on the battlefield.” 
What better way is there to gain access to the fingerprints of all Americans than to place biometric scanners on the personal devices they love most?
I would like to believe that we live in a country where the government and corporations are ethical enough to not collect and store the fingerprint data of everyday citizens. 
However, after The New York Times revealed last week that the National Security Agency had conducted a project in 2010 and 2011 that tested collecting the location data of everyday citizens from their cellular devices, it is clear that this organization lacks any sense of respect for personal privacy, and if there is a way to gain access to this trove of fingerprint data, it will find it.

A recent article in The Wall Street Journal highlights the debate over whether wage increases for primary and secondary school teachers should be based on the length of their teaching career and their personal level of education or on students’ academic performances.
Some critics, like Thomas J. Kane — an economist at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and director for the Center for Education Policy Research — argue that schools should provide salary increases based on student academic achievements, rather than solely on their educators’ academic degrees or time spent teaching. These critics are completely right, but until accurate measures of student abilities can be generated, a delicate balance between teacher qualifications and student performance must be struck when determining educators’ salaries.
Basing teacher salary increases on student performance is intended to reward those teachers truly dedicated to their students’ learning, but may, in reality, reward those who teach to the test. 
If schools choose to base their pay-raise standards upon state assessments, they may not accurately determine educators’ performances. These tests are important for measuring basic abilities, but they do not often match up with curriculum offered by teachers. Many state tests that have arisen from the No Child Left Behind Act, like the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, are geared toward ensuring that all students reach a certain bar but are unconcerned with how far above the bar students go. 
Educators teaching academically rigorous courses, therefore, may not be evaluated correctly, since they often cannot teach to the test, and their students are not tested in relation to their potentials. 
Furthermore, relying less on degrees to determine pay increases may deter educators from obtaining these degrees. In an academic setting, where the goal is to constantly learn, educators cannot be the exception. Just like students, teachers must continue their education. Admittedly, teachers are encouraged to complete Continuing Education programs throughout their time as educators. Why stop at Continuing Education programs, though? If educators have the resources to enroll in master’s programs, they should be encouraged by their school districts to do so. Basing pay raises significantly less on the attainment of master’s degrees may effectively remove encouragement that districts previously offered.
The ways in which educators are evaluated in relation to student performance may be too broad to provide accurate benchmarks for teachers. However, if evaluations become more specific to the material that individual educators teach, then they should be relied upon. Until then, other factors — like the amount of time teachers spend educating and the degrees they attain — should play prominent roles when determining pay increases.

A few weeks ago, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published an opinion piece by senior associate general counsel of the United Steelworkers union Daniel Kovalik titled “Death of an adjunct.” The article described the situation surrounding the death of Margaret Mary Vojtko, an adjunct professor at Duquesne University who taught French for 25 years.
Unable to pay bills for her cancer treatment and ineligible for health benefits from Duquesne due to her status as an adjunct, Vojtko died in poverty from a heart attack on her front lawn. The tragic situation sparked an outcry over the treatment of adjunct faculty, and was covered by many news sources, even sparking an opinion piece published on CNN’s website titled “Adjunct professors are the new working poor.”
The outcry over this tragic incident is justified, and the benefits given to adjunct faculty deserve further investigation.
Carnegie Mellon does a commendable job in offering appropriate benefits to its adjunct faculty. In university-provided information regarding employee benefits, the word “adjunct” is not used. Instead, university employees are labeled full-time; part-time benefits eligible; and part-time not benefits eligible. According to documents publicly available on the university website, the qualification for benefits depends on whether or not an employee has worked for the university for more than four months and over 17.5 hours per week, or has worked 46.7 percent of a “full-time schedule.” 
After these criteria are met, Carnegie Mellon employees are eligible for medical benefits, as well as retirement contributions. Dental and vision benefits are reserved for full-time staff. It is admirable that Carnegie Mellon provides health benefits for part-time faculty, especially when other universities do not. The criteria for eligibility is fair.
As detailed on the university’s human resources website, Carnegie Mellon currently has 83 part-time faculty members, which accounts for about 6 percent of university faculty. That means that — at maximum — only 6 percent of faculty are not eligible for at least some of the benefits that the university offers, although many may be eligible.
However, the situation seems more dire for faculty at many other universities. The Affordable Health Care Act, which would require all people to purchase some form of health insurance, could partially resolve the issue of professors not being provided with health insurance. Unfortunately, this does not eliminate the financial obligation of having to purchase health care — even at lower, public marketplace rates — a burden that could be lightened if more adjunct faculty were eligible to receive health benefits.

Advanced technology is playing an important role in the classroom now that it has proven its usefulness in daily life. 
Because of technology’s expanding practicality, it may seem like a great move to spend $1 billion to give every student in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) a $700-dollar iPad — but reality paints the situation in a different light.
Unsurprisingly, Los Angeles students figured out ways to circumvent web-browsing restrictions, and many ignored rules prohibiting the expensive devices from being taken home, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
As a result, the LAUSD has now called for the return of every iPad and is trying to determine if the devices should be used in future classroom instruction at all. So far, a third of the pricey iPads remain unaccounted for despite the recall.
A significant portion of the teachers in the school district probably foresaw this outcome to some extent. Students have been using and abusing classroom equipment since they were given wax tablets: Textbook margins become sketchpads, and chalkboards are blank slates for profane phrases.
It should be assumed that students will disregard rules and use equipment in undesirable ways. To believe otherwise is to be willfully foolish.
The classroom is simply not the place to put cutting-edge technology into students’ hands. Teachers should not have to spend class time and school resources ensuring that new technology is used for academic purposes and not mistreated, especially when older tried and true methods are already known to be effective.
However, if putting expensive technology in the hands of the youth is a must, e-readers instead of iPads with textbooks already pre-loaded might be a more effective option.
If this alternative is pursued, it may lighten students’ backpacks and could lead to deals with publishing companies, since digital-format books have much higher profit margins. Students will also be less likely to browse the Internet on unauthorized sites.
If educators ensure that technology can only be used for academic purposes, such as by providing technology with limited functions, they may ensure that students use technology in the classroom as it is intended to be used.
Educational technology should be tested before implementation, and educators should be comfortable before its admission into the classroom.

Attorney General Eric Holder announced on Monday that the Department of Justice was suing North Carolina over the state’s controversial new voting law. The amendments covered in this voting law will require all voters to present photo ID in 2016, eliminate same-day registration during early voting, and reduce the early voting period from 17 days to 10, among other changes, according to Time magazine. The Department of Justice is focusing specifically on the requirement of photo ID, as they claim that the law offers no protection for voters who do not have identification and would affect minority voters the most, according to CNN. North Carolina lawmakers argue that this law will prevent voter fraud, but critics point out that voter fraud is not a major problem in the United States.
Although there are no major elections in the near future, similar Pennsylvania laws passed last year must be revisited to allow those who may be barred by the laws to vote.
Pennsylvania lawmakers enacted a voter ID law just before the presidential election of 2012. According to NPR, many critics of the law in Pennsylania, including John Jordan of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, argued that the law had the potential to seriously limit the voting access of veterans, seniors, people with disabilities, and minorities. In October 2012, a Pennsylvania judge served an injunction that prevented the photo ID law from affecting the presidential election. However, the law was not completely thrown out, and therefore has the potential to affect a wide range of future elections in Pennsylvania. Over the past two years, voter ID laws have been struck down in Texas, Wisconsin, and South Carolina, according to The New York Times.
These laws have the potential to seriously affect elections nationwide, both on the national and local level. Most voter ID laws are pushed by Republican-dominated legislatures, but tend to affect minorities likely to vote for Democrats.
Pennsylvania’s voter ID law needs to be revisited sooner rather than later, to ensure that all U.S. citizens have equal ability to exercise their right to vote.

You are divided between two choices, but you need to make a decision soon.
Don't get too caught up in the money; do it because you love it.
You could focus on the negatives, or you could ignore them and have fun.
You can study all you want, but at some point you have to go out into the world and get real experience.
Don't blindly follow others' leads. Trust your own judgment instead.
Don't be ashamed of your mistakes — accept them and learn from them.
Learn to apologize when you are wrong.
You are probably right, but you should have to struggle hard to reach that conclusion — don't take it for granted.
It might seem like life will never run out of ways to torture you, but relief is coming.
Recently you have forgotten how hard it was to reach where you are; be careful not to take things too lightly.
