The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to Greencastle, Ind. this weekend and advanced to the final match of the International Tennis Association (ITA)’s Indoor Championship, where the team suffered a tough 5–4 loss to the Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays. 
Their advancement to the final rounds of competition on Sunday was not a novelty for the fifth-ranked Tartans, who won the inaugural championship in 2009 and were runners-up in 2011.
The Tartans immediately established their competitiveness and dominance in the competition, first advancing to the semifinals on Friday. 
The Tartans started the match with a sweeping double play. Senior Alex Tapak and first-year Brooke Tsu opened with an 8–1 win at No. 3 doubles. 
Junior Katie Cecil and sophomore Angela Pratt doubled up to claim the Tartans second point with an 8–4 win at No. 1, followed by a 8–3 doubles win by sophomores Bryn Raschke and Chelsea Motie.
“The doubles did an excellent job this weekend,” Pratt said. “I look forward to more of the spring season.”
In singles play, Cecil and Motie won in straight sets at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, to seal Tartan victories. 
The Tartans also claimed victories at No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 singles. Pratt won 6–1, 6–1 at No. 4 while Tsu won 6–4, 6–1 at No. 4, and Tapak won 4–6, 6–1, 10–5 at No. 6.
On Saturday the Tartans came away with an 8–1 victory over the Trinity University Tigers to advance to the national final match for the second consecutive year. 
The lineup was similar to the previous day and featured wins by pairs Raschke and Motie in addition to Cecil and Pratt. 
Motie and Cecil also won their singles matches, while first-year Elizabeth Martin sealed the match for Carnegie Mellon with a win inthe No. 3 singles.
Success did not stop there for the team, as Tsu and first-year Abbey Hamstra capped off the night with singles wins as well, marking the fifth straight set with a total of six singles wins for Carnegie Mellon.
On Sunday, the Tartans started strong with two wins in doubles: an 8–2 win by Raschke and Motie and an 8–5 win by Cecil and Pratt. 
The team was ahead 2–1 going into singles play, but unfortunately, the Tartans did not fare as well in the singles part of Sunday’s competition.
Ultimately, the two singles wins by Motie and Cecil were not enough to carry the Tartans.
Despite their final losses in the singles matches, the Tartans were still proud of their overall performance and thankful for the time to bond together during the long weekend. 
“I had an awesome time this weekend,” Tsu said. “Especially listening to Justin Bieber with my teammates.”
The Tartans and the Johns Hopkin’s Blue Jays will meet again on March 31, when Carnegie Mellon will travel to Johns Hopkins for a 12 p.m. match.

This week was an interesting one for Pittsburgh sports fans. The Penguins are succeeding even with some injury issues, the Pirates are starting spring training, and the Steelers are setting themselves up for what will likely be a very busy off-season.
While this may be a slow time in terms of Pittsburgh sports, things are about to heat up with the NHL Playoffs, the start of the MLB regular season, and the NFL draft all on the horizon. Hopefully each team makes the right moves now to put themselves in a position to win when it counts.
Hockey
It seems like déjà vu for Penguins fans. As we near the halfway point of this shortened season, yet another of the Pittsburgh superstars has gone down with a concussion. 
The only difference is that this time it is Evgeni Malkin, not Sidney Crosby, who is out for an indeterminate time period.
Malkin was injured last Friday against the Florida Panthers, after taking a brutal hit from Panthers defenseman Erik Gudbranson. 
Malkin was skating in Florida territory with the puck, hoping to break a 1­–1 tie in the third period, when Gudbranson checked Malkin to the ground causing him to slide on the ice and slam his head against the boards.
He was immediately removed from the game due to severe headaches, mild disorientation, and other early concussion symptoms. 
The play itself was a clean hit, but the real damage was done when Malkin’s head and neck whiplashed when he hit the boards.
The glimmer of hope for Pens fans was the speed with which Malkin has returned to the ice. 
Wednesday, Malkin skated around for 30 minutes during practice, but he still has a ways to go before he can play again. 
It is also important to remember the varied progress Crosby had in the nearly two years he spent trying to recover from his own concussion.
Thankfully, the Penguins are still in an easy position to make the playoffs with Crosby finally returning to his dominating form after two years off due to concussions. 
Goalie Marc-André Fleury and the Pens’ defense is also doing its part, ranking in the middle of the league in points allowed.
When coupled with their second-rank offensive, their defense’s performance has led the team to second place in the NHL’s Eastern Conference.
Baseball
For the Pirates, this may finally be the year that’s different. On the back of all-star Andrew McCutchen, third baseman slugger Pedro Alvarez, major free-agent acquisition Russell Martin, and a rotation that includes A.J. Burnett, Wandy Rodríguez, and James McDonald, the Pirates look to finally end this season with a winning record for the first time in 21 years.
The Pirates are still a year or two away from really making some noise in the National League Central Division, but at least they are headed in the right direction.
The front office has shown a commitment to winning by negotiating a big-money contract extension for McCutchen and out-paying the New York Yankees for Martin’s catching services.
Starling Marte is a name to keep an eye on this year. 
He got called up from the minor leagues in July last year, and appears to be in position to win the starting left field job out of spring training. 
At just 24 years old, he has plenty of room to grow but has some good power and great spee
Football
After last season’s crazy off-season with the team firing offensive coordinator Bruce Arians, who went on to win coach-of-the-year honors with the Indianapolis Colts, the Steelers missed the playoffs and barely had a winning record.
This off-season is setting up to be just as hectic, with the Steelers trying to get younger players on defense while also trying to get under the salary cap.
So far the Steelers have renegotiated quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s contract, but have pretty much given up all hope of signing free agent receiver Mike Wallace again.
The Steelers have better draft picks than in recent years — the 17th pick in the first round — due to their poor regular season performance. This could be used either to continue fixing their aging and porous offensive line or to rejuvenate the slowing defense.

Senior mechanical engineering major Taylor Gaston has been part of the men’s club volleyball team since his first year and is hoping to wrap up his illustrious volleyball career at Carnegie Mellon on a high note.
Gaston has been a standout outside hitter and captain on the club for four years, and has also been heavily involved as the manager of the varsity women’s volleyball team.
The Harrisburg, Pa. native says that “[the team has] gone through a rebuilding phase, but we’ve gotten a lot of younger guys as the team has progressed.”
Gaston has excelled in his position as a captain. First-year Daniel Lee said, “Taylor has been a really strong captain because he’s a role model who leads by setting an example, both on and off the court.” Lee added, “He’s incredibly supportive and consistently looking for ways to improve your play.”
Entering the season, Gaston hoped that “we would get out of the rebuilding phase and that we would be more strict, committed, and involved.” 
In Gaston’s eyes, much of this initial goal for the season has been accomplished. The team is 4-3 this season, with a final win in two games against Robert Morris University. 
The men’s volleyball team is in the Penn-Ohio Volleyball League (POVL), competing against local teams including the club team from the University of Pittsburgh.
The team has nevertheless faced countless challenges this year, with the most pressing being less-than-desired levels of involvement from the players. Gaston said that it is “hard for us to get as much participation and commitment as we’d like due to demand in other areas of life, especially academically.” The team practices twice a week, and often travels to other schools for matches.
Still, Gaston boasts that the team, led by coach and assistant professor of chemistry Kevin J. Noonan, is “better than it has been during the past two years.”
Sophomore teammate DJ Begos said, “[Gaston’s] always getting us excited on the court, and he’s just a leader. He always helps at practice and tells us things to work on. Him, [team president Alex Campbell], and our coach all help, and are really good leaders.”
Outside of the court, Gaston said that he simply enjoys  hanging out with friends and playing other sports. I also really like to eat and try out different restaurants.” Being a Pennsylvania native, Gaston also enjoys travelling to other schools and exploring other academic institutions. 
After graduation, Gaston plans to enter the work force as a mechanical engineer.
He is also an active participant in the university intramural sports leagues, engineering groups on campus, and is a brother of the Pennsylvania Rho chapter of Phi Kappa Theta.
Gaston uses volleyball as a break from the challenging engineering coursework and the busy college lifestyle. 
“It was at first hard to juggle academics and athletics, but there’s definitely time to get work done,” Gaston said. “When there are only a few things that you like to do other than hanging out with friends, [volleyball] is definitely a great outlet from the stress.”
Even before coming to Carnegie Mellon, Gaston was in correspondence with the president of the volleyball team, and quickly became integrated into the team environment. 
Based on his experience in joining the team, Gaston encourages any students who are unsure of joining a group like the volleyball team to “take that first step and be outgoing; you will definitely be accepted with open arms.”
“Taylor’s been our vice president for the past two years, and he’s also been our on-the-floor captain,” team president Alex Campbell said. “He’s the spirit of our team. He’s the one who always gets people motivated and gives speeches, and gets us up when we’re down. He’s very vocal and really excited all the time, which is great to have on the team and great for a captain to be.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team finished its season at the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) South Championship last Wednesday with a 94–80 loss to the Juniata College Eagles (19–8). This was the first time the Tartans have made it to the championships since the 1999–2000 season, and marking an end to the first winning season in 10 years. The Tartans’ final in-season record was 13–12.
In the week prior to the ECAC Southern Championship, the Tartans suffered losses at Case Western Reserve University and Emory University. But these losses were hard-fought battles. At the Feb. 23 game against Case Western, the Tartans had a 22–10 run in the first half, with senior Emily Peel leading with a high shooting percentage.
This is typical of Peel, who finished the 2013 regular-season campaign averaging 13.9 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. She also posted 30 blocks for an average of 1.2 a game to lead the team in all four categories.
Peel closed the regular season with a national ranking of eight in field-goal percentage, shooting at a 56.6 percent clip. With the first-team selection, Peel becomes the fourth Tartan to earn two or more University Athletic Association (UAA) first-team honors.
Peel was also a great asset for the Tartans, shooting a season-high 27 points. She is currently the fourth leading scorer in school history with 1,203 points and the seventh leading rebounder with 721 points.
“This season was awesome. To have the first winning season in a decade and to make it to ECAC’s was amazing. We have come a long way and this is only the beginning of the success I know the team will have,” Peel said. “It has been great to be a part of the CMU women’s baskeball program and I have really enjoyed getting to know such an awesome group of people.”
Following their loss at Case Western, the Tartans headed to Juniata and the ECAC South Championship last Wednesday. Juniata started off strong and gained a 14–0 lead in the first three minutes, continuing their dominance with the biggest lead of the half with a score of 28–9. Eagle junior Jordan Hileman was a major player, earning the majority of the points for the opposing team in this half.
The Tartans fought back to reduce the deficit to seven points with four minutes left in the first half. 
First-year Lindsay Poss stepped up for the Tartans and shot a three-pointer and two baskets in a row to make the score 39–32 in Carnegie Mellon’s favor.
At the break, Peel had scored 15 points and Poss scored 11, while senior Jordan Speck dominated for the Eagles with 19 points.Speck made the last three-pointer of the game, giving the Eagles a 57–42 lead over the Tartans. 
They continued their shooting streak with a 48 percent average for the second half, leading to the final score 94–80 in the Eagles’ favor. The Eagles only made one more shot than the Tartans, but they made more many more three-pointers than did the Tartans.
Poss made a career-best finish, a total of 20 points.
First-year Liza Otto also received honors as by making the UAA second-team, becoming the first Tartan first-year to make the second-team since the 2008–09 season.
Otto was third on the team in scoring with 10.3 points per game, and second on the team in rebounding with 8.0 boards a game. Otto led the team in assists with 72, which averaged out to 2.9 assists a game, and led the team with double-digit rebounds in nine games.
Overall, the Tartans do not dwell on their loss in the championship, but rather look at the successful season with feelings of accomplishment. These feelings of pride and achievement are especially strong for the graduating seniors.
“It’s very strange to think ‘Wow, these four years are over,’ ” senior Tori Baggio said. “But I really enjoyed this season and think we accomplished a lot. We have a great group of girls, and I’m excited to come back as an alum to see them do even greater things.”

Room selection application process
Housing and Dining Services has launched a new online portal application process in the hopes that Room Selection 2013 will be faster and more efficient. All eligible students can participate in Room Selection for the 2013–14 academic year via the housing portal at http:/www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room retention policies
Students wishing to retain their current rooms must fill all vacancies in their room, suite, or apartment through pull-ins. Students who retain but fail to fill vacancies will be paired with other residents in half-filled rooms, meaning that said students will either be assigned a new room or a new roommate who also failed to fill vacancies. The “Roommate Profile” section of the housing portal application at https://web.campusservices.cmu.edu/housing/roommates/index.html can be used to find other students looking for roommates.
Housing rates
Housing rates for the 2013–14 academic year are expected to increase by 4–6 percent, depending on the location, with the reservation fee at $400 a year. Final rates are available on the Housing and Dining Room Retention website at http://www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection/forms/13-14rates.pdf. 
Individual room selection
Students participating in room selection as individuals can only select either a single room (if available) or an available space in a partially filled room or apartment.  If no partially filled room options are available, the student can sign up for Open Assignment. Housing and Dining Services suggests that students participate in room selection with a roommate to ensure the widest range of room options available.
Potential changes for the 2013–14 academic year
* The second floor of West Wing House may not be available for retention during next year’s room selection. 
* Students with private or semiprivate bathrooms may be responsible for cleaning their own bathrooms starting at the beginning of the next academic year. 
* Phone lines will continue to phase out in individual rooms of all residential buildings. Phone lines in building’s staff rooms and common areas will remain to be used for emergency purposes.

Room selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), general room selection, RA/CA housing, special-interest housing, block housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three room selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room selection begins on March 6, so all students returning next year should begin thinking about their housing plans for the 2013–14 school year.
Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to most upperclass students, except those in special-interest housing, a first-year dormitory, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, students must be eligible to participate in room selection and must not have already selected an assignment for the 2013–14 school year.
General room selection
General room selection is the final phase of room selection. During this phase, students eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose a room from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general room selection must “elect to participate” by signing a housing license agreement. They are then given a random room selection number.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during the 2013–14 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in room selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection process carried out by the Office of Student Development.
Special-interest housing
Special-interest housing allows groups of students to apply for group housing centered around a certain interest or theme. Special-interest housing groups should consider how they plan to positively impact the larger residential community before completing the special-interest housing application process.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a “block” of apartments near each other in one of the apartment-style dormitories. Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who will be responsible for setting up their Block Housing group on the housing portal and will remain the main contact point between the group and Housing and Dining Services.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing is a program in the Oakland Community Apartments that permits upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2013–14 academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.
For more details about the room selection process, visit www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.

How often do you get a cold? Have you noticed that you get sick more or less often than your friends? Carnegie Mellon Robert E. Doherty Professor of Psychology Sheldon Cohen recently identified a biological marker — an indicator of a biological state — that corresponds with one’s susceptibility to the common cold.
Telomeres are cap-like protein complexes found at the ends of chromosomes whose function is to protect those chromosomes during replication. It has long been known that as you age and undergo more cell replication, your telomeres shorten, leading to the possibility of aging-related diseases. What is remarkable about Cohen’s work is the discovery that telomere length not only predicts susceptibility of disease in the elderly, but also does so for younger people.
Cohen cites two reasons that led him to conduct a study on the correlation between telomere length in young adults and their ability to fight off disease: “First, even though telomere length decreases as we age, the evidence suggested that there was variation in telomere length even in young adults. Second, telomere length is often measured in white blood cells. Our interest is in how the immune system responds to infectious agents like cold viruses,” he said. “The most prevalent diseases in the age group we study, 18-to-55-year-olds, are upper respiratory infections, and it seemed to us that those with shorter telomeres in key white blood cells would be less able to prevent cold viruses from replicating.”
Indeed, the results of Cohen’s experiments aligned with his prediction. Cohen and his team measured the telomere length of white blood cells in 152 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55. These volunteers were then quarantined for five days after being exposed to the virus that causes the common cold. “We have studied the role of psychological and behavioral factors in the common cold for over 30 years. Unlike most diseases, we can actually experimentally expose people to the disease-causing agent. Hence, colds have provided an excellent model for us,” Cohen said.
The results of the experiment showed that individuals with shorter telomere length were more likely to contract the common cold than those with longer telomeres. Another result of their experiment was the discovery that telomere length only started predicting an individual’s susceptibility to the common cold for those who were about 22 or older. Telomere length was increasingly indicative of an individual’s ability to fight off disease as the age of the individual increased. “The increased importance of telomere length with age is likely because the younger participants had fewer very short telomeres, or that their young immune systems were able to compensate for the loss of effective cells,” Cohen said in a university press release.
Sheldon and his team also found that a particular type of white blood cell — a CD8CD28- T-cytolytic cell — was the best indicator of the likelihood of contracting the cold because the telomeres found in CD8CD28- cells shorten at a more rapid speed than those found in other cell types.
Now that it’s known that telomere length corresponds with an individual’s ability to fight off disease, the obvious question one might ask is, what factors — besides natural aging — affect telomere length?
“Shorter telomere length is associated with traumaatic childhood experiences, with exposure to chronic enduring stressors, with poor health behaviors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol, with lower levels of education, and with stable psychological dispositions like hostility,” Cohen said. These factors may decrease telomere length through their effects on telomerase — an enzyme that rebuilds telomeres.
Further studies with other viruses and natural infections will increase the understanding of how telomere length corresponds to susceptibility to disease. Perhaps, in the future, telomeres will be the key to improving human health.How often do you get a cold? Have you noticed that you get sick more or less often than your friends?

Since the discovery of DNA in the ’50s, scientists have been trying to understand exactly how it can influence minuscule details of a living organism. Modern techniques of genetic engineering aim to manipulate an organism’s genome in order to change biological mechanisms at the molecular level. These techniques are being applied to a variety of fields — from medicine to agriculture — and with recent breakthroughs in genetic engineering, unbelievable ideas such as cloning may not be so far-fetched.
DNA exists in the cells of all living organisms and stores information on how the cell should grow, proliferate, and interact with neighboring cells. DNA is comprised of genes, which function as recipes for how cells should build proteins. These proteins then control everything the living organism does by facilitating specific chemical reactions. This can be thought of as a “lock-and-key” mechanism of sorts: A protein with the correct shape can bind perfectly around certain molecules and force their interactions.
For example, one of the approximately 25,000 genes in a human cell contains the information on how to build the protein lactase. This protein binds to and breaks down the complex sugar lactose into relatively simple glucose, which is vital for the cell to make energy. If someone doesn’t have the gene for lactase or if the protein is not built correctly by the cell, that person will experience symptoms of lactose intolerance.
However, the protein lactase is generally only found in the cells of the digestive system. These cells have the same DNA as the cells in the brain, but the proteins found in each cell make them function differently — it would be a waste of energy for a cell to build a protein that it didn’t need.
To ensure this, DNA’s influence on (or expression of) proteins is heavily regulated within the cell. Every gene consists of a controller region that must be activated in order for that gene to be expressed into a protein. In the case of lactase, cells in the digestive system recognize that lactose is present and needs to be broken down. Only then will a specific molecule bind to a controller region for the lactase gene so that the protein-building part of the cell will receive the recipe and then protein will be made by the cell.
According to PBS, techniques of genetic engineering aim to manipulate this process of protein expression in cells to impact their functions. Scientists have the ability to introduce new genes into the genome, so that the cells produce a protein that wasn’t present before. For example, in agriculture, genetically modified fruits are forced to express specific proteins to increase their health benefits, increase growth rates, or increase their resistance to pathogens.
People who suffer from diabetes don’t have the ability to create insulin in the pancreas that allows their bodies to take glucose from their blood. With the power of genetic engineering, the gene to produce insulin was introduced into the E. coli genome so that, as these bacteria grow, they produce large amount of insulin. This can be collected and given to patients so that their bodies can then function normally.
The current hot topic of genetic research is the battle against cancer. Cancer is the unregulated growth of cells, largely due to DNA damage, where protein expression deviates from the norm and results in a pernicious attack on the body. Using a protein called nuclease, scientists can target and remove specific genes from the genome of a group of cells so that the protein won’t be made, ideally preventing the unregulated growth. The challenge is that cells have intricate levels of complexity, and simply adding and removing genes can lead to drastic effects. 
Proteins play important roles in long pathways of chemical reactions; modifying these pathways must be done with caution. Still, there is a lot of hope that, by using various genetic engineering techniques, cancer can be defeated.
Techniques are also used to remove certain disease-causing genes from newborns so that they won’t suffer. It may also (at some point) be possible for parents to personalize their children by controlling the genes that express certain traits. This is where genetic engineering starts to walk the fine line of medical ethics.
Manipulating DNA allows us to change every aspect of a living organism, and the possibilities are endless. In the late ‘90s, scientists successfully took the DNA from a living sheep and used it to produce an exact clone, which they named Dolly. Since then, other animals have been cloned by scientists as they aim to learn more about the power of genetics.
The past three decades have largely been characterized by a technological revolution. Many scientists see the next few decades as defined by a genetic revolution by using the power of DNA to do everything from growing healthier foods to curing cancer.

Researchers find possible genetic links in psychiatry
A new study by Jordan Smoller, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, has found similarities in genomes linking five very different psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, clinical depression, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). The findings suggest that these disorders have roots in areas of the genome that code for major brain-signaling functions and may help to treat the disorders in the future.
The study was based on genetic data amassed from over 60,000 participants — both with and without illness — all around the world. The writers of the paper suggest that this could be the largest collaborative genetic study to date.

Big meteorite hunters travel to Antarctica
A team of meteorite hunters traveling across the East Antarctic Plateau on snowmobiles in late January stumbled across quite a large find. A meteorite, found buried in the snow, weighed in at about 40 pounds (18 kilograms) of space rock. The meteorite turned out to be a chondrite, one of the most common types of meteors and the same type as the Russian meteor that landed in Siberia last month.
The expedition, which is a common exodus for scientists excited about meteorites, collected 425 meteorites — a total of 165 pounds in extraterrestrial rock. However, largest among these by far was the 40-pounder, making it the largest meteorite found in eastern Antarctica in the past 25 years.

Prehistoric craters could have helped expedite life
A new study of an impact crater in Finland has suggested that meteors could have created ideal conditions for the creation of life in Earth’s early stages. While previous knowledge of the hydrothermal environments created by these craters accepted that they are beneficial to life forms, the new study suggests that these environments could have lasted for up to 1.6 million years, 10 times longer than previously thought.
The same report suggested that similar craters could have existed on Mars. Continuing research will help to determine whether thermal activity like this is unique to Finland’s crater, known as Lappajärvi, or if it is common to all similarly sized craters. These studies will hopefully shed more light on how life may have evolved on Earth, as well as give scientists a way to determine on which planets it may be likely for life to prosper.

Biological molecules found in cosmic dust
Researchers using the National Science Foundation’s Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia found several basic biological component molecules in a gas cloud almost 25,000 light-years from Earth. Chemists believe that one chemical, cyanomethanimine, is one of the critical agents in the formation of the DNA nucleotide base adenine. The other key molecule discovered, called ethanamine, is thought to be essential in the creation of alanine, one of the 20 amino acids that make up all proteins.
The discoveries at this distance suggest that gas clouds like this could seed biological precursor particles throughout the galaxy. However, both molecules discovered require multistep biological processes, which are quite complicated, before they evolve to anything of biological significance.

When announcing the release of Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre), German electronic musician Sascha Ring (also known as Apparat) described his newest album on his website: “It’s [my] first record ever that didn’t hurt at some point. It’s full of imperfection because it was made by humans.”
It’s clear that the album was “made by humans”; it is so emotive that it could only be created by passionate individuals. But if there are imperfections, they are certainly difficult to find.
Apparat mostly produces electronic music, but Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) delves into the hypnotic magic of live performance and orchestral instrumentation. The music was originally composed for Krieg und Frieden, an experimental stage adaptation of Tolstoy’s War and Peace by German theater director Sebastian Hartmann at the Centraltheater Leipzig; Ring performed the music live with two string musicians, Christoph “Mäckie” Hamann and Philipp Thimm, during the play’s performances.
When Apparat first started releasing music over 10 years ago, it was intelligent dance music (IDM) comprised of crisp electronic sounds. Over the years, though, Ring has slowly integrated more orchestration and vocals into his music; his 2011 album The Devil’s Walk featured lush, orchestral soundscapes mixed with his experimental electronics.
Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) shows just how far Apparat has come since its early, purely electronic days: The album leans far more on orchestral instruments, ambient noise, and modern classical influences than on the beeps and boops prevalent in Ring’s early work. The result is emotionally rich music that’s so full of color that it’s easy to forget it was performed by only three people.
Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) starts off simply, with slow, soulful harmonies from the strings. But eventually Ring’s electronic production creeps in, with small electronic sounds added here and there, eventually building into a noise interpretation of the strings’ simple melody.
This dark, ambient feel ebbs and flows throughout the album, with electronics, a piano, the strings, a xylophone, percussion, and Ring’s vocals all weaving in and out to create an emotionally complex tapestry of sound in which you can easily lose yourself. This is an album that deserves to be listened to with headphones, in full, without distractions, so that it can be fully appreciated.

“Why don’t we eat penguins?”
It’s a question that is not often asked, but one that comedian Hannibal Buress asked nonetheless at a performance last week at Mr. Small’s Theatre, where he claimed he would pay $500 to wrangle a penguin and eat it.
Buress is a Chicago-based comedian who has written for Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock. He has also been featured on Comedy Central programs and has appeared on various talk shows, including the Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.
Mr. Small’s Theatre, where the show was held, was a very colorful venue. Converted from a church into a performance space, the theater has an interesting atmosphere and interior, although there was not enough seating for a comedy show. The venue is usually used for concerts and musical performances, which was clear from the fact that nearly all the seats were folding chairs.
The show started off with a bang. Buress came in after a grand introduction and ran around the theater, mingling with the crowd. Through most of the hour-long set, he was able to maintain that high level of energy.
The show, mostly composed of observational and absurdist humor, seemed rather experimental. Buress’ conversationalist, off-the-cuff delivery is very sharp and adds greatly to his jokes. Some memorable moments include jokes about Mitt Romney’s proposed changes to the TSA, Will Smith’s death, the practice of podiatry, domestic violence in the context of Kobe Bryant’s career, and Buress himself being the victim of a failed robbery.
Another memorable joke involved Buress’ trip to the emergency room after a car accident: He describes a nurse who chastises him for cursing in the emergency room. “What? Does my cursing ruin the emergency room experience of the other patients?” he asked.
Although the variety of the subject matter kept the audience interested, some of his jokes could have been more connected by a narrative. For instance, Buress made plenty of jokes about his experiences in London, but they were far too spread out.
Another less-than-satisfactory part of the show occurred when Buress riffed on ridiculous rap lyrics. The particular jokes he made, like those about Big Sean’s lyrics in the Kanye West song “Mercy,” were not very insightful or original. Where Buress did make original commentary about certain lyrics, however, he redeemed himself somewhat.
An interesting aspect of the performance was that, unlike many stand-up performances, this was not a one-man show. Buress had a DJ accompany him as part of the show, playing music where appropriate. At the end, Buress also had ballerinas and someone dressed in an Elmo costume dancing with him on stage.
Buress’s comedy is pretty original, and he is very talented as a comedian. For anyone interested in stand-up comedy, it’s an act definitely worth checking out.

Kresge Theatre was filled with uproarious laughter last Thursday at a production written and produced by the School of Music sophomore vocal performance class, The Curious Murder of a Person Not Particularly Liked. Convocation is a requirement for all students in the School fo Music, but instead of a standard formal performance of one solo after another, the students comically arranged classic songs into a musical that swept the crowd away. Every scene had its own unique and standout character.
The story follows the mysterious death of an abhorred hotel owner and manager, Rick Felicino (played by Grant Braider). Detective Geoffrey Hansen (Ethan Crystal) leads an investigation into Rick’s death and the quirky community that surrounded him, which bridges into a series of hysterical character studies. The show concludes with the reveal of the villain’s identity, which comes as a huge surprise to both the audience and the characters on stage.
The performance kicked off with a Beauty and the Beast favorite, “Be Our Guest,” which welcomed the highly engaged audience and also invited the enthusiastic cast to the stage. The hype of the first number was followed by “Master of the House” — recently revived by the film adaptation of Les Misérables — which introduced the community and the situation. One by one, each student showcased his or her solo piece, often accompanied in harmony by the other actors.
The hilarious incorporation of Carnegie Mellon School of Music inside jokes into the lyrics made each piece relatable to many of the students in attendance. Jokes included references to eurhythmics class, the BXA program, and the question, “Did you shower?” Waves of laughter came one after another.
Joel Goodloe’s performance of “Memory” elicited even more laughter when Goodloe unexpectedly broke into a joyous tap dance in the middle of this all-time classic, prompting another wave of cheers. The captivating performances continued with John Teresi’s performance of Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” in which he dramatically acted out a rebellious teenager pursuing his passion of music despite the challenges he encounters.
Joanna Latini, Stephanie Ramos, and Campbell Rogers each embodied strong and distinctive characters through pieces with modified lyrics; their performances, in particular, were hysterical. Ramos’ rendition of “Contigo en la Distancia” (accompanied by Braider on acoustic guitar) was in Spanish, and though the majority of the audience could not speak or understand the language, Ramos’ synchronized voice, facial expression, and body movements were alluring.
After a few more entertaining vocal performances — including Patrick Coniway’s “Mad World” and a joint song by Adrienne Lotto and Bridget McCoy ­— the villain turned out to be the students’ vocal coach and the pianist of the night, Roseanna Irwin. This revelation brightened the afternoon: It was heartwarming to see a teacher singing with her fellow students.
Though it included a lot of classic oldies, the show was overall very up to date. It vibrantly and humorously examined today’s culture through its portrayal of different racial and gender stereotypes. Carnegie Mellon’s sophomore vocal performance class is filled with not just musical and acting talent, but also a lot of originality.
If all this is not reaped from hard work, I’m not sure what is. Whoever believes the program’s claim that “all voice majors do is complain but never do anything” must somehow be delirious.

Entering the Andy Warhol Museum is like entering a strange, neon-colored land. The giant Brillo box statue across from the entrance and the neon purple and yellow cows printed on the walls are signs of the eccentric work that is to come.
The museum currently features a special exhibit called Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup Cans.” The exhibit, which opened Feb. 3, showcases some of the most influential work Andy Warhol ever made — think of the Marilyn Monroe silkscreen images and the Elvis Presley prints — as well as work from other artists that have emulated Warhol since his legendary art rocked the world.
Each floor of the museum has huge photos of Andy Warhol, along with famous quotes that exemplify his character. The last floor of the museum, part of the permanent collection, is dedicated to Andy Warhol’s life and features his diploma from Carnegie Mellon — a nice link between the past and the present. It is fascinating to go through all the floors and see different facets of Andy Warhol and the people he inspired, albeit a little repetitive at points.
The new exhibit begins on the seventh floor and is also installed in floors five, four, and two. As soon as visitors step into the gallery, they are greeted with massive self-portraits of Andy Warhol. Featuring his iconic silkscreen technique, the neon-colored canvases are a strong opening statement to the exhibit. Continuing into the gallery, there are several standout pieces, but these are hidden amidst the other pieces that honestly fail to spur excitement. Some of the pieces are just confusing. Although it is modern contemporary art, it is hard to see the artistic value or talent behind it.
One of the knockout pieces, an untitled work by Félix González-Torres, is a huge pile of candy on the ground, placed in a corner of one of the rooms. It seems very simple at first — until the description explains that the candy’s weight totals 175 pounds: the weight of González-Torres’s lover, who died of AIDS. According to the description, the candy is a representation of the perfect sweetness between Torres and his lover. As people walk by the exhibit and take pieces of candy — as they are encouraged to do — they are symbolically re-enacting the diminishing effect AIDS had on the artist’s lover. But they are also adding to his lover’s reincarnation when the museum replenishes the candy supply to its original 175-pound weight.
Other interesting pieces include a silkscreen print splattered with dark, white, and milk chocolate (“Black Star Black Press: Black Star, Black Press, Star” by Kelley Walker) and a giant box of cigarettes (“Helmsboro Country” by Hans Haacke). Of course, the museum also features Andy Warhol’s famous pieces like his Brillo boxes and his screen prints of famous celebrities. Different artists that were inspired by Warhol are featured as well, through videos, photographs, installation pieces, and screen prints.
The Andy Warhol Museum is a good place to visit if modern art interests you, especially since it’s free for Carnegie Mellon students. After all, Warhol is such an important part of Pittsburgh culture. Though I wouldn’t recommend visiting the museum multiple times, a trip to see the Regarding Warhol exhibit is definitely worth your time.
Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years is showing at the Andy Warhol Museum through April 28.

The mood was set from the moment the audience entered the studio space: stark staging with harsh geometric lighting patterns, the spicy incense floating through the air, and an actor laying in the dust on the stage, twitching and writhing every few moments.
During the School of Drama’s Thursday night performance of DYO (or Please Take Care of Me), the meaning of life was questioned, fate was twisted, and caution was thrown to the winds of chance. The play, which ran for a little over an hour, was based on a variety of writings by Japanese author Haruki Murakami adapted by senior drama major Tegan McDuffie, who also directed the production.
Every part of the set and each costume served a purpose, even if it was a small, seemingly inconsequential one. Little touches, such as spraying fruity scents into the air to evoke the free winds of summer, only served to make the play more dreamlike and deliciously ambiguous. The massive amount of attention that this must have required from the crew and designers is impressive and admirable.
DYO (or Please Take Care of Me) was completely immersive in its nature, making for a thought-provoking, mystical experience. The story lines were disjointed, seemingly running along parallel lines and then intersecting haphazardly before returning to their respective planes. Because the story was compiled from 13 of Murakami’s works, the plot was grounded heavily in thematic material and characters. According to the program notes — written by the show’s dramaturgist, junior Bachelor of Humanities and Art student Emily Anne Gibson — the director and editors sifted through the works to synthesize common themes, motifs, and archetypes.
The result was a play that is unexpectedly deep and poignant, featuring six characters: He (junior acting major John Garet Stoker), She (senior dramaturgy major Olivia O’Connor), The Rat (junior acting and musical theatre double major Chris Douglass), May (junior acting major Bridget Peterson), The Sheep Man (junior theatre studies major Josh Buckwald), and The Man With No Face (also played by Buckwald).
Filled with intricate metaphors, metasymbolic references, and countless moments of surreal honesty, DYO (or Please Take Care of Me) examines the reality of life and the prices that come with reaching beyond it. While somewhat puzzling, an idea was presented early in the play that seemed to explain the bewildering stories and themes: Sometimes, not understanding something is simply how one understands it.
The cast that supported the incredibly abstract script was more than capable of communicating these intangible concepts. Peterson’s May was bubbly, sweet, and a true force of nature. She not only came off as startlingly real, but also made it easy for the audience to laugh a little in the middle of such a philosophical labyrinth. It was easy to see the viewpoint and philosophy that she represented, and the way in which she embodied the whimsical naivety of youth while spouting the truest truths was positively angelic.
May’s humor was balanced by the adorably quirky He. Resigned to agree with the many people that label him as weird, Stoker’s character was conflicted, sweet, and totally lost, making for an easily accessible and very relatable protagonist.
The collection of eclectic characters sported a wardrobe that was practically a character of its own, considering how much of the story it told, and the staging was both simple and incredibly purposed.
With all of these elements blending together, a play that had the potential to crash and burn in ambiguity emerged as a whimsical, magical story that explored the fuzzy edges of reality, crafting an introspective experience for all.

Dear Patrick,
Spring break’s coming up, and I’m going on a road trip with some friends. I’m a little concerned about it, though. How can I make sure our road trip goes well?
Thanks,
Hoping Imminent Trip Triumphs, Helplessly En Route On Arduous Diversions
Dear HIT THE ROAD,
Lucky for you, I’m a connoisseur of road trip films. I’ve seen ’em all. I know all the tricks. First things first: The point of road trips is to engage in multistate shenanigans predicated upon simple misunderstandings, like pretending to be in a historically black fraternity or holding an amusement park hostage with a BB gun.
While your shenanigans may not be as great as those, you should still engage in as many as you can. That means doing things like pulling over for every “World’s Largest ______” you pass, going to biker bars while cross-dressing for convoluted reasons, and reassembling your car with duct tape. Sure, it won’t be the same as traveling with Kristen Stewart in On The Road, but at least you’ll be able to make eye contact with your friend afterwards.
Just be glad you’re not traveling with David Spade,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
How can I explain to someone that I don’t want to be in a relationship right now? Everyone assumes that since I’m a girl, that’s what I want, but I really just want to hang out with my friends and maybe hook up with a cute dude.* 
Thanks,
Jonesing After Useful “Necking” Tonight, Yet Joes Escape Zealous Enticing, Believe Eager for Love
Dear JAUNTY JEZEBEL,
Have you tried just telling him you don’t want a relationship? I think he’ll still understand. If he still thinks you want a relationship, then there’s not much you can say to explain it to him. The best way to convince him you don’t want to date him is to just not date him.
At this point, the question becomes “How do I end my casual hookup?” You could go with the tried-and-true method of ignoring his texts and avoiding him until he gets the idea (of course, that makes you look like a jerk). Or just maintain polite conversation but come up with excuses for avoiding him (and be slightly less of a jerk). Or have an actual adult conversation — crazy, right?
Or just don’t give him your number,
Patrick Hoskins

TEDxCMU, a conference devoted to bringing together innovative thinkers, brought 11 speakers — including two Carnegie Mellon students — to the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium on Sunday to give short talks that covered a wide array of topics, ranging from urban revitalization to delivering happiness in students’ daily lives.
Ketaki Desai, a third-year graduate student in public policy and management and presdient of TEDxCMU, described the idea behind TED talks. “TED is basically a conference that was started by journalist Chris Anderson, and the idea was that people should be able to describe what they’re doing in 15 to 18 minutes or even less. The idea was to inspire people with things that everybody was doing, because there was no way to know what people were working on,” Desai said.
The theme of TEDxCMU this year was “Spark”; the event’s goal was “to spark collaboration and foster connections between participants, encouraging aspiring individuals to follow their dreams and make a difference.”
Zofia Tillman, a first-year chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major and volunteer at TEDxCMU, said that the theme of “Spark” refers to “that moment when you figure out how to develop your idea, or when you figure out what you’re passionate about.”
This year, TEDxCMU featured Jon Clark, Jenn Lim, Darell Hammond, Judy Swan, Rodrigo Arboleda, Eve Picker, Linda Benedict-Jones, Jeff Ferrell, and Rob Daley, as well as first-year computational biology major Rebecca Alford and senior directing major Stephen Tonti.
TED began in 1987 as a conference to bring together the worlds of technology, entertainment, and design. According to TED’s website, their mission is to spread ideas and change the world, noting that, “we’re building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world’s most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.”
TEDxCMU is independently organized; TED’s website describes such TEDx events as “giv[ing] communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level.”
Continuing a practice that began last year, this year’s TEDxCMU featured two Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students as speakers: Rebecca Alford and Stephen Tonti. Compared to only 18 entries last year, this year’s contest to be a student speaker generated 55 student entries, Desai said.
Sophia Nanda, a sophomore physics major in attendance at TEDxCMU, talked about the first speaker of the day. Jon Clark, medical director at Red Bull Stratos, described his work on the team that organized Felix Baumgartner’s record-breaking jump from the stratosphere on Oct. 14, 2012.
“As a science student, I saw [Clark’s] bio before coming and he was what I was waiting to hear about. It was really amazing seeing one of his applied projects come to life; it’s something I want to do later in life,” Nanda said.
First-year economics major Cynthia Hsia commented on the message of collaboration that Clark spoke about. “It was really inspiring, especially with the video that he showed. It was cool to see how everyone as an individual made it work together.”
The next speaker, Eve Picker, chief executive officer at cityLAB Pittsburgh, focused on what she called the “cure for the common city.” Picker explained the difference between bottom-up and top-down city design, using Pittsburgh’s CONSOL Energy Center as an example of an expensive, top-down project and the Toonseum in Downtown as an example of a cheaper, bottom-up method for revitalization.
“Imagine a city where 5 million visits are generated by 13,000 small projects — that’s a cure for the common city,” Picker said.
Rachel Fowler, a first-year business administration major, said she liked that Picker “focused on improving cities in ways that no one has really focused on before.”
Linda Benedict-Jones, curator of photography at the Carnegie Museum of Art and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon, talked about her journey as a photographer after getting her bachelor’s degree in English literature.
Holly Dennis, a first-year dramaturgy major, said that she admired Benedict-Jones’ passion for photography. “I’m taking my first photography class this semester, and that was really inspiring because I’ve always had a passion for photography, but just dabbled in it. [Benedict-Jones] talked about the magic of print and stuff and it really is magic; it’s crazy magic.”
TEDxCMU also featured a performance by first-year MBA student Chinmayi Bhavanishankar, who performed a classical South Indian dance and talked about her passion for the narrative nature of Bharatanatyam dance. 
She emphasized how Indian dancing has evolved from a hobby to a passion and into a daily routine that she cannot imagine living without. 
In the second half of the event, The Originals, Carnegie Mellon’s all-male a cappella group, also performed, engaging the crowd with a few songs, including a mash-up of two popular songs.
The last speaker before the lunch break was Robert Daley, the chief executive officer of 4moms. 
Daley showcased several baby products produced by his company that used robotics to make them “dramatically better.” 
One of the devices featured was the mamaRoo, a baby seat that mimics the natural rocking and bouncing motions of a mother comforting her child.
After lunch, first-year biological sciences major Rebecca Alford gave her talk. Alford has congenital stationary night blindness, a rare, incurable disease that impairs her vision.
“I can see about half of what the normal individual can see,” Alford said. “What was most important about this was that it introduced the idea of adaptation. The reality was that there wouldn’t be some change or cure for my condition any time soon.”
Alford’s condition led her to do novel computational biology research as a 14-year- old at her high school and at the Bonneau Laboratory at New York University.
Jenn Lim, the next speaker, spoke about Delivering Happiness, a company she co-founded with Tony Hsieh, chief executive officer of Zappos.com. 
According to her presentation at TEDxCMU, Lim described Delivering Happiness as a way “to inspire science-based happiness, passion and purpose at work, home and everyday life.”
Chairman and chief executive officer of One Laptop per Child Association (OLPCA) Rodrigo Arboleda gave his lecture on “provid[ing] equal opportunity of access to knowledge to small children in developing nations and in some communities within the USA.”
Jeff Ferrell, professor of sociology at Texas Christian University and visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, gave a talk about “the broader issues that we confront in our lives, such as ... what rules are made and why, the issues we confront as citizens ... [and] going over to an area beyond those rules.”
Senior directing major Stephen Tonti began his talk stating that he had ADHD and continued to speak about how this disorder led him to his passion of directing. He had a light-hearted approach to his speech, emphasizing that because of his ADHD he had the opportunity to explore all different avenues in discovering his zeal.
The talks at TEDxCMU were interspersed with videos of lectures from other TEDx events. TEDxCMU brought together speakers from all facets of study and experience, allowing students to gain new perspective. 
It challenged students to think about their own goals and their futures in terms of helping change the world.

Katie Stoebe, the executive director of the Carnegie Mellon Center for International Relations and Politics, and Emily Half, an undergraduate academic adviser in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, recently announced that the Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program (CMUWSP) is being restructured. The new program will be launched in January 2014, meaning that CMUWSP will not be offered during the upcoming fall 2013 semester.
The CMUWSP currently sends students to Georgetown University for academic study while they participate in an internship; Carnegie Mellon supplements their experience with extracurricular events and internship search support. In the new program, however, Carnegie Mellon will no longer be partnered with Georgetown. Instead, Carnegie Mellon will be part of a consortium of schools partnered with the University of California Washington Center (UCDC). These universities include the University of Notre Dame, the University of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, and Washington University in St. Louis. Carnegie Mellon students will take classes in the UCDC building — only five blocks from the White House. Courses will be taught by a combination of Carnegie Mellon and UCDC faculty, and with the new program, there will be more core and elective course options.
“Don’t get us wrong, our students have had good experiences at Georgetown, but we’re really excited about the opportunity to grow Carnegie Mellon’s presence in Washington and develop our own program there,” Half said.
The internship aspect of the CMUWSP will be retained; students will still complete an internship of their choosing while studying in Washington, D.C. Although students will apply and interview for internships on their own, affording them a real-world experience, a full-time adviser based in Washington, D.C. will be available to help guide their search. Additionally, the Carnegie Mellon Center for International Relations and Politics has an extensive database of descriptions and deadlines for over 360 internships, the majority of which are in Washington, D.C. 
In the past, Carnegie Mellon students have completed internships for government organizations, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, and think tanks. Students interested in the program are encouraged to research internships well in advance, as deadlines can approach earlier than expected, especially for government organizations such as the State Department and the White House.
In the spring 2014 semester, CMUWSP students will live in Washington Intern Student Housing (WISH). 
Carnegie Mellon students will live together in a WISH townhouse, and will be neighbors to students from other schools living in the WISH community. 
In the future, Carnegie Mellon is planning for students to live in UCDC housing, which mainly includes two-bedroom, four-person apartments with kitchens and living rooms.
Although it seems like restructuring the program was an abrupt decision, Stoebe said that changes to the CMUWSP have been in discussion for many years. “Things just kind of picked up in the fall semester and moved a lot faster than we had anticipated. We had wanted to do this program for the longest time and it just seemed like everything started falling into place,” Stoebe explained.
The CMUWSP will not be offered in the fall 2013 semester, because the program managers want to dedicate all of their time and resources to launching the program successfully and problem free in spring 2014. Although the CMUWSP website still says they are accepting applications for the fall 2013 program, emails were sent to Carnegie Mellon academic advisers asking them to inform students of the changes. Additionally, three information sessions regarding the new CMUWSP were held in February.
After attending a CMUWSP information session, sophomore psychology and philosophy double major Lavender Yi said, “It was unexpected that the Washington Semester Program is undergoing reconstruction. I had absolutely no idea until I went to one of the information sessions a few weeks ago. I really do like the new options for the spring semester of 2014. However, I do wish they were still partnered with Georgetown, because I heard about wonderful experiences and I wish I could have had those experiences as well. I expect a lot of great things to happen in the spring though, and I can’t wait to hear more about the program ... in the fall.”
Stoebe and Half are hoping to send 10–12 undergraduate students each semester to Washington, D.C. There are currently 11 students participating in the CMUWSP spring 2013 program. The majority of students who apply to the program are selected, but as Half said, “It’s not that it’s not a selective program, but I think that it’s self-selecting. We want students to have this opportunity, so unless we think there’s an academic reason or some other reason why you shouldn’t be in D.C., we want you to go.”
Applicants are advised to have at least a 3.0 QPA and to plan their semester schedules ahead of time. “Academics need to come first. You need to be a strong student in Pittsburgh to be a strong student at Carnegie Mellon in D.C.,” Half said.

Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences recently launched Under Construction, a networking event intended to connect current Dietrich College students with alumni who have made successful careers in a variety of fields, including public policy, entrepreneurship, and technology. Hosted on Feb. 23, at the Oakland Holiday Inn, the event consisted of lunch with alumni of Carnegie Mellon’s humanities programs, followed by a panel session.
“Your education allows you to go in many directions,” said Deitrich College consultant Debra Ignelzi. “This event is about learning how to do that.”
Before the alumni entered the event, senior decision science major Chris Sparks offered advice on how to interact with the alumni and potential recruiters. “You need to present yourself in such a way that they remember you,” Sparks said, explaining that he often introduces himself to potential employers with the phrase, “I see myself as a lighthouse.”
As the event began, Beverley Wheeler (DC ’76, HNZ ’78), the former president of the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Association, opened with words of encouragement for the students “to take advantage of the alumni association.” She reassured the students that the alumni would be incredible resources for them.
Keynote speaker Joshua Knauer (DC ’95) pointed out many examples of men and women who have formed successful companies with their “soft” degrees, including himself. Knauer has a degree in environmental ethics and policy. Since graduating, he founded a successful Internet-based business, Rhiza Labs, and also served on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.
“Those of you sitting here are going to have at least seven jobs in your career life,” he said, emphasizing the need for creativity in a job market that lacks job security. Knauer went on to address the influence of the upcoming economic sequester by the federal government, and how this situation emphasizes the need for one to further develop one’s career. This fact, Knauer noted, especially applies to those who wish to work in startups. In an interview after his speech, Knauer cemented this concept, adding that “a startup is inherently irrational.”
Knauer added that the creativity inherent in the liberal arts helps much more than the more technical degrees do, but he still believes that “it’s better to have some control over your future career.”
In her speech, Emily Feenstra, a senior international relations and politics and policy and management double major, encouraged her fellow students to ask questions about the advantages and disadvantages of the alumni’s fields.
The panels offered at Under Construction provided an open forum of discussion for students. 
The topics included marketing, education, museums, public health, and think tanks.
In the panel focused on entrepreneurship, students were given guidance on how to ask for money from investors.
“I learned a lot of valuable things about the life of a consultant,” junior policy and management major Branden Wiles said of the discussion at the entrepreneurship panel. “It’s so general and so broad, to have CMU alumni coming to tell you about it ... is definitely a valuable insight to have.”
Regarding the panel on think tanks, Stanley Krasner, a sophomore economics and math double major, stated, “I think it represented a really nice cross-section of alumni who all had interesting stories and perspectives.” 
Krasner also served on the student committee advising the event.
The feedback on the program from attending students was generally positive. 
“Under Construction was a great experience for me.... I was able to talk to and learn from Dietrich alumni who are in the midst of doing what I want to do,” sophomore international relations and politics major Chloe Hawker stated via email. “I learned a lot about the industries and made some contacts with whom I’m excited to follow up and cultivate a professional relationship.”
Sophomore creative and professional writing double major Jaime Fawcett thought the event was informative. “It was really cool seeing what alumni from Dietrich College are doing,” she said. 
However, Fawcett felt that the event also had some shortcomings, saying that students did not have ample time to pose questions to many of the speakers once their presentations had concluded.
Overall, Fawcett believed the event was useful. 
“I think it is a good process, but I feel like they should open it up to freshmen.” 
She thought that first-year students would benefit from the stories of alumni just as much as upper class students would.
As the event neared its end, Feenstra closed the gathering by saying, “You’re building on your experiences, not figuring out your end goal.”

Carnegie Mellon has been offering students and alumni an opportunity to start their own businesses since June 2012 with support from the Open Field Entrepreneur’s Fund (OFEF). 
This fund awards money and resources to Carnegie Mellon alumni who graduated  within the past five years.
David Mawhinney, an assistant teaching professor of entrepreneurship at the Tepper School of Business, serves as managing director of the fund.
“The fund was made possible by a gift from a gentleman, Jonathan Kaplan,” Mawhinney said, “who created the Flip Video camera and later sold it to Cisco Systems. 
His wife, Marci Glazer, also helped found the fund. It’s a fund for young alumni from zero to five years of graduation to make their own jobs and follow their dreams.”
The OFEF is part of the “Greenlighting Startups” initiative at Carnegie Mellon, which aims to promote and translate ideas and creations from labs to the market. Last year, the fund awarded a total of $300,000 to six different startup companies, each receiving $50,000.
There is a comprehensive application process to select companies. “If you meet your eligibility requirements, you are asked to make a pitch. But you have to be serious to convince another investor to commit $50,000,” Mawhinney said.
One company that received funding from the OFEF is PECA Labs, which focuses on rare cardiovascular and pediatric conditions. Doug Bernstein (CIT ’12), a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who double majored in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering, is the founder and CEO of PECA Labs. Bernstein feels that children with certain heart conditions often have insufficient products used in their heart procedures.
“Intra-operative conduits had to be developed from scratch by the doctor in the operating room for 30 minutes,” Bernstein said. In response to this issue, the company created the Masa Valve, described on PECA’s website as “a synthetic valve conduit for pediatric RVOT (right ventricle outflow tract) reconstruction.” The product would be a quicker, simpler solution that doctors could use on patients during heart surgeries.
The company is still in the process of getting regulatory approval for selling its product, but according to Bernstein, it will be an excellent option for parents and their children. Only a small market of individuals are affected by this issue, so no other companies have come up with more affordable options because of the $70-million fee attached to bringing the device to market. Bernstein hopes to bring this fee down to less than $750,000.
StatEasy, another company supported by the OFEF, takes videos and statistics from sports teams and creates a simple system that can be used by coaches, players, and families to view them. Chief operating officer Tom Matta (TSB ’07) explains, “We’re turning media into a new platform … on an iPad instead of paper.” After every game, the company hopes to provide every player with his or her own highlights. StatEasy is being used by 200 sports teams, including those in the Navy and at Pennsylvania State University. However, “The future of our media products is with high school athletic leagues,” Bernstein said. 
Tunessence, a company created by alumni Alex Soto (CIT ’11) and Matthew Bauch (CIT ’12), aspires to be an engaging online guitar teacher. “The ultimate goal is to be the Rosetta Stone of music by combining music technology with teaching,” Soto said. 
On the website, individuals are given access to audio processing software and instructional videos. Tunessence’s software then provides individuals with note-by-note feedback, tracks progress and personalizes lessons. “So we use software to do what private teachers would do,” Soto said.
The OFEF also invested $50,000 in Aurochs Brewing Company. Ryan Bove (TSB ’12) said that he and his business partner, Doug Foster, have had to be on a gluten-free diet on a daily basis for medical reasons; soon, he explained, “We [will] make a gluten-free beer.”
Aurochs Brewing, according to Bove, is commercializing a specific brew using millet, quinoahops, and amaranth. “Most beers,” he said, “use barley and wheat, and sometimes have corn and rice.” Aurochs Brewing has a brewery in Emsworth, Pa., about 10–15 minutes from Pittsburgh. The company expects to have a federal and state process complete in “the next couple weeks or so,” and plans on launching in late spring 2013. 
It currently has one brew flavor, and two others will be unveiled during the spring and summer.
Scott Sykora (CFA ’12) co-founded Pixite. 
“We make photography apps for the iPhone and iPad. Our most popular apps give users access to their photo libraries in Picasa Web Albums, Facebook, and Flickr on their iPad and iPhones,” Sykora said.
These apps are meant to make popular services more useful and “essentially replace the browser interface they would normally need to go through.” For example, Sykora mentioned that his company’s most recent app, Unbound, provides this service for Dropbox.
The fund does not favor innovation in any specific field; the six selected companies from last year focused on a variety of fields. Mawhinney also notes that in the past year, the fund has supported and invested in 16 different companies throughout the U.S.
While providing financial contributions to startup companies is its primary focus, the fund also provides perks for current students, including an invitation to go to a yearly OFEF personalized mentorship program. Startups are assigned at least one mentor.
These six companies utilized the financial support provided to them by the fund. “Being able to say CMU made a $50,000 investment in us is a big deal,” Bernstein said.
“Carnegie Mellon in general has done a lot to provide us with help and having that Carnegie Mellon name behind us is a big deal,” Matta said. “We’ve since raised $250,000, and as a humanitarian company, it’s a big deal for us.”
“It’s great to be acknowledged as a Carnegie Mellon product,” Soto said. 
Regarding the aid received from the fund, Soto added, “It’s been super helpful. We’ve hired [a] bunch of people. It allows us to go from prototype to a working product, and to raise more capital from a proven product.”
Sykora also spoke glowingly of the fund, saying, “We’ve been growing as a company and are looking into what our next steps could be. One thing we’re starting to explore is becoming more of a web service company instead of just creating stand-alone apps. The OFEF sponsorship is really helping us move toward that. It’s letting us grow faster than we would have without it.”
Additionally, the companies also appreciate the mentorship aspect of the OFEF sponsorship. 
“We’re also hoping to gain a strong set of advisers and connections through the OFEF and CMU Alumni network,” Sykora said.
Bernstein appreciates having his designated adviser, Craig Markovitz. “We’re a young company with young entrepreneurs,” he said. “There’s a lot of passion, but not experience, so having a mentor is great.”
Bove also had similar views. “The money is very helpful, but what’s really important is the mentorship and having people such as Dave giving advice and helping us troubleshoot problems before they even become problems,” said Bove of Mawhinney.
Every year there will be two cycles in which the fund selects startup companies — once in May and once in December. 
The deadline for the most recent cycle was on March 1, but graduates will be able to apply again in the fall.

Special Allocation: ASLC
The student organization for Asian Student Leadership Conferences (ASLC) petitioned the Senate for funding to attend an East Coast conference on leadership to be held at Columbia University. The organization requested $425 to assist with travel expenses for five students. The allocation of $425 was approved by Student Senate.
Special Allocation: Sigma Tau Delta
The English honors society Sigma Tau Delta petitioned Student Senate for funding to attend a international honor society convention at the end of March. 
The organization asked the Senate for $140 to cover the event’s  registration fees. Sigma Tau Delta has held service events such as book charity drives for the Pittsburgh Literacy Program in the past. 
The finance committee recommended $0 because Sigma Tau Delta is an academic organization, and is exclusive in its membership. 
After voting, no funding was allocated to the organization.
Special Allocation: SAE
The Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) builds race cars and competes in a competition in Michigan. Usually, a sponsor lends the organization a welder, but the offer has been withdrawn. The organization requested $900 to purchase a new welder. Senate voted to allocate $935.77 to the organization.
Special Allocation:  TEDxCMU
The organizers of TEDx asked Student Senate for additional funding totaling $800 to cover expenses of hosting the TEDxCMU event. The organization has a current funding gap of $6,330, and the $800 was being solicited in addition to grants from other sources. Student Senate voted to allocate $800 for TEDxCMU.
Special Allocation: Alternative Break
Alternative Break petitioned Student Senate for $2,500 for their program. This money would be allocated toward the organization’s travel expenses. When analyzed on a per-person basis this number was below the travel metric. The $2,500 was allocated to Alternative Break.

Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl announced on Friday that he will not be seeking reelection.
This is a significant announcement by one of the nation's youngest mayors, who assumed his position after the death of former Pittsburgh Mayor Bob O'Connor. Ravenstahl has served as the mayor of Pittsburgh since 2006 and will remain in office for the next 10 months.
Ravenstahl made this announcement in the midst of accusations of financial misconduct and an FBI and IRS investigation into allegations of misappropriation of funds.
Ravenstahl has been noticeably absent from many public events in recent years, and has faced public outrage over incidents such as taking a city security vehicle to a concert and vacationing at Seven Springs resort while Pittsburgh suffered one of the largest blizzards in recent memory.
The mayor also oversaw many important events for the city of Pittsburgh, including the G20 economic summit, which was attended by many world leaders, including President Obama. 
When asked about his decision to step down, Ravenstahl told the [ITAL]Pittsburgh Post-Gazette[\ITAL], "The public nature is something I wasn't prepared for. I disliked the ability of folks to say and do whatever they wanted to say and do regardless of any truth. I disliked the politics of it, the folks that are in it to win and will do so at any cost. I'm just not that person. I never was."
The current leaders in the upcoming mayoral election are City Controller Michael Lamb and Councilman Bill Peduto.

Matt Mastricova’s article last week, “Time to wage war for minimum wage,” defends President Obama’s recent State of the Union proposal to raise minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 per hour by 2015. Mastricova cites studies from the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Economic Policy and Research, which show that minimum wage increases have no impact on employment. He concludes that minimum wage increases can only be good, as they give higher wages to low-skilled workers. What Mastricova forgets is that the social sciences are not exact sciences.
Running a simple regression of unemployment on minimum wage reveals an R-Squared value of only 0.002. This means that only 0.2 percent of the variation in unemployment can be explained by variation in minimum wage. Put another way, there is an incredibly large subset of factors that have an impact on unemployment; the effect of minimum wage is negligible. Minimum wage didn’t change during the recession, yet we saw unemployment jump above 10 percent in late 2009.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), North Dakota has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate at 3.2 percent. Economists attribute this low unemployment rate mostly to the energy boom that’s going on in that region. The low rate has absolutely nothing to do with any policy North Dakota has put in place, but simply shows that North Dakota got lucky with its natural resources.
In social sciences, there is no way to run perfect tests. The only way to imply causation is to test one factor while holding all other factors constant. This is impossible to do with economics because the economy doesn’t operate in a vacuum. You can’t test the effect of just one thing on a system where billions of people are constantly moving money around for reasons spanning from the federal reserve’s quantitative easing to sheer whimsical thought.
With this in mind, the studies that Mastricova cites seem less relevant. Minimum wage workers only comprise 5.2 percent of all hourly paid workers and 2.5 percent of all workers in the workforce, according to the BLS. These studies are based on the unemployment rate, which includes all workers. With 97.5 percent of workers unaffected by changes in the minimum wage, it’s easy to see why studies that account for all workers as their population don’t find any effect in minimum wage changes.
We can, however, see a demographic greatly affected by minimum wage changes. According to the BLS, about half of minimum wage workers are under the age of 25. A study on the U.S. minimum wage and teenage employment conducted by economists from the University of Cambridge, University College London, and Claremont McKenna College found statistically significant evidence that increases in minimum wage negatively affect teenage unemployment, holding all other factors as constant as possible.
In economic theory, we see that minimum wages have destructive effects on the employment of low-skilled workers. Employers don’t hire employees if they lose money by doing so. Minimum wages ensure that employers don’t hire any employee whose value is below the government-set threshold; 97.5 percent of workers fall above this threshold and are unaffected. 
The real losers to minimum wage are workers whose skills cannot earn them wages above the minimum. They don’t make more because of minimum wage. They just don’t get hired.
With this in mind, it doesn’t make sense for President Obama to push for wage increases that prevent job growth for the lower class. The real motivation for Democrats and liberal research institutions to push for minimum wage is that many union contracts set wages as a multiple of the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage is just a way for Democrats to throw a bone to some of their biggest donors.
Because the social sciences are inexact, we have to rely on economic theory at times to make policy decisions. In this case, we can see that minimum wages are destructive and discourage the hiring of low-skilled workers, while having a negligible effect on overall employment. Though Mastricova’s argument is well intentioned, the studies he cites use incorrect metrics to gauge a reality that is ever changing. Economic theory still holds. Raising the minimum wage only harms the low-skilled workers it intends to help.

The Oscars is always an interesting event. Glittering jewelry, gorgeous dresses, actors and actresses being witty with one another, all at an event that has been run and decided by heterosexual white men for years. This year we were graced with Seth MacFarlane’s offensive jokes and blatant sexism as well.
Blatant sexism should never be allowed, especially from or toward the celebrity audience present at the Oscars.
Anne Hathaway hasn’t had a great year when it comes to the media; however, when it comes to just about everything else, she’s been ridiculously successful, as anyone who’s seen Les Mis can attest. From having a picture of her not wearing underwear circulating around the Internet, to appearing at the Oscars in a “nipple dress,” the media has shamed her for just about everything, even in debates over whether or not her Oscar acceptance speech was “over-rehearsed.”
She is not taking this passively. When asked about the “lesson” she learned from the picture circulated on the Internet during an interview that was supposed to be about Les Mis, she turned it back around and said that she was “very sad that we live in an age when someone takes a picture of another person in a vulnerable moment and, rather than delete it, sells it.” You go, Anne! Four for you.
On the night of the Oscars, the Internet exploded with the Twitter trend “Les Nipperables,” a joke about how Hathaway’s nipples were showing through her dress. 
Forgoing the fact that the “nipples” were just the seams of her dress, and forgoing the fact that people have nipples, the ability of our culture to take away Hathaway’s entire night, including her Oscar and accomplishments, to make fun of her “wardrobe malfunction” is proof enough to me that sexism is wholly prevalent in our society.
By choosing to focus on that singular part of her, we are reducing her to her nipples. We are telling her, “Yes, you are allowed to be successful. Yes, you are allowed to win an Oscar. But we’re still going to shame you for something this trivial, for essentially nothing more than being a woman.” 
Seth MacFarlane’s song at the beginning of the Oscars, entitled “We Saw Your Boobs,” supports this sentiment. The song was a list of every actress’s boobs that have been seen on the big screen. It’s not about how well they acted the scenes anymore. It’s about shaming them for exposing their breasts to the public. It’s about shaming them for thinking of their body as their own, something they can willingly choose to expose to whomever they want.
In her acceptance speech, Hathaway said, “Here’s hoping that someday in the not-too-distant future the misfortunes of Fantine will only be found in stories and nevermore in real life.”
I agree, Anne. But I think we’ve got a ways to go.

There has been recent controversy over “Lil’ Poopy,” 9-year-old rapper Luie Rivera Jr. from Massachusetts, due to the nature of the YouTube videos in which he stars.
In these videos, Lil’ Poopy references all the staples of the rap genre — money, drugs, and women. The particular video that garnered the attention of state child welfare officials, however, is most controversial because the fourth grader is seen slapping a woman on her rear end.
Before we get into any discussion of the ethics of Lil’ Poopy’s videos, I would like to make one thing clear: Lil’ Poopy is a terrible rapper. Although it may seem a mean thing to say about a 9-year-old, I think it’s important to establish that the boy is not some Mozart-esque child prodigy that the world would greatly suffer without.
If he had been, it would make my position more defensible: This child should not be taken away from his parents and the videos themselves do not warrant an investigation.
While I morally object to what the parents are exposing their child to, removing a child from his or her family should only be reserved for extreme cases of child abuse and neglect.
Every family has had instances of questionable parenting that society would frown upon. However, removing children from their families will always leave deep, long-term emotional damage. The question is whether or not the actions of the family harm a child so deeply that removing the child from the family is necessary.
At this point, there is no real evidence of abuse that would warrant removing the child from his home. If the investigation uncovers actual instances of physical or emotional abuse, then I would certainly support the removal of the child from his family. However, the videos themselves are merely distasteful, not evidence of severe abuse.
As for the video in which Lil’ Poopy is depicted slapping the woman, it’s important to remember that Natalie Portman, Jodie Foster, and Brooke Shields were all featured in films where they played very sexually suggestive roles at a young age. Their parents were not investigated for abuse and neglect. Furthermore, child pageant parents are not investigated when their children wear overtly sexual clothing on stage. What is it about this case that is drastically different?
Perhaps it is the association with hip-hop, and especially rap, with explicitly adult themes that makes this case so flagrant. 
However, the decision to remove a child from his or her family should not be a decision based on cultural stereotypes; instead, the decision should be based off of a careful analysis of evidence as to whether or not there is actual abuse going on in a household.
While I hate the fact that parents would think it appropriate for a 9-year-old to rap about drugs and sex, it would be worse if child services removed children from their parents simply because of distaste over the parenting style that they exhibit.

It’s time to look into where your university apparel comes from — at least if you own University of Pittsburgh-branded clothing.
Pitt students are uniting to encourage their university to affiliate with the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), an independent organization founded by students, university administrators, and labor rights experts that aims to end labor abuses and to defend workplace rights in factories, particularly in sweatshops that produce university apparel.
Duquesne University, Chatham University, and Carnegie Mellon are among the 180 organizations already affiliated with the WRC.
While Pitt has the right to not affiliate with the WRC, the university’s response — or lack thereof — is unacceptable.
Joe Thomas, founder of Pitt’s chapter of Americans for Informed Democracy, delivered multiple letters to Chancellor Mark Nordenberg last fall asking for Pitt to affiliate with the WRC. During a meeting with Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey and Vice Chancellor G. Reynolds Clark, Thomas said the officials “didn’t see the point of joining” the WRC and questioned students’ motivations.
While officials representing the university met with students and attended student-run events related to sweatshops, their responses do not indicate that they have seriously considered the notion of affiliating with the WRC. The lack of interest by Pitt officials also shows a lack of respect for student concerns. Students drive sales when they purchase university apparel, and their voices should be heard.
The university must respond promptly to student outcries and stop pushing aside the notion of affiliating with the WRC. While they may decline partnering with the WRC, they must at least provide a supported argument for their choice. Is it the cost of affiliation, which can be up to $50,000? Is it a disagreement with the WRC’s mission? Is it a question of whether or not the WRC will help Pitt ensure that its apparel comes from factories that promote workplace rights?
Admittedly, Pitt Senior Associate Director of News John Fedele wrote in an email to The Pitt News that Pitt was already “satisfied with the [Fair Labor Association] and its work in this area,” referring to the organization affiliated with the university. However, this claim is vague and needs to be supported by specific reasons why the university trusts the Fair Labor Association, which students and labor rights activists claim receives funds from the factories it inspects.
When asked by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, WRC executive director Scott Nova claimed that the university had not contacted the organization. Given the rising student outcry, one would think that, at the very least, Pitt would contact the WRC to discuss the possibility of affiliation.
The lack of action by the university should not go unnoticed. Students look up to their universities as bodies that have the power to promote change. They rely on that body to foster their ideas and help them meet their goals. When the university’s vision is not in line with the vision of the students, it is the university’s responsibility to thoroughly look into the matter before ignoring a proposed change.
It is not Pitt’s choice to remain unaffiliated with the WRC that bothers me — it’s the university’s lack of response, apparent disinterest, and absence of public research.

It is difficult to graduate from Carnegie Mellon without taking classes that require Blackboard. Carnegie Mellon students can access a customized version of the website through their Andrew accounts.
However, as of late this website has been more of a curse than a blessing. Frequent outages and planned downtimes that last longer than anticipated have plagued the system and frustrated users for weeks. This semester alone, there have been approximately eight downtimes. The latest outage occurred on Feb. 26, according to Blackboard’s downtime  log, which can be found at  www.cmu.edu/blackboard/downtime.
While these problems are being addressed and hopefuly remedied, students and teachers alike should still be conscious of how and when they use the website.
Professors and students should take into account that Blackboard already reminds users to have backups of every necessary file and to plan alternative ways to collect work.
Instructors should provide some degree of leniency to students who are faced with Blackboard issues outside of their control, especially if they use Blackboard to collect work. Alternatively, professors could email students necessary documents or links they would normally put on Blackboard until the outages and downtimes have ended. 
By relying less on Blackboard, professors ensure that their proposed class schedules are not interrupted.Likewise, students should take the current unreliability of Blackboard into account and do as much of their work offline as possible, uploading and downloading their documents at the earliest possible opportunity. 
Students should download instructions or save links for assignments the day the professor announces that the materials are on Blackboard. By ensuring that they have the necessary items to complete assignments on their computers, students do not risk their ability to access the material the night before assignments are due.
While the reliability of Blackboard over the past few weeks has been troubling, we can only hope that lack of access to the website does not get in the way of students’ educations.

News sources have recently reported several cases of universities mishandling or covering up cases of sexual assault on their campuses. When universities refuse to take responsibility for the prevention of sexual assault on campuses, the school community suffers as a whole.
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) has now joined the ranks of universities that have mishandled cases of sexual assault.
UNC sophomore Landen Gambill braves the possibility of expulsion ­­­— because she claims that her ex-boyfriend raped her, sexually and verbally abused her, and stalked and threatened her after they broke up.
Gambill first came forward about her experiences as a sexual assault survivor last December, when she told the UNC newspaper The Tar Heel about how she had filed a complaint against her ex-boyfriend through the university. At the time, sexual assault complaints were handled by the Honor Court, a student group meant to handle violations of the university Honor Code. She told the newspaper that her complaint was egregiously mishandled, with the court using her history of depression — a result of the abuse she suffered — against her as a sign that she was too “emotionally unstable” to be believed.
About a month later, Gambill, several other students, and the university’s former assistant dean of students filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Office, alleging that the university had violated numerous federal mandates in the way it handled sexual assault cases.
Shortly after she filed the report, however, Gambill received an email from the Graduate & Professional Schools Student Attorney General Elizabeth Ireland, notifying her that she had been charged with an Honor Code violation by “intimidating” her rapist and “adversely” affecting his ability to participate in university life — simply because she had told news outlets about her experiences. She has never even publicly identified her ex-boyfriend by name, but Gambill says that at a preliminary Honor Court meeting, she was told that she could have violated the Honor Code simply by saying she was raped.
According to UNC, the university administration has played no part in these proceedings; in a statement it released last week, the university emphasized that the Honor Court is a student-administered process, and that “administrators may not encourage or prevent the Student Attorney Generals from filing charges in a specific case.” According to Gambill, however, an assistant dean actually helped her ex-boyfriend file the complaint with the Honor Court.
It is appalling enough that Gambill’s complaint was mishandled, but it is even more appalling that the university has decided to punish Gambill for coming forward about her experiences. Sexual assault is not only prevalent on college campuses — nearly one in four college women are victims of rape or attempted rape — but is also chronically underreported, according to a guide released by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
The DOJ estimates that fewer than 5 percent of college women who are victims of rape or attempted rape report it the police, mostly due to the victim-blaming that occurs when a sexual assault survivor decides to report, as evidenced by Gambill’s case. The university should be focusing on protecting its students by promoting a safe campus community, rather than trying to protect its public image by silencing sexual assault survivors.
Carnegie Mellon is in the process of remodeling its own sexual assault policy, under the guidance of Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno. We are lucky to have an administration that is open to suggestions — in part through our increasingly common Town Halls — from students and faculty about policy changes. But if we at Carnegie Mellon can learn anything from Gambill’s horrible experiences and UNC’s mistakes, it is that we as a campus community need to be aware and supportive of the sexual assault survivors on our own campus.
