Stop the presses.
Yes, is this the Times? What are you running above the fold? Yeah, the reporter the Russians put in jail… there’s Israel occupying the Temple Mount? And the former president under indictment… 
But have you heard? Guess who swept the Red Sox? At Fenway?
—---------------
Full disclosure — on Wednesday afternoon, I still had yet to decide what to write this week’s column about. Two topics came to mind. One was the Pirates’ ongoing saga with center fielder Bryan Reynolds, far and away the team’s best player, whose contract expires at the end of this season. And the other was the new rules that Major League Baseball instituted — specifically, the twenty-second pitch clock and banning the shift.
We’ll have time to discuss both of those, plenty, as the season goes on. But that’s not what I want to talk about today. What I want to talk about, instead, is that the Pittsburgh Pirates won four out of five (three straight wins against Boston, a win and a loss versus the White Sox). They appear to have learned how to play the game of baseball.
Specifically, I want to talk about how the Pirates have learned to hit baseballs.
Yes, there were pitching gems this week — Mitch Keller allowing just one hit against the Red Sox in the first six-and-two-thirds innings on Wednesday, and David Bednar repeatedly putting the Sox to bed (as he does with such frequency). But the story of this week, for all that, was not the pitching. It was the hitting, and that’s why the Buccos end the week with four wins in five games.
Pittsburgh beat Boston 7-6, 4-1, and 4-1, beat Chicago 13-9, and lost to Chicago 11-5. That means that over the course of the week, the Pirates put up a mind-boggling 33 runs, an average of a shade under seven per game. These weren’t fluke runs, either. Over this stretch, the club hit .291 (including a staggering .452 against the White Sox on Friday), and belted home run after home run. What happened?
Two answers.
Answer number one is named Bryan Reynolds, who went a magnificent 11-for-21 with four homers on the week, including nearly hitting for the cycle on Friday, which would have made him the first Pirate to do so in nearly a decade.
Answer number two is a familiar one for Pirates fans. I grew up watching the young, up-and-coming Andrew McCutchen, and I remember what I felt when I would watch McCutchen stride to the plate. It wasn’t excitement, although there was certainly some of that. What I would feel was relief. It’s worth unpacking just how unusual that is. Baseball is a game designed to favor the pitcher at the expense of the hitter; a batter has one job, to get a hit, and even the very best fail more than two-thirds of the time. It’s a game designed for excitement. Every at-bat is a new chance, a new opportunity for something to happen, but you watch your team go to the dish every inning with the full knowledge that, in all likelihood, nothing will happen.
Sidenote — but is this why so many baseball fans end up alcoholics, why ballparks can get away with selling fourteen-dollar beers and still have a line wrapping all the way around the block? Baseball is a very sad game. Half of the time, you’re watching your team on defense, biting your nails. You cannot score — only the other team can. That’s sad, isn’t it? Then you get your chance at redemption in the other half of the game, offense, where you watch the best talent your team has to offer go to bat, only for there to be a mathematical likelihood that they do absolutely nothing and waste the plate appearance. That’s less sad, but it’s still sad. Then you repeat the cycle nine more times. Every inning has the same familiar beat. First you’re scared, then you’re resigned. Scared. Resigned. Scared. Resigned. And so on, and so forth. So ballparks have found the perfect solution. You drink out of fear in the top of the innings, and you drink out of self-pity in the bottom. Either way, you’re a wreck by the end of the game, and then you remember that this humiliation you’ve just endured isn’t over, that there are another 153 games to go in the season, and suddenly you’re crying in your friend’s car and vomiting and crying while he tells you everything will be okay but he doesn’t get it, does he? Because he isn’t like you, he doesn’t know the pain of being a diehard Pirates fan, can’t relate to the hope that this team has every spring that gets stabbed in the heart again and again and again, and the love for this stupid team that loses a hundred games every fucking year, and then you fall asleep, and then the Bucs are at it again the next afternoon and you start the cycle all over again.
“You’re getting distracted. This is supposed to be an optimistic piece, right?”
Yeah, but come on, we know how this is going to end-
“No. You’re writing this whole goddamned column about how these are the new Pirates, the playoff Pirates. What’s the point if you’re gonna be a naysayer about it? Don’t you believe?”
Yeah, but I write this same column every f$cking year, and- whatever. Where was I? 
McCutchen. Growing up, I would feel sheer relief to see him step to the plate, as counterintuitive as it was, knowing that he was the best shot our team had to do anything. If I closed my eyes this week, I could see the 36-year-old McCutchen turn back into his 26-year-old self, feel that relief come back, if only a little. I felt like a child again, and McCutchen did his job, going 7-for-16 on the week, including a hit in his first home game at PNC Park in half a decade.
But that brings us to answer number three. The guys that really impressed me this week were the bench guys, the depth guys, the utility players who are sometimes eighth in the order and sometimes pinch-hit, and the spot where the Pirates always meet their downfall. This week, those guys were good. Jason Delay, who caught four of the five games, went a very respectable 5-for 17. So too did Ji-hwan Bae, who’s quickly becoming the Bucs’ everyday second baseman. Connor Joe, a utility infielder, wound up 4-for-7. Obviously, this level of consistency and performance, a 14-for-41 (.341) week from the bottom third of the order, isn’t sustainable. But if these players can find themselves hitting, say, .240 or .250 going forward, the Pirates dugout will be a very different place.
They won’t, of course, because the Pirates suck. If one of our players is accidentally good, sometime in June, they will be traded, probably to the Yankees, for prospects who will never pan out,  because that is what happens to good Pirates players. They suck every year, and they probably suck this year, too. But right now, they’re 5-3, leading the wild-card race and just one game out of first place in the National League. They currently boast a higher winning percentage than the Penguins, who are doing their job down the stretch but appear infuriatingly close to missing the playoffs for the first time since I was in a stroller. They’re doing better than the Steelers were eight games into their season, and that team didn’t have a quarterback, didn’t have an offensive line, and still came one Joe Flacco incompletion away from making the playoffs.
So, dear reader, there’s hope. There is hope. The weather is warm, Bryan Reynolds leads the majors in homers, Andrew McCutchen is back in Pittsburgh, the semester is almost over, the grass smells like summer again, and the Buccos are doing alright. What more can we ask?

This week, the Penguins actually kind of didn’t make me want to cry! They went up against four different teams, and this is how it went:
On Sunday, April 2, the Penguins faced off against the Flyers in Pittsburgh at PPG Paints Arena. Our beloved Pens came out strong with a two-goal lead after the first period, and despite a strong showing in the third, the Flyers were just never able to close the gap. Pittsburgh won 4-2, and earned two more points in their race towards the playoffs. 
On Tuesday, April 4, Pittsburgh went away to Newark to play the New Jersey Devils. Despite desperately needing every win they can get, the Penguins were never able to find their footing after being behind 2-0 in the first and 4-0 in the second. They did manage to get one in the net in the third, but it was simply too little too late. The Pens fell to the Devils, 5-1. 
On Thursday, April 6, the Pens played the Wild at home. With the first score in the first, as well as the second score in the second, and also the third score in the third, Pittsburgh made everyone proud. Minnesota was able to get one past Jarry in the third, but the Penguins would promptly respond with their fourth goal. Pittsburgh won 4-1, and took another two points towards the playoffs. 
On Saturday, April 8, the Penguins went up against the Red Wings in Detroit. This one was absolutely one for the books — the Pens were two goals ahead after the first thanks to one from Alex Nylander, as well as an immaculate backhand from captain Sidney Crosby. In the second, we got a Danton Heinen goal assisted by Crosby, which was followed just 42 seconds later by a Red Wings goal. The Penguins held on, however. Just three minutes into the third, Crosby scored an IMMACULATE power play goal for the Penguins, making him the 15th player in NHL history to have 1,500 career points. Congrats, Sid! To round off this absolutely perfect game, Evgeni Malkin scored the final point, giving the Penguins a 5-1 victory over the Red Wings and two more points in their race for the Wild Card slot. 
For a glorious seven-ish hours, the Penguins sat in the top Wild Card slot, one point ahead of the Islanders and the Panthers. Unfortunately, both of those teams won their games on Saturday, so the Pens are once again on the outside looking in. At this point, there are only two games remaining in the regular season. In order for Pittsburgh to hold onto their 16 year streak, they need to win both games, and either the Panthers or the Islanders need to lose at least one. While I feel like this is feasible, I am genuinely nervous at this point. I am begging on my knees, sending up an Easter Sunday prayer: please, God, please let the Penguins make it to the playoffs.

The NBA is a strange, strange place. Teams juggle draft picks representing players in the seventh grade, one or two big stars carry teams, and players spend a third of the season contracting various minor injuries so that they can play less basketball. Teams tank for a 14 percent chance of bringing home the #1 overall pick, and gamble decades of mediocrity on the off chance one of the many ‘generational talents’ touted every offseason makes the difference. Those top players then get shuffled from one team to the next, paired up with anywhere from amazing talent to the dredges of the G-League, trying to drag one team or another to the playoffs in the hopes of becoming NBA champions. Out of the 32 teams that play in the league, 20 go to the postseason. Out of the 20, 19 will lose. No team seeded 7th or lower has ever won the NBA Finals. The 6th seed has won a total of once, as has the fourth seed. That means, in all practicality, 17 out of those 20 postseason teams are really just walking zombies, without much hope at all.
It’s a sad sport, really.
But ignore that! The postseason hasn’t even started this year, and the league has been insane this season. The best team in the West is the 52-win Denver Nuggets, with two other teams within 3 wins of them. The Bucks, Celtics and 76ers lead the East, with 58, 57, and 54 wins respectively. The new play-in format means more playoff games, and that’s always fun!
While all these teams are having an absolute blast playing the sport, there’s always the other side. Three teams have 60+ losses, with the Pistons, the Spurs, and the Rockets all competing to get the #1 draft pick and pick up Victor Wembanyama, a phenom out of France. They’re doing a good job at tanking, though, and even if they miss Victor, they’re still guaranteed top 5 picks. So on both ends of the league, teams are doing good at what they want – losing or winning.
Except for Dallas. What the hell, Dallas? While everyone else is having a blast, the Mavs have been imploding. After posting a miserable 7-13 record since the All-Star break, the Mavericks went from “will probably make the playoffs” at 32-29 to “well, there’s always next year” at 38-43.
Which is, well, fine. The Portland Trailblazers did the same as the Mavs, holding about .500 and then careening off a cliff after the ASB. So what did the Mavs do that’s so special?
Well, for one, the Mavs have not one, but two superstars. Luka “Devin’s Daddy” Doncic and Kyrie “Basketballs are round, the Earth is flat” Irving have been putting together an excellent season, but the Mavs couldn’t make it to the postseason. And then, it seems like Doncic wants a trade. At the same time, the New York Knicks are coming a-knocking for their first-rounder this year, and the Mavs don’t have the next two years’ second rounders. Even if they wanted to make something happen, if they lose Doncic, they just don’t have the draft capital to rebuild.
Which makes losing a game to the Bulls, an elimination game at that, where they’d led by 15 at some point, a pretty big problem. I’m not sure Doncic would want to keep playing for this team, and if they can’t make a push with two incredibly good players, what’s left?
Of course, that’s not where things get really bad. The Mavs coach, Jason Kidd, got on stage, and realizing the options were to blame himself, or blame his boss, admitted that management had told him to pull players when they got hot.
Uh oh. That sounds suspiciously like admitting to throwing a game. 
But watching that game, it sure does make sense. Kidd pulled Luka after a quarter, and then he went and took a shower. He just checked alllll the way out. He pulled any player who got remotely hot, making sure that there was no way the Bulls could fumble this game away.
God knows they were trying. Like, how do you manage to go down 15 points to a team that is TRYING to lose. It was like watching hot potato, with the Mavs and the Bulls just tossing the game back and forth, trying to get the other to win. With all that, the Mavs still had a chance at tying the game with a last minute three. Sure, they missed that three, and Mark Cuban gave a little smirk, but how do you put yourself in a position to lose against a G-League team?
But this is also really serious for the NBA. If teams can admit to throwing games, there will be legal action from betting groups sports gambling companies, as suddenly collusion becomes public and gamblers can bring up massive class action lawsuits. In boxing, throwing is a felony. Adam Silver, league commissioner, is not a fan of teams trying to mess with the "integrity of his league," though he is definitely willing to have the league's "integrity" get sponsored by DraftKings. If he brings down the hammer, Mizzou might get the death pen- I mean, the Mavs might have a lot to lose.
So now, the Mavs have a coach who has gone on tape to admit that he threw a game. The league is investigating. They have a superstar who wants out, and another who thinks that the vaccine is a way of connecting African Americans to a supercomputer for Satan. They have no second round picks for two years, and if they get hit with punishments, probably lose their first this year. If they do, it means that the Knicks will be coming back in ‘24 to try to take their first rounder, again. 
Sure is a great time to a Dallas fan, I’ll tell you what.

Full disclaimer: I am not a medical professional and do not claim to be one. This article is meant only to be a helpful summary of findings based on literature I take to be trustworthy. As you’ll soon learn, birth control is highly personal. Nobody will have the same response to any one type of medicine, and under no circumstances should any form of birth control be taken as 100 percent protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases or infections. I will also not be commenting on STD prevention in this article because that can only be achieved by barriers and regular testing (and neither are considered reliable protection against pregnancy). I will also not be commenting on non-hormonal options like vasectomies, condoms, abstinence, etc., with the exception of the copper IUD. With that said, I hope I can use what I’ve learned to shed some light on the medical fogginess that is hormonal pregnancy prevention. There is a lot to say about birth control; this is just some of it. Here goes:
Estrogen does not prevent pregnancy.
There, I said it. I know, you’re completely shocked. You’re calling your mom and your middle school health teacher. You’re yelling at random people on the street. Or maybe you’re cooler than I am and you already knew that the only hormone that prevents pregnancy is progestin. Progestin prevents ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovary into the uterus, where it could potentially access sperm and become fertilized (read: a baby). Progestin stops this entire process, which halts the menstrual cycle as well, since a period is just a means to getting the egg out of the uterus when it’s been sitting there, not being a baby, for too long. Also, notice that I used the word “halt.” This means that if you’re on a form of birth control that allows you to stop and bleed once a month, you are not having a period; there is no egg to release. Birth control bleeding happens because when you take your break week, the sudden lack of hormones tricks your body into thinking it’s time to bleed, since the normal cycle takes a hormone dip just before the period.
So why are we even talking about estrogen when progestin is obviously the star of the show? The thing is that estrogen is important for a lot of things. It is the key player in the circular dance of the female reproductive cycle, moving up and down in elegant and predictable patterns every month. That’s why some birth control methods include estrogen — not because it actually controls birth, but because it can supplement and stabilize you when you’re using medication to intentionally change your cycle. In the right doses, it keeps your bones healthy, clears up your skin, lowers the risk of certain cancers, and turns you into Cinderella at midnight. Obviously, I’m not sold. Estrogen can be damaging to the stomach and cause the “brain fog” or depression that is listed as a side effect on some birth control methods. The point is that choosing a method of birth control is not just about how convenient or effective it is, but also about considering what ingredients you’re ingesting and how they will affect your body, mind, and the inner werewolf that’s controlled by the cycles of the moon. 
Also, estrogen in medications is called ethinyl estradiol. Progestin is just one of a family of hormones called progestogens and is replaced in medications by levonorgestrel (which is actually similar to testosterone). Do not panic when you see these molecules listed on birth control packaging: They are synthetic derivatives of the real deal, chosen because of their ability to deliver similar results. However, do be aware that they are not identical and should not be treated as such.
Some forms of hormonal birth control are seemingly localized to the fertilization organ: the uterus. These include Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) and the ring. 
The hormonal Intrauterine Device (IUD; as opposed to the non-hormonal version), uses progestin to thicken cervical mucus as it sits inside the uterus. It can also prevent ovulation, which is typically the end game of birth control, but since the hormones are so localized to the reproductive organ, it takes a more physiological route: using the mucus as a physical barrier against sperm. The hormone sits in a little vial inside the device and leaks out at a controlled rate over the course of five to eight years, depending on the brand. Because the delivery is so constant, if it does prevent ovulation for you, it will stop your period or significantly shorten it. It must be inserted and removed surgically, and can become infected or release itself over time.
The non-hormonal IUD uses copper, which apparently sperm really hate. The release of copper ions into cervical mucus essentially makes it spermicidal. Science is neat, and in this case 99 percent effective!
The ring is deceptive: even though it sits right in the cervix, it releases hormones (both estrogen and progestin) directly into the bloodstream through the walls of the vagina. Despite how weird it may seem to keep something up there for so long, it really will not move until you pull it out because it is shaped the same as the area where the vagina meets the cervix. It stops ovulation and should be taken out once a month to allow for bleeding.  Depending on the brand, you can replace the ring the next month with the same one you’ve been using for up to a year or a new one each month. It is 93 percent effective.
Some forms of birth control release hormones constantly throughout the body. One such example is the implant, which is placed (and removed, both surgically) in the upper arm, and works similarly to the hormonal IUD except that the progestin it contains runs through the entire body as opposed to being localized in the uterus. This means that it definitely stops ovulation (with a 99 percent pregnancy prevention rate) while also thickening cervical mucus. It can be kept for about five years. 
No matter how many sources I look at, I cannot wrap my head around how the Depo-Provera shot actually works. Like some of the other options I’ve talked about, the shot is just slow released progestin, but for the life of me I cannot understand how they can inject three months of a hormone into your bloodstream and expect it to release at a constant rate. Like so many things with birth control, this one might just remain an unfortunate and kind of misogynistic mystery. What I do know is that it lasts three months, is 96 percent effective, and is given just like any other injection.
The patch works similarly to the ring, and is 93 percent effective. It needs to be replaced every week, skipping every fourth week for bleeding. It releases both progestin and estrogen and can be placed on the back, the butt, or the shoulder.
Then there’s the birth control pill. I could say a lot about the pill, mostly because there isn’t just one, contrary to popular belief. The list of pills may be long, but they all differ in the same respect: the ratio of hormones they contain. Every pill contains progestin, though not always in the same amount. Not all pills contain estrogen. Pills that contain estrogen are known as combination pills. Pills that do not are known as progestin-only. They can be prescribed for a myriad of different purposes, with the hormonal ratio changing depending on what you need. The main difference is that you must take progestin-only pills exactly 24 hours apart, whereas there is a little more leeway with combination pills because estrogen acts as a stabilizer. You take the pill every day for three weeks and then take a one week break. The pill is considered to be 93 percent effective because of the potential for forgetting a pill or taking one late. If you’re going to take the pill, you’d better be good at remembering to do it at the same time every day, and you’d better not make the mistake of taking the first pill on the list without deciding which ratio of hormones is right for you. You can also use some pills (and some patches) to skip your periods by continuing to take them with no break. Do this only with the knowledge that you are disrupting a cycle that your body considers extremely important.
In fact, take any of these options with that knowledge. Pregnancy was never meant to be prevented, and doing so by tampering with the extremely complex female reproductive cycle has consequences. For those of you who are currently yelling “What about male birth control!?”, new research announced this February shows promising options for temporarily disabling sperm mobility. Maybe the time has finally arrived for uterus-havers to not have to worry about the last 1,000 words I just wrote. For now though, I hope I’ve been able to spit some facts for anyone feeling like Carnegie Mellon is not the place to raise a baby.

        We're testing a new look for The Tartan. Let us know what you think!

Particulate matter in the air may not be visible, but its effect on health can be very real. Carnegie Mellon’s campus is no exception. That’s the current focus of a junior-level class in Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), where a group of students is currently studying air quality levels around campus. Their main goal is to better understand air particulates and determine what can be done to avoid the worst of their impact.
The course “Experimental & Sensing Systems Design” aims to teach students how to use a system of sensors to take and analyze measurements that may be useful in their field of engineering. It’s co-taught by Fethiye Ozis and Sarah Christian, professors in the CEE department. Ozis, who focuses on sustainability and environmental research, developed this semester’s project with the city of Pittsburgh in mind.
“Pittsburgh is known for its air quality issues,” Ozis said in an interview with The Tartan. She follows air quality issues with her students in CEE and is passionate about it, having done her Ph.D. research in the subject. It stood out as the ideal topic to choose for her sensing class, all the more relevant now after recent toxic events like the train derailment in East Palestine, revealing unseen pollution sources and the cracks in today’s aging infrastructure.
The class worked with Carnegie Mellon’s facilities department to develop the project and acquire the necessary sensing equipment, talking with facilities management and the University Engineer Steven Guenther. Facilities management invested in 15 sensors that the students could deploy. Capable of sensing particulates in the air at a width of 2.5 micrometers, matter known as PM 2.5, the sensors by PurpleAir are low-cost and provide publicly available data the students can access and investigate.
The teams set out with particular research questions they wanted to answer as a result of their data collection — when is the safest time to exercise outdoors? Are there patterns for when air quality peaks and falls? Are there any locations of concern on campus? How does campus air quality compare to the Pittsburgh region? Lastly, the teams contemplated the best ways to inform community members about their findings, the local air quality situation, and any associated risks.
The project teaches students how to run an environmental sensing system, but it also aims to inform the campus community, which the students and faculty are particularly excited about. It gives the students a chance to get involved with the school, working on a scale large enough to make a real impact on the university community. They’ve done work from setting up the sensors to making final evaluations, with the ultimate goal of helping people avoid harmful air particles when possible.
One basic finding is that air quality can fluctuate day-to-day and even hour-to-hour, Ozis explained. People on campus with preexisting lung conditions, such as asthma, may be more sensitive to those changes. Knowing when high-Air Quality Index (AQI) times occur can be very informative. Respiratory aggravations can potentially be avoided by limiting outdoor activity during certain hours or days, at which point “indoor air quality is better than outdoor air quality,” Ozis said.
A main learning objective for the course is for the students to set up the experiment, collecting and analyzing the data themselves. To better understand what the sensors are and what they’re capable of, the class was assigned to read the work of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, to get an understanding of how the sensors work, the theory behind them and how they can be used to answer the group’s research questions. The Center conducted air quality analysis at the East Palestine derailment site earlier this year.
The sensors used in the students’ project were first calibrated in the CEE basement laboratory and adjusted to Pittsburgh’s specific air standards. Each device was tested in-house for two days to make sure it was of good enough quality, giving accurate enough measurements to be deployed. The campus and surrounding area were divided into five sections, with each team assigned a certain area to research. Over two days, the sensors were placed in carefully selected locations based on wind direction and ambient pollution sources which may be impacting the community.
Each team had three sensors to place, with the only constraint being the need to connect to a power source. Students attempted to cover the area as well as possible, placing sensors based on where air pollution might be stemming from. They considered Bellefield Boiler Plant, a power station nearby to campus, as one point source, as well as busy roadways such as Forbes and Fifth avenues as possible line sources of pollution. Being able to deploy a large number of sensors allows for “a good map of what's really happening,” Ozis said.
The sensors have been collecting data since February 22, taking a sample of air quality every 10 minutes and posting the publicly available results live on the PurpleAir website. After collecting the data, the class will spend time making sense of it all, aiming to answer the research questions they set out with. Each team will present their findings in a final presentation as the project’s conclusion, with the goal of eventually sharing that knowledge with the school to improve campus wellbeing.

On April 3, NASA announced the crew of the next manned mission to the moon. While the crew will just be doing a lunar orbit, they will be the first in over 50 years to travel beyond low orbit around Earth.
The Artemis II mission is NASA’s first mission with a crew that will utilize their Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft. The goal of the mission is to confirm all of the spacecraft’s systems are working as intended with a crew in the environment of deep space. The mission looks to pave the way for future lunar surface missions and establish long-term lunar science and exploration capabilities. NASA has dubbed the astronauts in these missions “The Artemis Generation.” 
A crew of four will be on the 10-day Artemis II mission. The commander for the mission will be NASA Astronaut G. Reid Wiseman. During his 165-day mission on the International Space Station, Wiseman served as Flight Engineer and spent time with his crew researching human physiology, medicine, physical science, Earth science, and astrophysics. Wiseman spent almost 13 hours of spacewalking on that mission, his first spaceflight. He previously served as the Chief of the Astronaut Office. Notably, Wiseman has a sizable social media presence on Twitter, where he posts pictures of his missions. 
NASA Astronaut Victor J. Glover, Jr. will be serving as the pilot and second-in-command of the Artemis II mission. While serving as a Legislative Fellow in the U.S. Senate in 2013, Glover was selected as an astronaut. Recently, he served as pilot and second-in-command on the Crew-1 SpaceX Crew Dragon named Resilience. It landed May 2, 2021. Previously, Glover served as Flight Engineer on the International Space Station. He has completed a total of 168 days in orbit and participated in four spacewalks. 
NASA Astronaut Christina H. Koch will be serving as Mission Specialist I during the Artemis II mission. Serving in Expeditions 59, 60, and 61 on the International Space Station, Koch holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman with a total of 328 days in space. She also participated in the first all-female spacewalks. 
Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut Jeremy Hansen will be joining the Artemis II mission as the first Canadian (and non-American) to travel to space. In 2017, Hansen became the first Canadian to be entrusted with leading a NASA astronaut class, meaning he trained astronaut candidates from the U.S. and Canada. This will be Hansen’s first spaceflight. 
The Artemis II mission is currently planned to launch in November 2024. Some speculate that the need to recycle and refurbish components from Orion’s Artemis I flight may push the launch to later in 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.

Every installment of "From the Archives" — nay, every article I have ever written for this paper — is but a prelude to this. Before you is the culmination of 18 months of on-and-off work; publishing this was half the reason I joined The Tartan. In short, I have discovered that everything you've been told about The Fence is a lie, and I'm here to (partially) set the record straight. I don't have all the answers, but I have enough; and as we rapidly approach our beloved Fence's 100th birthday, it's high time somebody gets the facts out there. 
So let's talk about the lies. The most common story of The Fence — the ones that tour guides tell prospective students — goes as follows:
Back in ye olden days, the Cut was a proper ravine, over which spanned a bridge. The men of Carnegie Tech, rizz kings that they were, would leave notes and such for the dames of Maggie Mo as they traversed the bridge. But eventually, the Cut filled and the students lost their meeting point. So they constructed a fence to replace it, a place where the men and women of the sibling schools could once again meet and mingle. Until the dastardly administration grew weary, and made plans to tear it down. But! The night before its demolition, a frat painted over The Fence to advertise a party — and boy was it the most rockin' party ever seen on this side of Craig Street. It was so popular that administration relented and The Fence has been a student billboard ever since. It stood until 1993, when it collapsed and was replaced with a steel-reinforced concrete Fence.  
What a cute story! Just a few questions. Which frat painted The Fence? And when did this party happen? And how long was The Fence around before it got painted? Also, take a moment to consider the geography of campus — the Cut used to run from the tennis courts to the hollow between Doherty and Gates. That doesn't at all stop you from walking from the Mall to the front entrance Maggie Mo, does it? 
So, an inquisitive mind might take to Google for clarification, and discover the delightful Wikipedia page on Carnegie Mellon traditions, with a whole section about The Fence! It tells essentially the same story. It cites two web pages: a Tartan article, and a defunct page on the CIT website, neither of which are very helpful. (There's a third relevant citation added by yours truly, but we'll get to that in part 2). 
So let's say you check out this lovely little 2014 article from Atlas Obscura, which tells us, "Carnegie Mellon University Students Painted a fence for 70 years…it would collapse under the weight of all those coats in 1993." So 1923 must have been the year it was first painted, great! 
But wait. 30 seconds into a video on the official CMU YouTube page, our narrator says that The Fence must be painted with "1930s technology"? That doesn't really line up with the 1923 argument, does it?
It gets worse. In a 2015 article from the New York Times, bastion of journalistic integrity they are, we get the frustratingly vague line, "[it] collapsed in 1993 under the weight of some 50 years of paint." So 1943? Do they mean that in the middle of the WWII draft that frats were hoppin' enough to throw parties? 
Oh, but we still have more potential dates. In 2014, Amusing Planet told us, "For the last 70 years, students have been using The Fence as the unofficial campus billboard." I really want to believe that their "70 years" figure is a misunderstanding of the 70-year period between 1923 and 1993 reported by so many other sources, but if we take them at their word they're claiming the Fence was first painted in 1944. So we have about a two decade margin of error for the initial painting of The Fence, not to mention that we don't know how much time passed between its construction and the alleged frat party.
But we're not even close to being finished with the confusion! You see, the stories which circulate about The Fence are not static. Early on, I received a tip that the fourth floor women's bathroom in the west wing of Doherty has a poster (pictured here) with a history of The Fence. Except, it's just a weird allegory about why you should wash your hands. Yet, it cites a book — "Carnegie Mellon: A Centennial History." This is a genuine history book, written by Edwin Fenton, former dean at Carnegie Mellon, in 2000. If you check this book out of the Hunt library and turn to page 91 (or 6 in pillbox), you'll see that absolutely none of what this poster says is actually in the book. I don't mean to get conspiratorial, but it feels like someone is pulling the strings here to waste my time.
If you speak with alumni, you'll also learn that in the 90s, it was said that The Fence used to denote the boundary of an old cow pasture — the kernel of truth, no doubt, is that the plot of land on which our university sits used to be "Chadwick Farms." But this seems no more plausible than our bridge-frat story.
With yet another conflicting story, Bob Reppe, the University Master Architect, tells us in a video on the CMU Instagram that The Fence was built to keep people from falling into the Cut. Not entirely implausible, because Margaret Morrison Avenue (formerly Woodlawn Street) used to extend through campus along what are currently pedestrian paths. It's not hard to imagine there would have been a guardrail of sorts. So put that in the "maybe" pile? 
Let's pause and take a sidebar to talk about dirt. The Cut is pretty damn big, so where did all that dirt come from? Bob, in the earlier video, says the landfill came from the leveling of Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh. Wikipedia agrees that Grant Street was leveled in 1912, citing the book "Downtown Pittsburgh" by Stuart Boehmig. So I got this book from the library, but it sadly has no word on where the dirt was sent. So I reached out to Bob Reppe himself, who told me that this information came from an old colleague of his from the county records office who has since passed. So perhaps the one person with answers is no longer with us. 
But in contrast to the Grant Street hypothesis, the Wikipedia page on Carnegie Mellon says, "The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine … with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building." They make no citations.
"The Story of Carnegie Tech" is a history book written in 1935 by former Dean of CIT Arthur Wilson Tarbell, a copy of which I was kindly gifted by the University Archives. Wikipedia is, surprisingly, vindicated because on page 132 we learn that "a hill 43 feet high was cut down to provide a location for the College of Fine Arts … gradually, the ravine has been reduced in width and depth by influx of earth from both sides." Most likely, a bit of Grant Street, the CFA hill, and other bits of uneven ground were all dumped into the Cut to provide the level path between the Mall and Forbes Avenue that was so coveted by Hornbostel. 
Oh yeah, that's a sidebar to this sidebar that I learned in "Centennial History." If you want further proof that there was never a bridge across the Cut, on page 37 we are told that Henry Hornbostel, the original campus architect, apparently always wanted a bridge to cross the Cut and connect campus to Forbes Ave — implying he never got one.
Last word on the dirt. While it's hard to pinpoint an exact year for when the Cut was filled, on page 207 of "The Story of Carnegie Tech," we have a picture of a unit of soldiers lined up on the Cut from 1917, putting an upper bound on when it could have been filled.  
No more sidebars, I have one final lie to debunk. Nearly every source claims that The Fence held the Guinness World Record for "most painted object in the world" prior to 1993. In fact, if you Google those exact words you get an answer box from this gorgeously designed page by the School of Computer Science. Except, as someone who used to incessantly read the Guinness books as a child, I could have sworn once I read something different. Sure enough, the Guinness site itself tells us this record was earned in 2004 by a baseball coated in several feet of paint, easily beating The Fence.
But what if.  What if The Fence won this record prior to 1993, before Guinness started documenting records online? Before Michael Carmichael of Alexandria, Indiana started painting his baseball? The only way to verify that would be to go through physical editions of the Guinness Book of World Records for every possible year The Fence could have won this record. And that would be preposterous, wouldn't it?
So of course, my roommate and I went to CLP Main and asked the very nice librarian at the reference desk for every copy of the Guinness Book of World Records prior to 1993 in their collections. And 30 minutes later, a very disgruntled librarian gave us seven such copies. While checking these, it dawned on us that "most painted object" was simply not a record back in the olden days. Before Guinness revamped its look in the early 2000s with iridescent covers, gigantic images, and ridiculous records ("most straws fit in a mouth while hula-hooping underwater"), their art and sculpture section was much more dignified. Most expensive painting, largest painting, and most prolific painter are there, but nothing as frivolous as "most painted object." It's here I reveal my hand a little bit and tell you that at this point in my research, I had solid proof that painting the Fence has only been a tradition since, at the earliest, the late 50s. So we only checked as far back as 1960.
But what if. What if there was a one-off edition sometime between 1960 and 1993 where they introduced this award just to give it to the Fence. So I made an account on the Internet Archive and checked out copies of every edition we couldn't get our hands on, and sure enough absolutely none of them mention our beloved Fence. (Sidenote, if The Internet Archive loses its appeal in this ongoing suit I couldn't have done the search.)
I admit there is a chance I missed it. Maybe buried somewhere in the tens of thousands of pages of records published by Guinness since 1960 lies our Fence, waiting for someone to find it. But seeing as Guinness has yet to respond to any of my emails, I'll have to Occam's-razor this one and say the rumor is probably not true. 
I've just spent almost 2,000 words telling you what the Fence isn't. You might be wondering, "Gee, Will, where is all that nice archival research you were telling me about?" Don't fret, I will reveal everything soon enough. In part 2, and then just a bit more in part 3. So stick around so I can tell you all the interesting things I've learned. In truth, I didn't find all I had hoped for. But I outline what else can be done, in case some future researcher with slightly more dedication and slightly fewer credit hours decides to actually get to the bottom of this.

Sex, drugs, and rock & roll. This is the foundation of Amazon’s new television series “Daisy Jones & The Six,” based on the novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. The show, set in the characteristic '70s haze, follows the rise and fall of a rock band that is loosely based on the story of Fleetwood Mac. Starring Sam Claflin as band leader Billy Dunne and Riley Keough (Elvis’s granddaughter) as the titular Daisy Jones, the world of this series has caught the attention and adoration of many. For fans of Reid, '70s rock music and fashion, and Finnick from the "Hunger Games," Daisy Jones was a highly anticipated release. As someone who falls into all three of those categories, I can say that I was mildly disappointed in the show’s execution. Here’s why.
I read the novel “Daisy Jones & The Six” a few years ago. I had previously picked up Reid’s other bestseller “The Seven Lives of Evelyn Hugo” and was transported. Reid has a talent for creating fictional characters who seem so real that you feel like you could make a quick Google search and find them credited on some of the most influential movies and music of the past 50 years. The show captures this convincingly realistic fiction style well.
It begins in our beloved Pittsburgh, where Billy Dunne and his brother Graham start a band with some of their high school friends. The Pittsburgh shoutout gave me a good first impression of the series, especially the odes to Giant Eagle and steel mills that are characteristic to the city we all call home. However, this rosy lens was quickly shattered when the story shifted to the formation of the band. Billy is played by Sam Claflin, who is currently 36 years old. His character ranges in age from about 18 through 28 over the course of the show. Claflin, typical to people in their mid-30s, has some smile lines around his eyes and very obviously does not look like an 18 or 19-year-old. Of course, this is a minor detail, but it made me feel disconnected from the youthful hope and naïveté that are essential to Billy’s character in the beginning of the story.
After the band forms, they make the life-changing decision to move from humble Pittsburgh to bustling Los Angeles, the hub of the music scene. There, they use their scrappy wits and charm to secure a spot playing gigs at a dive bar aptly called Filthy McNasty’s. The band, now called The Six, get a record deal and go on a tour that falls apart due to Billy’s alcohol addiction. While trying to pick up the pieces from their tour disaster, we are launched into the crux of the story. The Six’s manager suggests that they try collaborating on their new song with the one and only Daisy Jones, who has been cultivating a music career of her own during this time.
This development leads us into the main plot of the series and we are rewarded for our long wait with lots of dramatic conflict between the two firecracker personalities of Daisy and Billy. One unique aspect of this series is that its release was accompanied by the release of the album that Daisy Jones and The Six write, record, and perform in the show. This album, “AURORA,” is available for us to listen to — and I must say, it is very impressively done and catchy. The vocals and instrumentals are done by the actual cast members who were put into a weeks-long “band camp” to prepare for their roles as actual band members. I do admire this feature of the show. Reading the book, I remember not being able to imagine the songs that Daisy and Billy wrote because they were just words on a paper. But the well-crafted melodies written by a variety of musicians including Phoebe Bridgers and Marcus Mumford work to bring the band alive and authentically carry that addictive quality found in the drama of the story and characters. I think that the songs are delightful, especially the powerhouse vocals from Keough, and have been listening to them on repeat since the series came out. A few of my favorites are “Let Me Down Easy,” “Kill You to Try,” and “The River.” All are certainly a labor of love from the team that went into creating them, and this is palpable in the music.
Despite thoroughly enjoying the finished product of “AURORA,” I found the portrayal of creating the album in the show to be lacking. First of all, the process of writing the album only spans about three episodes. Billy and Daisy are shown experimenting with lyrics and learning how to compromise on their ideas, but only for a few songs on the album are we given the motive or the meaning of the lyrics. In this way, I felt that the series missed out on the depth that the book includes. And while this is probably a result of the limited space of a TV mini-series, I thought the omission of an explanation of all the songs on the album that made the band a world-wide success left me unsatisfied.
The aesthetics of “Daisy Jones” are what drew many to the series in the first place. On the contrary, I believe that the makeup and costumes looked just a bit too curated to be realistic to the time period and Reid’s writing. Every character’s makeup is carefully done even if it is supposed to look messy, and their outfits were obviously chosen by a stylist team. I think this could have been overlooked if not for the blatant commercialization of the Daisy Jones “brand.” In the weeks after the show’s release, I was bombarded with advertisements about Daisy Jones collections from major fashion and beauty brands. The fact that the arrival of these ads was almost simultaneous with the series being unveiled to the public suggests that this was one of the motives of the series — to create revenue based on fans’ desires to be just like Daisy Jones. This commodification of media rubbed me the wrong way and felt like some marketing scheme to launch a carefully planned new fashion craze.
Overall, “Daisy Jones & The Six” missed the mark for me. I really wanted to love it, and I did enjoy some aspects of it like the music and the setting. But mostly, it was an oversimplified version of the novel that worked to capitalize on its audience. This does not sully my opinion of the novel or Reid’s other works, though, which I do recommend that you check out. In the meantime, I will continue to listen to “AURORA” and pretend that this show lived up to my expectations.

Hayao Miazaki’s profound love for airplanes, which we see throughout many of his films, is frank even in the name of Studio Ghibli. The Caproni Ca.309 "Ghibli" was a fighter plane used by the Kingdom of Italy on the African Front in World War Two. Fun fact, the plane that is used by Donald Curtis, the antagonist in “Porco Rosso” (1992). 
Also a fun fact, “Porco Rosso” is not a bad film. “Porco Rosso's” beautifully choreographed action and animation is some of the best that we’ve ever gotten from Ghibli. Perhaps it takes a certain appreciation for Golden Age of Hollywood WW2-era noir films to appreciate the love letter that “Porco Rosso” is supposed to be, with constant references to films like “Casablanca” (1942) littered throughout it. But the high praise that I can spill for “Porco Rosso” is not my universal sentiment for the entirety of Studio Ghibli’s filmography. As a matter of fact, there are many not-so-good Studio Ghibli films which many people probably haven’t ever heard about.
“Ocean Waves” (1992) is a made-for-television, low-budget romantic drama that was directed by neither Hayao Miazaki nor Isao Takahata, and was meant to be a short and cheap film created by the studio’s youngest animators. With a runtime of 72 minutes, it is the shortest Ghibli film they’ve ever produced, yet it is a terribly paced and uneventful picture that feels like an eternity. It has a grounded and simple setting which has to go further to achieve the audiences’ interest, and it falls short in that regard for a number of reasons. Taking place in Kōchi, the film centers around a love triangle between two high school best friends, Taku and Yutaka, both competing for Rikako, an attractive and mysterious transfer student that has entered both their lives. 
The story, summed up, is two friends falling out over a troubled girl who never liked them to begin with, not to mention the many issues and rumored issues that they get into over her. Then several years later, upon reuniting as a class, Yutaka claims that he used to be angry at Taku for not pursuing Rikako because Taku lost a chance at love because of him. The film ends with Taku realizing that he had always been in love with Rikako, the final shot being him smiling. We the audience, however, are not smiling. “Ocean Waves” is unrewarding, failing in delivering a worthwhile message. If it teaches any lesson, it would probably be to not waste your time chasing a one-sided relationship, or perhaps don’t break your bond with your friend over a girl. 
At least one can speculate a meaning from “Ocean Waves,” unlike Ghibli’s worst rated film, “Tales of Earthsea” (2006). If “Ocean Waves” was a stroll on a beach, “Earthsea” is a marathon in the desert. The film is supposed to be a challenge to nihilism. It shows a world in which there are terrible things that people do, and that even in such a world, we are able to derive purpose in ourselves. It’s a worthy message that, if not executed correctly, could leave the audience discontented, and to that, “Tales of Earthsea” does discontent. 
Although Lamarckism has had no credibility since the late 1800s, Studio Ghibli still decided to give this film to Miyazaki’s son, Gorō Miyazaki, who had never directed a film before at that point. “Earthsea's” biggest problem, apart from its length, is the half-baked philosophical argument that it embodies, with our main character Arren attempting to have optimism and purpose against the villain's cynical and destructive way of thinking. It strays time and time again from the source material to the point of being a different story altogether. The books, by most accounts, do not struggle in presenting a well made argument against cynicism. Such a message is so congenial with Ghibli’s type of storytelling that it would seem hard to mess up.
This is not an attempt to pour cold water on things that people like. This is an honest look at what makes some of their films so good by looking at what makes others so bad. Watching them gives you a greater appreciation for the art of animation, and although I wouldn’t recommend them in the traditional sense, for the most dedicated fans, they are not the worst movies in existence. As a person who has gone out of their way to watch more films from Ghibli than the average person probably cares for, I can say that they are interesting art pieces, and more interesting in how often they are looked over. Blemishes are on all artist’s portfolios, but they still make them what they are, so I guess take this as a celebration of them.

On March 31, indie supergroup boygenius released their debut album, “the record.” The group consists of famous sad women: Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker. As someone who was a fan of their group EP from 2018 as well as music from each of their solo careers, this album felt like "Avengers: Endgame" for sad women. And I have to say — “the record” did not disappoint. From upbeat rock-style tunes like “$20” and “Satanist” to gut-punching ballads like “Revolution 0” and “We’re in Love,” “the record” has it covered. There’s not a single skip on the 12-song album in my opinion, and I’m going to give you my rundown of each tune.
“Without You Without Them” – The album opens with Bridgers’, Dacus’, and Baker’s voices blended together in pleasing harmony with no accompaniment. While this song is shorter than the others (only 1:22), it’s probably one of the most tempting to sing along to for me. The message about personal connection is sweet and sentimental.
“$20” – Energetic percussion and instrumentals is what begins this song, a stark contrast from "Without You Without Them." Baker sings lead with backing vocals from Bridgers and Dacus, and the tone is rebellious and exciting. Their voices blend together really nicely at the end again, reminding listeners just how powerful this supergroup is. One of my favorites on the album.
“Emily I’m Sorry” – Bridgers takes the lead on this song, slow and reflective. Like the title implies, the lyrics are full of guilt as she apologizes for how she’s behaved in the past and who she’s becoming. The lyric “I can feel myself becoming somebody I’m not” is one of my favorites here and really sums up the regret that comes with change.
“True Blue” – Of the four songs that were released prior to the rest of the album (the others being “$20,” “Emily I’m Sorry,” and “Not Strong Enough”), this one may be my favorite. Dacus leads this one, singing about her personal connection with another person over a long period of time. The chorus gives me chills each time I hear it – the feeling of being known so well by another person is articulated beautifully and something that we can all find ourselves wanting.
“Cool About It” – Baker, Dacus, and Bridgers take separate turns singing verses in this song sampled from Simon & Garfunkel’s “The Boxer.” The melody is simple and familiar, but the lyrics are about deeply personal struggles of trying to communicate with someone you care about. Bridgers’ verse at the end is the heart-breaking finale to an already emotional song.
“Not Strong Enough” – While this song is upbeat and one to nod your head along to, the lyrics are about experiences with anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I especially like the chorus of this song, once again featuring the perfect blend of their voices together. The message of the song is relatable and it’s a great pick if you want a song to scream along to.
“Revolution 0” – Bridgers leads this slow ballad about depression in a thoughtful and personal way, bringing in similar vibes to her “Punisher” album. This song made me cry when I first heard it, especially at the lyrics “if you’re not enough, then I give up and then nothing is.” One of my favorites on “the record” upon first listen.
“Leonard Cohen” – An upbeat song to counter the tears from “Revolution 0,” “Leonard Cohen” is a sweet and short song lead by Dacus about being grateful for another person and the connection found in a road trip. The tune is pleasant and positive, including a quote from Leonard Cohen to give the song its name.
“Satanist” – Baker is the first to sing on this rock-n-roll type song, with similar intense instrumentals to those heard on “$20.” Rebellious and containing sentiments of punk, the three sing about being anarchists together. However, the tone shifts towards the end into a dreamy ballad about nihilism, which is a nice contrast to the aggressive feel from the beginning.
“We’re In Love” – This is one of the most personal and tear-jerking songs on this album to me. Sung by Dacus, the slow melody accompanied by the intimate lyrics about trust and bonding move me so deeply. My favorite part is when she describes how they’ll find each other in their next lives – “there is something about you that I will always recognize,” Dacus sings. If I had to choose, this may be my favorite song on the whole album.
“Anti-Curse” – Baker picks up the pace again with this song about nostalgia and the thoughts that accompany dying. While the melody is faster and contains energy, Baker’s lyrics are thoughtful and have a tone of regret to them. “Tried to be a halfway decent friend, wound up a bad comedian,” she sings. I especially liked what goes unspoken in her lyrics but is heard in her voice.
“Letter to an Old Poet” – Such a beautiful song to close out this beautiful album. Sung by Bridgers, this song encapsulates the difficult feelings that come with realizing someone you love is not a good person. To finish the album, there’s a callback to the 2018 boygenius song “Me & My Dog,” with altered lyrics following the same melody that every boygenius fan is all too familiar with. “I can’t feel it yet, but I am waiting,” the three harmonize as the album closes out.
If you haven’t yet given “the record” a listen, I (obviously) highly recommend it. Packed with emotion and deep thoughts, the lyrics are unmatched — not to mention the memorable melodies that go along with them. boygenius is everything someone who listens to the modern indie genre could ask for, and “the record” is evidence of this. There’s something for everyone on this album — so go take 42 minutes out of your day to find out what that may be.

The Super Mario movie is the culmination of an incalculable amount of accumulated hours that so many of us have spent glued to a screen controlling a portly Italian plumber in a fever-dream world. Translating that to the screen, Nintendo employed Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, the creators of “Teen Titans Go!”, to the directors’ chairs, along with Illumination Studios of "Minions" fame. Having such veterans making this movie, you could tell that Nintendo was covering their bases, ensuring that this film was not going to be a repeat of their live-action box-office failure, “Super Mario Bros.” (1993). Given the success that this movie is generating, it is possible that Nintendo might consider lending their other IPs to studios to make more movies. I would not be surprised if a “The Legend Of Zelda Movie” becomes a reality.
Unlike previous but recent video game/movie adaptations, like “Pokemon: Detective Pikachu” (2019) or “Sonic the Hedgehog” (2020), “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” completely embraces computer generated animation, rather than having the off-putting blend of reality with hyper-realistic cartoon creatures. The movie looks great, but the story is nothing to write home about, as was expected. People play Mario games not for their story, but for the imaginative journey they take you on. Even without a non-formulaic story, the Mario movie has so much washing over the audience. Pure stimulation and constant references to icons of the franchise come one after another, giving you no time to stop, which gets exhausting by the second act. There is little time to let the audience breathe. If the film slowed down a notch or two, allowing for emotional scenes to have their dramatic pauses or allowing characters to develop rather than having them standing on hot coals to progress the plot as fast as possible, it would be a far better film.
Another issue with the film is the untapped potential to explore the relationship between the two plumber brothers. The film starts off with letting us in on the relationship the brothers share, and seems to wish to build up a story where both Mario and Luigi go on an adventure, until Luigi is taken away for the majority of the picture. Dodging this plot to make it about saving Luigi failed to add a real story that this film could have greatly benefited from. 
The voice acting was well-done. Many big names bring our beloved characters to life, although that is not to say that it is without controversy. Some people have taken to social media to boo at the choice to make Chris Pratt our Jumpman, as opposed to the official voice of Mario for the past 32 years, Charles Martinet. It would probably not work to have Charles Martinet’s high-pitched and energetic caricature voice for 92 minutes without annoying audiences. In any of his games, we never see Mario give a speech or anything other than enthusiastic noises. All of a sudden making Mario’s silly Italian voice speak full sentences with serious emotion would not go over well. Allowing for a different recognizable voice to portray Mario seems like a reasonable change for Nintendo, and one that avoided more opposition from audiences than it has generated on social media. At no time in this film should the audience be annoyed by Chris Pratt’s Mario voice, nor any voice for that matter. Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black (who is criminally underused) as Bowser and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong are most memorable in the movie, with most other voice actors being replaceable with other names without changing much of the movie.
Critics have had a field day ripping this film a new one, although I cannot possibly see what one gets from dogging films not made for their high brows. Despite what they say, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is not rotten. It’s for children who like Mario and adults who were raised on Nintendo, and if one turns off the grumpy fun-hating buzzkills, they might be able to walk out of the theatre skipping.

Ceci,
I'm really sorry I haven't visited your grave until now. I know you're just a train ride away from the city, but I couldn't bring myself to go while I was getting my second and third Ph.Ds. It was too much to confront the fact that you were truly gone, so I just kept working, working, working. It was the only thing that I could do anymore. Clair passed away not too long ago, and it gave me the chance to reconnect with the kids. Both Roy and Alex have kids of their own now, isn't that crazy? It feels like just a couple weeks ago they were moving off to college. 
But things have just gotten too chaotic. I have no idea what else to do, so I'm writing to you once again. I thought, "Imaginary Cecilia would know how to deal with this." I guess I should catch you up on the last couple decades.
Things started so well. I retired from my position at Stanford, because I was the oldest person on their faculty by a wide margin. I thought perhaps I had finally outgrown higher education entirely. But my brain was as sharp as it ever was, thanks in no small part to JuVen. I had decades and decades of knowledge, few in the world could come close to my level of experience. So it was practically a shoe-in to become lead scientist for the propulsion lab at Orbital Logistics. They needed somebody with comprehensive physics knowledge to make their rockets better, and I just fully invested myself in the work. I felt for the first time that I was working for the future of humanity. I mean, space travel is the future right?
But it wasn't really the future I was working for. I was personally in contact with the CEO, Ernest Doherty. If you were still alive you'd know exactly who he is. He's just a bit after your time I guess — the Elon Musk of the 22nd century, you might say. Jesus, remember that guy? I've been alive way too long. 
I knew from the start Doherty was just as much a robber baron as fucking Carnegie. I should have known it wasn't worth it, but my work was the only place I got meaning anymore. So I ignored him, and just assumed that if we got humanity to space we would enter the Star-Trek utopian age we were always destined for. But he was operating on the same old-school business tactics that caused all our problems this past century. 
You really died too early to see all that stuff go down, didn't you? Yeah, I had to hop around the world for a little while to wait for things to calm down in the U.S. But that was fine, because my work required me to travel anyway. I probably visited every country that has a functioning space program, because my team was far and away the absolute best at what we did. God, I've been so busy, Cecilia. We probably advanced humanity's colonization of space by a hundred years, modestly. 
Sometimes I wonder if I would have served the world better if I had been a creative writing major, like you. I'm completely serious. Your work really meant something to your readers. It shames me to admit, but I looked down on your career my whole life. I had dreams of greatness, and I truly believed that I was the person whose breakthroughs would launch our species into the stars. But when I brought us there, it turned out nothing changed. 
You caught the earliest stages of the lunar industry, but unsurprisingly things really picked up once more countries could get to space for cheaper. I actually went there, believe it or not, at no less than 120 years of age. You'd never guess it looking at me, though. 120 is the new 60, they say. 
What sent me over the edge was when I met a kid whose parents died during an accident at their job — both at the same time, like mine. The child was well-off, to be sure. Doherty knew how to compensate the victims of collateral damage. Except this was a literal child, who had only known a world where industrial accidents on the Moon were commonplace. A world I helped create. 
I tried to convince Doherty to divest from the company him and I had built. I pleaded with him to change, to tell you the truth. When that didn't work, I threatened to leak documents, to smear his name, to systematically undo everything I had built in the last forty years. But I can't maneuver the way his lawyers can, and nothing came of it. I was ousted unceremoniously, and his people will tail me for the rest of my life. 
I had a dream the first night I got back to Earth. Remember how you used to love hearing about my dreams? This one was so vivid, I could have sworn it was based on a real memory. But the more I wrote it down, the more I realized how little sense it made. I was some kind of consultant for a construction company, and they needed me to take a look at the blueprints for a new facility they were building on the Moon. The longer I stared at the blueprints though, the more I realized it was actually my own face — then it was Clair's face, then yours, then my kids and grandkids. Then it became text. And the text told the story of my whole life. They said I had to put my signature at the bottom to approve the plans. I was too terrified to do it. 
I'm back on the ground now, and back in New York. Probably for good. I wasn't entirely sure what to make of my life. For a while the only thing that mattered was work, but now I feel like a fool for ever thinking that was worthwhile. That was when I realized I had never visited you. How could I have been such a bad friend? 
If only you were here to read all this.
Andy

As soon as I started to see trailers for “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,” I knew that it was going to be right up my alley. An utterly ridiculous movie starring Nick Cage and Pedro Pascal? Sign me up! Despite having been released over a year ago and my overwhelming urge to see it in theaters, I have only just watched “Massive Talent” this week. Now I’m here to share my long-awaited experience with you, dear readers. 
Released in March of 2022, Tom Gormican’s “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” follows Hollywood film star and long-time legend Nicholas Cage (Nicholas Cage) as he grapples with the decline of his acting career, as well as the effects that his lifestyle have had on his family, especially his relationship with his daughter. When an audition rejection is followed closely by a particularly embarrassing incident, Nick decides that he will retire from acting — right after one last gig. Billionaire playboy Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) has invited Nicholas Cage to his birthday party, and after some initial tensions, Javi and Nick kick off an epic bromance, kindled by their shared love of cinema. As Nick and Javi’s relationship flourishes, Nick is contacted by the CIA about some potential illegal happenings involving Javi. As you can imagine, hijinks ensue. It’s beautiful, but more importantly, it’s ridiculous. Everything is exaggerated and over the top, and nothing takes itself too seriously. I love a self-aware film and baby, this one delivers. Complete with a spy/drama/western inspired score, this is truly everything I could possibly want out of a bromantic comedy.
Obviously, we have to talk about the cast. Nicholas Cage as himself is just as wonderfully insane and over the top as we’ve all come to expect. Pedro Pascal is having himself a real renaissance, and he totally killed it as Javi. He’s so perfect in every way — cool and confident and charismatic as a billionaire should be, but also a Nick Cage superfan! I really love that Javi is noticeably nervous around Nick at first; it’s so endearing. I love Javi. I need him to be happy. The other standout performance for me was Tiffany Haddish as Vivian, one of the CIA agents giving Nick his orders. She is so funny and cool and confident, and absolutely awesome at her job. I honestly thought that I was going to get tired of the whole CIA thing, but Vivian carried so hard. I love Vivian. This whole cast was great, and came together so perfectly for an absolutely wonderful time of a movie.
All in all, this movie is just easy to watch. It’s not stressful, it’s not philosophical, it’s just a good old fashioned silly movie. Are you a little tired? A little stressed? In the mood to shut your brain off for a while? “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” will administer the tried-and-true home remedy of laughter in spades, and you’ll be out of that funk in no time, partner. On the good time-bad time scale, this one gets a “refreshing little break from the real world.”

While Flycatcher has made two albums (“Other Things” and “Songs for Strangers”), “Stunt” is their first EP and the first project they’ve released since I’ve started listening to them. Though I only discovered them last year, “Games” already has a place in my top 50 listened to songs of all-time on Spotify. Flycatcher will be playing later this month at Mr. Roboto Project on April 28, and you bet I’ll be going. Anyways, on to the review!
‘Games’ - 9.6/10
“Games” was the first Flycatcher song I heard and it caught me immediately. While it immediately landed in my liked songs, it took me a while to explore the rest of their discography. “Games” is by far Flycatcher’s most popular song, and for very good reason. To me, it’s an upbeat rock song about not knowing what to do next and reluctantly accepting that sometimes we leave people behind in life. The pacing and rhythm of the song is fantastic, and there’s something about the chorus that makes me sing along every time. I wouldn’t have any other song be first on the EP; it’s my favorite, hands down. 
‘Always Selfish’ - 8.5/10
While I wouldn’t call “Always Selfish” anything special, it’s still a good song. There’s only two verses and the chorus, and while that’s not much, I still like the entire song. It feels more like an instrumental feature, but it does a good job at delivering a good listening experience, so I can’t really complain. 
‘Sodas in the Freezer’ - 8.9/10
“Sodas in the Freezer” gets away from the faster pace of “Games” with a slower rock feel, but it still manages to deliver a great song. It’s a song about doing stupid stuff somewhat deliberately and being too lazy to do anything about it, like putting a soda in the freezer to get it cold and forgetting about it. I think it’s something a lot of people can relate to, or at least I can. I really like when the song gets more “taken back” during the small piano section; it’s a good complement to the weight of the chorus. Big fan!
‘Rust’ - 8.6/10
“Rust” is more of a return to the driven rock feel of “Games” and “Always Selfish,” and I’m a fan. The opening leaves the listener anticipating the start of the vocals, and I really like the low vocals. Similarly to “Always Selfish,” there’s not terribly much going on lyrically, but all of the instrumentals in this song are really solid — it’s definitely nothing to sleep on. 
‘Quitter’ - 8.7/10
“Quitter” is actually the only new song from Flycatcher on this EP; the rest had been released as singles before its release. As such, it’s the one I’ve listened to the least, but I like it just as much as the other songs. “Quitter” experiments a bit more with changing moods than the others, and I think it does a pretty good job. The song is solid both lyrically and instrumentally, and it’s a great closer to the EP.

On April 9, Pennsylvania experienced yet another train derailment. This time, the derailment was not accompanied by chemical spills and the need for a controlled burn, which is good news considering the derailed train was a lot closer to home this time.
The Norfolk Southern train derailed in the Esplen neighborhood, located in Pittsburgh’s West End, about a 15 minute drive from Carnegie Mellon. The train was empty and five cars long, meaning there were no hazards or injuries after the derailment. Roads surrounding the derailed train including West Carson were shut down for a few hours as Norfolk Southern cleanup crews cleared the cars and cleaned up the site. By the end of the day, trains were back up and running through the tracks by West Carson, without further issues with derailments.
This is the same company responsible for February’s train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, although that train was 50-cars long and transporting hazardous materials, leading to larger concerns about contamination in the surrounding environment and prompting evacuations of nearby towns. Since that derailment, Norfolk Southern has “faced mounting criticism over safety.” In response, last month they released a six-point safety plan to “enhance its current operations.” The East Palestine derailment also led to the introduction of new railway safety legislation.
Despite such backlash, the National Transport Safety Board has indicated that this latest derailment will not be part of the current special investigation of Norfolk Southern’s safety practices, nor will it prompt an additional investigation. At this time, the cause of the train derailment is unknown.
This train derailment is among one of the more common types, with no damages and cleanup taking less than two hours. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, 2022 had at least 1,164 train derailments, averaging around three a day across the country. Most of these don’t make national headlines like the East Palestine derailment did, and the significance of this recent derailment comes from the proximity to that event.

For the first time in history, a former U.S. president has been placed under arrest and is facing felony charges. Former president Donald Trump was arrested on April 4 and is facing 34 counts of falsifying business documents in the state of New York. The charges are focused on the $130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, allegedly as hush money to prevent her from discussing her affair with the president. These payments were falsified as payments to Michael Cohen for legal actions, something which did bring down the ire of the New York District Attorney. However, the case report includes several other payments made in a similar fashion, including $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman, and $150,000 to a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. This sum was alleged to be part of a "catch and kill" scheme to suppress any damaging information about criminal or extralegal activities in the lead up to the 2016 election. 
Trump’s critics in the Republican Party have remained skeptical whether this case passes muster. Both Republican Utah Senator Mitt Romney and former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton have stated that the case brought forward doesn’t contain enough evidence to guarantee any sort of sentence and the process may yield a not-guilty verdict for the former president. Alvin Bragg, the attorney in charge of the trial, contests those claims, pointing out that the precedent of allowing criminal activities to occur, even if by a former president, is one he does not want to allow. The Republican Party seems to have united on this issue, with most politicians on both sides of the party agreeing that the charges are illegitimate. Eric Trump, the former president's son, has also gone to the internet and spread misinformation, claiming that NYC was shut down by DA Bragg. The mayor of New York did shut down key Manhattan streets, but the mayor doesn't report to the DA, nor is the entire city shut down. 
Given that the person the money was given to for the transfer, Michael Cohen, has cooperated with the team and spent time in prison over the charges, there is some indication that these charges may stick, and Trump could spend time behind bars. Cohen’s testimony, if used, could be the key evidence necessary to convict, as it would give the prosecution and explicit case of hush money being paid to various individuals, as well as Cohen classifying the money as "legal fees."
Reactions to the arrest have varied. Protests were held in front of the courthouse, and calls for protest have been widespread, but there hasn’t been any significant protest or violent activities like what occurred on Jan. 6.
Trump has been instructed not to "jeopardize the rule of law" by interfering with the process by the judge in charge of an arraignment — an explicit warning not to use protestors as a way of fighting the charges. As the former president is not considered a flight risk, he returned to Florida after the arraignment, and will continue to campaign going forward. After returning, the president continued to post about his situation on Truth Social, his new social media account, posting all-caps, impassionate threads about the situation. On Easter, the former president posted, "HAPPY EASTER TO ALL, INCLUDING THOSE THAT DREAM ENDLESSLY OF DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF DREAMING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. THOSE THAT ARE SO INCOMPETENT THEY DON’T REALIZE THAT HAVING A BORDER AND POWERFUL WALL IS A GOOD THING, & HAVING VOTER I.D., ALL PAPER BALLOTS, & SAME DAY VOTING WILL QUICKLY END MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD, & TO ALL OF THOSE WEAK & PATHETIC RINOS, RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS, SOCIALISTS MARXISTS, & COMMUNISTS WHO ARE KILLING OUR NATION, REMEMBER, WE WILL BE BACK!" It's another stream-of-consciousness message to his supporters, and, following his arrest, is a return to the stolen election rhetoric that he had used in 2020. Its accompanied by a slew of comparisons of the former president to Jesus on Easter, specifically by various people from the Republican Party. Marjorie Taylor Green claimed that what the former president was doing was literally Christlike, while other loyalists have compared him to Martin Luther King Jr. We will continue to report on the situation as it unfolds.
The next hearing for this case will be in December, as each side will collect evidence and create a case for them to use in the trial.

Florida’s Disney Parks, consisting of Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot, and Hollywood Studios, have enjoyed privileges through the operation of their own self-governance since the parks opened, including special tax privileges. This week, Florida governor Ron DeSantis made several statements regarding the takedown of Disney’s self-controlled government in Central Florida. 
After the “parental rights in education bill,” also known as the "Don’t Say Gay" bill, was passed last year, Disney spoke out against it. Bob Chapek, the CEO of Disney at the time, claimed that the Walt Disney Company was “reassessing our approach to advocacy — including political giving in Florida and beyond.” Such a statement came after pressure from employees to react, and once the bill was signed into law, Disney also agreed to push for its repeal.
In February, in response to Disney’s statement, DeSantis declared he would sign a bill to strip Disney of its self-governing status in the area of the parks, the Reedy Creek Development District. The bill will also remove Disney’s exemption from the Florida building code and fire prevention code from state regulatory review and approval. DeSantis claimed the bill would “prevent local governments dominated by leftist politicians from using the situation to raise local taxes.” He created a board that would take away Disney’s control of Reedy Creek, to which he can appoint members. He also shifted the blame to California, insinuating that the leftist ideologies from the California park are being transferred into the Florida parks. 
Bob Iger, current CEO of the Walt Disney company, called DeSantis’ decision “anti-business and anti-Florida,” claiming that DeSantis “sought to punish a company for the exercise of a constitutional right.”
In preparation of DeSantis' maneuverings, the former board of Reedy Creek signed a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants with Disney 19 days before DeSantis’ bill was signed, nullifying the bill and allowing Disney to continue holding power over the Reedy Creek area. As part of this, the “rule against perpetuities” had been enacted, which was set to expire until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III -- a fun bit of legalese that allows parties to establish indefinite agreements without explicitly stating that they are indefinite. This agreement was discussed in public meetings in the weeks prior to the agreement being signed, and was conducted in accordance with Florida law.
DeSantis retorted last Thursday, claiming the changes Disney made those days before the bill was signed would be voided. He said he would target Disney with taxes on their hotels, tolls on roads around the parks, and developing land nearby. However, any attempts to remove Disney's special privileges would likely be met with backlash, as it would require the state to take over the outstanding debt of the Reedy Creek district (estimated at $1 billion), and take over maintenance and services for the 25,000 acres around Disney World.
Until then, it seems Disney still has the upper hand.

Fox News has been found to have lied to the public in the Dominion voting case. Judge Eric Davis of Delaware stated that it was “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” while moving the case forward to a trial. The now upcoming trial will determine whether Fox acted with malice in order to explicitly and intentionally misinform the public. Evidence pointing out that Fox did know what they were reporting on was incorrect will also be damning to their defense. Fox alleged that Dominion had flipped voters from Democratic to Republican, were controlled by Venezuela, and other lies involving the 2020 presidential election. Dominion refutes all of the claims, and as of now, no evidence has been found that substantiates any of these positions. 
Fox has staked its defense on the First Amendment and the claim that they were merely reporting what had been alleged by Donald Trump and his allies during the election. Judge Davis pointed out that without any rebuttal, disagreement, or vetting, Fox had essentially spread misinformation without any indication that it was opinion on misinformation. While there is tremendous leeway for media when it comes to freedom of speech, this may be a bridge too far considering Fox’s attacks on Dominion and the veracity of their claims.
Fox News Networks faces the possibility of paying $1.6 billion to Dominion over this lawsuit, a price that would seriously damage the network, and its owner Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns a huge stake in significant parts of various media sources. He also faces the possibility of testifying in the trial, the judge stated, putting one of the wealthiest men on the planet under fire. Dominion has indicated that they want both Rupert and his son Lachlan to testify, in their positions as owner and chief executive, respectively. Fox's defense has tried to prevent this from happening, claiming that their testimony is not necessary in the trial, and their presence would add nothing, though Dominion contests this. This would put the Murdoch's on the list of people that Dominion wants to see testify in the trial, a list that includes other Fox execs, multiple Fox hosts, and a number of other people associated in the media corporation.
The Dominion trial is slated to begin in December.

Earlier this year, the U.S. shot down Chinese balloons off the east coast, prompting speculation that the balloons were being used as spyware to gather intelligence on the U.S. Recent updates have indicated that the balloons were in fact capturing imagery and signals intelligence from U.S. military sites, and transmitted information back to Beijing in real time. 
While the balloon was passing over the U.S., China was able to control the balloon’s movement, allowing it to make multiple passes over different military sites to gather more information to transfer back to Beijing. The signals intelligence collected was from electronic signals, picked up from weapons systems and communications from personnel. However, the information China was able to gather with these passes was limited because of actions by the U.S. to “move around potential targets and obscure the balloon’s ability to pick up their electronic signals by stopping them from broadcasting or emitting signals,” according to CNN. This is largely due to efforts by the U.S. intelligence community to develop capabilities to track a “fleet” of Chinese balloons, allowing the U.S. to determine the balloon’s path and make necessary adjustments. 
Ongoing analysis on the balloon’s capabilities has given additional insight into the functioning of the device, including its power source and how its algorithms work. Even as this analysis has continued, U.S. officials have continued to release statements emphasizing that the balloon’s intelligence capabilities were not “additive,” and any information gleaned would have also been able to be collected through other means like China’s satellite network.
Despite these reports, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh notes that they cannot confirm any reports of real-time transmission, and that analysis is still ongoing. In response, China’s spokesperson has condemned any “distortion and hyping up of this incident.”
Ongoing updates will only be available as information is deemed appropriate enough to declassify.

Tennessee House of Representatives Expulsions
On March 30, three days after the mass shooting at Covenant High School in Tennessee, thousands of protestors rallied in the Tennessee State Capitol building for more gun control laws, chanting "save our kids" and other protest slogans and songs. 
These protests reached the House floor. Three state legislators were protesting: Justin Jones (D-Nashville), Justin J. Pearson (D-Memphis) and Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville), all chanting "no justice, no peace." For this, all three had their committee assignments stripped by Cameron Sexton (the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives), who compared their actions to those of the 2021 Capitol Rioters, or "maybe even worse, depending how you look at it." On the same day, a motion was filed to remove Jones, Pearson, and Johnson. Prior to this, only two representatives had been expelled since 1900 (one for bribery, and the other for sexual misconduct). This motion was widely criticized as politically motivated and unprecedented. In the Tennessee House of Representatives, a two-thirds supermajority is required to expel a sitting representative. The House is currently over 75 percent Republican. On April 6, resolutions HR 63, 64, and 65 were voted on. HR 63, expelling Justin J. Pearson, succeeded 69-26. HR 64, expelling Gloria Johnson, failed 30-65. HR 65, expelling Justin Jones, succeeded 72-25. Pearson and Jones are both Black men, while Gloria Johnson is a white woman. These expulsions brought outrage, most notably from President Biden's Twitter statement: "Three kids and three officials gunned down in yet another mass shooting. And what are GOP officials focused on? Punishing lawmakers who joined thousands of peaceful protesters calling for action. It's shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent."
Jones' and Pearson's seats are now vacant, but they are expected to be appointed the interim representatives by the local government bodies. Additionally, they will most likely win their reelections if they run, and will not be able to be re-expelled.
Mifepristone Scuffles
Mifepristone is a drug commonly paired with misoprostol to induce abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. It was approved by the FDA in 2000. It is on the core list of the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medication abortions now account for over half of all facility-provided abortions. Many groups have been fighting over access to it. 
Following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court ruling — which overturned Roe v. Wade — states once again have the power to regulate all aspects of abortion not directly protected by federal law. Although countless polls have shown that a majority of Americans believe that abortion should be legal, voters have consistently voted in favor of abortion protections, and against anti-abortion measures (even in Kentucky), this new status-quo isn't enough for some anti-abortion legislators. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas ruled to suspend the FDA's approval of mifepristone. As previously stated, mifepristone has been FDA-approved for over two decades. This decision essentially bans the sale of this drug nation-wide. 
It is important to note the Judge Kacsmaryk, prior to being appointed as a justice by Former President Donald Trump, was an attorney for a conservative Christian legal advocacy group, and is himself anti-abortion, all of which the anti-abortion plaintiffs knew when they chose to file in his district. This is yet another example of judges trying to rule from the stand, and in essence enact decisions that have a basis only in their own beliefs. This problem is endemic across all levels of the American judiciary. The Biden administration has already appealed the case, and the case may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court has been majority Republican since 1970 and is currently embroiled in controversy over Associate Justice Clarence Thomas' undisclosed gifts from Harlan Crow. Crow is a billionaire donor and collector of Hitler memorabilia. For the meanwhile, Washington State district court judge Thomas O. Rice ordered U.S. authorities not to make any changes that would restrict access to the abortion medication mifepristone in 17 Democratic-led states that sued over the issue. There are now two competing judgements requiring the federal government to do two completely contradictory actions. Some are saying that the Biden Administration should just ignore this ruling completely.

In a recent open letter to the Joint Funding Committe (JFC), the Spanish and Latine Student Association (SALSA) executive board wrote about cuts made to their budget request which they believe to be the result of bias within the JFC.  
In their report, they document which of their desired events for the 2024 year are going receive funding, which they connect to a larger pattern of underfunding they argue that other Latine and Black student organizations have to contend with. 
They point out a greater need for funding due to the small size of their developing alumni network, and the fact that a large number of their members come from low-income backgrounds. This means that most of their funding comes from JFC directly; thus, they can only fund evens which the JFC deems as important — not those valued by their own current and former members. Another important concern is their claim that the JFC, which consists of around two dozen students, has no members that are Black or Latine. However, The Tartan could not confirm this.
Still, we here at The Tartan editorial board support SALSA. We believe that cultural student organizations serve a key function on our campus. They provide community for students in minority groups and are an integral part of the broader campus community. SALSA points out that their most consistently funded event, “Noche Latina,” occurs during family weekend and serves are a way for Carnegie Mellon to outwardly display “diversity promotion.” It is unfair to this group to feel tokenized during one of the few events for which they are funded, yet remaining unable to spend money in like with their own priorities. They argue that events like their Senior Farewells are equally important to their members but aren’t viewed as valuable by the JFC because the funding for this event was entirely cut.
The JFC is under stricter budgetary constraints for the 2024 fiscal year, meaning that many student organizations will find themselves losing funding for events. However, SALSA has done a commendable job documenting a pattern of consistent underfunding compared to other cultural student organizations. We believe that given the considerations they outline in their report, the JFC should reevaluate how they impose budget cuts on cultural organizations such as SALSA.

In 1985, in the Big Apple, a young up-and-coming attorney named Rudolph Giuliani put the Italian mafia away for good. He used a combination of financial crimes, racketeering, and a novel new law known as RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, to sweep away one of the biggest blights on the American criminal landscape.
In 2023, Rudolph Giuliani’s former employer faces the prospect of getting swept away by NYC law as well. Former President Donald Trump was arrested last Tuesday, April 4, and will be facing charges of falsifying business payments. Big deal, right?
Yes.
Very big deal. These charges are big deals, particularly seeing Trump get hit with felony charges is insane. He’s being charged for 34 counts violating New York's Penal Law §175.10, a Class E Felony. A Class E Felony is typically associated with a jail sentence of between one and five years. While a non-violent felon will generally not see their charges run consecutively, this means that if even some of them stick, the former president may be facing jail time. 
And that’s… unprecedented. The most recent similar case is Nixon’s indictment that ended with a full pardon from succeeding president Gerald Ford. I get the feeling that Biden may not be as forgiving. As much as these charges seem underwhelming, the state of New York is in dangerous waters. They must ensure not to let anything past them because if they do, not only would the entire investigation fail, but any specific permissions they may have (such as subpoenas and further investigations) are gone. They have one chance to put him away, and this is their best bet.
It’s hard to contain my excitement in this case — and yes, I’m well and fully aware that I’m biased. This is something that’s been brewing since the 2016 elections, and if you read the official charges, they’ve got sections covering the entirety of the 2016 election cycle. They allege a catch-and-kill scheme to censor criticisms, they highlight specific instances of fraud, and they bring up crimes that people had honestly forgotten about. It's the culmination of some excellent detective work, a hardworking team in the New York District Attorney’s office, and the end product of one of the most tortured high-profile cases in history. New York has its case, now can they prove it in court?
What Trump has going for him is his power — and the precedent of finding him guilty. Is there even a way to have this case be impartial? Is there a single person in this country who’s unbiased on Trump? And even if you find someone who is, how do you convince his supporters this is a fair trial? Is that even possible anymore?
To all this, it really depends on the New York justice system. They’re going to start the process soon, and by soon I mean that the first hearing on this case is going to be in December. NYC has a lot of evidence and witnesses, including adult performer Stormy Daniels and Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen; they’re all going to be important in keeping this case alive.
But can they handle the former president? When he surrendered to law enforcement on Tuesday, he went along quietly. There were protests, but the nation isn’t gripped with the chaos many had expected. It’s been surprisingly quiet — and I'm cautiously optimistic. The president could still go scorched-earth, in which case New York City might finally have reason for the stockpile of military surplus equipment they’ve bought over the decades. As of now, it seems like there will not be another January 6.

On Friday, March 31, I attended Rebecca Fannin's lecture about her recent book, "Silicon Heartland" in the Tepper Swartz Center. Her book was the culmination of several years of research across different cities in the Rust Belt of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. She is a tech and business journalist, whose past works include books about the rise of the tech industry in Asia generally, and China specifically. Having studied how the Chinese tech industry exploded, Fannin applied her knowledge to trends and patterns she sees in various Rust Belt cities. She describes how Pittsburgh and many peer cities are seeing the development of "tech clusters" —  new centers of manufacturing, research, and development that show promising signs of growth. 
While I won't deny the tremendous amount of research and insight Fannin puts into this project, I came away with the distinct impression that the ethos of this book is founded in misplaced optimism. In hoping that the Rust Belt can become the "Tech Belt," the book misses the point of the term Rust Belt. This region of the country relied on a single industry — steel — in the 20th century, and the term is meant to point out the consequences of a region depending on profit from a single item. The imagery of rust feels like a pretty clear metaphor for how temporary and transient the products of capitalism are. Who's to say that the tech industry won't have a similar boom and bust, leaving midwestern cities hollowed-out and economically depressed once again. It feels misguided to see an industry grow in a region of the country and assume that the short-term gains brought on by the influx of capital to that region would lead to any kind of long-term stability.
There were a number of moments during the Q&A session where I felt that people brought up extremely valid or prescient concerns that the speaker wasn't able to really address. During a conversation about the factors that motivate industrial growth, Fannin brought up the need for "native venture capital" — the idea is that VC firms need to set up shop in a region before the local startup economy can bloom. This was followed by someone pointing out that Silicon Valley, the epicenter of American startups, is a notoriously terrible place to live, between its extremely high cost of living and the highly mobile, young workforce that rarely builds roots in the city. They asked if it was a good idea for a city like Pittsburgh to aspire to this to any degree, and I found that her answer did little to address this concern.
I think the business-first, wealth-oriented mindset that is reflected in this sort of tech-optimism can be dangerously short-sighted. Should the Rust Belt actually become the new Tech Belt, we would probably see massive accumulation of capital in the hands of a few industry magnates with very little trickling down to the working class. This would last until the tech industry falters, leaving cities like Pittsburgh holding the check just as they did when steel left the 80s. I would rather see institutions like Carnegie Mellon pioneering things that are practical, sustainable, and conscientious of how they impact those on the margins of society: not just hype for a second gilded age.

Dominion Voting System’s massive case against Fox News was allowed to go to trial following a ruling on April 31, as a Delaware Superior Court judge declared that the case was false.
False. Instead of the trial being about whether Fox News did or did not lie about Dominion, the case will basically be about whether Fox is responsible for the lies it told. That’s a really big distinction, especially when it comes to a case about slander. Historically, it's been really, really hard to find newspapers guilty of slandering other large companies because the U.S. really will only put restrictions on freedom of speech in the case of a big public figure is attacking a private individual. It's quite unprecedented for it to already be decided that yes, Fox lied about Dominion and yes, this is a harm to Dominion. The case is already half over, to some extent. Now, all that remains is to decide whether Fox did it of sound mind.
It's a big step in terms of bringing charges against news companies, especially since the entry into the mainstream of Trump's term, “Fake News.” Many news agencies, including Fox, CNN, and MSNBC have faced controversy over what their hosts have said. For MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, the defense required them to claim she just wasn’t news, and many hosts have used the same defense when placed under scrutiny for their claims.
And that’s where the Fox v. Dominion case gets far, far more interesting. By alleging that Dominion rigged the election, a move that Fox did not back down on until getting several orders, Fox put itself in a position where it directly impacted Dominion’s bottom line. Fox was putting Dominion in financial danger by alleging they had committed massive fraud. These are demonstrable damages; even if Dominion didn't lose any customers, this move could cause them future harm. This is only compounded by the findings that by granting their hosts' credibility, Fox loses the First Amendment rights that normally apply to free speech. They claim that they were making inherently newsworthy statements about an inherently newsworthy person — in their case, the U.S. government — only to be told that by elevating different hosts to the position where they were treated like endorsed reporting, they had violated the protections associated with being an unbiased news reporter. Fox claimed that the false statements they published were newsworthy because they came from the U.S. government, only to be told they still had responsibility to vet their sources.
That’s serious. It’s essentially stripping away Fox’s protections because they reported false information, as fact. While the courts usually have an idea of looking at things on a case-by-case basis, this is a very important precedent for Delaware and news media as a whole. If this case leads to significant monetary compensation from Fox, it will force news outlets to be far, far more careful about their opinion segments and reporting. That’s a serious shift from the more laid-back treatment media is used to, and it puts almost every opinion panel on other channels in danger. If there’s another major case of false reporting, like Fox’s reporting on Dominion, we could see multibillion dollar cases brought up again.
That might just be what the news industry needs. Television news hosts, from Tucker Carlson to Rachel Maddow to Anderson Cooper, are a mainstay in American political reporting. A talking-head who reports what happens and then tells you how to feel is fine so long as they aren’t liable for messing up, but this case could turn that on its head. That’s a really good thing — more unbiased, factual reporting, á la Associated Press, would help encourage both sides of the aisle to operate into the same reality. News would have to report news, and opinion would have to be clearly labeled as such. That’s a big step towards stopping the partisan divide we see today.
Dominion is now on its way to prove that Fox knew that what it said was wrong. If it can show a jury that Fox knowingly lied, it will be able to convince a jury to award them huge damages. Dominion needs evidence of that, and luckily it has it — a lot of it. If presented by a good attorney, they could bankrupt the Fox corporation.
Good riddance. Opinion pieces aren’t really much more than tabloids. If they lie, they deserve to be treated like a tabloid; if they lie knowingly and willfully, then they’re doing something wrong — they deserve to be punished. Yes, we are a free country and yes, the first amendment does apply to spreading misinformation. But the limits of freedom of speech are enshrined in the case law. You can’t yell "fire" in a crowded theater, and — if this case succeeds — it may be that you can’t lie to the public by presenting opinions as news. It's a big change in how the media treats their audience, and will alter the current landscape of rumors, gossip and misinformation entrenched in modern American politics.

As we all know, I am a huge appreciator of movies of all genres and levels of quality. However, I have sensed a troubling trend amongst movie enjoyers  — people just take movies way too seriously. Why is everyone such a film critic these days? Why are people so mean to movies? 
So many people will claim they don't enjoy a movie because it's “bad” or “unoriginal” or something; how they're shallow, soulless cash grabs, lacking in meaning BLAH BLAH BLAH. Okay, Negative Nancy! While you were stewing in the theater, I was having the absolute time of my life. Oh no, the special effects were bad? Who cares? Just look at them and laugh! Haha, silly effects, how fun! It didn’t have some deep, hidden message? Good! Who goes to the movies to have complex thoughts? I don’t know about you guys, but when I pull up to the theater, I am hoping for a couple of hours of escapism. Why should I care if a studio spends one morbillion dollars to make a movie? I only paid 10 dollars to see it, and by golly it has been worth it every time. Oh, you think that trope is so played out, plus “'Casablanca' did it better!” Tropes exist because people like them, that's the point! I don’t care how many times it’s been done, I’ve loved it a thousand times and I’ll love it a thousand more.     
Many also criticize films on account of the demographic that enjoys them: “That movie is a toxic male manipulator movie!” Well maybe I'm a male manipulator. “‘Puss in Boots’ is a kids movie!” Well slap me into second grade and call me Sally Sue goddamn it, I saw it twice. Oh, what? War movies are for middle aged fathers, you say? Catch me grilling in my New Balances because I eat those up every time. Who cares what demographic a movie was made for? If you like the movie, then you’re the target demographic.
While I understand the appeal of a movie with a powerful message, it’s often not what I want. When I sit down and unwind, I don't really want to think about how shitty the world can be. I agree that it’s really fun and engaging to sit down and consume a really well made, emotionally charged, edge-of-your-seat, life changing movie — I’m just saying that they don’t all have to be that way. For every “The Birds,” in the world, there’s a “Birdemic: Shock and Terror,” that you can enjoy just as much. Obviously “The Birds” is a classic and a Hitchcock masterpiece. However, “Birdemic” is just utterly ridiculous, and so much fun. Yes, it looks like it was shot on a flip phone. Yes, I could’ve made better special effects on Powtoons in seventh grade. And yes, I had the absolute time of my life watching it. Even if a movie IS a cinematic masterpiece, that doesn’t have to be the reason you like it. I don’t care if “Fight Club'' is an allegory for toxic masculinity or postmodern materialism or some shit. I just think shirtless Brad Pitt beating people up is hot, and I'm tired of pretending it's not.
The root issue here is that people are so afraid to admit that they like something without it being some sort of masterpiece! Sure, people might give you some weird looks, but who cares? Are you so worried about looking soooo smart and sophisticated that you can’t appreciate “Minions: Rise of Gru?” Didn’t we move past the idea that "It’s cool not to care” thing like… a decade ago? In case no one has told you recently: You are allowed to enjoy things. Your favorite movie doesn’t need to be “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari”; it’s alright if it’s “Paddington 2.”

On the fifth floor of Wean Hall, eagle-eyed passersby may notice the shiny new bathroom, finally completed after having been under construction for most of the last semester. The interesting thing, however, is that both doors lead to a multi-stall bathroom — marked as women’s. So where is everyone else meant to go? 
According to some rumors, the "women’s” bathroom is meant to be gender neutral, and when you look at it, it makes sense; the stalls are closed floor-to-ceiling, with no gaps in the stall doors and nowhere to admire your homies’ shoes while they’re using the facilities. Paper signs which have been taped over all of the permanent gendered signage declare the restroom an “all-gender space,” and encourage bathroom patrons to treat the bathroom as gender neutral. I’m honestly not sure if these are official signage from the university, or something that a student org has put up. Despite the official look of the poster, and the QR code which takes you to Carnegie Mellon’s all-gender restroom updates page (which has not been updated since 2021), there are also posters floating around with a strikingly similar design which read, “Do you need to piss?” so I’m not fully convinced they’re from the administration. I’ve heard varying accounts from my guy friends about why they have or haven’t used the bathroom. One said that if it was officially marked as gender neutral he’d have no issue using it, but since it’s technically a women’s restroom, he’s a little weirded out. Another said that he has used it in dire situations, but generally avoids it due to the high traffic and open doors (which really is weird, now that I think about it — why are Carnegie Mellon bathroom doors always propped open? Give a guy some privacy). The general sentiment among the fellas seems to be that they’re a bit suspicious. They don’t want to be caught with their pants down (pun entirely intended) if it somehow turns out that this is indeed just a plain old women’s restroom, intended for women. 
The way to fix this problem is obviously to change the permanent signage to reflect the true intentions of the bathroom, but this might not be as simple as it seems. Apparently, there is an Allegheny County plumbing code which mandates that all restrooms requiring multiple fixtures have signage which designates them as being intended for one gender or the other, which is quite silly if you ask me. For anyone feeling weirded out about sharing a restroom with other genders: Why? Who cares who’s pissing next to you? Carnegie Mellon has been trying to convince Allegheny County to change this code since at least 2020. Unfortunately, what this means for our all-gender(?) restroom (and any future restrooms Carnegie Mellon may have plans to build) is that the county will have to update their plumbing code to accommodate gender neutral restrooms before we’ll be able to have honest-to-God, official, all-gender restrooms. Until that day, the new bathroom in Wean will remain nominally "women’s." In the meantime, I say go for it: go piss in whichever bathroom you want.

I love nothing more than seeing beginning lifters figuring their way around the gym, and I’ll never make fun of people who are learning. But good God, the things I sometimes see — so often from people who look like they should know better. Here are seven highly important tips to follow if you don’t want to look like a fool.
1. Please share machines
You don't own the gym; this is a shared space, so you're gonna have to share stuff. When I ask "how many sets do you have left," if the answer isn't "one" the answer should be "do you want to work-in with me?" If you don't offer that courtesy, I am in fact judging you harshly. If I proceed to ask you if I can work in, and you say something to the tune of "oh but I only have two more sets then a drop set, and then I'm doing a different thing after" I will in fact be stealing a strand of your hair so I can cast a hex on you later.
2. Do not bench in the squat-only rack
You aren't supposed to do this. Not only in the courtesy sense, but the squat racks by the mirrors are literally not equipped to allow you to do this. If you hadn't noticed, the bench-squat combo racks in the middle of the room have special little tracks that the wheels of the bench fix onto, meaning that you won't be sliding around during the movement.
3. Do not pull up in the squat-only rack
Respectfully, do you lack shame? There is a set of exclusively pull-up/dip bars no fewer than fifty feet away. How arrogant must you be to think you deserve to occupy a piece of highly specialized equipment to do something that you can do just as effectively on a damn playground? Get real. 
4. For the love of God, use safety bars or get a spotter
I'm an avid proponent of using safety bars for every applicable exercise, not only for my own peace of mind but also because I don't like asking for a spot. I have, on multiple occasions, had to help lift the weight off of someone doing incline bench press who had neither a spotter nor safety bars. I once worked-in with someone who consistently took off the safety bars after me and refused my offer to spot; to this day I still thank God that they accidentally left the safety bars on during the set in which they lost control of the bar above their neck. 
5. Queue for the benches, please
The first person who gets there should get the first bench that opens. I once waited at the little pillar (you know the one) for ten minutes, only for some opportunist to swoop in on a newly available bench before I could move. And the worst part is, I couldn't even be mad at them because the line I was trying to form was completely informal. I was naïve enough to believe that other bench-waiters would respect the queue.
6. Only take one set of dumbbells at a time, you're not an octopus
Look, I get it. You probably watched some gym tik tok with a Schwarzenegger voiceover where some big huge guy in a YungLa tank top explained why you need to do supersets and drop sets and whosiwhat sets in order to get the optimal striations on your rear deltoid. Fine, that sounds great, I hope you get those hypertrophy gains from drinking your BCAA-infused Myoprotein shake within the anabolic window once you finish lifting. But you only have two arms, so why do you have seventeen dumbbells scattered around your bench like some tentacled beast? Have some decency. 
7. Have fun!
I promise I’m not being facetious, this is the last but most important tip. Odds are you’re lifting for fun (and I include the student athletes — let’s be real none of you are going to ever get a salary for your sport), so stop taking it so seriously. Don’t put yourself at unnecessary risk of injury and don’t be rude to people. It’s not that hard.

Fifth Avenue is home to three major student dormitories, and every day students travel from their rooms to campus via the parking lot nestled between Tepper and Morewood Gardens. There's a relatively clear path from the WQED stairs to the crosswalk at Cyert Hall driveway, but this isn't the case for anyone traveling to the corner of Forbes and Morewood Avenue. Any given morning, you can see students making this voyage in slightly different ways because there is no single, most consistently easy way to cross this parking lot diagonally. Why is there no clear pedestrian walkway for this obviously popular path?
The issue is that the only paths between these points that strictly follow curbs and crosswalks take you along the outer edge of the lot. But these paths are extremely inconvenient, so it's no surprise how many people cut across the lot diagonally. Between Fifth and Clyde (264 beds), Fifth Neville Apartments (163 beds), and Residence on Fifth (150 beds), there are at least 577 Carnegie Mellon students that have to cross the Morewood Gardens Parking lot every day to get to campus (not to mention those in Neville House, Highland, Webster, and anybody else living north of Fifth Avenue). Considering that anyone traveling to and from campus has to cross the lot at least twice, there are probably well over a thousand instances of someone traversing this lot every day, very few of which involve the strictly legal path.
There's no crosswalk, no curb bump-outs, not even a pedestrian sign to warn cars because you're technically not supposed to cut across diagonally. Yet hundreds of people do so every day, so let's not act like this is "jaywalking" and acknowledge there is a region of heavy foot-traffic on our campus whose design took almost no consideration of where people would actually be walking. It's a very silly and annoying feature of campus.
The larger concern, however, is that we have a situation where hundreds of students are traversing a parking lot every day at completely random paths, meaning that drivers are equally likely to collide with a pedestrian at any number of points. This is made worse by the fact that pedestrians are popping out between cars, often without checking the road. It shouldn't be much to want a consistent, well-signed point of contact between car and pedestrian paths as opposed to the chaotic free-for-all we have going on now.
