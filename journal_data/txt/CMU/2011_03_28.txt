Despite their loss on Saturday to Denison 6–3, the Tartans rebounded and defeated the University of Mary Washington yesterday, 5–4. 
The Tartans got off to a rough start against Denison, taking only one doubles match. Sophomores Jooho Yu and Harsha Rao topped their opponents 9–7 at No. 3 doubles to prevent the sweep. The second and third points came from senior Alex Nemerov, who battled out his match 4–6, 6–3, 7–5, and sophomore Duke Miller, who dropped five games 6–2, 6–3 to add the Tartans’ final point.
Yesterday, the Tartans rallied to come back after being down 2–1 in doubles, with the lone point earned by junior Jeremy King and Nemerov at No. 2 doubles 8–4. The first singles win came from Yu at No. 6 singles, who won his match 6–4, 6–0. King finished his match shortly after. Miller and Rao added the final two points at No. 2 and No. 4 singles, respectively, to clinch the match.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to Emory University in Atlanta, Ga., to compete in the Fab 10 tournament this past weekend.
Ranked seventh in Division III going into the tournament, the Tartans won against the University of Mary Washington on Friday and Sewanee: The University of the South on Saturday. They are now 10–3 on the year.
Friday’s victory over No. 18 Mary Washington began with a Tartan sweep of the doubles. Juniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin led the way with an 8–2 win at first doubles.
The second doubles team of senior Jennifer Chui and sophomore Alex Tapak and the third doubles team of junior Cze-Ja Tam and senior Ashley Herrick each won their matches by 8–4 scores.
Chen then won at first singles, 6–3, 6–4. Tam (6–2, 3–6, 6–0) and Chui (6–3, 6–4) then won at third and fourth singles, respectively, to round out the 6–3 Tartans victory.
The Tartans did not get off to nearly as fast of a start on Saturday against No. 22 Sewanee, with Herrick and Tam earning the Tartans’ only doubles win, 8–2.
Carnegie Mellon quickly took over the lead in points after Chen won at first singles, 6–1, 6–2. Tam then won at fourth singles, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and Herrick won at sixth singles, prevailing 6–1, 6–1 with each team at four points.
Chin sealed the 5–4 comeback victory for Carnegie Mellon 6–3, 7–6 (7–5) winning seven straight points after being down 0–5 in the tiebreaker.
“Our match against Sewanee was good for us because we got to pull out a close match and that gave us strength in our team and prepared us for our future matches next weekend,” Chen said.
This Saturday, the Tartans will travel to Lexington, Va., to compete against Washington and Lee University, before heading to Baltimore, Md., to face Johns Hopkins University on Sunday.

Sophomore Jooho Yu has stepped up his game this year and has made a continual impact on the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team this spring season. Yu is from Glenbrook, Ill., and chose Carnegie Mellon for its academic strength and for the opportunity to contribute to the men’s tennis team.
Yu is pursuing his bachelor’s in business administration. “Carnegie Mellon has a great business program,” said Yu. He is looking to focus his studies in the finance realm and minor in statistics. 
Looking to the future, Yu said, “I am not 100 percent sure of what I want to do, but I want to work in financial services.” This summer, Yu will be interning at Infinium Capital Management, a proprietary trading firm.
The best part of being a member of the Carnegie Mellon tennis team for Yu is playing against the top teams in Division III and having a really challenging schedule.
The most memorable moment of the season so far for Yu was at the Indoor Nationals, “watching Duke [Miller] battle cramps to put us over the top in the first round against California Lutheran,” said Yu.
Yu’s best personal performance was during the team’s second-round match against Emory, where Yu won his match at six singles. Yu’s win was the only victory for the Tartans that round.
So far this spring season, Yu has been on a roll. He has won seven singles matches, only dropping one match to No. 12 Kenyon College. Yu also has a winning record in doubles with five wins.
In future seasons, “I would like to keep improving as a player and become a key contributor to a team that contends for a national title and competes with every team,” Yu said.

This past weekend, Carnegie Mellon’s track and field team took a trip to Lexington, Va. to compete in the two-day VMI Carnival hosted by Washington and Lee University. Several Division III track and field programs attended the Carnival, including fellow UAA competitors Case Western Reserve University and Rochester University.
While the score was not announced, both the women and the men’s teams had top finishers in several events.
The women Tartans kicked off the invitational with a first place finish in the 1,500-meter run by senior Laura McKee, with a time of 4:48.50. McKee went on to win the 800-meter run with a time of 2:18.28.
Sophomore Emily Wobb and junior Christine Warner continued the trend of distance domination, placing second and fifth in the 5,000-meter run. Wobb’s time of 17:40.54 and Warner’s time of 18:26.52 were both personal bests.
Senior Kim Nederlof took fifth place in the 100 meter dash with a time of 13.19, while junior Luci Laffitte finished fifth in the 200-meter dash in 27.61.
First-year Jacqueline Guevel kept the competition going strong when she won both the 100 and 400-meter hurdles, and with times of 14.83 and 1:03.79 her time in the 100 meter hurdles set a new school record.
In addition, both times provisionally qualify for the NCAA outdoor championships. Junior Ivana Moses placed fifth in the long jump, clearing 4.96 meters. To wrap things up, Laffitte, Guevel, Nederlof, and Moses set a new school record in the 4x100 meter relay, with a time of 50.81. The relay placed second overall.
On the men’s side, senior Nate Bussiere took home second in the 1,500-meter run with a time of 3:56.49, less than a second behind the winner. Bussiere went on to finish fifth in the 800-meter run in 1:56.19. In the 5,000-meter run, junior Rob Morhard finished ninth with a time of 15:09.57. In the 3,000-meter steeplechase, first-year Josh Newby made his debut by taking fifth with a time of 9:55.58. Fellow first-year Zachary Erra-Hernandez also made a strong impression, placing second in the discus, throwing 42.18 meters, while placing third in the shot put, clearing 13.75 meters.
First-year Nathan Cheek also competed well, placing fourth in the hammer throw and clearing 48.50 meters.
In the javelin throw, senior Dustin Musselman came in second, with a lifetime best of 55.54 meters.
In addition, Musselman ran the 400-meter dash and came in third with a time of 50.51. Sophomore Noel Titus scored placed in the 200-meter dash with a time of 22.81.
The Tartans will next compete at Washington and Jefferson University this Saturday. The hammer events will  begin on Friday.

The Tartans’ swimming and diving team traveled to Knoxville, Tenn. this past week to compete in the 2011 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships.
It was on Friday that the Tartans changed Carnegie Mellon’s swim and dive team history.
First-year Soleil Phan, first-year Megan Garvey, senior Molly Evans, and junior Victoria Adams were all named All-American Honorable Mention for their outstanding performance in the 800-yard freestyle relay, finishing with a time of 7:38.28 and placing the Tartan relay team in 13th place. This relay set a new school record for the Tartans.
Other notable performances included Evans in the 200-yard butterfly and sophomore Breanna Stillo in the 100-yard breaststroke. Both swimmers competed last Friday. Phan competed on Thursday and set a new school record for the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 57.07 seconds, but narrowly missed making the final 16.
The women continued to swim on Saturday, with Evans swimming the 200-yard backstroke, Phan swimming the 100-yard freestyle, and Adams swimming the 1,650-yard freestyle.
On the men’s side, sophomore Dan Glaser-Garbrick also wrote his name in Carnegie Mellon’s athletic history.
Garbrick earned his second All-American title, as he reached the finals of the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:50.11.
Garbrick repeated his eighth-place finish from last year, and he also competed in the 200-yard IM and 400-yard IM.
Senior Alex Hanson swam his last race on Saturday in the 200-yard backstroke.
Overall, the NCAA Championships set a new bar for the Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving program.

Baseball players always talk about hoping to play “meaningful baseball” in September, a term that alludes to being in a pennant race late in the season. This is the only context in which that term is really thrown around. However, in order to be playing meaningful baseball in September, teams must play meaningful baseball through the season’s first five months; and, if a team plays exceptionally well all the way through August, it might be able to put a lot less pressure on the outcomes of those September games.
Even spring training games are meaningful. Important? No, but definitely meaningful, especially for the many teams who still have question marks about their Opening Day rosters. In three days, at 1:05 p.m., the first two games of the regular season will begin, with the Braves and Nationals opening the National League schedule and the Tigers and Yankees christening the American League slate.
That said, in what little time remains before the big show begins, teams like the Mets and Phillies are just some of the teams that don’t even know what their starting lineups will look like come the first game of the season.
The Mets’ and Phillies’ issues both stem from second base. Both teams are still trying to figure out who will be starting at the position come the teams’ openers on Friday. The Phillies can take some comfort in knowing that they do have a star second baseman in Chase Utley, who hopefully can recover from nagging injuries and quell any issues with the position.
The Mets, however, have spent most of spring training waiting for one of their unestablished candidates to distinguish himself as the best option, but none of them have. In fact, the only player in the competition who’d been a regular second baseman at the Major League level was Luis Castillo, whom the Mets released after a beleaguered tenure with the club and who now is competing for the Phillies’ second base job.
For the Phillies, the choice looks to be between the ex-Met Castillo and Wilson Alvarez, another ex-Met who filled in adequately at shortstop last season for the Phillies during Jimmy Rollins’ extended stints on the disabled list. Castillo’s upside is his experience and offense, which has dwindled considerably since his heyday in Florida but could still prove to be consistent enough to be a decent table setter for the big RBI guys in the lineup. Alvarez, purely on account of being younger and having had zero times as many knee problems, no doubt has better range than Castillo, and both can sufficiently turn a double play.
The Mets have somehow been able to whittle the second-base competition down to Daniel Murphy, Brad Emaus, and Luis Hernandez, none of whom has been a regular second baseman at the big-league level. Only Murphy, the best offensive candidate of the bunch, has been a starter, having played regularly at first base for the Mets in 2009. However, Murphy began that season in left field, before his horrendous fielding forced the Mets to make a change. 
That said, Murphy hit almost 40 doubles that season and if healthy could provide an offensive boost at the position — however, Murph is still getting acquainted with the position and hasn’t proven anything defensively. Emaus, who may win the job partially due to his Rule 5 status, has proven to be decent both offensively and defensively and could provide the balance and consistency that the Mets so badly need at the position.
Then there is Hernandez. Although his only career highlight came offensively last year, when he broke his foot with a foul ball and then homered on the next pitch, his game is all defense. There is, sadly, a stigma associated with purely defensive players, and they tend to fall by the wayside as teams try to piece together only the best offensive lineup they can.However, a purely defensive player like Hernandez could help shore up an otherwise-stellar defensive infield. The Mets of the late ’90s played with Rey Ordonez at short, a perennial Gold Glover who endeared himself to fans with his spectacular defense no matter how horrible he was at the plate — and boy, was he horrible.
Errors can, and will, be devastating. Castillo proved that to the world when he gave the Yankees a win by dropping a pop-up in the ninth inning. Bill Buckner, a million times more infamously, did it before him. Dewayne Wise, on the other hand, became a White Sox hero when he made a spectacular play to rob a home run and preserve Mark Buehrle’s perfect game.It is a truth universally acknowledged, and subsequently overlooked, that while good pitching and good hitting win ball games, it is good defense that saves them and bad defense that loses them.

The Carmelo Anthony trade was supposed to save a struggling New York Knicks franchise from mediocrity and help it rise into an elite group in the NBA.
With a team that features Anthony along with fellow superstar Amare Stoudemire, the Knicks were two-thirds of their way to an NBA Dream Team, much like the Miami Heat have done with their “Big Three.”
However, since the Carmelo trade, the Knicks are 7–12 in their 19 games with the superstar, sending the ever-anxious New York faithful into a frenzy of taunts and boos.
So, what is happening with this New York Knicks team? First of all, it is their unwillingness to play defense, which has been a problem ever since head coach Mike D’Antoni came in from the Phoenix Suns.
Taking a look at the Knicks’ overall defense from the beginning of the season, they are 26th out of 30 teams in points allowed, obviously the most telling statistic when it comes to defensive abilities.
They are surprisingly ranked lower in defensive efficiency than the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have possibly the worst team in history. With a defense this bad, a team cannot expect to be extremely successful, especially when the offense runs mainly through two players.
When one of these players has an off day, you might as well chalk it up as an automatic loss for these Knicks.
This defensive problem highlights the biggest problem with this Knicks team: a lack of all-around coaching. D’Antoni has forever been known for his “run ’n’ gun” offense, an offensive game plan that is based off of shooting the ball very quickly and trying to get transition points whenever possible.
However, D’Antoni has never made it to the NBA Finals, even with his former team, the Phoenix Suns, who had a much more talented roster than the Knicks do right now.
A huge problem with D’Antoni’s philosophy, especially with the Knicks, is that the game plan is based on the quickness of the point guard, along with teammates who are able to shoot the three.
With the Anthony trade, the Knicks got an aging point guard in Chauncey Billups, who is well known for being a mainly half-court offensive player.
In addition to this, Anthony does not necessarily have the skills to be in this offense, as he is a player who runs his game through isolations in the half-court as well.
Billups and Anthony brought their previous team, the Denver Nuggets, to the playoffs multiple times because their team employed a half-court offense philosophy, one that utilizes the team’s strengths.
In addition to the rigidness of the offensive system, D’Antoni clearly does not feel defense is an important part of the game, as he has never coached a team that has given up less than 100 average points per game, which is terrible. It’s pretty clear that the Knicks head coach has never heard the cliché “Defense wins championships.”
Looking forward for the Knicks, it looks like they will be entering the playoffs as the seventh seed, which would most likely pit them against their rivals, the Boston Celtics. The Celtics do everything that the Knicks do not, such as playing defense, listening to their coach, and running an offense suitable to the team needs. If the Knicks do end up playing the Celtics, I would expect a quick one-and-done series for New York as it prepares for next season.
Speaking of the future, many Knicks fans seem to be adamant that New York will lure another high-profile free agent, such as New Orleans point guard Chris Paul or Orlando center Dwight Howard, to the Big Apple.
However, these fans are uneducated in the financials of basketball. Assuming a salary cap cut, the Knicks would not have enough to reach the maximum-level deal in the summer of 2012, leaving them only enough money to fill the team with role players instead of making a huge splash like the 2010 Miami Heat.
If, by some miracle, the salary cap stays the same, it is possible that a scenario like this happens. Unfortunately for the Knicks, it looks highly unlikely at this point.
So as of right now, the Knicks have lost six in a row, and eight of the last nine. The most disappointing statistic of this streak is that seven of the last nine teams have had records below .500.
In fact, the Knicks are 1–6 against such teams, meaning they just aren’t taking care of business on the weaker teams in the conference, or just aren’t good enough. It is sad how far this Knicks organization has come from the competitive years in the late ’90s.
If Carmelo Anthony cannot bring this franchise out of the dumps, New York basketball fans may just have to pray that Jay-Z moves the New Jersey Nets to Brooklyn so they at least have another option. I hope they begin their path to contention by firing the main culprit, head coach Mike D’Antoni.

Last Saturday, anyone in Pittsburgh looking at the sky was treated to the sight of a large, celestial, reddish-silver ball in place of our regular moon. The spectacular ball was definitely a moon, but one that was nearly 14 percent wider and 30 percent brighter to our eyes. This moon was special in that it was a “super full moon,” larger and brighter than an ordinary moon due to its closer proximity to Earth.
Due to the moon’s  elliptical orbit around Earth, it was just 221,567 miles away — about 16,000 miles closer than normal, and the closest it had been in 18 years. This doesn’t appear to be much of a difference, but the moon’s diameter is only 2,159 miles, making the moon almost seven and a half times closer to the Earth than normal. 
But still, why did the moon look so much larger for only a 16,433 mile difference? 
In an interview with USA Today, NASA scientist Jim Garvin said that “a ‘Super moon’ is a situation when the moon is slightly closer to Earth in its orbit than on average, and this effect is most noticeable when it occurs at the same time as a full moon. So, the moon may seem bigger although the difference in its distance from Earth is only a few percent at such times.” Since there was a full moon at the same time, the moon looked significantly larger to us.
The super full moon has also attracted a large amount of media attention because of a misplaced connection with the recent Japan disaster. This was brought on when an astrologer, Richard Nolle, claimed that this was an extreme, super full moon and therefore chaos such as “huge storms, earthquakes, volcanoes and other natural disasters can be expected to wreak havoc on Earth.” At this point it should be noted that astrology is not a validated science, merely an attempt to make connections between astronomical and mystical events. 
The main concern with this speculation seems to be that in the past the super full moon has often accompanied natural disasters. For example, the years 1955 and 1992 were particularly heavy in natural disasters and coincided with super full moon occurrences. However, most of the other times, there haven’t been any natural disasters. In a video NASA placed on YouTube, it says a super full moon in 1983 passed without incident and also references the “almost super full moon” in 2008, that also passed without incident.
So can the super full moon cause natural disasters? There is a little logic behind this apparently crazy question. According to the website Life’s Little Mysteries, the gravitational force of the moon on the Earth causes the ebb and flow of oceans’ tides. At the same time, the moon’s gravity can cause minute ebbs and flows on land masses as well, known as “land tides” or “solid Earth tides.” These tides tend to be highest during full and new moons, as the sun and moon are aligned on the same or opposite sides of the Earth.
These minor land or water changes do not result in disasters of such a caliber as the Japan earthquake or tsunami. According to Garvin, “The effects on Earth from a super full moon are minor, and according to studies by terrestrial seismologists and volcanologists, the combination of the moon being at its closest to Earth in its orbit, and being in its ‘full moon’ configuration [relative to the Earth and sun] should not affect the internal energy balance of the Earth since there are lunar tides every day.” 
Internet speculation has generated a lot of theories about the super full moon, but in reality, the super full moon is just a regular moon phase. Though brighter and larger in appearance, the super full moon has minimal effects on Earth and is not a scary event. It is merely an opportunity to view the magnificent colors of the moon up close.

The weekly civil environmental engineering lecture had the honor of hosting Professor William “Red” Whittaker, the Fredkin Research Professor of Robotics in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute and a National Academy of Engineering member. His lecture, titled “Robots at Work ... on Earth and Beyond,” highlighted the various projects he and his teams have accomplished over the past decades. A few of his early projects include a robot that navigated and mapped dangerous coal mines and a sewer robot that could spot problems in city sewers. 
“In the beginning, you don’t have to be very good, just first,” Whittaker said. Building such a legacy, however, takes time and diligent work. “It takes teams that do a lot, mechanics, electronics, software, and ideas. Most people begin without qualifications or certifications, and they just begin to do something.”
Smaller ‘cash cow’ projects aside, Whittaker is more renowned for his work during nuclear crises, such as the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Three-Mile Island accident in 1979. “It’s one of those events that comes from nowhere and shakes the world, and one way or another resourceful humans will respond and do something,” he said. 
Whittaker worked on automated cranes, which helped pour concrete to cover surface contamination; the Remote Reconnaissance Vehicle, which, according to his website, “brought back the first footage from the flooded basement of the damaged reactor;” and Pioneer, which did recovery and recon work. 
During the Three-Mile incident, Whittaker and his team were commissioned to create a machine that would help with cleanup of the area. After surveying the site, the team created wooden models that illustrated what could be done, and soon after received a contract for the work in October 1983. 
To Whittaker, mobility is one of the most important characteristics a robot can possess. “Tools don’t mean much if you can’t get them up to where you are going,” he said. 
His more recent work is related to autonomous car design and space exploration. Just three years ago, Whittaker and his team, “Tartan Racing,” won the 2007 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Grand Challenge, a $2 million contest for designing an autonomous vehicle. Whittaker currently holds the position of Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Astrobotic Technology, a company specializing in “commercial space enterprise.” 
According to the website astrobotictech.com, Whittaker has “won more than 80 contracts from NASA, the U.S. Energy Department and the Defense Department.”
He also is the leader of team Astrobotic, one of 29 teams competing in the $20 million Google Lunar X Prize, a competition that challenges teams to send a robot to the moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit data about the surface of the moon back to Earth. 
“It has the kind of sensors [and software] on it that are on race vehicles. The simplicity is that it is one monolithic piece; that keeps it simple. [It has] one thruster, and has all the considerations you would be familiar with in terms of structure and dynamics,” Whittaker explained. 
Currently, he expects his team to launch in December of 2013. “Once you are leading something, people expect you to win. Here’s the thing— if you do 99 percent of it right, it doesn’t matter because all you have to do is screw up one thing. Once you are close enough, there are two choices, you can either land or crash.” 
Whittaker mentioned the everyday applications for the technology he worked on. One example is the automatic brakes in newer car models. 
“Before that [existed], there would be technical demonstration principles, and there comes the question: Would anybody buy this? We put it in the high price models.” The two demographic groups affected would be young drivers, who do not have adequate control over their vehicles, and older drivers. Although he states there would be a large increase in accident reduction, there also exists insurance-related backlash. 
“Good drivers get helped, but bad drivers get their stats reported to [an] insurance company,” he added, laughing. No matter the project, Whittaker is excited to push the boundaries of both technological and outer space frontiers. 
“It’s never about the money,” Whittaker said, reflecting on his experiences. In closing, he posed another question to the audience, “Is there another place in the universe where this could have happened?”

Missiles, a common military technology thought reliable and practical today, were not always the ubiquitous technologies they have become. Their proliferation in wars has been due to the convenience they offer armies by being “fire-and-forget,” thanks to the homing systems that make them accurate and eliminate the need for them to be continuously guided. 
While some missiles use an active homing system utilizing radars and continuous calculations to ensure the missile stays on track, others use a more passive form of homing. These second types of missiles are referred to as “heat-seekers,” as they look for areas with strong infrared radiation to focus on as targets. While the technology might sound simple, it is surprisingly complex.
As any physics student will know, infrared radiation (IR) is a type of electromagnetic radiation occupying a section of the electromagnetic spectrum with larger wavelengths than visible light. Adding heat to bodies tends to increase the amount of IR they send out, as the extra energy of the body is turned into IR rays. As a result, warmer bodies emit more IR. Heat seekers track this output of IR and follow it to its source. 
Heat-seeking missiles cannot simply turn to the largest IR source in their vicinity and destroy it. The sun is a huge producer of IR, and the fighter jets that release heat seekers also tend to be quite hot, which means they, too, give out IR. 
To counteract the confusion these different sources can produce, heat seekers come equipped with navigation systems in their nose that contain an optical filter. This optical filter is calibrated to allow it to separate the unwanted data it receives from the useful information that will guide it to its target. 
The optical filters usually come in two varieties that operate in different ways: An absorption filter removes huge chunks of unwanted radiation, like IR coming from the sun, and an interference filter removes smaller, more specific parts of the incoming IR radiation. These technologies combine to produce an inner navigation system that can reliably focus on the intended target and prevent the missile from flying off into the nearest source of heat.
Apart from the optical filters that these missiles use to eliminate noise from the signals they receive, they also have a sensor head, made of a special combination of metals, and an aerodynamic shape. A particularly popular model made in the 1950s and still in use in a modified form today is called the Sidewinder. When this model was first made, it only used IR to seek out its targets, which made it susceptible to jamming. 
According to Wired.com, a method of jamming such missiles is to release decoy flares that have the heat signature of a jet engine to confuse the missile’s guidance system. IR ray fields and lasers can also confuse the optical sensors of such missiles. 
Hence, heat-seekers have now been modified to become much more versatile. According to Air Power Australia, newer models have lasers that emit a spoke-like pattern; the missile only triggers when the spoke pattern is disturbed or broken by an object fitting a pattern. This ensures that the missile only detonates when it reaches its target. Also, newer models are “two-color” models which means they sense different ranges of IR to ensure that they reach a target and not a decoy. 
Improved coolants have also been found to reduce the temperatures of the sensors on these missiles, as when the sensors are cool they tend to be able to sense a wider variety of IR radiation. New types of sensor cone shapes and fuses have ensured that the heat seeker stays current and useful. 
When looked at as a piece of technology, there is no doubt that heat-seeking missiles are quite an innovation, and the improvements made to them since their invention have ensured that they are usable even in today’s advanced world. 
While critics may not agree with the ways they are used, and their proponents might choose to focus upon the effects they can have during war through their destructiveness, neither side can deny that the missiles in and of themselves are technological marvels.

Obesity interacts with human cognition
A recent study reports that obesity slightly diminishes memory and other cognitive processes. Researchers at Kent State University recruited 150 obese individuals for a series of cognitive tests, with the participants weighing on average just under 300 pounds. 75 percent of the individuals performed on the low end of the normal range for healthy individuals, while the rest fell within the impaired range. The decline is likely due to damage to neural wiring that connects the brain’s various information-processing regions.

Brain implant still functional after 1,000 days
A woman who experienced a brainstem stroke that left her four limbs and vocal chords paralyzed demonstrated the ability to control a computer screen cursor by way of a computer chip implemented in her brain. The tiny silicon electrode array still proved functional after 1,000 days as the woman passed two simple tests on a computer screen: using a cursor to select targets arranged in a circle, and following and selecting a moving target that changed in size on the screen. A few engineering-related issues are hoped to be improved to increase signal quality.

Further evidence of first Americans 15,000 years ago
Newly unearthed objects discovered northwest of Austin, Texas are said to be the most convincing pieces of evidence that humans resided in what is now North America before the so-called “Clovis culture,” a human settlement whose artifacts were first excavated near Clovis, N.M., in the 1930s. The virtually undisturbed layer of artifact-containing earth is located below Clovis deposits and is consistently dated at 13,500 to 15,500 years old. Some artifacts include knife blades, spear points, and thousands of flakes and chips, which allude to human workmanship.

FDA approves new drug for skin cancer melanoma
A drug by the name “Yervoy” has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to help prolong the lives of people with the skin cancer melanoma. Working by activating the body’s immune system to combat tumors, the drug prolonged the lives of clinical trial patients by four months over patients in a control group who received a treatment believed to have little effect on the cancer. However, the additional four months come with a hefty price tag: the complete three-month course of treatment costs around $120,000.

Scientists study ‘Soundscape Ecology’
Biologists at Purdue University are studying what they refer to as “soundscape ecology,” the orchestration of all kinds of sounds coming from a particular ecosystem, such as a forest, that may be a unique measure of the overall state of health of the ecosystem. Along with understanding how various animals interact, a larger goal of the field of study is to understand how human-produced sounds, such as airplanes flying overhead, can affect ecosystem health and behavior.

Chat abbreviations added to Oxford English Dictionary
LOL, OMG, and FYI have been added to the March 2011 release of the online Oxford English Dictionary (OED). These abbreviations for “laugh out loud,” “oh my God,” and “for your information,” respectively, will accompany other shorthands like BFF (best friends forever) and TMI (too much information). OED stated that it has seen occurrences of these abbreviations before the Internet was even invented; uses of OMG and FYI were seen in personal letters in 1917 and 1941, respectively.

Spring fever is in the air. However, this spring, the fever or swine flu should be the least of students’ worries. Instead, they should start looking twice at their fellow classmates for signs of blood or rotting flesh, because Carnegie Mellon has been infected by Zombie College Musical.
Zombie College Musical is an original series of webisodes, short episodes released primarily on the Internet, created by students Yulin Kuang, a junior English and social decision sciences major, and David Grabowski, a senior music major. It follows the story of Peter Wells (Lachlan McKinney, a sophomore drama major), a college student, who in the first scene is in quarantine for swine flu. He leaves the hospital with a strange craving that he does not understand. However, he does not have time to dwell on the peculiar sensation because he is met outside the hospital by his crush, the newly single Ella Carmichael (senior music major Loghan Bazan) and his best friend Joey Crisp (junior music major Sean Pack). As Peter gets caught up again in both college life and silly musical numbers, something sinister lurks in the background. 
The first episode, which was uploaded onto YouTube on Dec. 6, 2010, has already received over 5,200 views. 
The original idea for Zombie College Musical originated over the summer. Kuang contacted Grabowski and asked him if he wanted to write a musical with her. Kuang recalled via e-mail, “Grabowski texted me back with, ‘How do you feel about zombies?’ And we pretty much went from there.” 
In order to make Zombie College Musical a reality, Benjamin Welmond, a junior art major who became the director of the project, enlisted the help of the Carnegie Mellon Film Club, the School of Art, the School of Design, and the School of Music.  
“It’s honestly a situation where we seek out people and ask them what they love to do, and they do it for us,” Welmond said. “It always amazes me that I never asked the crew, ‘Can we do this?’ but [rather] how do we do it.”
Kuang agreed. “We have a dedicated cast and crew [of] members from the College of Fine Arts, H&SS, and CIT.... [Associate teaching professor] Riccardo Schulz and the CFA Recording Studio have been incredibly generous in allowing us to use their facilities. The university has also awarded us a SURG grant for continuing production this semester. Everyone’s just been incredibly supportive.... It really is an amazing collaborative effort.” 
Stories about zombies are usually construed as horror stories; however, Zombie College Musical explores a range of emotion, from silly to serious. Kuang explained that he sees Zombie College Musical as “kind of a musical tragicomedy, inspired by the likes of Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog.” He elaborated, “It’s a zombie apocalypse and we shouldn’t forget that, but at the end of the day it’s still a musical and we can’t take ourselves too seriously.”
Welmond agreed. “I think it would be ridiculous not to acknowledge the general campiness that needs to exist in a Web series called Zombie College Musical. At the same time, the characters need to be real, so we never try to make their importance in the story as a joke.”
Alex Rothera, a sophomore art major who is one of the producers on the musical, explained, ”We are trying to surprise viewers. On the surface level we use zombies, songs, and cliché college characters to make a really fun and familiar plot. But as the series continues, we’re beginning to break down the characters into more interesting people that start to speak to a new level about adolescence.”
Pittsburgh has a rich history of zombie productions, ranging from iconic horror films shot here by George Romero and Tom Savini to an annual Zombie Walk, and even Evenings in Quarantine: A Zombie Opera, which premiered in Pittsburgh last fall. 
Kuang was aware of the influence of zombies on Pittsburgh; however, she herself was not an expert on the subject before writing Zombie College Musical. “To be quite honest,” she said, “I’m the least versed in zombies in the creative team. I do think it’s awesome that Pittsburgh has its own zombie culture, though, and it’s cool that we’ve created something that can take a part in that. I think it probably has something to do with the apocalypse weather we have here so often.”
“While David and I were setting down the story arc for the series, I was coming from a place where the only zombie-related things I’d seen was Zombieland and a few other spoofs,” Kuang said. “So, as far as knowing existing zombie tropes went, I was pretty uneducated. That being said, I think we have something interesting in a main character who’s slowly turning into a zombie just as a more traditional zombie plague is hitting the campus. Plus, we sing!”
Welmond concurred, “[We have] singing. Lots and lots of singing. The musical numbers [are what] really help to make the webisodes feel unique.... When [the songs are] complete, [they] sound like professional songs. Not to mention the importance of Dave’s underscoring [to them].”
Now that the first two episodes are out, Kuang hopes that “people watch and enjoy [them]. It’s been tremendous fun and hard work producing the series, and we hope that the take away is that we can make something really awesome if we take advantage of the resources our university has to offer.”
Filming has not been without problems. Welmond quipped that Carnegie Mellon “is the busiest school in the world” and, as a result, scheduling has been a real issue for the team. In addition, Rothera recalled that “things go wrong at almost every shoot. Horror stories, really, about forgetting lab coats and delayed shoots and whatnot.” 
However, Rothera said, “At the end of the day, it’s incredibly rewarding.” Kuang said, “As hokey as it sounds, it’s been an amazing experience collaborating with all the talented people in our cast and crew. When you spend so much time together working towards realizing this crazy dream, you really have to love the people there in the trenches with you.”
Welmond is on the same page. “At the end of the day, it’s nice to know you can wake up early in the morning and work all day, but be surrounded by an awesome group of people who are always happy to be there. No matter how many takes we’ve just done, every single person on the set walks away with a smile on their face.”
Carnegie Mellon students can still get involved in the production. Check out the group’s Facebook page (http://bit.ly/zcmusical) if you are interested in being an extra or crew hand. In addition, if you are interested in becoming a production assistant, attend a Carnegie Mellon Film Club meeting. 
Currently, Episodes 1 and 2 have been released on YouTube. The third episode of Zombie College Musical is currently in production, and a release date will be announced soon.

Specialized food shops seem to be a growing trend in Pittsburgh. First there was Dozen Bake Shop for delicious cupcakes, and then there was Razzy Fresh for frozen yogurt. They both have limited menus, but sell food that is affordable, well-liked, and consistent.
Now there is Waffallonia, a new waffle store in Squirrel Hill located at the old Dozen Bake Shop location. This bar-style waffle shop offers a limited variety of Belgian waffles. It is straightforward: You select a waffle and choose your toppings. The basic waffle is the Liège waffle (priced at $3), a pearl-sugar waffle served warm.
The menu behind the counter resembles a timetable at a European train station, decorated in green and white. Opposite the counter, a labeled map shows that Waffallonia names its waffles after different cites in Belgium, all connected by train. Waffles are ordered here and quickly snacked on at a ‘bar’ in the back.
Toward the back, there are three small ‘bars’ with a couple tall stools, enough for one to snack on a waffle efficiently and head out, not for sitting and chatting. The stools are not uncomfortable, but eating at the bar facing the wall is rather constrictive. The wooden panel wall reminds diners of a European winter cabin, a romantic notion that could be challenging to maintain once blazing summer comes to Pittsburgh.
Waffallonia is a play on words with Wallonia, a French-speaking region of Belgium. Waffallonia uses a cast-iron Belgian waffle iron with a larger and deeper indentation. In engineering-lingo, it gives a larger surface-, or crust-to-volume ratio. The iron is not what makes the waffle Belgian, however ­— it is the dough.
Unlike crisp American waffles, Belgian waffles are dough waffles rather than batter waffles. The yeast-based dough gives a different weight and texture than the batter of American cake waffles. Belgian waffles have a developed gluten structure — similar to bread — that makes the waffles thicker and more substantial.
The sugar waffles, Liège, have imported grain-size pearl sugar folded into the dough. Unlike granulated sugar, pearl sugar doesn’t melt away, instead staying more intact. At Waffalonia, the waffles have some caramelized edges and glaze where some sugar has melted against the iron. Diners can often bite into a waffle and find some sugar pearls still intact, resulting in small pockets of sweetness.
Waffallonia partially pre-bakes its waffles and finishes the baking when the waffle is ordered. While the store’s attempt to serve hot waffles amid the cold is admirable, the workers rarely heat the waffle long enough, so the end result is a warm waffle — not a hot, dark caramelized waffle — which can be somewhat disappointing. Customers might be able to convince the person behind the counter to cook it longer, but some workers are more willing than others. As a new shop, Waffallonia is not yet a smooth-running waffle bar, but will hopefully soon become one.
The basic Liège, slightly darker and warmer if asked for, is fantastic for those who do not have a big sweet tooth. It’s not too sweet, and eating one feels like eating a substantial, but not sugar-heavy dessert. Those who enjoy sweeter snacks should go for the Antwerp ($5), which is ice cream and chocolate sauce on a sugar waffle; Bruges ($4), a sugar waffle with strawberries and whipped cream; or Namur ($4.50), which is a waffle loaded with bananas and Nutella. If making a choice is too hard, there’s also the Charleroi ($5), which has strawberries, bananas, and Nutella, or the Waffallonia ($6), which can be loaded with every topping of choice. Whipped cream (+$0.50) or fruit toppings (+$1) are also available for customizing waffles.
There’s also an option of Speculoos spread. This Nutella look-a-like is a spread made of ground Speculoos, a European dessert cracker. The cracker is a specialty made in northern France and southern Belgium, near Wallonia. In Belgium, this sweet cracker is made up of various combinations of winter spices and beet syrup — imagine a winter-spiced animal cracker. One can ask for a Liège with Speculoos spread (+$1) smeared on like Nutella.
Waffalonia serves ice cream from Oakland’s Dave and Andy’s Ice Cream, a great option for when summer comes along and a hot waffle won’t do. Dave and Andy’s also makes a special Speculoos ice cream for Waffalonia to spice things up.
Waffalonia’s Liège is in every way becoming a great Pittsburgh waffle, with a respectable crusted sweet dough. But is a waffle with strawberries, whipped cream, and ice cream really a dessert? The restaurant’s set-up does not say “weekend breakfast,” and the waffle doesn’t seem to want to be breakfast either. And in the world of a college student, how will a $3 waffle stand up to a $3 bowl of frozen yogurt, especially when summer is just around the corner?
There is another question: Will Waffallonia be able to follow Dozen’s success? Remember that Dozen latched on the cupcake craze started by Carrie Bradshaw eating Magnolia Cupcake’s swirl frosting. The scene is so legendary that Magnolia now has multiple locations in Manhattan and has inspired other similar cupcake shops around the country. Even Dozen has branched out of mere cupcakes and turned itself into a multipurpose bakery, though. Frozen yogurt was already popular around the world before Razzy Fresh came to Pittsburgh. So, where does that leave Waffallonia’s Liège, Antwerp, and Bruges, and what will Waffallonia’s staying power be?

Panic! at the Disco isn’t your average pop-rock band. With an image styled off the Elizabethan and Victorian eras, Panic! is its own circus act, to the point of even incorporating literal circus acts. While Panic!’s third album, Vices and Virtues, is filled with plenty of eccentric sounds, including marimbas, synthesizers, and something that sounds suspiciously like a vibrating phone, the band has learned to reel these in and write songs that are both mature and glamorous. Many of the songs begin or conclude with experimental, but controlled, interludes. 
Vices and Virtues is the result of Panic! at the Disco losing half of its members to become a two-man lineup, with singer/instrumentalist Brandon Urie and drummer Spencer Smith reincorporating the exclamation point into the name. After former lead guitarist Ryan Ross’ departure, Urie has taken over his duties as primary songwriter. This has resulted in an eclectic collection of songs on Vices and Virtues that have little in common aside from their implications in terms of the album’s title. 
Panic! has deviated from its sophomore album quite a bit, but has taken the lessons learned on Pretty. Odd. and sprinkled them throughout to bring more rock into its sound. The playfulness seen in the band’s first album, A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, has been brought back in a great way. The first single, “The Ballad of Mona Lisa,” seems to embody the heart of Panic!’s new direction as a band and the album itself. It alludes to the “Mona Lisa”’s famous smile, and the emotional layers that are hidden beneath. The single is infallibly catchy, and its personal layer and dark verses fall victim to an overpowering, shopping mall anthem.
The absence of Ross’ writing can be seen most in more romantic songs such as “Sarah Smiles,” which has none of the dark cynicism featured prominently on A Fever, yet this allows it to be much more direct when Urie addresses his girlfriend — “Oh Sarah, are you saving me?” — and, as a result, likely more accessible. “The Calendar” seems to be a song in the same vein, but it is more focused on the band’s split and the ability to move forward as individuals.
“Trade Mistakes” is perhaps the weakest song on the album, and it is easy to gloss over. The bouncy verses and the chimes used in the introduction are promising, but the chorus and bridge are a bit of a letdown.
Picking a favorite song is difficult, as Panic! is able to cater to many different tastes. For those fans of more traditional emo-pop, “Hurricane” has all the teenage energy of Panic!’s contemporaries with an added dose of funk, as well as a stylish piano and horn outro. The album’s Deluxe Edition extra tracks “Oh Glory!” and “I Wanna Be Free” channel even more teenage angst. Near opposite from these is the baroque-inspired album closing song, “Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met).”
With such a diverse collection of songs, Vices and Virtues is able to appeal to many moods and many tastes; each track is likely to be an experience in something completely different. At the same time, the CD is held together by a charm that never gets lost.

If Inception and Shutter Island left you craving more science fiction, then Limitless is definitely for you. Bradley Cooper, who played Phil in The Hangover, returns to the silver screen in this American techno-thriller as an average guy who comes across a pill which enables him to use his brain in the most efficient manner possible. But the question remains: What is the brain capable of doing when used to its maximum capacity?
The story revolves around Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a writer experiencing writer’s block with a deadline to meet. His life is down in the dumps until he runs into his ex-brother-in-law on the street. His brother-in-law, who is a drug dealer, offers Eddie a drug which will allow him to use all of his brain as opposed to the normal 20 percent. Tempted, Eddie consumes the drug, only to want more as it allows him to perform super-human tasks such as completing a draft of his book within a day, learning languages by simply hearing other people talk, and recalling small instances stored in his brain, giving him the ability to speak about absolutely anything knowledgeably. With a steady supply of pills to help him succeed, Eddie does odd jobs to come up with money for the drugs. Everything is going smoothly until one day, he finds his brother-in-law murdered. 
With a stash of drugs kept safely with him, Eddie continues his splendid lifestyle and enters the stock market, where his fast pace gets him noticed by a powerful businessman: Carl Van Loon, played by Robert DeNiro. Under Loon, Eddie rises to become a stock market “god,” gets back with his girlfriend who had previously dumped him, and is living in grandeur.
But this sudden success can only continue for so long. Eddie soon experiences the side effects of the drugs, as well as the intense withdrawal symptoms that occur if one tries to stop taking the medication, which can eventually prove to be fatal. Simultaneously, Eddie is continually harassed by people who have also learned about the power of the pill, including a Russian mobster, a client of his ex-brother-in-law, and many more suspicious characters. 
Like most thrillers, the audience can anticipate the point where the protagonist loses everything, only to turn things around again in his favor. Although the movie provides its audience with a unique theme and context along with a fast-paced beginning, the ending is much too dry for some viewers’ tastes and has several serious flaws, leaving lingering questions.
Also, the reality of the pills isn’t exactly along the lines that one would have presumed, making the ending not nearly as thrilling. However, director Neil Burger (The Illusionist), provides a great storyline, one that will definitely excite movie buffs and provide instances where the ongoing action can enrapture the audience, a feat achieved only by a few thriller movies, making this a memorable watch.

Michael John Cuervorst, a master’s student in music composition at Carnegie Mellon, created a campus-wide music composition contest this semester. Although the contest was not highly advertised — mainly through posters placed around CFA — four contestants participated.
The winner of the contest, Robert Randazzo, a junior music composition student with a minor in music education, was chosen by two faculty judges in a blind judging.
Randazzo says he saw the flyers in CFA and was intrigued. The guidelines of the contest were straightforward: write three to five short musical compositions for three to five players. Using these guidelines, Randazzo strove to push the boundaries of musical composition in his aptly titled piece “3-to-5-Miniatures.”
When one discusses Randazzo’s compositions with him, it is clear that he is a student passionate about his major and about music. He patiently explained some of the more technical terms in his piece and how he believed he had achieved a new personal level of musical exploration through it.
Using mainly a soprano voice and a vibraphone, he created miniature compositions about a page each in length. “I chose the two instruments because I love how they sound together and individually,” stated Randazzo. “The piece is about the relationship between these two instruments and how they interact together and apart. The vibraphone imitates the vibrato in a singer’s voice, so I played with that similarity throughout my composition.”
“The music program here is very classically strong, but as a music composer you are exposed to a lot of modern music,” said Randazzo. “I drew from this exposure and tried to make this composition avant garde in the sense that it seeks to be adventurous in surprising ways.” His decision to submit the composition in handwritten form differs from the norm of standardized pieces and also lends it a personal edge.
This competition was the first composition contest that Randazzo has won to date. “It felt great to win the contest and I was very confident in my piece when I submitted it,” said Randazzo. As a junior in the music department, Randazzo is required to give a junior recital. He plans to perform his piece “3-to-5-Miniatures” at the recital, which will be held on April 23 at 8 p.m. in the Alumni Concert Hall.

Our relationships with people are the most valuable things we will ever form in our lifetime. They surpass the value of any job we will ever hold, any beautiful landscape we will ever see, and any ounce of fame we hope to attain. Before traveling abroad, I expected my four-month experience to yield dozens of breathtaking views, cultural anecdotes, and many pictures of me standing awkwardly next to famous landmarks to send home to my family. Now, as I reflect on my time in St. Gallen, Switzerland, the things I remember the most are not the famous landmarks, nor the sheer beauty of the country, but the friendships I made and strong relationships that I still hold close.
Little more than a year ago, I wasn’t even planning to go to Switzerland... ever. The opportunity seemed great, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest myself in taking this risk. The day the study abroad application was due was the day I decided (on a whim) to apply because I wanted to be able to tell people that “at least I tried” to study abroad. I felt extremely honored to be selected to participate in the School of Design’s exchange program with the Schule für Gestaltung, St. Gallen. Carnegie Mellon’s relationship with Schule für Gestaltung has lasted 20 years and remains one of the longest-standing exchange programs in the School of Design. Switzerland has historically set the standard for good design, and our exchange program has become a valuable asset to design students. I was excited to have the opportunity, but I had no idea that an eleventh-hour decision and a completely random living arrangement would produce many of the best friendships I have had.
The Swiss people are very proud of their self-sufficient nature, but are very humble, genuine, and loyal. During my time in St. Gallen, I lived with the Osterwalder family in their apartment. The Osterwalders’ daughter, Lara, studied at Carnegie Mellon as a part of the exchange, while I lived with her family in Switzerland. Their son Patrick and I quickly became friends. Patrick’s willingness to show me Switzerland made our friendship all the more special. Patrick led me on a couple of hiking excursions through the Alps. Our hikes tested our trust in each other early and often. I’ll never forget Patrick telling me matter-of-factly, “On part of this hike we tie a rope to each other so that if one us slips down one side of the mountain, the other person can jump off the other side so no one falls all the way down.” Neither of us fell, and after eight hours of strenuous hiking we completed the hike, rewarded by the breathtaking view and each other’s company. It’s hard to put the feeling of walking to the sky and hearing a constant clanging of cowbells into words. Patrick’s immense knowledge of alpine hiking and strong outdoor skills were a huge help. I wouldn’t have made it to the top without him.
Josef Osterwalder: Lara and Patrick’s father, 70 years old, husband, local historian, journalist, author, book collector, and consistent voice of reason who also became one of my good friends. He’s one of those people that I just know I was meant to meet in life some way or another. It’s often weird how we are connected with people. How split-second decisions and a bit of luck can often times put us in the best of situations when we least expect it. I don’t think you can ever expect to be connected to someone halfway across the world, but sometimes the stars align, everything falls into place, and you find yourself experiencing something that must have just been meant to be.
Josef’s first words to me were, “Are you going to teach me better English?” to which I responded, “Only if you teach me better German.” Our friendship took off after that. There were often late evenings that Josef, Sharon (my host mom), and I spent at the kitchen table with a glass of wine, talking about anything from family to politics to school to life in general. These conversations enlightened me to Swiss culture and allowed me to share my perspective as an American. That being said, I tried mostly to play the role of listener to soak up all the great stories.
Josef is a popular man who has earned every bit of respect he’s been given. He isn’t known for breaking any world records, but everyone in the city (and I mean everyone) knows him because he cares. Josef is one of the few people I know whose earliest memory was hearing bombs over Germany, who used to hike in the Alps for an “afternoon walk,” who has interviewed the Pope’s brother, who is friends with famous Swiss designers, who studied theology and philosophy in Rome, and after all those experiences is still humble enough to live a modest lifestyle, enjoy his family, and 
welcome complete strangers into his home. I’m also grateful that Sharon spent time to help me with my German skills and often shared her love of music. I am thankful that I was privileged to share four months of my life with them. It made my life in Switzerland more wholesome. I became part of a family.
At Schule für Gestaltung I worked in a design studio along with nine Swiss students and Allison Lenz (CFA’12), my American counterpart. While we were under the direction of four professors the atmosphere was collaborative, much like the community atmosphere of our School of Design here at Carnegie Mellon. Each day we worked in the studio from 8:30–4:30, focusing on a single class or project each day. Our work ranged from developing a new visual identity system for an annual event with the local museums to developing illustrations for the annual report of Switzerland’s main health insurance company. Although the work was exciting and challenging, the best experience within the design studio was having the chance to collaborate with talented Swiss design students. Often our conversations drifted between German and English while we shared our experiences and became good friends. Often, Allison and I joined them after class for dinner or to explore the city.
A week before leaving St. Gallen, the students and professors invited us for a dinner of cheese fondue to celebrate an incredible semester. Andreas Tschachtli, our professor and main adviser, described the experience best when he told us, “Your time here is about making connections to last a lifetime. You realize that acquaintances will become your best friends and it doesn’t matter that there is an ocean in between.”

100 YEARS AGO -- March 29, 1911
A small column thanks The Tartan’s “unknown benefactor,” who deposited a penny into the newspaper’s mailbox in the Science Building. “Mr. Ormston of Oil City” was initially suspected, but then indignantly cleared himself of the crime. Overall, it doesn’t exactly sound like a successful fundraiser.
50 YEARS AGO -- March 29, 1961
The Tartan asks students if booths should be part of the upcoming Spring Carnival. It’s not surprising that all of the answers were resoundingly in favor, but we do wonder what past upheaval caused one respondent to call Booth a “tradition which is slowly being choked to death in the name of progress.”
25 YEARS AGO -- April 1, 1986
Morewood Gardens burning to the ground is the lead article in The Natrat, The Tartan’s annual April Fools issue. Apparently, the fire spread via a confusing chain of candles, a typewriter, a Cabbage Patch doll, a garbage can, and an exploding dryer. Hang on a minute — a typewriter?
10 YEARS AGO -- April 9, 2001
In student government elections, the winning candidates for student body president and vice president collect 321 votes. The tally is considered high amid “increased ... election hype and voter turnout.” It wouldn’t be so bad these days either.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- March 27, 2006
Around 2,000 anti-war activists march from East Liberty to Oakland to protest the war in Iraq’s third anniversary. A student marcher refers to the military action as “the long war.” With the Iraq war still on five years later, he’d have to call it “the extra-super-double-plus-long war” now.
ONE YEAR AGO -- March 29, 2010
A referendum on stipends for student executives heads to a vote next week. The proposal comes from Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola, citing an “endless” to-do list of meetings and decisions. By that metric, we all ought to be getting salaries.

True Grit
10 12
A remake of Charlie Portis’ novel of the same name, the Coen brothers’ True Grit was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor. In the film, 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) wants to hire a deputy U.S. Marshal to track down Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), a hired hand who murdered her father. She eventually convinces the merciless Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to do the job, and insists that he let her accompany him on the manhunt. Also starring Matt Damon as a Texas ranger, the film is a more faithful adaptation of the book than the 1969 version of True Grit, which starred John Wayne.
127 Hours
10 12
By now, you’ve probably heard all about 127 Hours, which is based on the life-threatening experience of Carnegie Mellon alumnus Aron Ralston. For those of you who haven’t heard, though: 127 Hours stars James Franco as mountain climber Aron Ralston, who decides to go canyoneering alone in Canyonlands National Park in Utah. As he descends through a narrow passage, a boulder is jarred loose and ends up pinning Ralston’s arm to a canyon wall. Ralston eventually is forced to cut off his own arm with a dull knife in order to escape and save himself. Fun fact: The real-life Ralston will speak at Carnegie Mellon’s Commencement this year. Maybe he can explain why he thought hiking through dangerous areas alone was a good idea.
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
10 12
Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 film received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The movie focuses on Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), ex-lovers who have had all memories of their relationship erased through targeted memory erasure, a non-surgical procedure performed by the company Lacuna, Inc. The film has a nonlinear narrative style, alternating between Joel’s memories, the current interactions between him and Clementine, and additional story arcs involving Lacuna employees Patrick (Elijah Wood) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst). Fun fact: Although memory erasure sounds like pure science fiction, according to Scientific American, scientists are already able to prevent specific memories from being stored in the brain.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
The fall schedule of classes is up! I am torn between being excited and terrified. How can I possibly pick a schedule for next semester with so many classes offered?!
Sincerely,
Confused
Dear Confused,
The first thing you need to do to pick out your schedule is to make sure you’re signed up for all the classes your major requires for the semester. This should give you two or three classes. 
Now it’s time to pick electives. There are exactly two ways to go about this. The first is to scour the Schedule of Classes (SOC). This must be done thoroughly. I mean, you must read class descriptions for every single field of study. Compile a list of the 30 or so classes that sound interesting to you and sign up for the maximum number possible.
If you don’t like this strategy, there is one other option for you. Tape the names of some classes that sound easy to a nearby dartboard and throw some darts. Take whichever ones you hit. And hey, if you have really bad aim, you just might end up with a really easy semester.
Don’t throw darts when people are standing nearby,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m moving into an apartment next semester, and I need to find a cheap mattress that won’t give me STDs or lice. What do you recommend?
Thanks,
Homeless
Dear Homeless,
The solution to this problem depends on how much you really care about what you’re sleeping on. If you’re really desperate to save money, just drive down Beeler in May and see if you can find a mattress for free in someone’s garbage. Be warned: There were college kids sleeping on these mattresses. They probably got them from their friends who graduated the year before, who probably got them from someone else’s garbage. Just... be careful.
If cleanliness is your main concern, you probably shouldn’t be buying used mattresses anyway. That’s gross, man. Your best bet is IKEA. They have cheap mattresses as well as bed frames. And dressers. And silverware. The only problem is that when you walk out of the store, you’ll end up having spent about $1,000 on accessories. Even the strongest-willed can’t resist those matching measuring cups!
Enter IKEA at your own risk,
Brian Hoskins

Tommy Guerrero is a man I wish more people my age knew about. One month ago, he released his 10th album in 13 years, Lifeboats and Follies.
A native San Franciscan, Guerrero has been releasing solo instrumental rock recordings, whose nuances in musical feel vary considerably, since 1997. As is said in every review, Tommy comes from the intense DIY culture of ’80s skating, having been a prominent member of the Bones Brigade, Peralta’s professional skateboarding team. He was a member of the skate rock band Free Beer and the experimental jazz and funk group Jet Black Crayon. His songs are cocktails of fused rock, soul, jazz, rap, and funk. Some of you might know him for his submissions to the game skate. by EA.
The music on Lifeboats and Follies is far more contemplative than his Soul Food Taqueria, meatier than A Little Bit of Something, and far smokier and more jazz-oriented than Hoy Yen Ass’n. The songs are often mysterious, ushering up dark purple and blue vistas of the fog-laden San Francisco Bay at four in the morning, pierced by the quiet orange and white of incandescent lights. Although the composition of these pieces is Guerrero’s, mad props have to go out to the musicians on this album, many of whom have played with Guerrero in Jet Black Crayon.
This is definitely my favorite album of 2011. If you’re looking for something to listen to while you ink comics at three in the morning, this is the ticket. This album is in that beautiful territory of being indefinable in terms of traditional genres. Highlights of the album’s style include laid-back instrumentation with funk and rocksteady as prime influences.
In summation, the biggest folly on your part would be to not hop out of your lifeboat into Guerrero’s sea of soul.
Hugs and kisses,
Juan Fernandez

Students damaged the Fence with a hacksaw last Monday. At around 4 p.m., a group of students observed individuals cutting through a crosspiece and column of the Fence. Facilities Management Services staff covered the damaged portions with duct tape and plastic as a temporary measure, fully repairing it the next day.
Nicholas Petrillo, a senior mechanical engineering major, was an eyewitness to the vandalism. He recalled that he was initially confused before he realized what was actually happening. 
“Basically I was walking across from Baker Hall to the University Center,” he said. “As I was walking up to the Fence, it looked as if [students] were putting stuff on [it]. I thought maybe there was an art project happening on the Fence — it’s happened before.... As I got down by the flagpole, I look back and I see someone with a saw.”
Petrillo and his friends immediately went into the University Center and approached members of the Office of Student Activities. “We went over the [student] activities office and asked [if there was] something going on with the Fence.... I said, ‘I think someone is taking a saw to the Fence,’ ” Petrillo said. Upon hearing that students were actively defacing the Fence, the Student Activities staff members responded to the scene along with a University Police officer. “We grabbed a [Carnegie Mellon] officer, and we all walked over and asked, ‘What are you doing?’ ” Petrillo said.
Will Weiner, a sophomore economics and social and decision sciences dual major, was with Petrillo when the students responsible for the vandalism were approached and questioned. “It was really weird, too, because they were just sitting there,” Weiner said. “We approached the Fence, and [the students] tried to conceal the saw.... We asked what they were doing, if it was for an art project, and they responded ‘kind of.’ We told them to stop and leave.... A fair bit of damage had been done at that point.”
According to Weiner and Petrillo, the responsible students saw the paint peeling from the rain and thought it looked interesting; from there, they obtained a saw and began to chip away at the Fence. 
The names of the students were collected by the members of the Office of Student Affairs who accompanied Petrillo and Weiner to the Fence. Those students present at the scene reported that the vandals were first-year art majors, although the Office of Student Affairs has not released a list. Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno confirmed her office’s involvement and indicated that an official investigation is ongoing.
The aftermath of the event left students angry and upset. “When I saw the pictures, I ran over here and my heart stopped,” said Molly Walter, a junior psychology major. “I felt sick. I love the Fence.”
As soon as word of the defacement spread, students gathered to discuss and explore solutions of how to repair the campus icon. The event resulted in a cross-campus discussion on the meaning and tradition of the Fence. A majority of the students gathered around the landmark were visibly upset with what had occurred. “I’m just glad we managed to stop them.... [The Fence] is a big part of Carnegie Mellon. I’m just very angry,” Weiner said.

A group of first-year art students used a hacksaw on the Fence Monday afternoon to carve away some of its layers of paint. In response, Tim Hieter, a master’s candidate in materials science and engineering, created a Facebook event — “Operation Heal the Fence” — that attracted hundreds of students to the Cut that night to reclaim and repaint the Fence.
Hieter, after hearing about what happened to the Fence, began discussing his reaction with friends. “We see it as the one real, easily identifiable symbol of Carnegie Mellon, and everyone loves it,” he said. 
The Facebook group began as a way to organize his friends, but after only two hours, nearly 300 people had committed to attending. By the end of the night, this number had climbed to almost 1,000. 
Those who arrived at midnight took turns painting the Fence black, adding the message “Don’t mess with our Fence” on the side facing Forbes Avenue, and writing personal messages of support on the opposite side. Nicholas Petrillo, a senior in mechanical engineering, painted the first stroke, explaining through a megaphone while standing on the nearby picnic table that the Fence would be captured by the traditional rules and that no one was to begin painting until midnight. As Carnegie Mellon’s  website and the Student Handbook outline, groups must capture and paint the Fence between midnight and daybreak.
Many students pointed to these rules in condemning the accused vandals. Additionally, Hieter felt that “painting the Fence is adding to its history” and that by removing layers of paint, “they were taking that history away.” Other students echoed his sentiments. 
Will Weiner, a sophomore economics and social and decision sciences dual major, and Jay Rockwell, a junior biomedical and chemical engineering major, were some of the first to notice when students began cutting into the Fence. Weiner, Rockwell, and others confronted the students, who were then escorted away by university personnel. Weiner described the Fence as “the definition of school spirit” and noted that “everybody felt hurt” by the destructive actions.
Indeed, many attendees at Operation Heal the Fence expressed their anger and called for disciplinary action. Kong Wong, a junior chemical engineering major, said it was “an act of vandalism, and expulsion of the students should be on the table.” 
In an earlier e-mail, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno confirmed that her office was investigating the incident for potential violations of university standards. She declined to name the students involved or discuss any details of the investigation, citing the confidential nature of the process.
While Operation Heal the Fence’s Facebook wall attracted support for Hieter’s efforts to reclaim the Fence, it also became a sounding board for students’ anger toward the accused students. Some comments bordered on threats, something Hieter called an “overreaction.” He hoped students would use the event for “showing school spirit as opposed to blaming.” He consequently deleted many of the threats.
One student, however, claimed that her non-supportive but non-threatening comments were deleted. Casey Li Brander, a senior art major, said that she posted comments describing the not-so-happy history of the Fence. Originally, the Fence separated Margaret Morrison Women’s College and the Carnegie Institute of Technology. As the plaques in the Maggie Murph Café testify, the college routinely denied women’s requests to enroll in math, science, and other high-level courses deemed inappropriate or too difficult for women. 
Brander protested that the Fence “builds a sense of community only if your membership in a community is based on fetishizing this object — who sets this criterion?” Indeed, while many at the event could recite the rules for painting the Fence, none mentioned its history as a symbol of gender inequity.
Operation Heal the Fence celebrated the aforementioned community. 
Club music blared while underclassmen, graduate students, and student government members mingled and recaptured the Fence. Hundreds of — but not the nearly 1,000 — students dropped studying for a night to show their support.

Junior mechanical engineering and public policy major Jake Flittner and sophomore materials science and biomedical engineering major Sangita Sharma are running against juniors in materials science and biomedical engineering Turi Alcoser and Kelsey Briggs, respectively, in the race for student body president and student body vice president.
In addition to the positions of student body president and vice president, candidates for vice presidential positions for finance and for organizations are up for election. Junior business administration major My Le is running unopposed for student body vice president of finance. Senior social and decision sciences major Meghan Nahass, junior computer science major Will Zhang, and sophomore general MCS student Varun Deshpande are all running for student body vice president of organizations.
Student government has also put a non-binding referendum regarding Carnegie Mellon’s participation in the Collegiate Readership Program on the ballot. The Collegiate Readership Program provides copies of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The New York Times, and USA Today to students at no cost beyond a $5 media fee.
Both tickets agree that communication with the student body has been a problem under the current president and vice president, Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith.
“This has been one of the biggest shortfalls of student government since Jared Itkowitz [student body president during the 2008–09 school year],” remarked Flittner, who believes that past presidents were only eager to publicize work related to issues raised during their campaign. “A lot of stuff can pop up in office for the executives to deal with that aren’t necessarily related to their platforms, so they have to find a balance between working on that and working on their other initiatives. But regardless of what they do, they have to publicize what they are doing.... We are ready to tackle that problem.”
“Since the beginning, Kelsey and I have identified the transparency and communication problems between the executive branch and the student body,” Alcoser said. “I want students to recognize us and know that we are here.”
“We would rather that students feel bombarded with information than feel that they aren’t being recognized or cared about,” he said. Briggs added, “But we want to find a healthy balance.”
Flittner, Sharma, Alcoser, and Briggs will all face off today at the Tartan Debates. The elections will take place from April 2 to 5.
For more information about the candidates or their platforms: www.buildingabettercmu.com for Flittner and Sharma; and www.engineeringchangecmu.org for Alcoser and Briggs.
Editor’s Note: Turi Alcoser is a staffwriter for The Tartan.
Jake Flittner and Sangita Sharma’s platform, which they have labeled “Building a better Carnegie Mellon,” has six main points: Community Building, Government Relations, Health and Safety, Transparency, Transportation, and Continuing Past Initiatives.
“We feel that in order to effectively fill the roles of student body president and student body vice president, you have to cover a variety of initiatives on many different issues,” Flittner said. “For areas that already have a heavy infrastructure for working on these issues ... our main goal is to help those infrastructures with our cabinet. Our goal is also to build new infrastructures in area where there isn’t heavy infrastructure.”
Flittner and Sharma said that their platform is based on experience. “The longer [you’ve] been in student government, the more knowledge you get [about] issues that are happening on campus ... and the more you see ways you can make changes and implement them on campus,” said Flittner, who has been a Student Senator since his first year here. “[Our platform] is really a culmination of all my experiences over the past three years.”
In addition to experience, Sharma also adds a direct link to many of the issues addressed in her and Flittner’s platform. “I’m already very involved in different areas of campus,” she said. “[Running for office] is taking a step forward. This is a way I can do something that affects all of the student body, not just an individual organization or group.”
In contrast, Turi Alcoser and Kelsey Briggs stress how they are running because they are not “involved” in student government and can introduce new viewpoints to those are have been involved.
“If you are involved in student government, you have a very specific viewpoint on how student government works ... and that narrows your views of things,” explained Briggs. “I want to run because I have experienced things in a very different light. We hear this whole other spectrum of concerns because we aren’t involved in student government.” 
Having an outside perspective is key to Alcoser and Briggs’ campaign strategy and platform. They feel it gives them an important distinction from their competitors. 
From this vantage point, Alcoser said that the he sees the main issue for students is stress: “I’m sure that many students can attest to this, and I want to show that I when I leave here from Carnegie Mellon, I recognized this problem and I did something about it.”
Alcoser and Briggs’ platform, which they have labeled “Engineering Change,” has five main points: Mind, Body, and Wellness; Undergrad-Grad Collaboration; Empowering Diversity; Unifying the Greek Community; and Current Administrative Initiatives.
Alcoser and Briggs drew their platform’s five main points from both of their various experiences and extracurricular activities on campus. “Our platform is what we live,” Alcoser said. “These are the areas that we are involved in on campus.”

Indira Nair speaks about her life journey. 
Indira Nair, Carnegie Mellon’s former vice provost for education, retired at the end of last year following 32 years of dedication to the university. This past Tuesday, she returned to campus to deliver a lecture as part of “Journeys,” one of Carnegie Mellon’s University Lecture Series and the successor to the “Last Lecture” series. Her topic was “Teachers All Around Me: My Life of Learning.” She spoke about the “lessons learned along this journey and the worlds they opened up.”
More a narrative than a memoir, Nair’s lecture discussed the most important learning opportunities of her life and what she described as her “intellectual journey.” She used her life as a learning ground for four significant themes: the ethic of care; identity, authenticity, and integrity; respect for time and questions; and literacy versus expertise.
In her introduction, Amy Burkert, the current vice provost for education at Carnegie Mellon, welcomed her as “the creator and architect of the Journeys series.” 
Nair began her lecture with her childhood experiences in Trivandrum, Kerala — a state on the southwest coast of India — where she grew up with a unique, statewide emphasis on education and literacy. Offering a sample of the atmosphere, Nair recounted one story where a government official came to her house demanding to know why she, a five-year-old girl, was not in school when children were required to begin their education at age four. Even today, she said, Kerala has the highest literacy rate in all of India.
Nair’s family reinforced this early government-based focus on education, insisting that she achieve her bachelor’s degree and teaching her a lasting lesson about the value of internalizing knowledge.
As she moved on to her experiences in higher education at Elphinstone College’s Institute of Science, graduate school in Kansas, and a Ph.D. at Northwestern University, Nair talked with passion about her love of physics. Once she graduated from Northwestern, she and her husband decided to come to Pittsburgh; a decision that eventually led her to Carnegie Mellon.
After some time teaching science classes at Bishop Canevin High School, Nair joined Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy (EPP). She began as a part-time research assistant, post-doctorate, and a part-time administrative worker. 
According to the University Lecture Series website on Nair’s lecture, “She founded the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Student Pugwash to encourage students to think about the social responsibility of science and technology.” While working as a professor in EPP, Nair developed strong relationships with students, she said she would sometimes “[advise] whole fraternities because one [student] was [her] real advisee.” She also grew close to fellow faculty members and mentors. 
Reflecting on her success at the university, she stated that “freedom and a trust in our abilities,” was what allowed her and her colleagues in her department to develop.
Nair also commented on the lessons that she learned from unexpected sources — her children and time. She credits her younger daughter with having taught her the importance of wonder “in life and in teaching.” Time, she said, was responsible for a different side of her learning: the differences between economy and ecology, cure and care, and efficiency and efficacy. Time is also responsible for what Nair described as the “only edge [professors] have over [their] students.”
Nair ended her lecture with a passage from Rainer Maria Rilke, an Austrian poet, that addresses the issue of living and learning. 
“Love the questions themselves,” he wrote in Letters to a Young Poet. “Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them.... Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually ... live along some distant day into the answer.”

Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon gave an address on the state of the university last Friday. The event, which was organized by the Staff Council, was an open forum intended to respond to staff concerns. Prior to the address, staff members submitted questions and comments, and Cohon chose his talking points from the submissions. After Cohon’s address, the forum was opened to the audience.
Many of the questions Cohon received dealt with his salary. In November 2009, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that between the 2006–07 and 2007–08 school years, Cohon’s “total compensation” (salary and benefits) was raised from $591,876 to $733,220. According to the Post-Gazette, this figure is “above the median ... for the major private research universities.” The next year, Carnegie Mellon implemented a salary freeze for employees, Cohon included. 
Cohon responded to this article, saying that his salary is $556,000 a year and has not increased since 2007. However, he did not reveal the total dollar amount of his benefits. “The university, in every respect, for every position, tries to compensate at levels comparable to the median percentile,” he said.
Carnegie Mellon compares the salaries of the president, vice presidents, and deans to those of 30 comparable universities; Cohon said that his salary is in the bottom 10th percentile of those universities. However, as a result of an agreement made in 2007, Cohon received a $91,000 bonus last summer. Cohon said that he gifted the bonus back to the university. Cohon was adamant that he would never take a bonus or raise during a salary freeze. He said there will be small salary raises in the next fiscal year.
In response to next year’s tuition increase, Cohon said that the financial aid office is in touch with students, attempting to detect financial stress and avoid students dropping out for financial reasons. He said that he believes the attempts have been successful so far, as the university’s student retention rate is at a historic high.
The university website reports that tuition will be raised 4 percent for new students and 3 percent for returning students in the fall 2011 semester.
Another concern that Cohon addressed was the state of university and regional transportation, particularly Port Authority (PAT) service cuts. According to the PAT website, 29 bus routes will be eliminated by the end of this month, and 37 more will see a significant reduction in weekday service.
“The university ... has been very active ... about service cuts, trying to protect as much of the service from PAT [as possible] and, in fact, improve it,” Cohon said. He highlighted the buses that run eastbound on Forbes Avenue between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. as particularly problematic, and said that the university had received assurances “as recently as this week” that PAT services around campus will improve.
Cohon also addressed allegations of increasing bureaucracy within the university’s administration, saying that, as irritating as bureaucracy may be, “Every time we approve a new level of authorization, or a new form, or something like that, it’s for a good reason.”
For those interested, Cohon said that Carnegie Mellon’s Council on Administration, Regulation, and Finance is developing a website from which staff members and students will be able to find out the reasoning behind new bureaucratic requirements.
Cohon received several questions which dealt with the new 10-year master plan. The plan, which Cohon said will go to the city for approval within 30 days, outlines ideas for a new Tepper building constructed in part of the space now used for the Morewood parking lot, as well as development of newly acquired properties on Forbes Avenue.
“We don’t really have any plans per se,” said Cohon, “but we have a lot of wishes, hopes, and desires.” He said that the university definitely intends to build on the land. As for the new Tepper building, Cohon said that it is in the discussion stage.
Michael Murphy, the vice president for Campus Affairs, cautioned people to take the master plan with a grain of salt. “Every master plan has many more projects on it, many more buildings on blueprints, than will ever happen,” he said. The important thing, he added, is “to have the approval to move forward on eventual projects that may come to pass.”
Overall, said Cohon, “The university is doing very well. The key things that we do — that is teaching, and research, and public service — are all areas where the university is excelling.”

Jee-Hoon Choi, a senior in the School of Art, died in a car accident early Friday morning while he and a group of friends were driving to Florida.
The group he was traveling with included nine Carnegie Mellon students, five of whom were in the same vehicle as Choi. They are currently receiving appropriate care in Florida. Two staff members from the Office of Student Affairs traveled to Florida to support the students and their family members.
Gina Casalegno, dean of Student Affairs, issued the official communications report about Choi’s death, stating that all official memorial plans and events for Choi will be communicated to students.
“Jee was a tremendous person. He was the type of person who would walk into a room and instantly light it up,” said Rebecca Feeney, a senior art major, via e-mail. “He was a friend to everyone he met; a truly gifted artist and a beloved brother and son.”
Tonight, friends of Choi will be gathering to paint the Fence in his memory, as well as write letters of support to his family.

President Cohon wins 2011 National Engineering Award
Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon was awarded the 2011 National Engineering Award from the American Association of Engineering Societies. The association gives this award to individuals who strive toward excellence in engineering education, the improvement of the profession, and the development of public policies.
Cohon exemplifies these requirements through his career. He has served as the dean of Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. In 1973, he began his teaching and research career in the department of geography and environmental engineering at Johns Hopkins. Cohon also served as assistant and associate dean of engineering and vice provost for research at Johns Hopkins. 
He has authored, coauthored, and edited over 80 professional publications focusing on topics relating to environmental and water resource systems analysis. He has worked on water resource problems in the U.S., South America, and Asia, as well as issues relating to nuclear waste shipping and storage. 
Outside of the academic realm, Cohon served as a legislative assistant for energy and the environment in 1977 and 1978 under former New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He was also appointed to the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board in 1995 and served as its chairman in 1997.
Professor writes memoir on survival and being a scholar
Edith Balas, a Carnegie Mellon professor of art history, survived numerous trials throughout her life; these include living through the Nazi death camp Auschwitz, handling the disappearance of her husband after falling into disfavor with communists, and facing the recurrence of breast cancer five times.
In her new book published by the Carnegie Mellon University Press, Bird in Flight: Memoir of a Survivor and Scholar, Balas describes her past of enduring harsh circumstances and evolving into what she calls a “professional survivor.”
Balas grew up in the Transylvanian city of Cluj, but her childhood abruptly ended in 1944 when Germany occupied Hungary. Her family was deported to Auschwitz, but she managed to escape the atrocities of the camp. She hopes for her book to allow young people to understand the reality of Auschwitz and anti-Semitism in the world.
Upon her return to Cluj, Balas married a young diplomat named Egon Balas. However, in 1952, Egon fell from favor in Romania’s Communist regime and was arrested. When Egon was finally released from prison, the couple immigrated to the United States. In the U.S., Egon became a famous mathematician and Edith an art historian and specialist. She has taught at Carnegie Mellon for over 30 years.

You’ve probably already heard the new single “Friday” by the young pop singer Rebecca Black. Her song and claim to fame are part of a larger trend in the music industry: the rise of tween singers. Music companies are looking for younger and younger talent — artists that are usually between 12 and 17 years old — to produce new hits. Let’s look at some young pop stars’ recent successes:
33 million: views of the music video "Friday" on YouTube
13: Justin Bieber's age when he first signed to his record label
2: peak position of Demi Lovato's song "This is Me" on Billboard's charts
12: Nick Jonas' age when he recorded his own solo album for Columbia records

Carnegie Mellon’s cherished symbol, the Fence, was damaged by a group of first-years wielding a hacksaw. 
The usually apathetic student body responded loudly, with hundreds of students coming out to the Fence Monday night to repaint and repair it as an act of campus solidarity. While we are proud of this campus turnout, we are cautious about the consequences of this vandalism and the attitude of the student body toward the students responsible.
We have two concerns about the campus response to this incident.
First, we urge students to respect the Division of Student Affairs’ official investigation and its ultimate decision. The university has protocols in place to deal with acts of vandalism and violations of community standards; they ensure that the consequences are fair to the community and to the accused students. Anyone who knows the identities of the students involved should keep their names confidential and not expose them to ridicule or threats. While we condemn these students’ actions, they should still feel safe on our campus.
To facilitate this, we urge students to stop the spread of rumors related to the incident. In the week following the vandalism of the Fence, a few students have transferred blame from the first-years directly responsible to larger groups. Some individuals have blamed the College of Fine Arts or the entire first-year class for the actions of a few first-year CFA students. These accusations are absurd and inappropriate. The actions of the accused students are not representative of their college or their year.
Our other concern relates to the official investigation by the university. It is clear to us that the accused students not only violated community standards but Carnegie Mellon property as well. According to The Word, the Carnegie Mellon student handbook, students responsible for damaging property will be responsible for any costs incurred, and they will face disciplinary action if such damage is intentional. While the specific consequences are entirely up to Student Affairs, the students who damaged the Fence should not get off with merely a slap on the wrist. Not only did they damage school property, they damaged a campus symbol treasured by students and alumni. At the very least, the students responsible should pay to have the Fence repaired.
Official investigations into student actions have an unfortunate habit of disappearing from public view after they begin. There was an incident last year where chickens were released on campus, and the community never heard what disciplinary action was meted out. In such cases, the administration should keep the student body informed as to the progress and result of its investigation. While the identities of students involved should of course be kept confidential, their punishment should not be. It should be an example to students that the administration is serious about preserving our community standards and our campus traditions.

The United States of America has been thought of as a superpower since the end of World War II; our government took it upon itself to be a global leader and to be an example for other countries to follow. According to Henry Luce’s famous essay, The American Century, our form of government allows this country the unique ability of being able to offer international aid while still maintaining its own domestic agenda. 
However, our country is abusing this “right.” The U.S. hedged its way into Iraq on the basis of removing weapons of mass destruction, a supposedly quick operation that turned into an extremely expensive eight-year war. 
More recently, America has been involving itself in the Libyan revolution in solidarity with the United Nations. Although we support the notion of offering support and advocating democracy in foreign countries, at present we cannot afford to spend our money or resources on Libya while our domestic policies continue to suffer.
The current political and military turmoil in Libya began in late February and grew more intense throughout the past month. On March 17, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1973, which sanctioned a no-fly zone and the use of “all means necessary” to protect civilians in Libya. Two days later, American forces mounted a campaign to knock out Libya’s air defense systems by attacking radar and communication centers, according to The New York Times. As of March 27, the United States is continuing its air strikes and bombing of Gadhafi’s tanks and aircrafts.
While we sympathize deeply with the Libyan people, we feel that a major military commitment in another foreign country is not conducive to the trend in U.S. government of trying to cut down on spending and allocating money only to essential areas. Especially since our involvement in Libya has no concrete timeline or exit strategy, we have no way of knowing how much money we will have to invest in this military action. 
Our economy, though slowly improving, is still in a recession. Jobs are still in short supply. The deficit continues to grow past its already- obscene and utterly unmanageable size. Important programs’ budgets have been or are in danger of being cut. 
We as a nation are facing all these problems at home and are already spreading our resources and time thin. 
Although it is important to protect national interests and to provide aid to suffering countries, America cannot accomplish anything without a strong domestic base, and at present, we do not have that. For this reason, we believe the government should, for the time being, re-evaluate its involvement in foreign issues and allocate more time and funds to fixing the American economy.
Editorial Dissent 
Michael Kahn
The Tartan’s editorial board claims that the United States must focus on domestic priorities and that military intervention in Libya is a mistake. It compared last week’s airstrikes to the invasion of Iraq. This is a mischaracterization of America’s involvement in the international coalition enforcing a United Nations Security Council resolution. Unlike the war in Iraq, there are no American troops on the ground. 
This is not a unilateral action. Before international forces stopped them, soldiers and mercenaries loyal to Muammar Gadhafi were bombing unarmed Libyan civilians who had no way to defend themselves. We cannot stand idly by as a government mass-murders the people it has a duty to protect. Far from an unnecessary entanglement in another country’s internal affairs, our support of the UN no-fly zone is a moral imperative.

Though few students knew about it, about 100 members of the Carnegie Mellon community had a chance on Friday to sit down with President Cohon for a question-and-answer session on the state of the university. The lunchtime open forum, hosted by Staff Council, proved to be a worthwhile event.
Too often, we are compelled to use this space to bemoan the lack of direct communication from university, college, and student leaders. In that light, Friday’s open forum was a refreshing change from the status quo. Cohon’s answers were pleasantly informative and frank, covering everything from his yearly salary — $556,000, plus benefits, tax offsets, and a retention bonus he entirely re-gifted to the university — to the possibility of a university-run East End shuttle service.
Many of Cohon’s discussion points, in fact, would have been relevant and interesting to students. While we cannot fault our peers for not attending an event that was not advertised to or aimed at them, we do wish that a similar open forum could be set up to focus on student concerns. According to Official Communications e-mails, the last general-audience “open town meetings” with the president occurred in March and April of 2009, with the March event again hosted by Staff Council. However, half of the undergraduate student body has graduated since then.
Any student’s e-mail archive would show a continued stream of communicative messages, both from Cohon and other administrators, surrounding major campus or world events. However, we would still welcome more frequent chances to have a less structured, two-way dialogue with our university’s top leaders. Back issues of Carnegie Mellon’s “8 1/2 x 11 News” service show that Cohon has hosted a student office hour once or twice a year in the past, but this information is not widely disseminated to students, nor is it mentioned on the Office of the President’s homepage.
Congratulations are due to President Cohon and Staff Council for last week’s enlightening event; at the same time, we call upon the university administration and our own student leaders to apply this successful strategy for the benefit of the rest of the Carnegie Mellon community.

To the students who defaced the Fence, and future would-be defacers of public property: It’s questionable what went through your minds when you took a hacksaw to the Fence. It is also questionable where you managed to get a hacksaw in the first place. We’re a college campus, not Carnegie Carpentry, so it’s a little disconcerting that sharp tools are apparently lying around so accessibly.
That being said: It’s obvious to you, me, and the entire campus community that what was done to the Fence was an atrocity. The outpouring of anger on Facebook and Twitter should prove that much; I can assure you that had you decided to take a hacksaw to, say, Wean Hall, there wouldn’t be a tear shed. (In fact, if you decide to get tool-happy again, take out that small snowman statue near Doherty. No one has any idea what it’s supposed to be.) But you chose this particular piece of campus property, and you got your comeuppance in response. 
There are those who use facts to claim that this anger is misplaced: that the school takes layers off occasionally to do maintenance, that it’s just paint, or that the Fence itself is a facsimile of the original. That’s valid. To some, the outrage over the Fence seems overblown at a time when other events in the news could certainly use more campus attention. But there’s a good reason for it; the simple truth of the matter is that the Fence is nearly all we have. We’re a young school. We don’t have secret societies and famous statues and stunning historic buildings from the Colonial era. We’re content with Booth, Buggy, Carnival, and the Fence — and that’s it, really. We have “Walking to the Sky,” but that’s more like the unwanted bastard child of our campus than anything else. The Fence is our legitimate heir: beautiful, front-and-center, and — until this week — unspoiled.
If you could see under the paint, my dear defacers, you’d have thought twice. The marriage proposals, the solemn messages to classmates who have passed away, the countless events and gatherings are all there — the words of the hundreds of students who came before you, some of whom are now gone from this world. The Fence is a piece of painted metal, but it is also a primary record. It is a way for generations of people to leave their mark; to say, “We were here, and so was our barbecue wing night.”
The importance of these traditions is not their physical presence, but their symbolic value to the campus as a whole. When you cut into the Fence, you were cutting into a lot more than paint. I hope you’ve at least learned something important about the proper use of sharp tools from this whole experience. More importantly, I hope you’ve learned that the Fence is not just private property. It’s a tangible representation of our shared experience as one student body, compressed like the rings of a tree. That shared experience, more than anything, is what makes us Tartans; and that’s why we need to protect it.

As publisher of The Tartan, I have the distinct honor of moderating this year’s student government election debates. The debates, which are being held from 5 to 7 p.m. today and from 8 to 10 p.m. tomorrow, are a great chance for the student body to become familiar with the candidates. That being said, I wanted to take this space to emphasize the importance of voting and knowing the candidates you vote for. 
Most of the time, when one contemplates the role of authority in a university setting, one thinks about faculty, administration, or the university president. Few seem to truly realize the role and position of power that those elected to student government are given. The Carnegie Mellon student government passes university legislation, recognizes student organizations, distributes student activities funding and special allocations, and acts on behalf of student interests in an administrative setting. This is why it is so important for members of the student body to vote and be well informed about the candidates they’re voting for.    
“Voting is part of every student’s civic duty,” said Turi Alcoser, a candidate for student body president. “In order to see positive outcomes in student government, every person, no matter their major or level of involvement, must come together and voice their opinion by reading the platforms, meeting the candidates, and choosing a team that can speak to their concerns. I believe as long as there is choice, students can make all the difference in their leadership through voting. Every vote counts.” 
For this reason I would encourage all members of the student body to attend this year’s election debates. As voters, we seldom get the chance to ask on-the-spot questions and compare candidates side by side. Take advantage of this opportunity and get involved, and become a well-informed voter. Help the student body ensure that those candidates elected will run student government smoothly and to the best of their abilities.

There has been a lot of concern about the vandalism that occurred at the Fence this past week. The popular opinion on campus is that the damage caused to the Fence goes against school values and undermines the history that the monument stands for. Authorities suspect that a first-year took a hacksaw to the Fence, cutting into the structure about one-third of the way to the supports and peeling off many layers of paint. 
While it is true that this was an act of blatant vandalism, another point of view should be considered as well. Just as in the dust of destruction lie the seeds of creation, the damage caused to the Fence illustrates Carnegie Mellon University’s collective history by showing just how deep the paint really is. So many years of paint, pride, education, and spirit have gone into decorating the Fence and using it to advertise for school clubs and events. Being able to see under the layers for just a few minutes was an experience in itself. 
Because Carnegie Mellon’s students are so busy with their respective studies, I sometimes feel like we lack a sense of community. The vandalism caused to the Fence was one of those rare moments at Carnegie Mellon where students came together for more than their own personal interests ­­— whether it be a club they participate in, some part of their studies, or something they do to escape from their student life — and for a few brief moments there was a community of peers. This fleeting sense of community transcended what the students who gathered were studying, the specific colleges they were in, and even where they came from, so that they could express their appreciation for the history and the value they find in the university. 
It is unfortunate that the Fence had to be damaged, but it is better to see the good in these kinds of situations rather than perpetuate the attitudes that most likely caused a student to act out in this way. Perhaps there should be a new school tradition of cutting off a small layer once a year, a sort of renewal ceremony celebrating Carnegie Mellon’s community in the spring. Either that, or the Fence should become an open spot where students can congregate, come to exchanges, and perhaps even make new acquaintances. All in all, the damage to the Fence does not affect anyone’s daily life, and should not be taken too seriously. Treat it as a lesson, and keep learning.

Last year I organized and ran the student body presidential and vice presidential debates. But, truth be told, when it came time to vote, I abstained from voting for a presidential ticket. After reading the candidates’ platforms and listening to them speak, I was bored and uninterested. I found that the candidates did not appear to have a specific vision and were promoting incentives that I either wasn’t interested in or didn’t seem especially important; one set of candidates had even treated the whole thing as a joke.
To clarify, I didn’t abstain because I think that the roles of student body president and vice president aren’t important. Because of my involvement in The Tartan and other student groups, I see their importance and potential impact. The president and vice president are the voice of the student body to the administration. They have a sizable budget, viewable at https://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/budgettracker/, which they can use as they see fit. 
They also have the opportunity to speak with members of the administration who most students never see or do not seek out. Given these tasks, I’d even go as far as to say they have the ability to steer the direction of campus culture. The president and vice president could clearly play an important role on campus that the student body would recognize. But until student government finds a way to reach out and communicate with the student body, a lot of students will find themselves disconnected from it, like I did.
I do see some of the struggles of our current system. From what I’ve heard from friends at other schools, student government often organizes a lot of campus activities. Here, that role is covered by the Activities Board. This leaves room for interpretation as to what exactly student body president and vice president do. And I think if you asked the majority of campus what they do, the answer would be, “I don’t know.”
And that’s not good enough. If the student body president and vice president want to be an important and active part of campus life, they need to focus on letting students know what they can do and what they’d like to do and then keep them updated on progress. If the only time the campus community hears from the student body president and vice president is during a few weeks in March while campaigning, there is a problem with the system.
It’s campaigning time — student debates will be held this week. I’ve started reading the platforms and intend on attending the debates. I hope this year’s candidates seriously address the disconnect between student government and the student body, and I hope whomever is elected acts accordingly.

“Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday...” One can occasionally hear the lyrics to Rebecca Black’s “Friday” echoing around campus, particularly on Friday, and usually accompanied by some sort of joke about the song or groans about how bad it is. Some, however, have gone beyond mere mockery of the song and have started attacking Black herself.
During an interview with ABC News, Black related some of the meanest comments she’s received online from people: “ ‘I hope you cut yourself,’ ‘I hope you get an eating disorder so you’ll look pretty,’ and ‘I hope you go cut and die.’ ” “When I first saw all these nasty comments,” she continued, “I did cry. I felt like this was my fault, and I shouldn’t have done this, and this was all because of me.”
Granted, she did have a hand in this; even though the song was produced and written by Ark Music Factory, she did sign up to perform the song. However, her professional mishaps do not require such harsh and personal attacks. Considering all the attention that has been given to cyberbullying in recent months, one would hope that people would stop and think before tweeting or writing YouTube comments to a 13-year-old girl about how she should kill herself.
Instances like Black’s “Friday” video and even UCLA’s Alexandra Wallace’s racially insensitive video are becoming more frequent and have been receiving more attention than ever before. The more extreme instances, like Tyler Clementi’s suicide at Rutgers University, have received national attention and for a short time brought the psychological and emotional devastation of cyberbullying to the forefront of the American public. According to isafe.org, 42 percent of kids say they have been bullied online. 
What is it about the anonymity of the Internet that makes people feel free to say anything they want, regardless of how cruel their comments are? And what can we do to prevent online bullying? The National Crime Prevention Council provides suggestions on its website for parents to prevent their children from being bullied online, but none to ensure that their children are not the ones doing the bullying. Parents need to start explaining to their children that nothing on the Internet is anonymous — despite what they might think, people from school can, in fact, read their Tumblr or figure out whose YouTube profile left them a nasty comment. 
Nasty tweets to an Internet sensation may seem harmless, but a 13-year-old girl might be crying because of what you said. Think about that before you comment, “This sux, I hope u die” on someone’s YouTube video.

Balance is one of life’s greatest ambitions. That being said, take some time this week to exercise the other sides of your personality.
It’s one thing to wish upon a star for grand, life-altering dreams. It’s another to wish on a star for your professor to cancel class. Then again, those two wishes might be one and the same.
Elevators are your sworn mortal enemy, so always take the stairs. If you happen to break your leg, be afraid; be very afraid.
Something you do this week will be taken out of context and spread through the school like wildfire. So, by Friday when people think that you are a street walker who carries pennies in your shoes, it won’t seem that weird.
A stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet. That, or a serial killer in waiting. If you’re good at statistics, then — and only then — can you go and explore the city alone.
Get to know more people in your major this week, if for no other reason than to have someone aside from your roommate to complain to about your academic life.
This week you will be a contestant on Pittsburgh’s favorite live action game show, “Where the @#&* is the Bus?” You will be the grand prize winner — and by winner, I mean that you will get to your destination only an hour late.
You will find an “undo” option really useful this week when something that you planned doesn’t turn out quite as you hoped. Don’t panic, things will turn out as they should.
Spring is in the air and pollen is up your nose. Be prepared and carry a box of tissues with you at all times.
Turn the Cut into your own personal life-sized board game. Chalk out all the spaces and use everyone walking by as game pieces. What you will use for dice is beyond me.
Just because LOL and OMG are now in the Oxford English Dictionary doesn’t mean you’re free to use them all the time in everything you write. Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.
No, your dorm room is not leaking; you’re just drooling again.
