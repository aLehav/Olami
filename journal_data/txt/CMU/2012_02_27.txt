Junior Wade Brogdon grew up playing baseball.
“Everyone plays baseball in my area as a little kid,” said Brogdon, who is originally from Georgia. “It’s the most interesting and challenging game in the world in my opinion, and that’s what keeps me playing. You can never reach perfection — it helps you deal with failure, and it really prepares you for things off the field.”
Brogdon became interested in club baseball at Carnegie Mellon in the spring of his first year at the university. “I decided to contact coach Claudio to see when a tryout would be. He told me to go to the gym 30 minutes from then, and from that moment forward I was a part of CMU baseball,” Brogdon said.
Brogdon’s skills have been essential to the Tartans’ recent success. “Wade means a lot to our team on and off the field. On the field as our leadoff hitter he will hit .525 plus, as well as a high number of stolen bases which means a lot of runs for us,” said head coach Claudio Reilsono.
Three years later, Brogdon still feels that joining the team was a great choice. He is now the president of the club. “I enjoy the mixture of guys that we have with such a wide variety of backgrounds. The thing that brings us together and makes us such a good team and so fun to be a part of is our undying love for the game of baseball and our desire to win,” Brogdon said.
Brogdon takes pride in his team and himself for finishing the fall season with the best record in Carnegie Mellon’s recent history. Looking forward to next season, Brogdon has his goals set even higher for his team. “[Our goals] are to be perfect and undefeated, make the playoffs, and win the Club World Series,” Brogdon said.
According to Brogdon, between the young talent on the club baseball team and hard work, these goals are realistic. Brogdon also set his personal game to a high standard. “My personal goals are to improve my fielding percentage from last year, and bat over .500,” Brogdon said.
Brogdon is one of the all-around leaders of the club baseball team. “Wade is the prototypical leader. He’s confident, outgoing, and great with the new players. Above all he’s a great hitter and field general at shortstop,” said senior captain and starting pitcher Bennett Poepping. 
Brogdon is a business finance major in the Tepper School of Business. He explained that he would like to be in the financial field next year, as a consultant or an analyst.
Being a student athlete is very important to Brogdon. “I think I can speak for most members of the team when I say that it keeps me sane. Being at CMU, you don’t get a lot of opportunities, if any, to alleviate stress, especially for athletes who depended on athletics in high school. Playing baseball gives me something to look forward to, makes my weekends infinitely more enjoyable, and gives me an opportunity to represent my school outside of the classroom. It’s very rewarding and makes us proud,” Brogdon said.

Senior day for the men’s basketball team signaled the end of three Tartan basketball careers. Guard John Duhring, guard Max Gordon, and forward Joe Kromka all laced up for their last college game against Case Western Reserve University on Saturday. In grand fashion, the Tartans sent their three seniors out on a high note, closing their 2011–12 season with a come-from-behind 72–69 victory over the Spartans.
The Tartans started out with a quick 8–1 start, featuring a one-handed slam by Kromka and threes from sophomore forwards Christian Manoli and Sean Brophy. But any momentum they had early in the game seemed to dissipate as the Spartans unleashed a 21–7 run. The Tartans had trouble finding easy baskets as their offense became stagnant.
“The intensity was missing; we were settling for jump shots on offense, not reversing the ball and not attacking the hoop,” Kromka said.
The Spartans buried the Tartans in a 13-point hole with 3:32 left in the first half, and at the end of the half, Carnegie Mellon trailed 41–31.
The two teams traded baskets for the first 10 minutes of the second half. At the 8:13 mark, the Tartans still looked up at a 12-point gap, trailing 61–49. 
Then Kromka got hot.
A two-handed throw-down, two blocks, a three-pointer, two free throws, and a three all by Kromka brought the Tartans back into the game. With 49 seconds left, a post-up by Duhring — who converted and drew the foul — gave them their first lead of 68–67 since the 11:22 mark in the first half.
“We hit a couple big shots, but it was really just going to the line and getting them fouls,” Duhring said. “Once we got their big guys out of there, there is nobody who can guard [Kromka] in the post, and he stepped up.”
After two free throws by the Spartans, sophomore guard Rashaun Riley drove strong side to weak side, hitting a floater off the backboard with 21 seconds left to give the Tartans a 70–69 lead. Case Western missed three potential game-winning shots before the ball went out of bounds and was awarded to the Tartans with 0.8 seconds left. Kromka was fouled before the ball was inbounded, and he hit the two free throws to seal the Tartans’ victory.
Kromka scored a career-high 22 points and pulled down eight rebounds in his last game. Manoli and Riley each added 13 points. 
“It was awesome,” Brophy said of Kromka’s closing performance. “He has a talent, and he has put it on display a lot this year and he really showed what he can do in this game.”
At the end of the 2011–12 season, the books close on Duhring, Kromka, and Gordon’s careers. 
“John and Joe will be two of my best friends for life, there’s no doubt about that,” Gordon said. “Other guys that have come in the past and guys that are currently on the team I will always be close with.”
Regarding Duhring and Gordon, Brophy said, “A great leader, [Duhring] taught me a lot. Hopefully I can take some of the things he taught me as a leader going into the next two years. Max [Gordon] is one of the hardest workers — when you think nobody is in the gym, he is in here working.”
The Tartans’ season concludes with a record of 9–16, and 4–10 in UAA play. But this last game will be remembered for Kromka’s dominant play and how the Tartans sent their three seniors out with a great win. 
“We wanted to send our seniors out on a good note,” Brophy said. “We needed to bring the same energy we always bring.”

On Saturday afternoon, the women’s basketball team closed out the season with a 57–43 loss at home to the Case Western Reserve University Spartans.
Early on, the game appeared to be evenly matched, as both teams struggled to get in rhythm on the offensive end. Only 30 points were scored between the two teams in the first 10 minutes of the game.
The Spartans shifted momentum in their favor with 4:34 left to play in the first half. They went on a 13–3 run, building up a 10-point halftime lead that they would not relinquish for the remainder of the game.
The Spartans’ defense was able to clog up the paint and prevented the Tartans from finding much success close to the basket. This made for a difficult afternoon for junior forward Emily Peel, the Tartans’ leading scorer and three-time UAA player of the week, who shot just 2–5 from the field.
Despite being forced to settle for shots from long range, the three-point line was kind to the Tartans, as four players combined for eight of 17 from three-point range. However, that was not enough to overpower the Spartans, whose offense controlled the tempo of the game in the second half.
First-year guard Gabrielle West was the only Tartan to score in the double figures with 10 points. Senior forward Jennifer Larsen finished the game with seven points and nine rebounds. The Tartans ended the season with an overall record of 9–16 (3–11 UAA).
For Larsen and fellow senior, guard Alex Hansen, the game not only brought an end to the 2012 season, but it also culminated two memorable collegiate careers. Even though the team couldn’t pick up the victory, playing their last game on their home court meant a great deal to Larsen and Hansen.
“It was really nice to end the season at home in front of a great crowd,” Hansen said. “Many players don’t get a chance to end their careers that way.”
Larsen’s scoring and Hansen’s leadership will both be missed. Larsen averaged 7.5 points per game this season and Hansen averaged 5.7 points per game in the 2009–10 season.
“Being able to play basketball with Jen and Alex over the past three seasons has been great, but it has been even better to have been able to build such great friendships with both of them,” Peel said. “Both on and off the court they are the hardest, most dedicated workers I have seen and they have been awesome leaders for this team.”
That camaraderie is what Hansen wishes did not have to come to an end.
“I think what I’ll miss the most is just being part of a team,” Hansen said. “Our team is really close and it will be tough to get used to not having that extended family to fall back on.”

Peyton Manning, the soon-to-be-former quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, is caught up in a media frenzy. His fight to return to the field is being challenged by Colts owner Jim Irsay, but his departure from the team where he made his legendary career seems imminent. 
The last example of this was the Brett Favre saga starting five years ago, when the Green Bay Packers decided they wanted Aaron Rodgers to be their quarterback and would let the face of their franchise walk away. Favre eventually went to the New York Jets, where he appeared to prove the Packers right with his poor play, and then to the Minnesota Vikings, who, under his great play, came within one game of the Super Bowl.
Manning is now in a similar situation. He is coming off his fourth neck surgery, and any team he signs with is taking a risk that he will be able to perform near his old level — if he can play at all. There are currently four teams rumored to have interest in Manning: the Arizona Cardinals, the Miami Dolphins, the New York Jets, and the Colts. Each of these teams has strengths and weakness that can facilitate or hinder his success this season.
The Cardinals have a good supporting cast on both offense and defense, but since quarterback Kurt Warner’s retirement in the season following their 2009 Super Bowl bid, they have been desperately looking for a quarterback. They traded for former Philadelphia Eagle Kevin Kolb last year, but he has been a dud so far.
If Manning ends up in Arizona, he will be teamed up  with perennial Pro-Bowler Larry Fitzgerald. That combination is a recipe for a high-octane offense. The problem is that the Cardinals may not want to acquire another quarterback after giving so much up for Kolb. Moreover, Manning is a risk.
The Dolphins have been looking for a quarterback since Hall of Famer Dan Marino retired over 10 years ago. Dolphins fans desperately want a new quarterback, and Manning is one possibility for them. 
Their defense wasn’t at its best last season, but it is still one of the better defenses in the league. But their offense, even with all its weapons at running back and wide receiver, has stalled without good quarterback play. The question for the Dolphins is whether to sign Manning, the much older and injured talent, or a younger, up-and-coming quarterback.
For the Jets, it all comes down to their trust in their young quarterback, Mark Sanchez. After making strides in his play two years ago, he regressed last year and did not play at the level necessary for playoff contention. Playing in New York would give Manning a chance to play in the same city as his brother, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.
Additionally, Manning would be playing in the biggest sports market in the country. But with the Jets comes their boisterous coach Rex Ryan. In Indianapolis, Manning was given a high degree of freedom with offensive play, but Ryan is much more controlling of his players.
It is possible the Colts may end up keeping their Hall of Fame quarterback. The Colts have the No. 1 pick in the 2012 NFL draft, and will likely select the University of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. Manning could come back and let Luck sit on the bench for a few years to gain some experience. 
However, the Colts and Manning are not on such good terms: Irsay has fired many of the people Manning worked with, including former coach Jim Caldwell.
Wherever Manning ends up, he can turn that team into an instant contender. But what team is going to pull the trigger on this high-risk, but potentially high-reward quarterback?

The biggest trade the Pittsburgh Pirates have made in years brings A.J. Burnett to the Steel City. The Pirates have sent two minor leaguers — right-handed reliever Diego Moreno and outfielder Exicardo Cayones — to the New York Yankees for right-handed starting pitcher Burnett. The Yankees will take on $20 million of Burnett’s contract, leaving only $13 million to the Pirates.
This trade has Pirates fans and analysts reeling — but there is an important distinction to make when analyzing this trade. Is Burnett going to be the player who single-handedly ends the Pirates’ frustrating streak of 19 losing seasons? No. Is it certain that Burnett will be as effective as he was four years ago? No. Nonetheless, this is a great move for the Pirates.
On KDKA Radio 93.7’s “The Fan” last Friday, Pirates pitching coach Ray Searage said that Burnett would be the Pirates’ ace. If you look at the Pirates’ starting rotation before the trade — Erik Bedard, Jeff Karstens, James MacDonald, Kevin Correia, and Charlie Morton — only Bedard has ace-caliber pitching. The Pirates gave up two minor leaguers, who got past double-A ball, in exchange for a pitcher who can lead the starting rotation.
Burnett is only four years removed from striking out 231 batters, and last year he struck out 173 in the American League. MacDonald led the Pirates in strikeouts last season with just 142. It is not a stretch to say that Burnett can hit that 200 mark again, now that he is back in the National League. Additionally, he will be in PNC Park, a pitcher’s ballpark, whereas Yankee Stadium is a batter’s paradise with its easily cleared right-field fence.
Pirates fans can hope for one of two things. The first possibility is Burnett’s re-emergence as a dominant pitcher, coinciding with some of the young Pirates hitters putting up big numbers. That could lead to a .500-plus record for the Pirates, and a possible title in a weaker National League Central division. The other possibility is that Burnett enjoys his two years in Pittsburgh, and subsequently speaks highly of the team, so that other players might be more open to join the Pirates in the future. 
I understand the concern that Burnett struggled in New York, as he did not put up the numbers he did in prior years. Besides the aforementioned change of league and ballpark, joining the Pirates provides an opportunity for Burnett to put up solid numbers. The expectations in Pittsburgh are miniscule compared to those for the Yankees.
With the Yankees, the assumption is a World Series. In Pittsburgh, the season is a glorious success if the Pirates finish above .500. The decreased pressure will benefit Burnett. Not everyone is born to pitch in New York’s spotlight. Randy Johnson, Kenny Rogers, and Kevin Brown were all big-name, dominant pitchers who struggled in New York.
If Burnett puts up double-digit wins and a sub-4.50 earned run average, he might not consider it a personal success. But even if Burnett were to only put up such mediocre numbers as those, this trade would still be a success for the Pirates. This trade has made the Pirates better, but the degree of improvement is still a mystery.

A group of researchers led by Shirley Ho, a Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of physics, has made significant strides in analyzing a trillion-pixel, three-dimensional map of the universe. Ho and her team hope their results lead to a better understanding of the origins of the universe.
Ho is an active participant in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), a gigantic, multi-university effort for astrophysicists to map out areas of the universe. Based at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, the survey uses a 2.5-meter telescope, equipped with a large-format digital camera, to capture celestial bodies over 6 billion light years away.
According to SDSS’s website, the project’s most recent iteration — SDSS-III — is working to map out the Milky Way galaxy, search for extrasolar planets, and explore the mysteries of dark energy. 
Just last year, the largest three-dimensional color map of the universe was unveiled as part of the Baryon Oscillation Spectrographic Survey, a branch of SDSS-III. It was this unique, trillion-pixel image that Ho and her team assessed. From the 1.5 million galaxies captured within the image, Ho and her team chose over 900,000 to analyze.
“We used multiple computing clusters,” Ho said. “One of them was in the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. It’s basically a national facility that’s for all kinds of research. We also used supercomputing facilities in Yale University.”
Ho said that the research is still very much a work in progress. “We haven’t started using the computing resources here [at Carnegie Mellon] yet, but we intend to,” Ho explained.
What numbers are these massive computing clusters crunching? Ho pointed to the Optimal Quadratic Estimator, a theorem-turned-algorithm that she and her team used on the map to estimate distances of celestial bodies from one another. The collection of distances was then transformed into a power spectrum­ — a set of data that essentially gave astrophysicists information about the distribution of matter throughout the universe.
Because of their work with such a massive data set, Ho and her colleagues are credited with forming the most accurate power spectrum calculation of the universe to date.
“The power spectrum tells you how fast the universe is expanding, and how much dark matter and neutrinos exist in the universe,” Ho said. “The power spectrum contains a wealth of information that could help explain what happened at the beginning of the universe and during the expansion of the universe.”
Power spectrums may also help unravel the secrets of dark energy, a hypothetical form of energy that opposes gravity by continuously pushing matter apart. While dark energy accounts for about 73 percent of the total mass-energy of the universe, scientists know very little about it. However, Ho is expecting this situation to change in the future as research continues.
Analyses of these large celestial maps also make it easier to observe important trends, including ones that may explain the origins of the universe. With these maps, astrophysicists are able to observe the distributions of galaxies and make inferences about the distributions of bodies in the early universe based on those structures. According to Ho, a scientific paper detailing these findings is in the works.
“We’re linking 13.6 billion years of history,” Ho said. “We’re going all the way back to the beginning.”
Ho is currently being assisted in this research by graduate students, though she had a few words to offer interested undergraduates.
“For projects like these, we’re looking actively for students to help,” Ho said. “A significant part of the collaboration consists of young people.... You don’t need to have multiple degrees to do this.”

When scientists revealed the structure of a DNA molecule in 1953, many people took this discovery to mean that the “secret of life” had been found. However, almost 60 years later, diseases still go undiagnosed while patients suffer. Many scientists believe that having a complete understanding of DNA will help doctors diagnose their patients more swiftly and accurately. That belief is no exception at Carnegie Mellon, as researchers are developing software aimed to help doctors finally make sense of patients’ DNA.
Robert Murphy, professor of biology and director of the Lane Center for Computational Biology, is heading a project that aims to create a “doctor in a box” software that combines computer science and biology to assist doctors. Murphy said that this type of research has been ongoing at Carnegie Mellon for many years, but the Personal Genome Sequencer, a machine that can swiftly decipher the code of a DNA molecule, has elevated the need for bringing this research into practical applications.
The entire DNA molecule in a human cell is made up of thousands of smaller segments called genes. These genes are made up of building blocks called nuclueotide bases, and it is the specific sequence of these bases that scientists refer to as the DNA sequence. 
The combination of genes in a people’s DNA determines their particular traits, such as their hair color or what they are allergic to. If scientists can sequence or determine the specific genes in someone’s DNA, it may be possible to determine what diseases the person has.
The huge rise in DNA research over the past 30 years has helped scientists make conclusions about which genes represent which diseases. The problem, however, is that there is a multitude of information in one strand of DNA. As a result, it is practically impossible for a doctor to reach a conclusion by simply knowing a DNA sequence.
In the past, sequencing DNA was a drawn out and expensive process, making it a hassle for doctors and researchers. Jonathan Rothberg, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus and founder of the biotechnology company ION Torrent, recognizes and attempts to solve this problem.
Over the past decade, Rothberg and his company have developed a faster and cheaper method of DNA sequencing that uses small differences in the structure of DNA molecules to determine the genetic code. Their finished product, known as the Personal Genome Sequencer, was released last year at a price of $50,000.
With the ability to swiftly sequence an individual’s DNA in two hours, Murphy and his team are working with Rothberg to develop a software that can take the DNA code determined by the Personal Genome Sequencer and make conclusions about a patient’s DNA.
The project commenced less than five months ago, but Murphy is excited that he and his team “have had a lot of great discussions and the project is quickly taking shape.” He said that the software should be ready for use in the next six to 12 months.
Looking into the future, Murphy remains optimistic. “In five years, this type of software will be able to be applied to clinical practice,” he said.
One of the most important aspects of the software is the idea of endless learning. “You don’t train a system and then release it, but rather the system is continuously learning from whatever data is available,” Murphy said. In other words, the software continues to make new associations between genes and diseases from the analyzed DNA.
According to the National Human Genome Research Institute website, the price of personal DNA sequencing has plunged from $3 billion dollars to $50,000 per person with the Personal Genome Sequencer, but this price is still too high for DNA seqencing to have an impact on medicine. 
The ultimate goal Murphy and Rothberg share is to make sequencing and analyzing an individual’s DNA for less than $1,000, an affordable price for clinicians.

Charge your cell phone with a touch
Thanks to researchers at Wake Forest University, powering your cell phone could be as easy as touching it. This new technology, called Power Felt, uses tiny carbon nanotubes to sense temperature differences, such as the temperature of your hand versus room temperature, to create an electrical charge. The carbon nanotubes are wrapped in plastic fibers to make the material feel like fabric.
The scientists claim that potential uses for the material include lining car seats to increase battery power or wrapping wounds to easily track medical needs. Although similar thermoelectric technology exists, the researchers claim that Power Felt’s affordability may make it possible to wrap a cell phone with the material for as little as $1.

Faster-than-light particles doubted
The faster-than-light particles that were reported in Gran Sasso, Italy, last September may have actually been a result of faulty wiring. Two possible errors are currently being discussed among the scientists involved. A malfunction in the timing equipment, if confirmed, would mean that the particles traveled even faster than they were originally recorded. The second possible error involves an optical fiber connection, which would mean that the particles’ speed was less than the speed of light.
Many believed that the original findings, which showed subatomic particles called neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light, would undermine Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity.

Girls better than boys at arithmetic
A recent study has shown that girls outperform boys in arithmetic exercises. Psychologists from Beijing Normal University performed a series of tests with children aged eight to 11, and found girls to perform better than the boys in arithmetic tasks, such as simple addition and subtraction or quickly estimating an array that contains more dots than another. Boys outperformed girls in mentally rotating three-dimensional images.
Girls were also better able to recognize whether two words rhymed, which led the researchers to believe that the girls’ verbal skills made them better at arithmetic. The researchers argue that tasks like counting and memorizing multiplication tables are verbal tasks, so the skills go hand in hand.

Male-determining gene stabilizing
Men may breathe a sigh of relief as researchers have found that the Y-chromosome may not be withering away like scientists have speculated. Some 320 million years ago, the X- and Y-chromosomes contained nearly 1,000 genes each. Since then, however, the X-chromosome has retained an estimated 790 genes while the Y has withered down to a mere 19, one of which is the male-determining gene.
Scientists at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., examined the Y-chromosome of rhesus monkeys, which  once shared a common ancestor with humans. They found that most of the chromosome’s self-sacrifice occurred more than 25 million years ago, indicating that the analogous chromosome in humans has likely stabilized in size.

Epidemiologists turn to the internet
A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University recently started looking at health-related Google search history to see if they could predict epidemics. They compared Google searches originating in Baltimore to the number of people that showed up at a local emergency room with flu-like symptoms.
The team found a high correlation between flu-related Google searches and the number of flu patients admitted to local hospitals. One weakness of this online surveillance was that public hysteria may skew the results, such as when there was a spike in flu searches after the 2009 bird flu outbreak was announced. However, hospitals still saw 6 percent more people showing up to hospitals during the week of heightened anxiety.

Social networking sites more private
According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, users of social networking sites such as Facebook have been editing their content to protect their privacy more than before. The poll, which surveyed 2,277 users by phone, said that nearly two-thirds of social networking site users have deleted people from their “friends” lists, an increase from 56 percent in 2009. Seven percent more users have been removing their names from photos, and 8 percent more have been deleting comments that others made on their profiles since the 2009 survey. 
The report indicated that the results reflect an increase in online privacy concerns among consumers.

From street harassment to religious gender implications, Sunday’s MOSAIC Gender Conference brought rare but important discussions of social gender constructions to center stage. Every year, the MOSAIC conference tackles issues of gender and explores them in unconventional ways. This year’s conference featured sessions led by faculty, staff, students, and guest speakers — each exposing attendees to provocative and insightful material on the ways in which society constructs gender.
Katherine Bates, a member of the MOSAIC planning committee and a senior cognitive psychology major, was optimistic about the 2012 conference. Speaking before the conference, Bates said, “This year we have more people registered, more people talking about the issues.” According to Bates, the target of the conference is “to get all of us talking about issues that we don’t really think about.”
Organizers and supporters of MOSAIC were enthusiastic about the awareness and discussion that the conference has raised in years past. “I think it does a really great job of bringing those issues to campus,” said Lisa Tetrault, an associate professor of history at Carnegie Mellon who specializes in United States women’s history.
While MOSAIC, and programs like it, exist to expose Carnegie Mellon students to gender studies and issues, a vast number of students are unaware that these opportunities are available to them. The conference aimed to discuss issues that, according to many students, are given little attention at Carnegie Mellon. With a predominantly technically focused student body, the topic of gender issues is often overlooked. “We don’t talk about it as much,” Bates said. “It’s not a real focus here.”
MOSAIC 2012: Gender Movements
This year’s MOSAIC conference offered insightful dialogue between knowledgeable and provocative speakers and engaged students and guests. Sessions ranged from street harassment to the stereotypes in Mad Men to gender roles in dance movement therapy. Each session only had about 15 people in attendance, but the smaller numbers created an intimate setting, which made more personal discussions possible.
The conference began with T.J. Jourian’s opening keynote speech on the transgender experience, “The Fluidity of My Journey with Gender and Privilege.” Jourian, a guest from Vanderbilt University, discussed his own personal trials in search of identity and the difficulties of engaging in discussions of self. “Exclaiming ourselves is like declaring a war,” he said, speaking of the challenging process of defining one’s identity.
On another personal note, fifth-year philosophy major Jessica Dickinson Goodman’s session on street harassment addressed how women’s ownership of their bodies comes under attack on the streets. Drawing on her own experience as well as others’ testimonies — including those of guests in the room — Goodman emphasized that unwanted attention should not be a necessary price to pay for being female. “Just because I’m in a girl body doesn’t mean you can treat me this way,” she said.
Like Jourian and Goodman, Carnegie Mellon Coordinator of Gender Programs Jeannine Heynes connected to her audience by sharing her personal struggle with reconciling her female gender and her religious devotion. Heynes’ session, “Thank God, for Gender,” explored the gender constructions in Judeo-Christian religions and the ways in which those constructions dictate our lives. Heynes pointed to the traditional white-bearded image of God and general resistance to referring to God as “She” as examples of the barriers against female authority that religion imposes on secular society.
The program offered several sessions at the same time, so guests could select topics that most appealed to them. Other sessions ranged from an LGBTQ workshop that explored gender nonconformity, led by Carnegie Mellon Coordinator of LGBTQ programs and ALLIES advisor Meg Evans, to Carnegie Mellon Associate Director of Student Life Lucas Christain’s examination of white masculine gender roles. Christain’s workshop broke down stereotypes for a group that is not typically considered to be marginalized.
Carnegie Mellon associate teaching professor Chante Cox Boyd took a more psychological approach by examining social groups and the negative stereotypes within them. The closing keynote address, led by CEO of Good Fruit Expressive Arts Angela Tatum Fairfax, actually had guests undergo dance movement therapy to demonstrate how body movement can be an expression of gender.
The personal nature of many of these sessions, as well as the eye-opening topics they explored, allowed for very open discussions between speakers and listeners. Many in attendance shared their own experiences and reasons for their interest in gender issues. At times, the listeners had just as much insight to offer as the speakers who ran the sessions.
This inviting atmosphere was exactly what organizers were going for. In the world of gender studies, “anyone is welcome to come,” Tetrault said. In her words, “the spirit of learning, of growing, and of questioning” was embodied in Sunday’s conference.
According to Molly Walter, a member of the MOSAIC planning committee and a senior cognitive science major, the conference plans its sessions with a diverse audience in mind, catering to a variety of interests and backgrounds. “There is a session for everyone,” she said.
But the open invitation to join did not reach all corners of campus. The female and LGBTQ presence at the event was strong, but the turnout was not representative of the entire campus community. A greater diversity of perspectives may have further enriched the insightful but somewhat one-sided dialogue.
According to Walter, drawing interest from all groups on campus remains an important goal for the conference. In particular, Walter wishes that more students saw the topic of gender as more accessible and universal. “I want people to know that MOSAIC isn’t just for girls or LGBT or crazy feminists,” she said. “I don’t think guys should be afraid to come.”
Campus Awareness
The meager attendance of the conference was in part due to students’ lack of awareness of the opportunities to discuss gender issues. The first step is discovering that the program exists. Many students are unaware of the academic opportunities open to them, and others discover them too late.
According to Tetrault, the students who are able to take advantage of the gender studies department are those who start exploring early. “It depends on how lucky you are to discover these things early on in your college career,” she said.
At a technically focused university with many structured majors, finding time to branch out is often difficult and undervalued. But exploring academically, Tetrault said, is vital to the complete college experience: “I think one of the most important things you can do when you’re in college is to take something outside of your interest now and then.”
Awareness is crucial for the success of programs like MOSAIC. Anya Weitzman, a senior Bachelors of Humanities and Arts student in art and anthropology, said that despite her interest in gender studies, this year was the first she had heard of the conference. “I wish I knew about it before,” she said.
After taking Tetrault’s Body Politics course, a class on women’s health, Weitzman’s eyes were opened to the opportunities available to her in gender studies. If she could do it over again, Weitzman said, she would have studied art and gender studies. Weitzman’s advice for the organizers of MOSAIC was to “advertise more.”
Despite the general lack of awareness about the gender studies program at Carnegie Mellon, many opportunities exist for students. Learning about the university’s program and being involved in events like MOSAIC provides students with meaningful opportunities to discuss the important issues surrounding gender.

The Distant Worlds Philharmonic Orchestra presented its Final Fantasy concert this past Saturday, where it was received by a crowd of hundreds at the Benedum Center downtown. “It’s because of you, the fans, that we are here,” said conductor Arnie Roth as he took the stage — and looking around, that was certainly true.
The Final Fantasy series of video games has its own cult-like fan following. The crowd was rife with everything from cosplayers dressed up as main characters from the series to fans in evening wear, ready for the symphony.
This symphony was a little different from others of its kind. The games are known as much for their narrative as their music, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Each Final Fantasy title introduces a new and separate world, featuring a full cast of characters and epic plots. The games are always magical, a little over-the-top, and charming in their treatment of the fantasy genre. On Saturday, a tall projector screen served as a background to the orchestra, and during each song, an accompanying mélange of cut-scenes from the games played on the screen, sometimes perfectly synchronized with the music.
But even more wonderful was the way in which the visuals paid homage to the music, and vice versa. The orchestra got into stride with “Don’t Be Afraid” from Final Fantasy VIII; meanwhile, a large mechanical war machine chased the game’s protagonists through a battle-torn city, down to where a ship waited to take them home.
Next was a medley of themes from I, II, and III, which are considered some of the most famous pieces of Uematsu’s repertoire. Fans got teary-eyed hearing the nostalgic pieces, which have callbacks throughout many pieces in later Final Fantasy games.
From there, vocalist Susan Calloway took the stage for “Eyes on Me.” Calloway is best known for her work on the theme from FFXIV, the most recent Final Fantasy MMORPG. Uematsu has specifically requested her vocal talents in the past, and it was easy to see why. She handled the piece with more finesse than even the original singer, Faye Wong; meanwhile, the audience was treated to an homage of Final Fantasy characters Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly’s budding romance. The couple is a major focus of FFVIII’s conflict, and the choice of this romantic piece was definitely a nod toward that.
From there, the first half of the concert was a blur of beautiful scenes and heartfelt moments; during “Blinded by Light,” the audience witnessed Final Fantasy characters Lightning and Sazh sneaking onto a train into the city, from FFXIII; in “Dear Friends” and “Vamo’ alla Flamenco,” guitarist Shota Nakama played, accompanied by violins. The first of these, “Dear Friends,” was interrupted by a bit of mic feedback, but the rest of the pieces progressed smoothly, and Nakama seemed able to recover well from sound issues.
“Chocobo Medley” had the audience cracking up, as the visuals paid tribute to the lovable yellow birds. Chocobos are a method of transportation in the Final Fantasy series; much like large avian horses, characters can ride and train them. The goofy-looking birds got the spotlight during this piece, and it was definitely the most lighthearted arrangement in the show.
The second half of the show had some of the most moving scenes in Final Fantasy history. “The Man with the Machine Gun” followed the character Laguna Loire in his military forays with his comrades. “Zanarkand” allowed the audience a quiet moment as Yuna, the esteemed summoner from FFX, performed a ceremony to pass on the souls of villagers killed at the hands of a vengeful deity. Men and women wept around her, as coffins floated silently on the water’s surface. “Aerith’s Theme” displayed perhaps the most famous scene of all: As the character Aerith kneels quietly in prayer, she is struck down from behind by the villain Sephiroth as Cloud Strife helplessly watches.
The music really hit its stride during “Maria and Draco,” an operatic piece from FFVI. Three soloists took the stage: Tami Fire as soprano, Juan de Leon as tenor, and Kyle Oliver as bass. These three vocalists brought life to a piece which originally wasn’t vocalized at all — the original game has only lyric text overlaid during the melody. The reinterpretation of the original piece brought wild screams and cheers from the audience. And “Terra’s Theme” served as the penultimate climax of the concert — a classic favorite for fans of the earlier games.
Roth re-emerged from backstage to perform an encore following a standing ovation from the audience: “One Winged Angel.” With original lyrics in Latin, the piece is difficult even for a full chorus to sing in sync, but somehow Roth managed to rally the audience. “I said there’d be work involved,” he told the crowd with a smile, directing participants to sing “SE-PHI-ROTH!” at the correct pitch and timing.
Overall, the show was a respectful and well-executed nod to a series that has shattered many walls in the video game medium. Roth hinted at the possibility of a 25th-anniversary tour in the near future, so it’s possible that there may be a tour returning to the city soon.

The infamous Sweeney Todd is currently slitting throats in Carnegie Mellon’s Philip Chosky Theater. The School of Drama’s adaptation of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street played its first performance last Thursday to a full house.
This masterpiece features music by composer Stephen Sondheim and a libretto by Hugh Wheeler. The story centers on Sweeney Todd (played by senior drama major Denver Milord), a once-prominent barber driven mad after being imprisoned for 15 years on false charges. At the opening of the show, Todd returns home with the hope of being reunited with his family. However, he soon learns that his wife poisoned herself after she was raped by the corrupt Judge Turpin (played by senior drama major Abdiel Vivancos). Todd swears revenge on the judge. The story is a dark one, filled with passion, mystery, and despair. 
Over the years, there have been several versions of the show. It premiered on Broadway in 1979 and has won eight Tony Awards. Since then, there have been several revivals and productions, including the recent Tim Burton film adaptation starring Johnny Depp.
On Thursday, an enthusiastic audience came out to experience the musical thriller. This performance was a preview of the show — the first performance for a full audience.
As the show began, the curtain rose, revealing a captivating set. Three large drapes formed walls around the stage. A narrow staircase and a table with chairs served as the major parts of the set. Several dimly lit chandeliers seemed to float above the stage. As the ensemble started singing “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” Todd made his grand entrance. The jaw-dropping opening number set the tone for the rest of the show. 
The staging of the show is a work of art in itself. The School of Drama brought in a guest director, Joe Calarco, for this production. Working with a guest director allowed cast members to have a production experience similar to what they will face when they enter the industry. “It was very nice to have a true professional setting,” said senior musical theatre major Lucia Roderique, who played Mrs. Lovett. “[Calarco] brought that sense because he won’t stand anything else.”
The work of scenic designer Brandon McNeel, master’s student in the School of Drama, is stunning. The show has a mysterious look that complements the score. The scenic design is accented by senior drama student Michael Berger’s lighting choices. The lighting throughout the show contributes greatly to the tone of this production. 
“Everyone who is the best in their major is involved in this production ... so I think we got the best team to do one of the best musicals ever written,” Roderique said.
Visually, Sweeney Todd is a smashing success. Actors enter the stage from above and below it. Props seamlessly fly in from above the stage. The tall staircase is used in a number of innovative ways, providing the set for different scenes. This production also exhibits a steaming bake oven, a large meat grinder, gushing blood, and countless other visual excitements.
The music, under the direction of Thomas Douglas, an associate professor of drama, is the heart and soul of the story. The orchestra — consisting of School of Music students — is conducted on alternate nights by graduate music students Matthew Samson and Jan Pellant, and presents the music of Sondheim at its best.
In addition to its exceptional creative team, Sweeney Todd features a stellar cast.  
Milord performs well in the title role. He is dark, yet humane. Milord’s resonant voice is a good fit for the role and he shines in numbers like “My Friends” and “Epiphany.” Always at Sweeney’s side is the jolly Mrs. Lovett. Roderique’s performance is stunning throughout the show. Her voice is perfect for the role, and her acting captures the character completely. 
The evil Judge Turpin is a vital character in the musical. Vivancos’ portrayal of this vile character is very satisfying. In his song “Johanna,” Vivancos delivers one of the most intense scenes in the show. This disturbing scene can only be pulled off with superb acting, and Vivancos does not disappoint. 
At the Judge’s side is the Beadle Bamford, played by senior drama major Grey Henson. Henson presents the perfect balance between the malicious antagonist and the comedic relief. The audience was charmed by his witty performance during “Parlor Songs.” 
Sweeney Todd’s ensemble also plays a vital role in this production. They hold each scene together, performing various tasks throughout the show. Group numbers such as “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd” are very impressive thanks to these gifted actors. 
The preview performance of Sweeney Todd received a standing ovation from the packed house. This was the start of what will no doubt be a successful run. “The show is fiercely fabulous,” remarked senior vocal performance major Katie Griffin after the show.
“I thought that the lighting was wonderful,” said junior economics major Erika Tang. “They made really bold choices and I thought it worked really well.” 
Sweeney Todd runs throuh Saturday, March 3. As of last Friday, all performances are sold out.

“An architect, artist, and dedicated environmentalist.”
This is how the gallery guide at the Carnegie Museum of Art describes Maya Lin. Lin is renowned for her pieces all over the world, and is known by many for designing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1981. The artist’s exhibit, titled Maya Lin, opened on Feb. 11 and is housed on the second floor of the museum in the Heinz Architecture Center.
Entering the exhibit from the side of the grand staircase allows patrons to enjoy an immersive experience. Upon opening the glass doors, Lin’s two themes — ground and water — are juxtaposed on each side of the hallway, with a view of Lin’s 2006 piece “Wire Landscape” straight ahead.
“Wire Landscape” was created from lines of three-dimensional, darkly colored wire. Large in size and hung at eye level, the work naturally draws in viewers because of its location and its contrast to the rest of the pieces in the exhibit.
To the right of the entrance is the ground-themed half of the exhibit, which features a small-scale piece of topography and what Lin calls paper landscapes. These smaller pieces include Manhattan phone books and a Rand McNally atlas that have each been cut into in order to expose the inner pages, creating a similar effect to the topographical work that Lin presents throughout the exhibit. Perched on solid white pedestals, but untouchable, these works allow for an up-close examination of Lin’s technique.
Security personnel and signs abound, reminding patrons that the exhibits are off limits. This method, as opposed to the pieces being surrounded by glass or some other covering, makes the exhibit feel more interactive. Patrons have the ability to get close to the pieces and examine them fully, a detail that is much appreciated. Similarly, a lot of variety exists in how pieces are presented. Some cover the floors, others are staged on pedestals, and still others reach almost to the ceiling.
The water-themed half of the exhibit includes more individual pieces and covers three different rooms. The first room includes a piece mimicking water droplets, a large-scale canvas series, and a piece made of recycled glass. The second room includes three pieces focused on rivers. The final water room contains three-dimensional interpretations of bodies of water. Lin’s “Caspian Sea” appears to defy the laws of gravity with its undersized base and a surface that seems to jut out at the viewer.
“The Pin River — Ohio (Allegheny & Monongahela)” is one of the highlights of the exhibit. Made of nails hammered into a canvas, the piece was created specifically for the show and is Lin’s interpretation of the convergence of Pittsburgh’s famous three rivers. The nails cast interesting shadows on the canvas, crossing each other and appearing darker in some places than others due to the varied quantity of nails on the canvas. Beginning at ground level and reaching toward the ceiling, the piece is huge and very impressive to those familiar with how the three rivers come together, despite their different origins.
Definitely not geared toward younger viewers, Maya Lin has a lot to offer whether you are an experienced art critic or just a student looking to explore a bit of culture. The relaxing environment paired with the secluded location of the exhibit allows viewers the chance to explore for as long as they like and lose themselves in the art.
Maya Lin is open until May 13 at the Carnegie Museum of Art, located at 4400 Forbes Ave.

Thanks to a recent partnership between the Andy Warhol Museum and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, fans of cats, dogs, and Andy Warhol can experience Warhol’s 1976 ode to man’s faithful companions: the Dogs and Cats print series.
Together, the museums have dedicated the space just preceding the Benedum Hall of Geology in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History to exhibiting Warhol’s varied print work. Dogs and Cats is the second exhibit to be held in this space. It follows another exhibit that displayed Warhol’s prints of endangered species. The collaborative effort to put together Dogs and Cats was organized by Natural History director Sam Taylor and Warhol director Eric Shiner.
In a press release, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History expressed the significance of exhibiting these portraits: “These works remind us of the complex relationships between humans and domesticated animals.” Although the museum claims that examples of this long and intertwined history can be found throughout the museum — in exhibits like the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt’s cat mummies and the Polar World’s depiction of Inuit reliance on dogs for transportation — the justification is weak.
There simply isn’t a lot in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History that deeply explores the relationship of man and domestic animals. While it may not meet the expressed purpose, Dogs and Cats does provide a colorful passage for museum patrons.
The Dogs and Cats series is among Warhol’s lesser-known works. The eight silk-screened painting set features common house cats and dog breeds such as the Great Dane, West Highland Terrier, and Dachshund. The series began in 1976, when art collector Peter Brant commissioned Warhol to paint his Cocker Spaniel named Ginger. Warhol made two paintings of Ginger, as well as numerous drawings. Brant liked these works and encouraged Warhol to do a whole series of cat and dog drawings.
When viewed, a juxtaposition of eeriness and vibrant personality comes forth from the depicted pets. This eeriness is likely due to Warhol’s decision to use stuffed animals for his first cat and dog photos. He took this approach because of the difficulty he initially faced when staging the pets. The subsequent paintings Warhol completed were done from photographs of cats and dogs and, given his predisposition to work from photographs as an illustrator, it is easy to understand why the later pets are so vibrant and infused with personality.
Dogs and Cats’ vibrant colors and energetic swatches of paint contrast the rigid tension created by the exhibit’s wallpaper. The backdrop of the current exhibit, a three-color wallpaper print on sand-colored paper, is actually a reproduction of the fish wallpaper that was created as a backdrop for Warhol’s exhibition Painting for Children at the Bruno Bischofberger Gallery in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1983. Like much of his art, this backdrop was visually engaging because of its hypnotic repetition.
Despite the interesting background, the mundane subject matter of domestic pets does not create as much excitement as the previous exhibit’s endangered species prints did. As such, the fish backdrop is an essential element of the curated exhibit that prevents the room from feeling too sparse.
Despite Dogs and Cats’ small size as an exhibit and its seemingly lofty mission, the exhibit is a pleasantly whimsical contemporary experience that will add to patrons’ museum visits.

Part of what made Sleigh Bells’ 2010 release Treats so enjoyable was the band’s seemingly effortless juxtaposition of loud, distorted rock guitar and calm, airy vocals. Singer Alexis Krauss’ voice stood out, working with guitarist Derek Miller’s chaos, not competing with it. The noise pop duo appears to have attempted to do this again with Reign of Terror, but the result is an overly loud, unbalanced mess of underdeveloped melodies and empty vocals.
Throughout the album, Sleigh Bells merely amplifies their sound instead of adding depth or pushing their creativity in song writing. Krauss’ breathy vocals simply don’t stand up to the sound of the added guitars. The resulting effect is a noise-heavy album that lacks interesting melodic content. Poorly mastered and over-compressed, any sort of dynamic range in the album is lost. While this is a stylistic trend for the duo, it makes for a difficult and exhausting 36 minutes of listening.
The album opens with a live recording of “True Shred Guitar,” featuring Krauss screaming “New Orleans! What the f**k is up?” over heavy guitars and cheers from the audience. Setting the tone for the rest of the album, Krauss succeeds in building energy, but is left competing with Miller’s guitar work.
The album does have some strong tracks. “Demons,” a heavy, anthemic song with a simple but strong guitar riff and powerful vocals, stands out among the other tracks. The song’s lyrics are lacking in quality, as with most songs on the album, but it can stand on its own. “You Lost Me” is a dreamy pop ballad with catchy vocals; unfortunately, the guitar riff is annoyingly repetitive and takes away from Krauss’ simple, easy singing.
While some critics have praised the album for showing a more sophisticated approach, Reign of Terror is less successful for that exact reason. Although the duo might have planed these songs more carefully or made more conscious decisions about songwriting, the album seems to be trying too hard to find the balance that came so easily in Treats.
It’s hard to deny the catchy melody of “Rill Rill,” the hit song from Treats that you found yourself singing along to the first time you heard it. Reign of Terror, however, seems to lack such a singular, melodic masterpiece. In fact, the album lacks any sort of hook to sing along to, leaving the listener disappointed and lost in a sea of a half dozen guitars. The charm that was all over Treats has all but dissipated into the mess of this new release.
The album ends on a much more enjoyable note than it begins — but that’s not saying much. If anything, Reign of Terror serves as a rude reminder of the limits of compression. The album pales in comparison to the band’s first release and would perhaps be best to listen to after a few drinks.

After moving from Regent Square to North Oakland last September, Legume has been busy making a name for itself in a new neighborhood.
The move was inspired in part by the size constraint of its previous location. The new space seats over 100 — as opposed to just 32 before the move — and the new kitchen is larger than the entire old restaurant.
The restaurant has marble flooring, which complements the art deco light fixtures and decor. The sense of openness highlights the pristine and opulent environment, but the spaciousness tends to take away from the intimacy of the restaurant.
While it now serves a wider range of customers such as students and other residents of Oakland, Legume has been able to maintain its previous fan base, and many of the original regulars still eat at the new location. With a diverse menu that changes daily, it’s easy to understand why people keep going back. The food is expertly prepared and there are plenty of vegetarian options.
Last Friday, the albacore tuna tartare had a clean, fresh taste. A light starter plate listed under the “Nice Things to Share” section of the menu, the tuna was served on a plate with toasted bread and a few garnishes on the side. Overall, the dish was enjoyable, though it seemed to lack any defining flavorful element.
The second course of the evening was an endive salad with pears, blue cheese, beets, and candied walnuts. A medley of textures and flavors, the salad was topped with a slightly tart dressing that was a nice balance to the creamy blue cheese and sweet walnuts.
The main course — a sweet potato ravioli — was the highlight of the meal. The ravioli was topped with mushrooms and salsify, a root vegetable. Instead of adding a heavy cream sauce to the dish, Legume kept it simple and let the flavors of the ingredients speak for themselves. The dish was sweet without being overpowering, and the fresh, light flavor made for an excellent dish.
For dessert: Caramel pots de crème with espresso meringue and maldon salt. The caramel flavor was a bit overwhelming, creating an unnecessary richness. However, this dessert was perfect to share and was a nice note to finish on.
Ranging from eclectic folk to dream pop, the music felt inconsistent with the general vibe of the restaurant. The food and decorations would have been paired better with cool jazz. The service, however, was efficient and the staff was knowledgable and professional, making the overall experience enjoyable.
Adjacent to the main dining area, the bar at Legume hosts regular DJs and bands throughout the week. There is live music every Tuesday at 9 p.m. — including bands like Sleep Experiments, Armadillos, and Boca Chica — and local radio legend DJ Zombo plays every Wednesday at 9 p.m.
While the price range may be a barrier for many students, Legume has an excellent, ever-changing menu and is a wonderful place to take a date or enjoy a nice meal while your parents are in town.
Legume is located at 214 N. Craig St. and is open Monday-Saturday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. The bar is open from 4 p.m. to midnight daily.

Dear Patrick,
I’ve been blowing off my friend all week, but not on purpose. How do I not look like a tool when I finally see them again after avoiding them?
Thanks,
Busy All Day, Friend Requesting Intimate Exchanges, No Dice
Dear BAD FRIEND,
Well, it really depends on if the two of you are guys or girls. If you’re girls, then you should know that she’s probably been complaining about you behind your back to all your mutual friends. When you finally hang out with her, she’s going to be angry, but won’t say why. You’ll just have to put up with it. Wait until the next time she gets drunk, and it will either be a tearful reconciliation of “I luv u soooo much, we’r BFFs 4evs,” or a lot of crying and screaming. Either way, pretend like that night didn’t happen and get back to normal.
If you’re guys, then don’t worry about it. He probably hasn’t noticed. Just buy him a beer and you’ll be good. If you’re mixed gendered friends, then just start dating already. Everyone’s been waiting for it to happen. You guys are totally Ross and Rachel, not Sam and Diane. Then, when you guys inevitably break up, you won’t have to worry about this anymore.
Or just cut off all contact to avoid an awkward conversation,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My girlfriend wants to move in with me next year. We’ve been dating for about a year, and I like her quite a bit. But I just don’t think moving in together is such a good idea. What do you think?
Sincerely,
Seeking Partner Advice Regarding Ensuing Roommate, Other Options Missing
Dear SPARE ROOM,
DON’T DO IT. Sorry­ — that was just a gut reaction. Let’s go through the pros and cons. Pros: You get to see her a lot more, she’ll always be around when you’re home, she’ll always know where you are. Cons: You have to see her a lot more, she’ll always be around when you’re home, she’ll always know where you are. Plus, if/when you break up, either she stays living with you and you have a miserable rest of the year, or one of you moves out and you have to find a new place to live or a new roommate. So basically, DON’T DO IT.
Moving in together is about two steps removed from getting married, and that’s way too much commitment for a couple of idiot college students. You’re better off living separately but still spending a lot of time together. That way you always have some place to go away from her.
DON’T DO IT,
Patrick Hoskins

The future of music is blasting out of the sound system at Zizek Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. DJs and producers are mashing up cumbia (a popular Colombian genre), reggae, hip-hop, and electronic music, creating a space in which musicians can work with new ideas and giving them the chance to show what they’re doing in the current music scene.
Zizek Club — arguably the epicenter of the borderline avant-garde transformation of the Latin American sound of cumbia — has created a whirlwind of energy in just a few years, spawning the acclaimed record label ZZK Records.
Established in 2008 by producer Grant Dull, ZZK Records now manages 11 “new cumbia” groups. ZZK belongs to a new movement of rhythms born out of cities that are being reinterpreted using electronic music to create something new, fresh, and fun. Baile Funk from Brazil and Kuduro from Angola were popularized by M.I.A. and Buraka Som Sistema, respectively, evidencing the rise of this global movement of sonic reinterpretation.
The movement is exemplified by Tremor, an Argentine trio on ZZK Records. Tremor bridges generations, genres, and geography through technology to produce its signature style. The group’s sound is equal parts electronic music and native drum. It owes as much to anthropology as it does to popular music.
Today, ZZK is home to the psychedelic cumbia of Fauna, the experimental beats of Chancha Via Circuito, and the hard-hitting cumbia hypnotics of El Remolon, among other artists. To experience the ZZK sound, the best place to start is its newest release Amazonico Gravitante by Argentinian artist Mati Zundel.

The Undergraduate Student Senate unanimously voted to hold impeachment proceedings against Student Body President Jake Flittner at its meeting Thursday night. The motion for impeachment was made by Senator Jonathan Mark, a junior drama major.
Senate Chair Will Weiner, a junior social and decision sciences and statistics double-major, said the motion was "on the grounds of [Flittner] not fulfilling his constitutional duties."
Mark explained further that Flittner's job as student body president was "unsatisfactory" and that "the feeling wasn't exactly new." Mark also said that Flittner was not present at Thursday's meeting to hear of the request for impeachment. As president, Flittner is required to attend every Senate meeting or send a representative.
Senator Amy Quispe, a junior computer science major, said, "The thing is, Jake wasn't impeached for doing something scandalous or horrible. He was impeached for doing nothing."
According to the Student Body Constitution, a request for impeachment requires a 3/4 supermajority vote at a Student Senate or a Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meeting, or a petition signed by 500 students. The unanimous Senate vote means that, unless Flittner resigns, impeachment hearings will be held at a joint meeting of Senate and GSA. The meeting will take place within three weeks, and a 3/4 supermajority vote from both Student Senate members and Graduate Student Assembly members will result in removal from office.
During the impeachment proceedings, Weiner and GSA President Jason Imbrogno, a doctoral student in economics, can appoint a member of the student body to fulfill the president's duties. In the event that Flittner leaves office through impeachment or resignation, Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma, a junior materials science and biomedical engineering double major, can serve as student body president.
Flittner and Sharma have not yet replied to requests for comment.

“Bring the restaurant out further,” said David Bear, a fellow at Carnegie Mellon’s Studio for Creative Inquiry, gesturing to a virtual dining area on the computer screen. “We’re going to need more room for the kitchen.”
As fourth-year architecture major Dan Rapoport moved virtual objects around the screen, Bear explained, “Not only do you need to serve the bar, the restaurant, and the cafeteria, but if there’s an event upstairs, you’re going to need [space in the kitchen] for catering.”
Bear is leading the High Point Park Investigation, a proposal to build an environmentally friendly and publicly accessible facility on the roof of the U.S. Steel Tower, downtown Pittsburgh’s tallest skyscraper. 
Although a real-life facility is still being reviewed and considered by the city and potential financial backers, teams from the School of Architecture and the Entertainment Technology Center are building a detailed virtual replica of the facility so that online users can get a feel for what it would be like when built.
“The goal is to make this as realistic a virtual experience as possible,” Bear said. “We perceive the virtual destination as in itself something that’s unique and worth visiting.”
High Point Park started in 2010, when students and faculty from Carnegie Mellon participated in a sketch design competition for ways to use the approximately one acre of space at the top of the U.S. Steel Tower.
“We generated a lot of ideas and creativity, but not a lot of it was really actionable,” Bear said. “We needed to figure out what could be done, and that suggested to us the notion of a virtual architectural workshop. When I became familiar with the capabilities of [computer-aided design] and what they were doing down at the Entertainment Technology Center ... we really allowed our collective imaginations to soar.”
Rapoport is a member of the team designing the virtual facility. “The primary focus will be the view,” he said. “We’ve taken this Gigapan photograph from the roof of the building, and when you look out any of the windows, you’ll see what you would see if you were looking out the actual building.”
Rapoport is also making space in the building for other, more interactive features, such as guided tours, virtual restaurants and meals, art shows, and stage performances.
“There’s going be a large triangular stage here,” Rapoport said, pointing out an outdoor theater on the computer screen. “There will be some doors for the actors and actresses to come out of, and this part will act as a curtain. We’ll have dressing rooms for the actors back here.”
“We’re going to have the virtual place for several years before the real place is built, and our intention is to take advantage of that virtual venue and to have events, music, plays, and things that will attract visitors,” Bear said. “And then there’s no reason not to continue it after the real place is built.”
The team expects to release a prototype for feedback and public beta testing in early March. By the end of the semester, the group plans to have a single-user simulation online.
The Entertainment Technology Center team’s producer, Sean McChesney, said that the project is starting out small given tight time constraints. 
“Guests will not see other real visitors, but will be able to see NPCs, non-player characters, that will be animated and speak to give a sense of liveliness to the space,” McChesney said. “The sheer amount of work involved, coupled with our 15-week time frame and a four-man team, will not allow us to create a multi-user experience, but we have documentation on how to create such an experience that we will hopefully get to pass along to the next contingent of students in order to realize this goal.”
As the man responsible for implementing all of the features proposed by Rapoport and Bear, McChesney knows the project’s scope well. “It is ambitious for a mere demonstration, but we are making much more than that,” McChesney said. “This is designed to be a simulation like no other that is currently available. The simulation is built to give the guests a unique experience and opportunity to visit a location to which only a few people in the world have access.”

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) spoke to students on campus this week, disseminating information regarding refugee resettlement and encouraging students to become active in the local and national support systems that constitute the resettlement process.
The IRC is an international organization that responds to humanitarian emergencies as they emerge across the globe. At work in over 40 countries and in 22 U.S. cities, the IRC works to restore stability to those uprooted or struggling as a result of crises.
While the IRC has recently worked on many relief-based efforts — including providing food to East Africans, rebuilding infrastructure after the flooding in Pakistan, and aid for victims of the Japanese tsunami and earthquake — the organization also focuses on providing assistance and organizing resettlement for refugees worldwide. Intervening in all aspects of the process, from immediate relief efforts to the resettlement of displaced populations in the United States, IRC members “lead the way from harm to home,” as their slogan says.
Most people in the audience were members of Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth and Empowerment (FORGE), a student organization that works with government and non-government agencies to place students with local refugee families in need. Student volunteers offer services that may be otherwise overlooked due to insufficient funding and staff availability, including one-on-one tutoring in English, educating about the American culture, and training in basic tasks such as grocery shopping and cooking. FORGE was the host of the presentation.
IRC representatives Erica Marcus and Katherine Rehberg from the IRC’s office in Silver Spring, Md. delivered the talk. Marcus and Rehberg work with refugees attempting to resettle in the United States. 
In their talk, they offered advice relevant to students currently volunteering with local refugee families. In particular, they offered a list of seven “best practices” for working with refugee families, which included things like “know when to make a referral” and “be aware of cultural differences.”
“The IRC’s refugee resettlement agency is heavily related to what FORGE does. We thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more about the situation and how we can help,” said Nikhil Bikhchandani, current president of FORGE and sophomore electrical and computer engineering major.
Emily Feenstra, a junior decision science major in the Science and Humanities Scholars program and current co-vice president of FORGE, found the event useful for providing simple strategies to integrate into her time with her refugee family. “For me, the tips given on how to stimulate conversations with our family were particularly helpful,” Feenstra said.
“It helped me get a better understanding of the the refugee resettlement process,” said sophomore art and global studies double major Jenny Soracco, who tutors a Bhutanese family through FORGE. “I was able to see a better picture of where my family is now, and what process they’ve gone through so far. They also presented pertinent information regarding what can be difficult for these refugee families now that they may not feel comfortable voicing to me.”
Whether sharing communication techniques or best practices, IRC representatives encouraged FORGE members, and other students in attendance, to work in whatever ways possible to provide local solutions to humanitarian issues that exist globally. “What you do is crucial,” Rehberg said. “It may seem like a small thing, but it can make the difference for these individuals who have already been through so much.”
Feenstra asserted that she also benefits from the time she volunteers to work with her refugee family. “I think working with a refugee family has been the best experience possible to get out of my own ethnic-socioeconomic-national bubble,” she said. “To recognize and connect with people who have struggled and endured through so much introduces a whole new perspective to our daily struggles and gives me great humility.”
Students interested in joining efforts to facilitate refugee resettlement efforts can contact FORGE to join its tutoring program or find volunteer opportunities directly with several local Pittsburgh agencies, including the Jewish Family & Children’s Service of Pittsburgh, the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council, and Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh.

Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus created an outreach program, called CS4Qatar for Women, to bring women into the field of computer science. The program is part of CMU-Q’s broader CS4Qatar agenda. Reem Al-Mansoori, former e-inclusion manager and current information and communication technology skills development manager at Qatar’s ICT regulatory body, ictQatar, started the CS4Qatar program. According to CMU-Q’s website, CS4Qatar is “a series of Computer Science workshops for secondary students,” which are “designed for students in Qatar who want to broaden their horizons in the ever-expanding and broad-reaching field of computer science.”
Khaled Harras, a CMU-Q computer science professor heavily involved in the program, said via email that the workshop “marks an inevitable collaboration with ICT Qatar [sic] in helping [Carnegie Mellon] deliver the message of the importance of computing education and awareness in Qatar.”
Ninety high school students out of 200 applicants attended the women’s program. They listened to a discussion panel and took part in a workshop on the 3-D graphics tool Alice and on puzzle and problem solving. “The focus on females this year is simply because they are half the society and in this culture, in this part of the world, it is even more crucial to reach out to this half,” Harras said. “The focus on female students is also an international trend to better balance gender involvement in rigorous engineering and sciences programs.”
Maryam Ali, a senior computer science major, studied at CMU-Q in the spring of 2011. “The classes are much smaller,” she said. “Every professor knows every student in their class.” According to Ali, there is a substantial amount of female participation in computer science on the Qatar campus. “The gender make-up is different, about 50–50,” Ali said.
Natalie Hildebrandt, a junior computer science major who is currently studying at CMU-Q, said via email, “The most noticeable academic experience that CMU Qatar offers is personalized instruction. The class sizes here are small, your professor’s door is always open for help or for conversation.” Hildebrandt said that she supports the idea of engaging all Qatar residents in pursuing the education that they desire. “Educational outreach is very needed here compared to in the States, as there are fewer universities serving a more diverse high school population,” Hildebrandt said.
This April, CMU-Q will hold a CS4Qatar event that will detail opportunities for undergraduate research in the field of computer science, featuring female computer science students and professionals as panelists.
Harras said, “Our goal in CS4Qatar is to help spread this awareness among the younger generations … by reaching out to the students and exposing them to technological and computer science basics. We hope that through this work and effort by Carnegie Mellon, we plant a seed that continues to grow the students’ interest, motivation, and excitement in these crucial areas of knowledge.”

NASA astronaut to speak to students about education
NASA astronaut Catherine “Cady” Coleman will present her professional experiences to Carnegie Mellon’s new student chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Coleman will focus her discussion on the importance of her engineering and science education.
Coleman received a bachelor of science in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983 and a doctorate in polymer science and engineering from the University of Massachusetts in 1991. Coleman was selected to be an astronaut by NASA in March 1992.
In her first space flight, Coleman orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled more than six million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes, and 21 seconds in space. Coleman has logged more than 4,330 hours in space aboard the the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle Columbia.
“This is a wonderful opportunity for our students to see and meet such a distinguished leader in her field,” said Nadine Aubry, head of Carnegie Mellon’s Mechanical Engineering Department and a fellow of the AIAA, in a university press release.
AIAA student leaders Jayon Wang, a junior mechanical engineering major, and Emerson Silva, a sophomore mechanical engineering major, will introduce the astronaut to more than 30 members of the new AIAA student chapter.
“We are very honored to meet such a prestigious aerospace leader who has traversed the world and beyond as a pioneer for engineers and scientists alike,” Wang said in the press release. “Her accomplishments are something we all wish to emulate.”
New research reveals social lives of prehistoric elephants
Two members of the Fine Outreach for Science Fellows, part of the Robotics Institute’s CREATE Lab, have successfully used photomosaic technologies to study tracks left behind by a herd of prehistoric elephants. The resulting images offer previously unavailable insights into the social behavior of these prehistoric beasts.
Faysal Bibi, a paleontologist at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, and co-author Nathan Craig, assistant professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, worked together on developing an analysis of these footsteps. 
The tracks were made over seven million years ago by at least 13 individual elephants that cover an area of more than 12 acres. By using a camera mounted on a kite to take aerial photos, Bibi and Craig were able to digitally stitch together each individual image to form a highly accurate photomosaic of the site.
“Once we saw it aerially, it became a much different and clearer story. Seeing the whole site in one shot meant we could finally understand what was happening,” said another co-author, Brian Kraatz, in a university press release. Krantz works at Western University of Health Sciences.
The authors of the paper are both Fine Fellows. The Fine Fellowship is sponsored by the Fine Foundation. The Fine Fellowship   encourages leading scientists to use perform new and innovative tasks with gigapixel imagery. GigaPan, a service which was developed by Carnegie Mellon and NASA, is one example of gigapixel imagery technologies.

Masahiro Fujita
Monday at 2 p.m.
Gates Hillman Complex 6501
Masahiro Fujita, a professor in the VLSI Design and Education Center at the University of Tokyo in Japan, will deliver a seminar titled “Tsunami Simulation on FPGA and its Analysis Based on Statistical Model Checking.” 
The lecture will discuss the ways in which the simulation of tsunamis can be accelerated using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and graphics processing units (GPU). 
Because of their different memory structures, FPGA and GPU deal with variables in different ways. The lecture will also cover error checking of the bounds of tsunami simulations.
Fujita received his Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo. He is the co-author of seven books and the author of over 100 publications.
Biomedical Engineering Seminar Series: Randy Bartels
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.
Breed Hall (Margaret Morrison 103)
Randy Bartels, a professor of electrical engineering at Colorado State University, will give a talk titled “Advances in Speed and Resolution in Nonlinear and Fluorescent Optical Microscopies.” 
The lecture will discuss the recent developments in Bartels’ lab, which has generated three-dimensional image acquisitions in approximately one millisecond of exposure.  
Bartles says that the results could have an effect on activities such as embryonic heart imaging and three-dimensional imaging of neural circuitry. 
Bartels will also discuss the work his lab has completed in enhancing the resolution of three-dimensional images. 
Algorithmic Economics Seminar: Michael Kearns
Tuesday at noon
Newell-Simon Hall 3305
Michael Kearns, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, will discuss experiments that have been performed with human subjects in microeconomic trading networks.
In the experiments, the players were divided into two groups with mutual interests in trade, and then arranged in networks that created potential asymmetries in negotiating power. Players could only trade with their immediate neighbors. This model has a detailed equilibrium theory in which variation in individual wealth is directly related to global network structure. Kearns will discuss his findings, as well as several other analyses.
Machine Learning Special Seminars: Benjamin Van Durme
Thursday at 1:30 p.m.
Newell-Simon Hall 1305
Benjamin Van Durme, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, will deliver a seminar titled “Simple Randomized Algorithms for Large-scale HLT.” 
Van Durme will give an overview of two methods for dealing with large-scale language data with streaming and randomized algorithms: Bloom filters and locality-sensitive hashing. He will discuss how the methods have been used within the HLT computer language, such as for counting over large key sets in limited memory. Van Durme, a former Carnegie Mellon graduate student, specializes in natural language processing, streaming and randomized algorithms, and psycholinguistics.

Whitney Houston’s death last week elicited sympathy, renditions of “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),” and profit. After Houston died, Sony briefly raised the price of two of her albums on the British iTunes. We should not condone price increases of a product following the creator’s death.
Houston died on Feb. 11. Early last Sunday, the cost of Houston’s CD The Ultimate Collection was raised to the equivalent of almost $5 on iTunes in Britain; The Greatest Hits was raised to the equivalent of more than $3. These changes were reverted by Sunday evening, but Sony executives didn’t comment until Tuesday, when they claimed that the price changes were a mistake.
Journalist Dan McDermott reported through Google Plus that Netflix removed Houston’s DVD so Sony could make more money. Netflix later denied the claims, stating that it had lost the rights to use it at the beginning of 2012, an event unrelated to Houston’s death little over a month later.
The righteous indignation in response to these actions (misplaced as they may have been in Netflix’s case) shows that sometimes we need to be saved from ourselves. In one sense, the laws of supply and demand in a free market would seem to encourage a corresponding price hike on Houston’s albums. What makes us uncomfortable with the idea of raising prices in response to her death is the implication that Houston is worth more dead than alive.
The American public has grown increasingly aware of its role in undoing the health of stars. We simultaneously condemn and support paparazzi who put pressure on celebrities to live a certain way. In Houston’s case — which is especially jarring considering her battle with drugs and alcohol — the tie between the public’s insatiable appetite for commercial products and someone’s death is too much to bear.
We should condemn price hikes, not because they are wrong, but because we are.

Xavier Alvarez, a California native who campaigned for and eventually won a seat on the Three Valleys Municipal Water District’s Board of Directors in 2007, publicized the ideal résumé. 
He boasted an array of military honors, the most notable being the Medal of Honor.
He continued to boast about his accolades as a serving officer and veteran until he was prosecuted on two accounts of falsely stating that he had been awarded the esteemed medal.
After he was charged and fined, he resigned from the board in 2010.
The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court, which concluded that although the lies were “bizarre,” Alvarez’s free speech protections had been violated by the mere prosecution against his lies.
Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case U.S. v. Alvarez.
The core of the issue remains, however, that freedom of speech is protected, and “bizarre” cannot justify incrimination.
Simply put, legal action against Alvarez’s lies, and the lies of others who falsely claim military honors, is unconstitutional.
A Supreme Court decision would not only wrap up the Alvarez debacle, but to also serve as a precedent for “stolen valor” cases to come.
The dilemma at hand is the constitutionality of the Stolen Valor Act of 2005.
This congressional law made it a crime for anybody to “falsely represent himself or herself, verbally or in writing” as having been awarded military honors of any magnitude.
The law was a direct reaction to the tripling of “stolen valor cases” since the 9/11 attacks, and although it is merited and understandable, the legislation is blatantly unconstitutional.
Never before has the Supreme Court questioned the act of lying under these situations. The First Amendment’s free speech clause offers a few exceptions, namely “fraud, defamation, and perjury.” Lies, either spoken or written, have never been described or classified as exceptions to the First Amendment.
If the lies were to cause a “breach of the peace,” they would be deemed constitutionally objectionable.
In the case of Alvarez, his lies did nothing more than reflect poorly on his character and blacklist him from the community. 
Lies, in and of themselves, are protected forms of speech.
If the Supreme Court were to vote in favor of the unconstitutional Act, it will transform the FBI and other civil investigative agencies into — as a New York Times editorial titled “Honor and Free Speech” eloquently put it — the “truth police.”
Thousands of civilians will be incriminated for lying about small and minute points of contention if this comes to pass.
This is not the job of the government and, more importantly, this was not the objective of the framers of our Constitution.
Even Douglas Sterner, a war veteran and staunch proponent of the law, is beginning to backpedal on his previous statements.
In interviews with veteran’s groups across the country, he has consistently expressed his strong support for the Act in order to maintain respect for servicemen and women who have actually received the awards.
Surprisingly, there is no government-constructed database cataloging military achievements. A congressional subcommittee is currently in the process of planning to create a database of “American military award-recipients.”
This database would prevent these lies from occurring and would simultaneously weed out those that commit these disgusting deceptions.
Action needs to be taken against lies of military valor — the respect our servicemen and women deserve depends on it. However, within the confines of the Constitution, this action cannot come in the form of incrimination.

Virginia’s Republican-controlled House of Delegates voted 65–32 last Wednesday for an amended bill that  would only require an external ultrasound before an abortion instead of requiring an obtrusive trans-vaginal ultrasound. 
The previous, more invasive bill required women to have a doctor use a wandlike device (vaginally inserted) that emits ultrasonic waves to create images of the fetus.
This is a successful compromise between the pro-life and pro-choice sides of the highly debated abortion issue. 
When abortion is such a heavily contested topic at the state level, compromise is essential to promote what is truly important in the debate: women’s health.
The House decided to amend the bill shortly after Republican Governor Bob McDonnell issued a statement opposing the more invasive procedure, according to the Associated Press. 
McDonnell changed his stance after the proposal drew outrage from women, pressure from the media, and appeals from Republican moderates concerned about the political impact.
The invasive bill rightfully incited criticism. 
Ultrasounds during early stages of pregnancy involve an uncomfortable vaginal probe to measure gestational age, due to the fetus being undetectable by normal ultrasound methods. 
Democratic Sen. Janet Howell said in the Virginian Pilot that the bill was “mandating rape” because of these aggressive methods.
At a time when state governments are making abortions increasingly difficult to obtain, it is nice to see an abortion bill scaled back to a reasonable requirement in an attempt to reach a compromise between both sides. 
Those who are pro-choice and pro-life will never agree on the fundamentals of abortion, but women’s health and safety should be a priority no matter what.

President Barack Obama recently asked Congress to find a new metal mixture for the production of pennies and nickels. This was a response to information released by the U.S. Mint that it cost the government 2.4 cents to produce a single penny and 11.2 cents per nickel as of February 2012.
While there may be economic benefits to finding a new metal mixture for the nickel, the same cannot be said for the penny. The government should simply discontinue the penny altogether.
The U.S. Mint stated that approximately 5 billion pennies were produced in 2011.
At 2.4 cents per penny, the cost of creating these coins was undoubtedly expensive. Even if a new mixture for the coins were found, the time and administrative cost alone that is necessary to produce the penny would exceed the worth of the coin. With the cost of materials rising, the penny will be even more of a liability next year, even with the possibility of a new mixture.
Even though Time.com writer Josh Sanburn stated in his article “Obama Wants to Make Cheaper Pennies and Nickels” that a new penny mixture could save the government over “$100 million a year,” the net loss for the government would still be large.
Imagine the savings the nation would accumulate if penny production were completely stopped.
The proposal to get rid of the penny is even more enticing when the history of the half cent is considered. Introduced in 1793, the half cent was an integral part of the economy. However, its existence was short-lived — it was taken out of circulation in 1857.
The U.S. economy was not negatively affected by the removal of the half cent, and the absence of the penny would have the same result.
In his USA Today article “Why Keeping the Penny No Longer Makes Sense,” economist Robert Whaples debunks the fears of consumers that purchases would be rounded upward to the nearest nickel if the penny was eliminated.
He asserts that the number of times a purchase would be rounded up would be about equal to the number of times the price of the purchase would be rounded down.
In fact, the removal of the penny from circulation could actually stimulate the economy.
Whaples claimed that the penny’s absence would save the consumer 0.025 of a cent per purchase due to this method of rounding. With millions of purchases made across the nation per day, 0.025 of a cent could add up to a nice boost for the economy.
With countless pennies placed in “Leave-A-Penny, Take-A-Penny” trays at retail stores and abandoned behind couch cushions each year, it is apparent that consumers and sellers do not care for the penny as a viable currency.
If there are so few who care about its existence and its absence would help boost the economy, there is no reason to cling to this dying denomination.

The Republican party stands for limited government. If nothing else, the party should understand that a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you have. While all current candidates champion this cause, or claim to, no one really understands what motivates people to believe in limited government.
People came to this country to be free. Whether it was freedom from religious persecution, freedom to pursue economic endeavors, or freedom to start a new life, most immigrants who built this country came from a place that wasn’t letting them do what they wanted. Our limited government ensured that opportunity. Our small government carried the promise that, with hard work, they could secure a better future for their children.
All the benefits of limited government went to the average, working man. The wealthy benefited too, and so did the poor, but it was the ambitious, hardworking, everyman who really gained from being left alone. Everyone was able to secure a better life because our government was small, leaving our economy free and prosperous. People could earn standing on their hard work, and our economy grew, further ensuring bigger, better, and brighter futures. That’s not to say there weren’t speed bumps on the road, but on the whole, economic freedom benefited everyone.
The current candidates don’t understand how to pitch it that way. Tax cuts for the rich are seen as corrupt and out of touch with the needs of society.
They need to be seen as a reward for those who worked and achieved the dream, to incentivize people to work even harder for the promise of the American dream.
The reason why former President Ronald Reagan was so successful as a candidate was because he knew how to pitch Republican ideas that are good for this country to the working man. He got the economy rolling and created millions of jobs. He believed that the wealthy should pay more in taxes than those who aren’t wealthy. He stressed that working families should be supported by being left alone to use their money at their own discretion.
The working man will win every election, simply because the 99 percent is bigger than the 1 percent. Republican candidates need to drop the unpopular gay marriage and abortion issues and pitch real pro-growth, anti-deficit, and anti-corruption reform for the good of the 99 percent. Republicans need to pitch a limited government that lets people run their lives and their money as they see fit.

The United States Supreme Court decided on Tuesday to try the case Fisher v. University of Texas. This case will likely be a landmark one, as the verdict will decide the fate of the ever-controversial college admission policy known as affirmative action. Abigail Fisher, a white student who was rejected from the University of Texas in 2008, is suing on grounds that her grades were better than those of some of the racial minority students accepted into the university.
Whatever the Supreme Court’s final decision on the case may be, The Tartan supports the Court’s initiative to reassess affirmative action legislation concerning college admission.
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor provided the swing vote to set a precedent for race-based admissions in 2003 with Grutter v. Bollinger, saying, “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.” Therefore, many assumed that the issue was settled, at least for that period of time.
Yet, affirmative action in college admission has continued to be a hot-button issue long after the ruling in 2003. We believe that it is the Supreme Court’s primary job to set precedents, but just as important is its duty to follow up on those precedents, to reassess them and determine if they are still necessary and effective. By taking on Fisher v. University of Texas, the Court can strive to accomplish the latter.
Supporters of affirmative action fear that the Court took on the case because the conservative-leaning majority — which includes Clarence Thomas, who has often spoken out against affirmative action — will choose to simply overturn the 2003 verdict.
Hopefully, the Court will review the effectiveness of race-based admissions over the past nine years from a nonpartisan stance, basing its final decision on how affirmative action has affected colleges and those attending them, and not just on their personal beliefs.
Reevaluating the constitutionality of established laws is necessary to maintain and uphold the principles of the nation.

Port Authority budget cuts are all over the news right now. What they should really focus on is being more consistent with their drivers and the public about when we’re supposed to pay.
I moved to Pittsburgh last summer and had a chance to get acclimated to the system. If you’re heading toward Downtown, pay when you get on the bus. If you’re heading away from Downtown, pay when you get off, unless it’s rush hour (5–7 p.m.), and then you always pay when you get off.
If only it were that easy. Factoring time and direction isn’t very simple, but you would think that at least once you learn it, you can get around Pittsburgh with ease. I have had a number of bus experiences, though, where the driver wanted me to pay at an unexpected time and then got aggravated with me for not knowing.
The more I think about how to pay, the more uncertain I get. I’ve heard that since there is a second zone further from Downtown with more expensive fare, you pay when you get off heading out of town to help them know how much to charge you.
Perhaps that rule only applies to buses that actually go to Zone 2. Since I ride the 71B home, which sometimes stops in Highland Park in Zone 1 and sometimes goes all the way to Waterworks Mall in Zone 2, that might explain why I’m randomly asked to pay when I get on. But sometimes I ride the 71D part-way, which goes toward Hamilton, but I’m still required to pay when I get off.
If it were just my confusion I had to deal with, I wouldn’t have a problem. But the apparent inconsistencies are compounded by the bus drivers’ surly attitudes toward students. At the beginning of the year, their contempt was palpable.
While it doesn’t excuse their behavior, I admit that a lot of us had no idea how to ride the bus. Even now, though, they often throw their hands over the payment machine in exasperation and growl, “Pay when you get off.”
With the student population creating a high turnover of bus riders, you would think that Port Authority would have payment education down pat. However, the Port Authority seems to have taken the opposite course of enduring pesky students until they leave. In response, students endure Port Authority, silently resenting being treated disrespectfully and reinforcing negative relations.
When budget cuts do take effect later this year, one certain consequence is that buses will be even more crowded. 
The Port Authority could help passengers and bus drivers if it was consistent and helpful in applying the rules for payment.

A neighbor and former alum sent me a copy of your coverage of Jeff Zaslow’s untimely death. I succeeded him as a former Editor-in-Chief of The Tartan. I want to let your readers know that Jeff Zaslow was an exceptional human being and a very unique Carnegie Mellon alum. He had great impact on campus before his professional success.
As a young undergraduate student at CMU, writing and journalism were not “in,” but that did not deter Jeff from forging his very unique path.
He was a problem-solving genius, knowing just how to get the best out of the engineers, artists, scientists, and actors who worked for the newspaper.
He had a vision about what he wanted from his education, from life, from friends, from the world around him. My good fortune came when an English professor recommended that I join the newspaper staff to “improve” my writing.
Jeff swooped me up and taught me everything, recognizing that curiosity and energy go a long way. We were finishing up the paper one very late night in the basement of Skibo. He and one of his good pals cornered me, convincing me that I could run the thing! He was that way. Always ready to conquer the world, and those around him had better strap on our seatbelts and go along for the ride! He made all of us who worked closely on the newspaper together feel like a million bucks.
His exuberance about campus life, finding something interesting in the most mundane happenings, really caught on and he made The Tartan into the go-to news source at CMU. The relationships we forged putting that paper together were precious.
When it came time to graduate, many of us landed solid jobs as engineers, bankers, consultants, actors, designers — and some went off to grad school. Not Jeff. He bought an airline ticket that allowed him to travel anywhere in the U.S. for the next year in search of his dream job with a newspaper. So un-CMU!
We were dumbstruck at his sense of adventure, and in awe that he was so willing and so genuinely happy to take on that kind of risk.
We knew he was something special then, but couldn’t imagine the way he made us feel would be multiplied exponentially in his lifetime.
My tribute to him is that I find myself telling my children his story and the lessons he taught — to follow your passions, to love life and people, and you will light up the world.
