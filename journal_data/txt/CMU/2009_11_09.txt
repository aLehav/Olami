Everything seemed to go against the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team this past week as they followed last week’s 1–0 loss to University Athletic Association (UAA) rival University of Rochester with a 2–2 tie against a sub-par Emory University team; they then heard that conference co-leaders Rochester had also tied on the last day of conference play. Saturday’s results put Carnegie Mellon, Rochester, and the University of Chicago in a three-way tie for the UAA title. However, as a result of the UAA tiebreaker, Carnegie Mellon was ultimately awarded an automatic bid to the NCAA championship. The Tartans, who finished the regular season at 14–2–1, now have to wait for Monday’s draw to see where and who they will play in the NCAA tournament.
The Tartans’ game against Emory was their third straight road game in less than 10 days, but the team knew that it was important for them to get a good result in their last regular season match of the year. 
The Tartans came out very strong and made sure to test Emory goalkeeper Trenton Spindler early on. The duo of seniors Pat Lutz and Ricky Griffin gave the backline a hard time as always, but it was a fellow senior that was able to break the deadlock. Red-hot Ryan Browne was finally able to beat the Emory goalie in the 22nd minute off a Pat Lutz assist. Despite recording three shots and putting on continuous pressure thereafter, Carnegie Mellon was unable to extend their lead before halftime.
In the second half, Griffin notched another goal for the Tartans as he recorded his career-best 19th in-season goal. The Tartans thought they had the game in their hands with a comfortable two-goal lead, but a late rally from Emory caught Carnegie Mellon by surprise. With 10 minutes left in regulation, Emory netted a goal in the 81st minute and then again two minutes later. The Tartans, unsatisfied with a draw, continued to push forward. Browne nearly got the win for his team late in the game, but the Emory goalie came up with another great save.
The game ended 2–2. However, there is a three-way tie for first place in the UAA among Carnegie Mellon, Rochester, and Chicago, all at 5–1–1.
Once the NCAA draw comes out later today, the Tartans will know their first opponent in the tournament.

The Tartan football seniors took the home field on a beautiful fall day for the last time this weekend. Saturday marked the last home game of the season as well as the last game for senior football players and cheerleaders, who were recognized for their commitment before kickoff at Gesling Stadium at 2 p.m. against Case Western Reserve University.
Carnegie Mellon hosted number 9 Case Western in the 24th Annual Academic Bowl on Saturday. The Tartans’ loss of 17–34 makes their overall record 5–4 and their University Athletic Association record 1–1.
The Tartans, set to receive after the coin toss, opened the game with a strong offensive drive toward the end zone. Their opening drive finished with a 23-yard field goal by junior place kicker Elliot Carnevale to make the score 3–0 Tartans. Unfortunately, the Spartans soon took the lead 3–7 when Case Western quarterback Dan Whalen threw a 29-yard pass to junior Zach Homyk for a touchdown. The Spartan offense fumbled the two ensuing drives, but Whalen put his team up 3–14 just before the end of the half.
Case Western powered it up after half-time, bringing the score up yet again with another touchdown on their opening drive. However, the Tartans battled on and minimized their lead to 10–21 on their next drive when junior running back Justin Pratt took the ball in for a touchdown. However, once again, the Spartans were quick to take action as Whalen scored for the fourth time. Case Western pulled further into the lead at 10–27 as the third quarter ended.
The Tartans were not about to give up. First-year Jared Delello scored his first collegiate touchdown on a 20-yard run, tightening the score to 27-17. With only a 1:18 left in the fourth quarter, the Spartans scored yet again to give them a 34-17 victory.
Senior offensive guard Ryan Chehanske said, “I felt that we played well. They were just a very good team. On offense we were able to move the ball, but there were little things that held us back from scoring on certain occasions. The defense had to defend against a great Case quarterback.”
Although it was a disappointing loss for the team’s last home game, it was a great game for parents, fans, and especially the seniors. “It was a very emotional game playing for the last time at home,” Chehanske said. “All of the seniors wanted it to be their best. [Head coach Rich] Lackner has done an amazing job with us over these past four years and we owe so much to him for being there for us on and off the field.”
The football team will finish off their regular season next Saturday in Chicago against the University of Chicago at noon.

As I watched the New York Yankees celebrate their 27th World Championship at around 11:30 p.m. last Wednesday, I couldn’t help but think, “It’s about time.” It had been nine years since the Yankees last won the World Series, and those nine years were probably the most frustrating nine years of my life. For the last decade, the “Bronx Bombers” have been throwing money at big-name players in the hope of fielding an unstoppable team in order to try and keep their storied franchise on top of the baseball world. However, something went wrong every year, and they always fell short of that elusive World Series championship. This season, they finally got it right.
The Yankees spent a whopping $423 million this off-season locking up three of the top players in baseball: first baseman Mark Teixeira and starting pitchers C.C. Sabathia and A.J. Burnett. After these signings, I doubted the capability of these three players to mesh with the already star-studded team that they were about to join. Then the season began, and the Yankees got off to a typical slow start. Fans became restless, especially when they lost their first eight games against their most hated rival, the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, the team began to play to their potential, and the Bronx Bombers won the division and entered the playoffs feeling very confident about their chances at a championship.
Entering the playoffs, the Yankees faced some big questions. Third baseman Alex Rodriguez and Sabathia, notorious playoff flops, would have to prove that they could perform under the pressure. These doubts were quickly squashed as A-Rod and Sabathia led the Yankees to win the World Series with phenomenal performances.
One of the main reasons for the Yankees’ success this year was their deep lineup, both hitting-wise and pitching-wise. There were no easy outs in this Yankee batting order to go along with the top-of-the-line starting pitching, featuring a former Cy Young Award winner (Sabathia) along with three more above-average starters. And of course, if the game ever were close, closer Mariano Rivera, considered by many to be the best in history, would be able to handle any situation and close out a win.
But what made the Yankees better than every other team this year was not only the skill level of the players, but also team chemistry. There was a great mix of both veterans and younger players, and as I watched the games I began to realize that all 25 members of the team were very close. 
From special handshakes to blasting Michael Jackson before every game, a wide variety of team-first personalities helped create a very loose clubhouse, almost taking all the pressure off a normally uptight team. The players trusted that if they played a bad game, someone else would pick up the slack and they wouldn’t have to worry too much.
Ultimately, the Yankees proved that they were the best team in baseball this year. If they spend their money well by acquiring players with the personalities to match the statistics, the Yankees will be contending for championships for years to come. The team will come back again in March to start spring training with possibly more talent, and once again baseball will decide if the Yankees are the favorite to win it all.

The Carnegie Mellon University men’s basketball team has been picked seventh in the 2009–2010 University Athletic Association (UAA) this season. Carnegie Mellon was tabbed seventh of eight teams, falling behind Case Western Reserve but ahead of Emory University.
The Tartans are coming off a successful 20–7 season in which they advanced to the second round of the NCAA Division III playoffs for the first time in the history of the program. The record for the men’s team at UAAs for the 2008–09 season was 9–5.
The Tartans will return two of their starting players from last year, seniors Shane Rife and captain Jack Anderson. 
Along with these players, Jon Wolleben, a co-captain for the Tartans, will return for a fifth year of eligibility. Anderson, a guard for the Tartans, was the second leading scorer for the team last year, averaging 14.1 points per game. He was able to score in 22 out of 27 games last year, and ranked eighth in the UAAs for his scoring record. Anderson also enters this year in 11th place for the school’s all-time three-point scorer, and only needs 219 points to reach 1000 points; if he achieves this feat, he will become the 18th in Tartans history to receive this honor.
When discussing the competition heading into this year, Anderson said, “We consider every UAA conference game to be crucial; with the depth and talent of the teams in our league, every game is a battle. This year we are really trying to focus on one game at a time. With a less experienced group, it will be important for us to not overlook any opponents.”
Rife, a forward for the Tartans, was the third leading scorer for the team last year, averaging 9.2 points per game. The junior was second on the team for blocks, raking in 21 blocks last season. Wolleben is also a valuable player to the team, playing in 81 games during his career on the team and averaging 5 points per game.
Another returning player is junior Matt Pettit. Pettit appeared in 51 games through his first two years as a Tartan. Pettit shared his sentiments about next season. “I’m excited to start playing games and see what our team is made of. We have a lot of young talent this year and they’re all looking to contribute to the team,” he said. “After losing five seniors and three starters, we have two new captains (Anderson and Wolleben) that have stepped up to lead the team and fill the void.”
Sophomore John Duhring is another returning Tartan who will strengthen the lineup. Duhring, a swing man for the team, saw action in every game last season, averaging 2.8 points per game and shooting 38 percent from behind the arc.
“The team goals are to be equally as hard working and successful as the team was last year, because even though we lost multiple seniors and starters, we still plan on being a competitor in the UAA and NCAA come March,” Duhing said about the upcoming season’s goals. “A team strength that we have is versatility and diversity of players because we are relatively young and somewhat inexperienced, but that means we have 16 guys who can all get playing time and mix things up in games.”
Another returning asset is senior Dan Lavallee, who had to sit out last season with an injury, but is ready to head into this season strong. Senior Dan Bruce and sophomores Max Gordon, Bryan Good, and Joe Kromka will add good experience for a great season this year.
For power inside the court, senior Dan Sawl and sophomore Jackson Read are talented players that the coaches will look to this season. Sawl, playing 29 games in his two-year career, has averaged 3.2 points.
There are four first-year additions to the Tartan team this year: Stephane Batton, Andre Moore, Christian Shepley, and Chad Stein.
Coach Tony Wingen, who is entering his 20th year of coaching with Tartans, is confident in his team this season. “We’re definitely a different-looking team than last year. Less experienced and a little smaller, but I believe we are [a] better perimeter shooting team. The guys are really working in practice, and we’re learning about each other every day. The intensity has picked up, so we must be close to playing real games.”
Overall, the morale of the team is high heading into the season, but the Tartans will take things step by step. 
They start their year with high hopes for their first game at Skibo Gymnasium on Nov. 15 at noon.

“The young and the restless” seems to be the theme for the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team’s upcoming season.
Only three starters from last year’s squad returned, including last year’s University Athletic Association (UAA) Rookie of the Year Jacki Cortese. Coming off the bench, Cortese ended her season with 11.9 points per game, shooting at a 54.3 percentage. Also adding to this season’s scoring is fifth-year senior and captain Rachelle Roll, who averaged 7.6 points and 7.0 rebounds per game and finished with a team-leading total of 48 assists last year.
“Losing [the seniors] last year definitely took away a lot of the team’s experience,” said Roll. “However, the [first-years] bring a new outlook and the returning sophomores are great leaders.”
Sophomore guards Alex Hansen and Alison Aunkst are the other returning starters who will provide leadership on the court.
Also, sophomore forward Jennifer Larsen, guard Nicole Vaccarella, and junior guard Jessica Burvanovsky add to what little UAA experience the Tartans have, all whom saw substantial time on the court last year.
The new batch of first-years add much needed height to the roster: forwards Elissa Goldner and Emily Peel and guards Brit Phillips, Sarah Wiernicki, and Tori Baggio. Rounding out the first-year class is Rebecca Yazner. The newcomers are looking to prove themselves and to help turn around the UAA coach’s poll results — released Oct. 30 — that placed the Cardinal and Gray at the bottom of the league.
“I don’t believe in predicting the season. I don’t believe in preseason polls,” coach Gerri Seidl said. “If I could predict the future, I’d play the lottery. I believe that there is a good positive climate with in the [Carnegie Mellon’s] women’s basketball program. We are solid from managers to players to coaches to support staff and to administration. It doesn’t get much better than that. I believe in this team, and more importantly, they believe in themselves.”
Hansen expresses the team’s restlessness to change people’s minds: “We want to win. We definitely are looking to get some revenge and respect in conference.”
The Tartans’ season starts with a home opener against Bethany College on Monday, Nov. 16 at 7 p.m. The squad will continue their quest to prove the critics wrong with their first UAA game on Jan. 8 at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga.

The Carnegie Mellon swim team will be participating in the 2009 Ted Mullin “Leave It in the Pool” Hour of Power, a national swimming event to raise awareness and money for sarcoma research in honor of former Carleton College swimmer Ted Mullin, who died from synovial sarcoma in 2006. This will be the second year in which the Tartans have participated in the event.
The Hour of Power will take place this Tuesday from 5–6 p.m. During that hour, the Tartans, along with over a hundred other colleges, high schools, clubs, and teams of students from abroad, will participate in a nationwide, continuous, all-out relay swim. 
The team will be split evenly into eight lanes, the goal being to swim exactly at the same time at maximum intensity, building on team spirit, cooperation, and determination. Proceeds raised during the event will go toward the Ted Mullin Fund for Pediatric Sarcoma Research at the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital, where Mullin received care. The University of Chicago, whose scientists are considered to be at the forefront of sarcoma research, is one of two University Athletic Association (UAA) institutions participating along with Carnegie Mellon; Emory is the other.
Sarcoma primarily affects people in the 15–29 age group, and is the fifth most common cancer affecting said age group today. According to the Ted Mullin Sarcoma Research Fund Report, the fundraiser helps Chicago fund Stephen Skapek’s “study of tumor suppressor genes and how their abnormality contributes to sarcoma biology.” Skapek is currently focusing on rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of sarcoma that is particularly common in children and young adults.
“I think it’s important for our team to get involved in service projects,” junior swimmer Molly Evans said. “In addition to supporting the community, these types of events really bring our team together.”
In order to raise money for the event, the team set up a table outside the University Center last Thursday through Saturday, where they sold homemade scarves for $6 and gave away free Snoopy dolls with donations of any amount. 
They will continue to do so Monday and Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. before possibly tabling during the event, which will take place at the UC pool. Please stop by the table and donate before coming to watch and support both the team and sarcoma research.
Editor's Note: Joans Altman-Kurosaki is a member of the swim team.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team finished their season on Saturday, when they competed in Atlanta, Ga. against Emory University. Unfortunately, Emory competed at the top of their game, and the Tartans lost with a final score of 0–5.
As soon as the game started, Emory went on the offensive, attempting to score three goals, all of which were saved by junior keeper Anya Rosen. Within 24 minutes in the first period, Emory broke through the Tartans’ defenses and scored to pull ahead 0–1. The Eagles kicked in their second goal just 12 minutes later. 
In the second period, senior midfielder Casey Garth made an attempt at the goal, but Emory’s keeper kept the Tartans goalless. Just two minutes later, sophomore Elsa Wu kicked a second shot which was also saved. Emory scored another goal 30 minutes into the second period. Ten minutes later, Emory scored again, to bring the score to 0–4. With a minute and a half left, Wu attempted to score a final time, but to no avail. With only 30 seconds remaining, Emory scored the final goal of the game to win 0–5.
Despite the results of their final game, the Tartans finished their season with a respectable record of 6–8–2. Their record for the University Athletic Association is 1–4–2 overall.

With his senior swimming season underway after a victorious showing against Clarion University on Halloween, Jeff Dahlen is hopeful that the talent and determination he already sees in himself and his teammates will take them far. Dahlen was the University Athletic Association (UAA) Champion last season in the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke and is currently on the A team for the swimmers for the 200-yard medley relay. While Dahlen has aspirations to someday become an Olympic swimmer for Mexico to represent his roots, he would be satisfied competing in triathlons to stay connected to the sport he loves.
Dahlen is a native of San Juan Capistrano, Calif., and admits that coming to Carnegie Mellon was a bit of a lifestyle change. Although the area lacks the beaches and perpetual sunshine of Southern California, Dahlen enjoys the feel of a college town and opportunities for activities that Pittsburgh offers. Another aspect missing in the area is a source of good Mexican food, although Dahlen admits nothing can compare to his grandmother’s traditional cuisine. Dahlen looks to return to his home state for graduate school to obtain a Ph.D. in neuroscience with the University of California in San Diego as his top choice. Though he is majoring in biological sciences, Dahlen cites his favorite course at Carnegie Mellon as poetry.
Growing up in a predominantly baseball-oriented generation in his family, Dahlen did not pursue swimming until later in his upbringing. Describing his inspiration to start swimming, Dahlen said, “When I was in middle school, I found a huge box of ribbons, medals, and trophies in our attic from when my father swam in high school and college, and I naively said to myself, ‘I can do that.’ ”

This week’s edition of Fiber Content will expose you to other cardiovascular options besides working out on the treadmill or elliptical. So grab your water bottle and Clorox wipes, dust off the spinning bike, and get to work.
For the past 10 to 15 years, the indoor cycling industry has grown, with sales of equipment reaching new heights. Following the trend of the professional circuit, modern Americans have also taken up this familiar training mode. Spinning classes can be found at most health and fitness facilities, even here at Carnegie Mellon. If anyone is looking for a challenge, I recommend signing up for one; most spinning classes that I have witnessed look more like an advanced stage of the Tour De France than a stroll in the park. Those not quite ready to take on Lance Armstrong can follow these simple steps to create their own program.
Step one is determining the total training time. You may choose to set up three or four different training protocols for different days depending on what your work and workout schedule permits. For example, on Mondays plan on doing 20–30 minutes of strength training to limit your total fitness time to an hour, so you can schedule 30–40 minutes of ride time. Wednesday may be your off day from lifting so you can spend more time on the bike. Make sure you have a specific plan for each day of training. 
For most beginners, I would recommend anywhere from 30–45 minutes of riding. Individuals with a more extensive training base may be better suited to ride for longer — 45–60 or more minutes — but it is all up to your schedule.
Step two is about setting up the specific stages of your race. Once again, this becomes an arbitrary number based on your experience, your interest level, the time allotment you have set for the specific training day, and your personal goals. For beginners, I would recommend anywhere from five to 10 stages. Keep in mind that the more stages you set, the more changes you will have to make and the more intense the training will become. Advanced exercise enthusiasts can have anywhere from five to 20 stages or even more; remember that more stages means more complexity. Once you have the number of stages, move on to step three.
Step three entails designing the specific time intervals and intensities which each stage will be performed. First, the time intervals and intensities should always be inversely proportionate. What that means is that the higher the intensity, the less time you should spend in that stage, whether you measure intensity in repetitions per minute (RPM), perceived rate of exertion (how hard you feel like you are working), percentage of maximum heart rate maximum or percentage of aerobic capacity, or the maximum amount of oxygen the body can use. 
So if you are working at 90 percent of maximum intensity, your time in that stage should be less than your time spent in a stage at 64 percent intensity. Intensity and duration are always inversely related. For recommendations for intensities and time for both beginners and advanced individuals, please see the included table. Once you have your numbers in mind, proceed to step four.
Step four is the final piece of the puzzle. The format of the program will determine your adherence and your level of excitement. For general purposes, it is better to put your lower intensity, longer time period stages at the beginning and end of your program. This will allow your body to properly warm up prior to the high intensity training and cool down afterward. Another general recommendation is to alternate low intensity and high intensity stages to allow for recovery between high intensity bouts. For example, a beginner may want to start with 5 minutes of low intensity riding then possibly 30 seconds of high intensity followed up again by 2 minutes of low intensity. More experienced people with a greater training base may choose to follow up a moderately high intensity training stage (e.g. 85 percent) for 60 seconds with an even more intense stage (95 percent) for 5 seconds, followed by a low intensity, long duration stage to rest.
Trial and error with program design will become both your friend and enemy. You will find out in a hurry if your perception of your personal fitness level may not actually match your fitness level. With all new endeavors in life, we learn best by falling down, picking ourselves up, and learning from our experiences. Always continue to challenge yourself, striving for improvements in your health and fitness levels. However, be careful that the goals you set are safe, realistic, and attainable; even the best laid plans often go awry.

Jibbigo is an iPhone application created by Mobile Technologies — founded by Alex Waibel, a professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Language Technologies Institute — that allows for effective, simple translation between Spanish and English. 
It is a powerful piece of software that its creators hope will provide both monetary and humanitarian benefits.
The first thing you notice about it is the name, which was chosen for the pragmatic reason that the URL for it was available and that there were no other applications with a similar name. 
It is derived from the words “gibberish” and “go.” Gibberish is what the application hopes to fight and “go” is the suffix attached to the names of different languages in Japanese. Jibbigo is the culmination of nearly 20 years of work, which started out as a mere infant of a program that could only work with 500 words and specific sentences and which had to run on powerful computers. Waibel feels that until recently, there was “no concern about making [the software] for people and no concern for the resources [it used].” 
The developers of Jibbigo have gone to great lengths to remedy this. While it is still a bit slow on the older generation iPhone, it is surprisingly quick on the newer versions and is extremely easy to use and understand. Jibbigo is used to convert speech in English to speech in Spanish or vice versa and is thus called a bi-directional translator. According to Waibel, this requires “six modules, two speech recognizers, two translators, and two voice synthesizers.” 
All the user needs to do is tap and hold the record button next to the flag representing the language they want to speak in, and then speak a few sentences. Jibbigo then does all the work. It provides text versions of both what was said and the translation and also speaks the translation aloud. If the user misspeaks, all they have to do is shake the phone to undo it.
The software has a database of 40,000 words that it can use to interpret what is said, and a dictionary of many more words that it can speak and translate word for word, but not understand. One can also type in what one wants translated, and it will translate it and then speak it. A future (free) upgrade of the software will also allow the user to add words to the database so that Jibbigo will be able to recognize non-standard words automatically. Finally, one can give a particular translation a “thumbs down” and send the developers an e-mail about the problem, which will allow them to improve the software.
It doesn’t take much thought to realize that this application would be very useful for tourists in foreign countries when they don’t know the language. Instead of fumbling with a phrasebook or being forced to hire a translator, all they would need to do is whip out an iPhone.
But tourists are not Waibel’s only, or indeed primary, target audience. He says that he wants “to pursue a humanitarian goal” as well and that the goal of his company (Mobile Technologies) is “to earn some money by selling this software ... and build these devices for the developing world.” His concern is well-placed, as in many cases, the greatest problem faced by aid workers in foreign countries is being unable to speak the local language. Up until Jibbigo, they used rugged laptops (costing thousands of dollars each) to make use of such speech-to-speech translation software. 
Such translation is now available for a fraction of the cost. Indeed, doctors from the East Liberty Healthcare Center belonging to the Shoulder to Shoulder initiative in Pittsburgh are currently using Jibbigo in Honduras. Jibbigo also has potential applications in the military, where, according to Waibel, departments are spending millions to develop effective translation software for Arabic. Waibel’s future plans for Jibbigo primarily involve adding more languages to the application so that it can be used in a wide variety of situations. 
Because of the difficulty of implementing the translation software, he has to choose languages carefully, pointing out that he needs not just “languages where we can make money, but also languages where there is a humanitarian need.”
Jibbigo is a quiet, unpretentious application. Simple at first sight, it hides extreme complexity and extensive research. 
Waibel complains that “science fiction is always a research project, never for real,” but he also notes with a smile, “this is like science fiction.”

Every now and then, researchers in the scientific community reveal a finding that upturns popular belief: The sun is the center of the solar system; nothing travels faster than light; Pluto isn’t actually a planet. 
And just recently, another discovery was added to the list. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Michigan have found that giving up hope may make a person happier. The basis behind this surprising study was the satisfaction of life as evaluated by patients who underwent colostomies — a process by which the colon is attached to the abdomen, such that feces leave the body through the abdomen. Some patients were told their colostomies were irreversible, while others were told they might be cured in the future.
George Loewenstein, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s social and decision sciences department and also a principal researcher of the study, surveyed the “overall quality of life” of these patients using two different scales, which enabled a numerical quantification of happiness. The first scale, described as the “satisfaction with life” scale, used five general statements to assess respondents’ general feelings and attitudes concerning their life. These were very broad, and included statements such as, “in most ways my life is close to my ideal” and “so far I have gotten the important things I want in life.” 
As Loewenstein explained, “Respondents indicate how much they agree or disagree with these statements on a 1 to 7 scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree,’ which is 1, to ‘strongly agree,’ which is 7.” The second scale, known as the “ladder scale,” asked patients to describe their current view on their life. “This asks participants where on a 0 to 10 ladder they stand at the present time,” Loewenstein said. “The top of the ladder, 10, represents the best possible life for them, and the bottom, 0, represents the worst possible life.”
The outcome of the research proved to be something unexpected, but Loewenstein offered a logical explanation, reflecting the notable human ability to adapt to many situations. Loewenthal states, “There are probably good reasons that we adapt to ongoing adverse circumstances. Negative emotions serve the function of motivating us to change our situation, but if a situation generates negative feelings for some time and doesn’t improve, it’s probably an indication that we are powerless to change it.”
The patients who were told their colostomies were irreversible were in a situation they had no control over; any feelings of distress might be natural, but would not help change their condition. “At that point, dwelling on it further is no longer productive, so we evolved to adapt to negative situations — to stop feeling bad about them when they have been constant for some period of time.” Just as humans can adapt to moving to a new location with a new climate, these patients showed they could adapt to living with different circumstances.
This research can be applied to different aspects of life other than life-changing surgery. Loewenstein noted that individuals were happier if their spouse had passed away rather than divorced them. These individuals are similar to patients who now live with irreversible colostomies, in that they have no chance of regaining their old life. In essence, the finding shows that happiness and what is generally considered a “happy” outcome are not necessarily correlated. 
“By showing that a group that is objectively worse off, because they have an irreversible colostomy, is happier than a group that is objectively better off, because they have colostomies that can be reversed, the study underlines the fact that the relationship between subjective happiness and one’s objective situation is tenuous,” Loewenstein said.
The study holds implications for the psychology of those who have to give the bad news. As Loewenstein explained, “People are often reluctant to be the bearer of bad news, both because they don’t want to be blamed and because they don’t want to make someone else feel bad. But, while giving bad news an optimistic spin may be easier for the person conveying the news, it may well be worse, at least in the long-term, for the person receiving the news.”

Carnegie Mellon associate research professor Roberto Gil has employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to analyze the chemical structure of a compound known as withanolide, known to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells.
NMR spectroscopy has been in use for the past decade and has provided new insight on the structure of chemical compounds. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance is a property of atomic nuclei, allowing them to absorb electromagnetic radiation and emit the same energy back out. 
By using the resonance frequency of the emitted energy and applying quantum physics techniques, researchers can find the type and orientation of the atoms involved. A member of Carnegie Mellon University’s chemistry department, Gil worked on developing residual dipolar couplings (RDC), a new anisotropic parameter for the NMR process. Using this parameter, one can more easily determine the structure of small organic molecules, which are often overlooked by traditional liquid NMR techniques.
“This is a relatively new field for NMR of small molecules that I can call ‘NMR spectroscopy in anisotropic media,’ ” Gil said. The parameters, he continued, include not only RDC, but also residual chemical shift anisotropy (RCSA) and deuterium quadrupolar splitting. Gil applied RDC to jaborosalactol 24 (or withanolide), a steroid molecule in the Jaborosa parviflora plant, and found out how its atoms were arranged. The analysis shows that it may have some use in the future for breast cancer resistance.
Using RDC over NMR had several benefits. According to Gil, while NMR detected three potential structures for the jaborosalactol, RDC narrowed it down to one. 
Unlike NMR, RDC reads the magnetic interactions between atomic nuclei, allowing their overall orientation to be determined even at long distances. Although RDC is not a new technology, only after recent findings has it been able to be used on molecules like withanolide. Previously, this technique was only compatible with DNA and protein analysis. The breakthrough came with the development of an elastic polymer gel, which traps small molecules within it and allows them to align. 
The gel is known as poly-methyl methacrylat (PMMA) and was a result of Gil’s work in coordination with Carnegie Mellon faculty members Nicolay Tsarevsky and Krzysztof Matyjaszewski. There are several advantages to using PMMA over other available gels. Not only is it comparatively easy to use and cost-friendly, but it also has an easily removable background signal. 
Besides Tsarevsky and Matyjaszewski, Gil also collaborated with Viviana E. Nicotra of Argentina and a group from the University of La Laguna in the Canary Islands, Spain. Their research has been submitted to the Journal of Natural Products, reporting the activities of the jaborosalactol 24 with their work on other plant molecules.
In the past, Gil worked in the field of bioactive natural products. “At a certain point I have isolated and reported a natural product that inhibits the aromatase enzyme involved in postmenopausal hormone-dependent breast cancer,” he said.

Hallucinations have always been difficult to explain and interesting to witness. For some, these non-realistic images are seen throughout their day, every day of their lives. Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a disorder in which mentally healthy people experience complex visual hallucinations. Patients with this syndrome are usually aware of the unreality of their visual experiences. Their hallucinations are often pleasant, but sometimes can be disturbing. 
The patients have little control over these hallucinations, but they are noted to be well-defined, organized, and clear.
This illness was named after Charles Bonnet, a Swiss philosopher who, in 1760, noticed that his nearly blind grandfather was seeing patterns, figures, birds, and buildings that were not actually there. This syndrome affects 10 to 40 percent of people with poor vision. Research suggests that it is more likely to appear in those with visual acuity between 20/120 and 20/400. 
This syndrome occurs more often among elderly people and frequently goes unrecognized in a clinical practice. 
This could be because, currently, there is little known about the causes of this syndrome and how it correlates with the hallucinations, or how the brain receives information from the eyes to produce these images. 
One explanation is that when people lose their sight, their brains are not receiving as many images as needed. To compensate for the loss of visual stimulus, the brain will sometimes release fantasy pictures or old pictures to fulfill that need. 
This is comparable to another medical phenomenon,  phantom limb syndrome. In phantom limb syndrome, when people’s limbs are missing, the limb’s nerves are still active and sending signals to the brain, which the brain interprets as signals from the missing limb.
It is important for people to understand that Charles Bonnet Syndrome is not actually a mental disorder, but rather that it is simply a side effect of vision loss. Mogk et al., in an article in the journal Vision Rehabilitation: Assessment, Intervention and Outcomes, describe ways to differentiate between mental disorders and side effects of loss in vision. 
If the hallucinations occur while the patient is fully conscious, or if patients know they aren’t real and they suddenly disappear, then these are solely visual problems. Another criteria is that the hallucinations must simply be amusing and not grotesque.
CBS, though, could be aggravated by other circumstances such as sensory deprivation, diminished ability, stroke, aging, depression, or bereavement (for instance, seeing deceased kin).
According to a study conducted by Mogk and Mogk, their patients have reportedly seen a wide variety of visual hallucinations. According to research, patients have seen “cartoons, flowers in the bathroom sink, hands rubbing each other, waterfalls and mountains, tigers, maple trees in vibrant autumn foliage, and a dinner party and brightly colored balloons.” 
It also seems that these hallucinations usually appear in the same situation each time: For example, one patient would see monkeys around sunset. In this case, the images involving the monkeys stayed for 10 or 20 minutes several times a week over the course of two years. They then began to appear less frequently. 
It seems that hallucinatory activity may terminate spontaneously due to factors like improving visual function.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing the hallucinations, but anticonvulsants have been shown to help. 
When people first experience symptoms of Charles Bonnet Syndrome, they are often startled or embarrassed by them. Therefore, specific care such as physician awareness and careful management of the illness is important to the patient’s well-being.
It is also important for the doctor to begin treatment in the form of grief counseling or treatment of psychiatric problems, especially depression, if these conditions worsen the symptoms of CBS. 
Since CBS is a side effect of vision loss, treating vision disorders may also help lower incidences of hallucinations. Luckily, most people find their hallucinations to be pleasant or entertaining — seldom disturbing. CBS, therefore, usually does not cause the person to become extremely uncomfortable. Mogk et al. suggest that the patient’s family and doctor should approach Charles Bonnet Syndrome with empathy and a good sense of humor.

As surprising as it may sound, cosmetics and styling often involve a large amount of science. Whether it be producing safe makeup or coming up with effective shampoos and moisturizers, science is everywhere. Hair straightening is one such technique that relies heavily on the basic scientific properties of hair.
Hair is made up of a protein known as keratin. Keratin is composed of long chains of amino acids. Along with hair, nails and teeth enamel are also made up of keratin. Hair, nails, and teeth have one important factor in common — they are all strong. 
It is extremely difficult to break a strand of hair apart without a pair of scissors. No amount of twisting, pulling, rubbing, or even hammering can do anything to hair. 
The strength of hair can be attributed to a special property unique to proteins like keratin, which are made up of a large number of sulfur-containing amino acids. Sulfur atoms, from adjacent chains of keratin, bond together to form disulphide bonds. These extra bonds make the fibers that have keratin very strong. In addition, they ensure that the position of the keratin molecules remains fixed, such that the shape of the hair fiber stays the same. 
Naturally, this is a good property since hair — especially long hair — is normally subjected to a large amount of stress, and one would not want hair breaking or changing its shape because of this everyday wear and tear. However, when people do want to change the shape of their hair — get rid of curls, add curls, make it wavy, make it straight — these disulphide bonds pose a great problem. Most hair-straightening techniques, therefore, target these bonds. An easy method of breaking these bonds is using heat. This brings us to what is probably the most common technique for straightening hair — the flat iron. 
The plates of the iron are usually heated to high temperatures, generally between 300 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
When hair is passed through the iron quickly, while being held tight and straight, the extreme heat causes the disulphide bonds to break. This breakage allows the keratin chains to move around slightly and assume a position that results in straightened hair. When the hair cools down, the disulphide bonds between the keratin are reformed. Because the keratin molecules are in different positions when the bonds are reformed, the hair stays in the straightened shape for a long period of time. As most people who use flat irons know, this method of straightening hair is not permanent. 
Exposure to moisture causes the hair to revert back to its original shape. Permanent hair straightening techniques use harsher methods, with chemicals, to break the disulphide bonds and reform them. The disulphide bonds cannot be broken apart by oxidizing agents, which are acids, but can be broken apart by strong reducing agents, which are bases. Alkaline solutions, therefore, are applied to hair to break apart the disulphide bonds. The hair is then held straight and acidic solutions are applied to it. 
The acid neutralizes the base, stopping the disulphide bond cleavage reaction and allowing the disulphide bonds to reform in new positions. Although all chemical hair-straightening techniques have this same basis, each has a slightly different mode of action on the hair. Alkaline hydroxides are the harshest and most rapid agents for breaking the disulphide bonds; usually, either sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide is used for this purpose. Along with breaking the disulphide bonds, these solutions also cause the hair to swell. Since they are so harsh, these chemicals should not be left in the hair for more than 10 minutes, as they can cause severe damage to the hair and scalp if not used properly. Hair is usually treated with a cream to protect it from the caustic effects of these chemicals before applying the alkaline hydroxides. Thoroughly washing off the solutions allows the reaction to stop and the disulphide bonds to reform, sealing the hair in its new, straightened position.
Solutions containing thioglycolate are safer to use. Thioglycolate has a rather unpleasant odor, but since it is much less harsh than alkaline hydroxides, it is a more popular method for hair straightening. Thioglycolate contains a thiol (-SH) group, and dissociation of the hydrogen atom from the sulfur creates a thiolate (-S-) ion. Thiolate ions are good reducing agents and help break the disulphide bonds. This method generally takes much longer than alkaline hydroxides. Also, a strong oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, has to be applied after thioglycolate treatment in order to stop the reaction and help the bonds reform. 
Another method is the use of bisulphate-containing solutions. These, too, can act as reducing agents. They work slightly better than thioglycolates and are safer than alkaline hydroxides. Although chemical hair straightening techniques are popular, scientists are now trying to come up with a way to attack this issue from its roots. 
According to a November 2005 article on the Telegraph, scientists from L’Oreal in Paris discovered that a curve-shaped hair follicle gave rise to curly hair while a straight one gave rise to straight hair. The article further states that by understanding what process in the body determine the shape of the hair follicles, scientists could develop a drug to alter the shape of hair follicles and, ultimately, hair. As of now, no such pill exists, and flat ironing or using chemicals are the only two ways to straighten curly hair.

Cat catches swine flu from humans
While the H1N1 “swine” flu has prompted widespread vaccinations and concern, one group was excluded from these protection efforts: household pets. Last Wednesday, a housecat in Iowa was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. 
Over the past several months, the only other animals diagnosed with the flu have been swine and ferrets. 
The normal seasonal flu does not affect domestic animals, but other strains, such as avian flu, can be transmitted among species.
While the transmission from human to cat of the swine flu is a new step in its development, veterinarians are not particularly concerned. Given the many thousands of human cases of H1N1 in the past months, a single appearance in a pet is still only a minor threat. 
The virus has not been documented spreading from animals to humans, and most animals still seem to have immunity. For now, at least, dogs and cats are safe from the swine flu.

Obesity quantitatively linked to cancer
In a study published last Thursday by the American Institute for Cancer Research, scientists revealed for the first time predicted numbers of cancer cases caused by obesity. 
This is the first experimental data making direct links between this condition and specific cancers. Researchers analyzed a number of obesity-related cancers, including endometrial, esophageal, pancreatic, kidney, and other types. Of these, endometrial cancer was shown to have the greatest link to obesity, with 49 percent of the cases caused because the patients are overweight. Overall, the authors estimated that more than 100,000 cancer cases each year directly result from obesity. 
The study does not propose explanations for the links between obesity and cancer, but scientists theorize that the excess estrogen and increased oxidative stress resulting from extra body fat may encourage cancer growth. As with other obesity-linked diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, a healthy diet and lifestyle decrease the risk for nearly all related health problems.

Space elevators go to infinity and beyond
A competition straight out of science fiction took place last Wednesday in the California desert: Three teams tested prototype climbers for a future space elevator. The space elevator concept, a staple of science fiction, was popularized by author Arthur C. Clarke (see “How Things Work: Space elevators” from the Aug. 15, 2009 edition of The Tartan). 
They seek to make travel to Earth orbit easier without expensive, wasteful rockets. 
The team LaserMotive won a second place prize of $900,000 when their climber reached one kilometer of cable at two meters per second. The first prize of $1.1 million requires five meters per second. While these tests are a long way from the 22,000 miles a real space elevator would have to climb, they are the first steps toward a new and potentially revolutionary technology.

For years, the office of admission here at Carnegie Mellon has invited applicants to participate in one of the university’s most anticipated undergraduate events: Sleeping Bag Weekend. During their stay on campus, applicants spend their evening at the dorms and then follow their hosts to classes the next day. All in all, this experience is one of the most accurate ways by which prospective students can get a proper understanding of our university.
For many, the effects of Sleeping Bag Weekend vary greatly. For some students, it proved to be the breaking point for their collegiate decisions. “Your experience during Sleeping Bag Weekend is determined almost entirely on your likeness to your host,” said Adam Rosini, an undecided first-year in H&SS. “I always see cool baggers paired up with weird hosts, or vice versa, and I can’t help thinking how that kid’s opinion of Carnegie Mellon is either going to be ruined or improved by his or her relationship with that host.”
This can be a terrifying notion, but for those of us who chose not to participate in Sleeping Bag Weekend, and for those baggers arriving on campus this weekend, some accounts of experiences might be of great value.
The experience
For first-year CIT student Paul Dagnelie, Sleeping Bag Weekend was a deciding factor in his choice to come to Carnegie Mellon. “Before I did my Sleeping Bag Weekend, I thought I was going to come to Carnegie Mellon, but I wasn’t sure, so I decided to do a Sleeping Bag Weekend to really solidify my opinion,” Dagnelie said. “At first, it felt a little weird and strange, but then after a while I really got to know my host and his friends and I really enjoyed myself. I felt as if I really fit in amongst this group of people that I had never met before. I felt at ease and at home, and the fact that I could do all of that in maybe a day or two made me feel as if Carnegie Mellon was really the place for me.”
For Dagnelie, it wasn’t so much his host that made the experience worthwhile, but the community as a whole. “My host was distracted with exams and stuff, so he wasn’t super attentive, but that meant that I got to meet a bunch of different people on his floor as opposed to hanging out with one person the whole time. That actually ended up being an advantage,” he said.
However, not all baggers are as lucky as Dagnelie. “I don’t think my sleeping bag experience was a remotely accurate representation of what Carnegie Mellon is like,” said first-year CIT student John Rushing. “Sleeping Bag Weekend, for me, was a gigantic waste of time. My host was pledging a fraternity and working with a bunch of his friends in EMS [Emergency Medical Services], so at night we did fraternity stuff and then spent the rest of the weekend posting flyers for a blood drive. I had just had midterms so I was very tired, but my host stayed up and played Guitar Hero until, like, seven in the morning. There were three baggers all stuffed in one room in Hamerschlag and I ended up missing a 9 a.m. class I really wanted to go to.”
Rushing’s advice: If you get caught in a bad sleeping situation or are not getting along with your host, sleep somewhere else. He also urges baggers not to let their experience, whether positive or negative, completely influence their decision to attend Carnegie Mellon. “When I came back to campus for my interview, I ended up staying with a friend and had a really great time. That’s what convinced me to come to Carnegie Mellon, and that experience was completely separate from the Sleeping Bag Weekend program,” he said.
Sleeping bag agenda
When visiting Carnegie Mellon for the weekend, it’s good to have some sort of idea about what you want to discover and learn about the university. There are always many events happening on campus, so it’s good to go into your weekend with a plan.
For first-year H&SS student Edward Bai, Sleeping Bag Weekend was one big party. “My host was all about the fun,” said Bai. “We went running over to Baker Hall at one in the morning and rode down the incline hallway in spinny chairs. He even took me to his bhangra practice the next morning after classes.”
Some students choose to focus more on the intellectual side of the program. “Academic-wise, the experience was super informative,” said Veda Vadyar, a first-year in H&SS. “We got a tour, learned the history of [Carnegie Mellon], and met other people from our colleges. I went to a computer science class and an economics class, but there were actually a lot of other activities going on like lectures from professors and different things like that. It felt as if you were already in college.”
“For me it was all about experiencing dorm life,” said Jennifer Brown, a first-year in MCS. “I’m a counselor at an all-girls summer camp and I’ve been there for 13 years as a camper and a counselor, so I have lived with a lot of people. I got to see what life was like outside of the cabin. Surprisingly enough, I met people on bagger weekend whom I’m still friends with.”
Whatever your motive, Sleeping Bag Weekend is the perfect time to craft your understanding of our school.
Advice
What can baggers learn from the experiences of these first-years? Hernando Vidal, a first-year CIT student, recalled his weekend on campus and spoke about the importance of the formalities of Sleeping Bag Weekend. “When I first got to campus, I made sure that I immediately spoke with a bunch of undergraduate admissions officers, and I made sure they knew me by name. I signed up for my interview right away. I then went with my host back to his room and spent a lot of time meeting people on the floor and talking about majors. I was trying to get an actual student’s perspective on what life was like here.“
Many baggers get nervous or intimidated by the whole process. According to Vidal, this fear can be the most hindering side effect of the whole process. “When you do the Sleeping Bag Weekend, it’s really important that you take advantage of everything you can. You pay $50 to come visit the campus and you travel all this way; you don’t want to waste it by isolating yourself or by being afraid. You need to take advantage of all the resources on campus and all of the students you’ll be meeting — that’s the only way to get a true feel for the school,” he said.
For those arriving on campus and those hosting baggers, best of luck! This experience can be an innovative one, so take advantage of all that is being offered to you, but also remember to have a little fun.

“We’re all the same.”
Are we?
This is the thread that keeps weaving itself through explanations of our journey to Qatar, through descriptions of the people we met on Carnegie Mellon’s campus in Education City, and through the fast food restaurants with familiar logos that we saw.
I like to speak in the plural “we” about this experience because I wasn’t traveling alone to Doha to take classes and participate in extracurricular activities, as one might expect from a typical student studying abroad. Instead, I traveled with nine other students, of varying majors and years, including two graduate students. Together, we did take classes and participate in extracurricular activities, but not in the typical “we are all Carnegie Mellon students” sense. I had the opportunity to sit in on a class on the history of Islam. Although similar in subject matter to a class I took in the fall, Religion and Politics in the Middle East, the teaching style and classroom dynamic was completely different. There were only three students in the class — all female — and the professor didn’t lead as much of a discussion as might be expected from such a small class.
Despite the difference in classroom dynamics, we all carry heavy backpacks and the burden of the week on our backs. There’s always work to be done between classes, no matter what time zone we’re in.
We were lucky enough to take part in Qalta during our visit. Qalta is CMU-Q’s version of Summit, but it only took place in the evenings over a two-day period. The time and planning that the students put into this event was enormous. We learned a huge variety of things: how to make authentic tabbouleh, how to sword dance (only for the guys), how to belly dance (only for the girls), how to play some traditional Qatari games, and how to apply henna. 
Obviously, the skills and insight the students gave us were very different from anything that might have been taught at our Summit. But there was a sincerity and sense of community that can be found on both campuses.
Throughout the week, we really got to know the students. CMU-Q is contained in one building within Education City, and their enrollment is about 200 students. The small size of the campus and the population made it feel like we had met most people by the end of the trip. The warmth and hospitality of everyone there was astounding. Perhaps this was because they are such a close-knit community and they were excited to meet their peers from Pittsburgh, but it also seemed like this was just a part of their culture, to welcome us into their school and, at the end of our visit, to welcome us into their homes.
The home and the family are central to Islam and Qatari culture. The three boys in our group were whisked away to the desert tents to roast meat, play cards and music, and smoke shisha. This is a common experience for men in the culture — to isolate a little from the rest of the world and race their cars over the dunes. Before the women in our group were split among three different houses, we gathered in one student’s palatial home. We met two of her sisters that were home and talked about the rest of her family, who were away. It was clear how central the family is, especially after she showed us a wedding album of photos from an older sister’s wedding. 
More than Education City, what remains clearest in my mind is often not the adventures we had outside the gates of Education City — sand duning in the desert; relaxing by the Persian Gulf; exploring the Islamic Art Museum; wandering through Souq Waquif, buttered dough ball in hand; whizzing along the hectic streets of downtown Doha, through the ever-expanding construction — but the time we spent on campus with the students.
These other experiences definitely added a lot to the journey and gave me a clearer sense of what Doha is like. But the students, their voices, and their faces gave me the best sense of what CMU-Q really is. Their voices, stresses, and workload might be similar to ours, but there are differences, too — differences we can learn from and admire.

It took 250 years of history and five different writers to bring Candide to Pittsburgh’s former Don Allen Auto City. Last Thursday night, Quantum Theater presented the first of many performances of Leonard Bernstein’s operetta, as adapted from Hugh Wheeler’s adaptation of Voltaire’s original work.
The story follows the titular character (played by John Wascavage) as he is unwittingly pulled around the world, always in search of Cunegonde (played by Carnegie Mellon graduate Nicole Kaplan) — both the love of his life and his cousin.
The Don Allen Auto City locale presented a few challenges to the ensemble, but also offered the theater group a unique opportunity to bring in the setting in amusing ways. For example, when Cunegonde is holding what is intended to be a rose, she is instead clutching a bouquet of cardboard air fresheners.
Before the show began, the audience — wrapped around three sides of a small square stage — awaited the cast and tried to ignore the pervasive scents of oil and grease. Meanwhile, the eight-member pit (including conductor Andres Cladera) sat in the recessed center of the stage dressed as mechanics.
One of the best features of the show was that the pit was more or less forced to be a part of the show. “There’s no pretending the pit is not there,” Cladera said. At one point, one of the characters, called the Jew, took hold of the violinist’s bow and brandished it as a sword.
When the performance began, the cast entered, all dressed in white, and sat on the varied stools and chairs on stage, clearly noting that they were being observed by an audience. Despite the story’s 1759 origin, they soon brought out iPods and cell phones, which elicited some small laughter from the audience.
Very quickly, the performance proved to provide much more humor throughout the show. As Cunegonde prayed for the return of Candide — whom her family cast out because he was the bastard son of the sister of Cunegonde’s father but intended to marry Cunegonde — Kaplan comically thrust her hips and lamented the ravages of life.
In the first song, Wascavage seemed a weak singer. He did not carry his part and faded into the rest of the ensemble. However, as the show went on, he seemed to find his voice, finally shining in “Make Our Garden Grow” — the show’s finale.
Kaplan, on the other hand, proved to be a powerful singer and showcased her considerable vocal range and emotional breadth in “Glitter and Be Gay.” While Wascavage’s expressions were exaggerated and unrealistic, Kaplan provided a much more pitiable Cunegonde.
An unexpected star of the show came out of Laurie Klatscher as the Old Lady. For “Easily Assimilated,” the character’s breakout song, Klatscher held her character’s Polish accent with surprising ease. As the show went on, Klatscher nearly stole the show with her intense characterization and powerful expression.
Klatscher had begun the show as a small member of the ensemble cast, where most of the cast members spent the performance except in the few places when they took on a character. In fact, director Karla Boos took advantage of the small cast by reintroducing characters like Maximillian and Paquette after they had already died — more than once.
Jeffrey Gross, who played parts from a priest to a pygmy native, said that this was a much different version of Candide from the one he had been familiar with — a more traditional adaptation of Voltaire’s story. “Some of my favorite numbers aren’t in this,” he said, “but it was a great time.”
Indeed, the show was a great time and a great laugh. Some very addictive songs caught the audience by surprise — I walked away singing “Tus labios ruby/Dos rosas que se abren a mí” for hours after seeing the show — and some fantastic moments made viewers burst out in laughter.
In spite of a few weaker moments — which will likely work themselves out in time — Candide was definitely a production worth paying for.
Candide runs Wednesdays through Sundays until Nov. 22 at the former Don Allen Auto City at 5315 Baum Blvd.

The floor of Mr. Small’s Funhouse was a sea of screaming 20-year-old women — and no, the Backstreet Boys were not reuniting onstage. Ingrid Michaelson (the singer-songwriter best known for her song “Keep Breathing” from the Grey’s Anatomy season three finale) was performing the last show of her two-month-long U.S. tour in Pittsburgh.
Besides working the hospital-TV-drama circuit (Michaelson’s songs have provided the background music to the Fox Network’s House and ABC’s Scrubs in addition to Grey’s Anatomy) her melodies were also used to sell Old Navy knitwear — “If you are chilly, here, take my sweater” — last winter.
Onstage, Michaelson’s signature “librarian rocker” look — pin-straight hair parted down the middle, pulled back with a headband, and thick, rimmed eyeglasses — matched her geeky yet endearing personality. In between songs, Michaelson talked to her audience like old friends, which, for many who have followed her career from MySpace prodigy to international phenomena, was not a stretch. In the middle of the set, alone on stage with her guitar, Ingrid confessed that she was nervous, as she was about to try out a song she had written just a few days prior. After a soulful two and a half minutes singing about a new love who appreciated everything about her, imperfections and all, Michaelson turned to her fans for advice as to what the title should be. A lyric within the song’s hook — disaster — was shouted by a fan in the front, and Michaelson giggled with appreciation: “I like that!”
Michaelson’s simple yet honest lyrics have clearly resonated with a large fan base, one that is so hooked on her songs that she has not yet had to sign on to a major record label. Instead, Michaelson distributes her albums through the self-owned, independent Cabin 24 records. In a time when most artists we hear on the radio are attached to music companies through “360” deals, in which the singer’s label takes a percentage of any promotional work the artist pursues (for example, Rihanna is a spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics), Michaelson’s dedication to her music remains as pure and as fresh as the songs themselves.
The one and a half hour set on Thursday night was a perfect example of an artist who does not take these fans for granted. From getting the audience to sing harmonies to performing choreographed hand motions — a crowd pleaser: “spirit fingers” — Michaelson was respectful and thankful for her fans’ support. She was also incredibly appreciative of her fellow band mates, thanking them several times during the set. The atmosphere onstage was like kids at a playground. At one point Michaelson shouted “remix!” and like musical chairs, each band member assumed a new role onstage, with Ingrid playing drums. The song continued for another 30 minutes before the band was back in order.
Leaving the venue, fans were confronted with Pittsburgh’s chilly weather, but certainly went home with that childish, warm, fuzzy feeling that Michaelson’s personality and songs evoke. That, or maybe some were bundled up tight, wearing last season’s Fair Isle Old Navy sweater.
Ingrid Michaelson is next on tour in Europe, but will be returning stateside in December to play a show in New York City. Tickets are available at myspace.com/ingridmichaelson. Information about upcoming shows at Mr. Small’s Funhouse is available at Mrsmalls.com.

With the recent sightings of Russell Crowe and Jake Gyllenhaal filming different movies in Pittsburgh, it is clear that the city has been, and still is, a hot spot for filming locations. So it should come as only a mild surprise to hear that CBS’s soap opera As the World Turns recently completed filming a story arc in the ’Burgh. While the names may not be as big among our generation, stars Michael Park and Maura West, who have been in a staggering 1350+ combined episodes of the show, could be seen on campus and around Pittsburgh this past week.
As the World Turns premiered in 1956 and has been running uninterrupted ever since. It has spawned spin-offs and launched careers (Julianne Moore used to star in the show), broke the 10,000-episode barrier back in 1995, and has done pretty much everything a show can do during its run. Without going into the complete life story of the soap, let’s just say that it is set in the fictional town of Oakdale, Ill. and focuses on a wide array of characters and the relationships they form and break along with all the difficulties that come up in life — a typical soap opera, really.
This week, the show filmed at the College of Fine Arts building on the Carnegie Mellon campus. Christopher Goutman, the executive producer of As the World Turns, received his master of fine arts degree in directing from Carnegie Mellon University.
Sonia Blangiardo, line producer for the show and a staff member responsible for selecting locations, commented on Goutman’s choice.“The director for this episode (Goutman) remembered the College of Fine Arts building from his time here and we thought it would be good for what we needed location-wise,” she said. And in regard to the multi-episodic story arc, she said,“We’re not taking a cop-out; you will definitely be able to tell that you are in Pittsburgh.”
Indeed, viewers familiar with Pittsburgh will definitely recognize the locale, as the soap is also filmed at the Mattress Factory, the Pittsburgh Food Bank, and Clark’s Bar and Grille, among other well-known locations. Blangiardo also said that the story arc will have a “Feeding America” theme — hence the food bank — and will air over the time period of Nov. 17–25.
Probably the most interesting part about the filming, besides waking up at 6:30 a.m. to go see it, was actually to be able to see what goes on behind the camera. Sure, we’ve all seen “Behind the Scenes” episodes of our favorite shows, but to actually watch the boom mic operator check sound, the extras stand around, and much more was — simply put — really, really cool.
Keep in mind here that the crew had to jam all of their shooting, which consisted of three different scenes, each a few minutes long and both in and outside of the CFA building, into a one-hour period from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. so that they could beat the rush of students who were sure to be arriving soon. It was pretty impressive to see them have to pack light when they moved around and always to be on the ball. Each scene was wrapped up in just a few takes, each with minimal disruption.
One thing that jumped out pretty quickly was how easy it was to tell the actors, director, and the rest of the crew apart. There wasn’t any tension among the different groups, but it was surprising that, without knowing anything about the show going in, they could be spotted in an instant. In addition, the director was clearly in charge from the get go — he was constantly pacing and lining up shots, with not a moment to lose.
As the World Turns airs daily at 2 p.m. on CBS. Be sure to catch the episodes that will be airing during the week of Nov. 17 as you may recognize several of the locations, and who knows: Maybe you’ll see yourself in the background.

Rolling Stone gives rock band Taking Back Sunday’s new album only two and a half stars, but they do say that “Sink Into Me” is the best track on New Again and should be coveted by the Foo Fighters.
It seems ironic that the name of the album is New Again, and yet Taking Back Sunday has brought back the same old sound. In reality, the title of the album has little do with the music and more to do with the band’s history. New Again is the fourth studio album from the American rock band and was released on June 2, 2009. The title of the album refers to the addition of the band’s new guitarist, Matthew Fazzi, who brings a whole new sound to the band. “[Fazzi] brings an excitement and a fearlessness to working on music that really makes us feel even more so that we can do anything and call it us,” bassist Matt Rubano said. The band has turned in a new direction and, with the help of Fazzi, may be able to claim a fourth gold album.
Despite the review from Rolling Stone, many other critics give the album much better ratings — three stars and higher. Scott Heisel of Alternative Press said that the album “leaps forward as the best album of Taking Back Sunday’s career to date.” The album has been called “perfect,” and Channing Freeman at SputnikMusic has said that “[Taking Back Sunday] have never felt like more of a summer band than they do on New Again.” The band’s new sound is reminiscent of a drive-in concert at the beach where everyone is just having a good time.
Listening to some of the band’s previous music, it is evident that the style of sound has changed. Each of the songs presents something different. There are heavy vocal stylings on “Catholic Knees” and pop hooks on “Summer Man,” and many of the album’s songs are very strong and give listeners a chance to hear many of the new guitar stylings of Fazzi. The band’s lead singer, Adam Lazzara, has mentioned in previous interviews that the lyrics are more personal than before. “Lyrically it’s really autobiographical, whereas normally I try to mask all that just so people can take whatever they want from it. But [“Everything Must Go”] was one of the more straight-forward tunes on the record,” he said, referring to the last song on the album.
The band promoted the new album through the most basic and fastest growing medium: social networking. The name of the album was announced on the band’s MySpace page on Nov. 6, 2008. “We kicked around a bunch of different titles, but [New Again] always remained the top of the list, and that’s because it really does feel like a new band,” Lazzara said.
Taking Back Sunday’s previous album, Louder Now, received higher ratings and, as of June 2008, had sold 900,000 copies. Like the band did with Louder Now, it has released a special edition CD/DVD that offers track-by-track commentary and includes a “making of the album” special and even an autographed booklet.
This new album seems like a great way for the band to reintroduce themselves after three years and get back in the limelight.

Cameron Diaz and James Marsden star together in a new movie called The Box, directed by Richard Kelly of Donnie Darko fame. Based on a 1970 short story by Richard Matheson titled “Button, Button” that was remade into a 1986 episode of The Twilight Zone, the film is a modern psychological thriller.
Marsden and Diaz play Arthur and Norma Lewis, a couple coping with Arthur’s losing his job as a NASA engineer. Norma solemnly tells her husband in the film’s trailer, “We’re already living paycheck to paycheck. We’re going to have to move.” 
In these dire times, a mysterious and disfigured man arrives at their door, bringing with him a box and a case of money. For the desperate couple, this is both a blessing and a curse: If they push a button (inside the titular box that the stranger brings), they’ll receive $1 million in cash. The catch? As the stranger explains, “Somewhere, someone that you don’t know will die.”
When asked if she thought most people would push the button, Diaz’s response was not a simple yes or no. “In today’s society, we’re pushing the button already,” she said. She mentioned things like “dropping stuff in the ocean,” which will have an effect on something or someone else, which is exactly what The Box is about.
Diaz added, relating the question to her character specifically, “[Norma] didn’t want to have to suffer the consequences.... She saw Arlington [the stranger that delivers the box] and the million dollars, and somewhere in her heart she wanted to believe that there would be no consequence.” Kelly was drawn to the story when he heard Arlington’s response to the Lewis’ question of who he works for: “I can assure you that the organization is large and international in scope.” This obscure response hypnotized Kelly, who wanted to explore this stranger’s motivations. “What’s the point of it all?” Kelly wondered. It was this question that propelled him to take on this project.
The characters of Arthur and Norma are directly inspired by Kelly’s own parents, as he felt it appropriate to pay homage to the most important people in his life. This allowed for some conveniences during production — one in particular involving accents. The movie takes place in Virginia and lets Marsden’s Oklahoma roots come out without being a distraction to the film itself. Diaz, on the other hand, had to work to find an appropriate born-in-Texas-lives-in-Virginia accent to accompany her character.
Although a thriller, comedy abides on the sets of the movie, and Marsden admitted that he found humor in having a heart-to-heart with Diaz, quickly followed by her rushing to the bathroom and vomiting. He also referred to a scene that was physically draining yet provided some comic relief: During a take when about a thousand gallons of water was dropped on the couple while sitting in bed, Diaz was actually knocked onto the floor by the water pressure. 
For Marsden, it was “great to do something different; as an artist, it’s nice to change things up a bit.” He also added some words regarding his character, saying that “the further [the character] is from me, the more difficult it is to go there.” After working on The Box and the upcoming Straw Dogs, both dark psychological thrillers, Marsden said, “I may be looking for something light and fluffy after this.”

In the Pertinent and Impertinent section, it is announced that “the new cover design for The Tartan has been chosen.” Judging by the fact that this was given just a small blurb on a back page, it is obvious that the current staff of The Tartan has clearly taken some hints from the 1909 staff.

Carnegie Tech won its ninth game in a row the past weekend, putting them one win away from their first undefeated season. An amazing achievement indeed for the Tech players, considering that they lost multiple players during the game to injuries such as boo-boos and ouchies.

Several Pittsburgh students staged a hunger strike outside Mellon Arena to protest the Ringling Brothers Circus’ treatment of their animals. Now, I love animals as much as anyone else, but I can’t look at this quote from a Carnegie Mellon student — “The hunger strike left me uncomfortable and hungry” — and not laugh a little.

A Forum piece invokes both Dawson’s Creek and J.D. Salinger in the same breath. Surprisingly, the world did not implode. However, the writer then relays an important message about keeping one’s goals in sight and keeping people up until 5 a.m. just by talking about them. After that, I almost forgive the writer for the Salinger/Dawson crossover.

As I was walking past Lulu’s to campus the other day, the song that was blasting out across the steps was one I was not familiar with. Usually, I can recognize universally appealing tunes. However, this upbeat, over-produced song about love or dancing or whatever was something I could instantly recognize as pop music. Sometimes, I think people forget that the “pop” in pop music is short for popular. With this song fading into the distance, I started to contemplate what makes popular music popular and why so much of it sounds the same. I mean, really, how many times have you heard the new hot young thing sing about infatuation over a beat everyone can dance to?
The absorption of culture begins at a very young age. We begin to take in the world around us and learn things like apples grow from trees and Mommy gets mad when we spill juice on the rug. What we are also learning, but less consciously, are the schemata associated with places we go and things that we do. For example, the schema associated with going to the beach is that it is fun and sunny. An idea proposed by Ernest Schachtel is that when we recall events, we often recall just the schema associated with the event and not what we actually experienced. Maybe you were mad that the seagulls ate all your potato chips on the beach, but when someone asks you, “How was the beach?” you are more likely to say, “Why, it was fun and sunny!” than reporting that you were angry. In this way, we can lose all the meaning of an experience by replacing it with the schema.
The same thing can happen with music. If we let popular culture assert that music sounds a certain way, and we do not object, then we can listen to music churned out using the same formula and enjoy it again and again. 
The next time that you plug in your iPod or turn on the radio, really listen to the song that is playing. Maybe you will have an epiphany and fall head over heels for that chord progression, or maybe you will realize that you’ve heard that melody a million times before. Either way, I can almost guarantee that you will have a completely new experience.

Dear Rohit,
When I like someone, I like them — warts and all. And by warts, I mean subtle physical or emotional flaws, not actual warts (gross!). But when it comes to myself, I’m always worried that I won’t be able to find someone willing to look past my flaws, or that, if they do, they’ll always be thinking: “Man, I like her, but I wish she were less weird.”
I know that self esteem is more of a problem for 13-year-olds, but I guess I never really got over it. How can I feel confident while still knowing I’m not perfect?
—Nerdy in Wean
Dear Nerdy,
If you are indiscriminate in those you choose to like, don’t you think there are people out there who are the same? And if someone does judge you for your flaws, you don’t want to be with that kind of person anyway. Kick ’em to the curb!
Confidence, I think, relies on the knowledge that you aren’t perfect. It’s your lack of doing everything textbook-style that makes you unpredictable and worth pursuing. Be confident in the fact that you are a little weird, and that even with all your imperfections you can light up one lucky person’s day and bring a smile to his face.
Perfection is a bore,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I’m not the kind of person who hates a lot of people. It’s a strong word, so I don’t like using it. However, there are special negative/repulsive feelings I hold for a privileged few. I cross their paths on campus once a week and have found that I’m not sure what to do. Is there any etiquette for walking past people you don’t like?
—Confused on Social Conduct
Dear Confused,
In this kind of situation, you have two options. Option one is not to speak to said person(s) at all. Don’t address them, not even with eye contact; your quasi-enemy will be left wondering why you just looked at them with a crooked eye instead of simply saying “hey.” 
But if you are a particular fan of contempt, you should go with option two: You should definitely say “hi” to them, laying on the sarcasm thick. Shout something like “Oh yes, hello! I really like you!” to them before rolling your eyes and sauntering off. After a while, if your victim isn’t completely dense, they will get the point and stop talking to you, and you won’t even have to be concerned with whether to speak to them; they’ll have made the decision for you.
Confusion cleared,
—Rohit

In a recent survey published by the Chronicle of Higher Education, the median presidential pay at private American colleges and universities for fiscal year 2008 was $358,746, a 6.5 percent increase over the previous year. Presidents at major research universities, such as Carnegie Mellon University, did even better, with a median compensation package of $627,750, which is 5.5 percent higher than the previous year’s pay.
Surprising to some, particularly in these tough economic times, 26 colleges and universities reported paying their chief executives more than $1 million in total compensation. Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, topped the list with a total pay package of almost $1.6 million. Just behind Jackson were David J. Sargent, president of Suffolk University, and Steadman Upham, president of University of Tulsa, who each took home almost $1.5 million. Upham’s pay deserves particular notice in that it was more than triple the amount he had received the year before.
It may ease some students’ concerns, though, to know that Jared L. Cohon, the president of Carnegie Mellon University, is not among the 26 presidents receiving more than $1 million, and the Chronicle of Higher Education ranks Cohon as only the 51st highest-paid university top executive, just above John L. Hennessy of Stanford University and below Stuart Rabinowitz of Hofstra University. Nevertheless, the article also reports that Cohon received an estimated $733,000 in salary and benefits last year, roughly $100,000 above the median compensation for his position and a nearly 24 percent increase over his pay package the previous year.
A 24 percent increase may seem hefty, but when asked for comment, Cohon emphasized the importance of understanding the context of his raise. “The [Board of] Trustees wanted to bring my salary more in line with presidential salaries at the 31 peer universities with which they compare my salary. In that group, my salary is one of the lowest and below the 25th percentile. Thus, they gave me a 15 percent raise in my base salary to about $535,000 with the rest of the increase due to increased benefits,” explained Cohon in an e-mail message. “In all other years, my raise has been no larger than the average staff raise.”
As reported in the article’s survey, full professors at Carnegie Mellon earned on average approximately $136,000 in the 2008–09 school year, a 3 percent increase over their salaries in the previous year. Associate professors received average compensation of approximately $98,500, only a 2 percent increase over their prior salaries.
It’s no news that student tuition and costs at Carnegie Mellon have risen along with faculty and executive compensation packages. According to Carnegie Mellon’s admissions department, undergraduate tuition and fees for the 2009–10 school year are $40,910. Admissions estimates that the combined cost of tuition with room and board comes out to approximately $50,640, breaking the $50,000 milestone for the first time. Adding in the required $610 activities fee brings the total cost of attendance up to $51,250, making Carnegie Mellon the seventh most expensive school in the United States.
Teresa Thomas of the university’s media relations department, however, defends rising student costs. “[The] tuition increase was 2.94 percent and [the] full cost of attendance increased 2.93 to 2.95 percent depending on what year you entered CMU. This was the lowest increase in decades,” she said. “More than 51 percent of Carnegie Mellon students receive some form of financial aid.”
The Chronicle of Higher Education’s data on presidential pay was derived from tax documents for fiscal year 2008, a period ending before the devastating Wall Street collapse last year. In addition, many university presidents’ pay packages were set at even earlier dates. President Cohon stated, for example, “The reported salary was for fiscal year 2008, i.e., from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. That salary was set by the Board of Trustees in May 2007, obviously more than a year before the beginning of the financial crisis.”
Jeffrey Selingo, a Chronicle of Higher Education editor, also explained, as quoted in an article published by the New York Times, “[These] pay packages were set before the economic crisis began last fall. Since then, many presidents have taken pay cuts, donated part of their pay in scholarships, or had their pay frozen. Next year, it’s likely that we won’t see many presidents getting big raises.”
Likewise, President Cohon stated that neither he nor any faculty or staff at Carnegie Mellon has received any raises during the current year.

Carnegie Mellon’s Information Systems (IS) department has finally settled on its summer plans: mentoring students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and familiarizing them with the IS field. The summer program, “Information Systems in the Community,” is an intensive six-week course that brings these students to Carnegie Mellon to learn about IS from the faculty. The program began six years ago, and last week it was made possible for the next two years with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
“Carnegie Mellon and the Mellon Foundation have a long and productive history of sponsoring programs in higher education that make a real difference and have lasting impact,” said Randy Weinberg, professor and head of the information systems program. “We’re fortunate, and especially so in today’s economic climate, to enjoy the Foundation’s continuing support and confidence.”
The Mellon Foundation is a non-profit corporation started by Paul Mellon, the son of Andrew W. Mellon, in 1941. 
Since its inception, the program has served to make grants in six core areas including higher education and scholarship, as in the case of the IS program.
When the program began six years ago, it was due to an initial grant by the Mellon Foundation. This year’s grant totals $206,000 and will allow operation of the program for 16 students over the next two summers.
“The students learn to create information systems solutions that meet the real-world needs of local non-profit organizations ... and build an understanding of IS opportunities available to them after college,” said Jeria Quesenberry, an assistant IS professor who worked with the program last summer.
This past summer, six students designed a custom software system for the Pittsburgh Light of Life Rescue Mission, a non-profit organization aimed at providing food, shelter, and recovery programs to Pittsburgh’s homeless population.
“Although the program is a major time commitment for the faculty, we really enjoy working with the students in this program,” Weinberg said.
Last year’s team called themselves “Team Synergetic 6.” They worked hands-on with Weinberg, Quesenberry, and Larry Heimann, another IS professor involved with the program last summer, as well as their client, Light of Life. Their deliverable program enabled Light of Life to easily identify, match, manage, track, and evaluate mentoring relationships for Light of Life’s CARE program that provides homeless men and women mentors to assist them in graduating from homelessness.
Heimann elaborated on the benefits for “Team Synergetic 6” as well as past participants.
“There are no grades, so students are really here to learn and take advantage of the tremendous educational opportunities afforded by Carnegie Mellon,” he said.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, 10 of the program’s past participants have been accepted and fully funded by scholarships to obtain a master’s degree in IS at Carnegie Mellon.
Heimann, Weinberg, and Quesenberry all said that the effect of diversity goes beyond the student body.
“The program demonstrates Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to promoting diversity — not just in words, but in actions. Business and community leaders throughout Pittsburgh are aware of the program and have applauded CMU for taking a leadership role in promoting diversity within our region,” Heimann said.
Students learn about technology, project management, client relations, and teamwork through a mix of classroom teaching and hands-on exercises by professors such as himself, Quesenberry, and Weinberg, before applying them to their given project.
Heimann explained that one of his students last summer said he learned more about databases in that one summer than he had in a semester-long course at his home institution.
“This has been a wonderful experience from which we have all grown personally and professionally,” Weinberg said. “We’ve established valuable friendships and personal links with a good number of HBCUs and we look forward to building up these relationships in the future.”

The Allegheny County District Attorney has dropped all charges against two New York men accused of using social networking to inform the public of police locations during the G-20 summit in September.
The two men, Elliot M. Madison and Michael T. Wallschlaeger, were charged with hindering apprehension or prosecution, criminal use of a communication facility, and possession of instruments of crime.
The charges were filed after Pennsylvania State Police searched the men’s hotel room at the Carefree Inn in Kennedy early in the afternoon of Sept. 24, the first day of the G-20. The police found Madison and Wallschlaeger listening to police and EMS scanners, tracking the movements of law enforcement, and then forwarding this information to the general public via Twitter and cell phones.
The charges filed against them have been pending before a district judge. However, on Nov. 2, the district attorney’s office withdrew all charges against the men. The charges were dropped after the district attorney consulted with other law enforcement agencies and concluded that the acts that occurred during the G-20 summit were not isolated to this case, but rather were related to more expansive activities that went beyond Pittsburgh.
“It is unbelievable [Madison and Wallschlaeger] were arrested in the first place; we have the freedom of speech in America, and there shouldn’t be any legal repercussions for someone who is only exercising that right,” said Aaron Regal, a first-year art student who was arrested during the G-20. Regal also used technology as a means of communication during the summit: “I was actually texting people during the anarchist rally in Lawrenceville on Sept. 24 — basically just giving people who were interested first-hand updates about what I was seeing and what was going on. I also had my camera with me. I took tons of photos on Thursday during the day; I was actually taking a video on someone’s porch and had a gas canister land right next to me,” Regal said.
Regal was arrested at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Thackery Street in Oakland for failure to disperse, which is a misdemeanor. Regal is currently in the process of completing community service in order to have the charge removed from his record.
“I feel that my civil rights as an American citizen were entirely stripped from me on this day, and this experience has fundamentally changed my emotional and political perspective about our government forever.... I feel that I was assaulted by a dozen police officers, experiencing police brutality on a level that I did not think even occurred in this country,” Regal said.
Claudia Davidson, a Pittsburgh-based attorney representing Madison and Wallschlaeger, said, “The charges have been withdrawn. We never saw the evidence. To me, what they charged them with was probably subject to dismissal by a court because I don’t think what they charged them with was a crime.... My position is that they were charged with acts that are lawful under the First Amendment. It’s pretty simple.”

In October 2008, Jess Zimmerman, a junior political science major at Butler University in Indiana, started his True BU blog discussing Greek life and the student government, among other groups.
When Zimmerman began criticizing Jamie Comstock — provost and vice president for academic affairs at Butler — and Peter Alexander — the dean of the university’s Jordan College of Fine Arts (JCFA) — the administration took notice. 
In January, the university filed a lawsuit against “John Doe” — since Zimmerman was authoring the blog under the pen name Soodo Nym — for “harm[ing] the honesty, integrity, and professional reputation of Butler University and two of its high-level administrators,” according to the summons issued by the Marion Circuit Court.
According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), this is the first time that a university has sued a student over online speech. Zimmerman said the suit was dismissed in court on Oct. 27 of this year, but he still faces disciplinary charges from Butler University, which could affect his expected early graduation this May.
According to a statement issued by the Butler University administration, True BU “published communications that included defamation, threats, harassment, and intimidation.”
A Dec. 15 post on True BU reported that Alexander fired Andrea Gullickson as chair of the School of Music. Not only did it speak of Gullickson’s merits and accomplishments, it also suggested that Alexander was not an appropriate dean for the JCFA.
Zimmerman, as Soodo Nym, reported that a Google search he performed of Alexander’s name did not result in information on the individual serving as JFCA dean within the first 50 results. 
“While it’s not relevant to this article,” he wrote, “I do have to question the University for hiring someone as dean who, it appears, is not particularly accomplished.”
Gullickson is Zimmerman’s stepmother. According to Michael Zimmerman, Jess Zimmerman’s father and the former dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler, Alexander told Gullickson in December 2008 that she was doing a poor job — despite apparent disagreement from music department faculty — which led to Gullickson resigning the post.
According to Jess Zimmerman, Comstock then called a meeting with Gullickson and denied her resignation, and instead Comstock “threatened to fire her” from her tenured position at the university.
The details of this issue were on the blog, along with several letters reportedly from faculty criticizing the actions of the administration. The notes were posted anonymously, speaking highly in favor of Gullickson’s tenure as chair and negatively about Alexander’s and Comstock’s decisions.
On Jan. 4, Jess Zimmerman ended the blog. On Jan. 8, the university filed the lawsuit against Soodo Nym.
Michael Zimmerman said that after the lawsuit was filed, he was called in for a meeting with the provost. She told him that she did not want him to continue as dean, but that instead she would take him on as vice provost. He said she told him, “Either we would concoct a story showing we work well together or she would spread bad things about me.”
He decided to move back into a faculty position. Michael Zimmerman said the university’s board of visitors wanted to know why he had been removed and were reportedly told that she had told them a number of negative things he had done that he said were not true.
In response, he sought a lawyer, who sent a letter to the university requesting a retraction or clarification of her statements. The university agreed, if both Michael and Jess Zimmerman would sign a confidentiality agreement stating they would not discuss this issue nor that of Soodo Nym. They agreed, contingent that the university would not pursue a change in the suit to identify Jess Zimmerman as Soodo Nym.
No further information regarding the conclusion of the case was available at press time.
This story has been reported in a number of student newspapers, as well as Inside Higher Ed at insidehighered.com/news/2009/10/16/butler.

Prof. reappointed to CNO
Carnegie Mellon’s Kiron Skinner was recently reappointed by the United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to a position on the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) advisory panel. Skinner was appointed to the panel in 2004 by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and will now serve a second term of four years.
Skinner is an associate professor of social and decision sciences, and the director of the international relations and global politics program. She is one of the country’s experts in the areas of international relations, U.S. foreign policy, and political strategy. Along with Serhiy Kudelia, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, and Condoleezza Rice, she co-authored The Strategy of Campaigning: Lessons from Ronald Regan and Boris Yeltsin. Additionally, she wrote Turning Points in Ending the Cold War, a landmark work in international history featuring a collection of essays by leading American and Russian statesmen and scholars. She has published five other books, two of which were New York Times best sellers.
Skinner has also co-chaired the CNO task forces on the Middle East and Africa, and also serves on the board of the Atlantic Council of the United States in Washington, D.C. Skinner is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York City and is a former fellow of CFR’s studies department.
Team tracks energy usage
Lucio Soibelman, H. Scott Matthews, and Jose M.F. Moura have received a three-year, $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) devoted to developing inexpensive methods to track energy consumption. The research team has a goal of creating a process for obtaining statistics about electricity use in homes and buildings.
“This research grant gives us a timely opportunity to begin exploring electricity consumption on a variety of levels and to eventually develop tools to track the trends and patterns of energy usage and suggest ways to conserve,” said Soibelman, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon.
The team will use a grouping of residential buildings to test their new hardware and software tools for electricity monitoring with the goal of creating inexpensive and easy-to-install devices that could carefully monitor energy consumption. After collecting this information, the device would then infer the energy usage of individual appliances and electronics. This data, specific to each appliance, will be used to provide homeowners and building managers with suggestions on how to optimize their consumption and understand the effects of their energy-related decisions.

Is Water ‘The New Oil’?: The New Water Monopolies and the World’s Poor
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Karen Piper, professor in the department of English at the University of Missouri-Columbia, will talk about multinational companies that are gradually controlling the world’s water supplies. Such companies, including Suez, Vivendi, and Bechtel, are supported by World Bank policies that force poorer countries to privatize their water supplies. In her lecture, Piper will look at the consequences of water privatization today, bringing up her research in India and South Africa. She’ll also explore the discrepancy between the World Bank’s vernacular and the conditions on the ground, what cartographers call “ground truth.” In response to water cut-offs or floods, locals have tried to make their condition known to the media by taking drastic measures, including attempted mass drowning, extended fasts, monkey-wrenching, and riots. Piper will expand upon these forms of resistance and shed light on the gap that lies between development and disaster.

I’ll admit it — I’m a television addict. If I’m in my room, there’s a good chance the television is on. This means that I’ve seen at least a few episodes of pretty much every popular TV show and almost every episode of my favorite ones. It also means that I’ve seen way too many commercials, many of which are advertising other shows that are airing or movies that are about to be released.
Because of my time spent staring at or listening to the television, I consider myself an expert of sorts on TV and movie trends (vampires are big now, in case anyone’s missed that one). And I’ve noticed another recent — and rather disappointing, in my expert opinion — trend in television and movies: the remake.
I know what you’re thinking — remakes are popular now, were popular years ago, and will be popular for years to come. But I think the remake trend has become even more noticeable in the past few years. Two of the shows airing on the CW right now are remakes — they’re currently showing new episodes of 90210 and Melrose Place. And the CW has caught the vampire trend, too, with their show The Vampire Diaries, so they clearly know what’s happening. Movie remakes happen all the time as well. I’m sure almost everyone has seen the Christmas classic A Miracle on 34th Street (Matilda is in it!), which is actually a remake of an old black-and-white film with the same title. Planet of the Apes, King Kong, Hairspray, Footloose — almost every horror movie in existence has been subjected to Hollywood’s recasting, refilming, and rereleasing.
But old television series and movies aren’t the only places that Hollywood execs are getting their ideas from. There have also been a huge number of books that have been turned into movies. Harry Potter, of course, along with Twilight (the book that started the recent vampire craze), My Sister’s Keeper — the list goes on and on, and these are all movies that were released in the past year. And while making a book into a movie is different than simply remaking an old show or movie, it still promotes what I believe to be behind the remaking trend: a lack in creativity.
When a movie or show is remade, or when a book is turned into a movie, the idea is already there, laid out right in front of you, with no independent thinking or creative process that needs to be done. The characters are developed, the plot is fleshed out, and the ending has already been decided. And it’s clear that people will be interested in the show or movie, because the old one that it was based on was popular, or else it wouldn’t have been chosen for a remake.
Even on shows like 90210 or Melrose Place, where most of the characters are new and only one or two of the original stars have come back, I maintain that much of the work is already done. The storylines seem to follow the same cliche — albeit entertaining  — plots that their original counterparts did: Someone unexpected gets pregnant; someone is on drugs; someone is gay. 
I can’t completely fault the entertainment industry for taking the easy way out and remaking something old rather than trying to come up with something new. They want to keep their jobs just as much as any of the rest of us would, and if they can make something that will almost certainly be a hit instead of coming up with a new idea that may or may not fare well in the ratings, why not go for the sure thing? But who I believe is at fault, however, is us — the audience, the people watching these shows.
Why do we put up with remakes in television and movies when we wouldn’t in any other entertainment field? Books don’t get remade — no one wants to buy two copies of the same book written by two different authors. No matter how many words the author would change, the new book wouldn’t be purchased because the plot and the characters, the heart of the book, the creative part, would remain the same. Authors must constantly come up with new ideas — new plots, new characters, new situations — and other branches of the entertainment industry should be held to the same standards. Creativity should not be left out of television and movies simply because it can be.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) likes Glee more than she likes the new 90210 — but she still loves Dylan McKay.

Driving to Baltimore last Wednesday, phrases would pop into my head. Fragments of this article, of songs and conference papers and stories not yet written. I realized, as I always realize in the course of a real drive and then promptly forget, that it is during these times that the words flow best. This is, of course, tragic, as I can’t write them down while slaloming the Pennsylvania hills.
This past weekend, Golan Levin and the Studio for Creative Inquiry hosted Mobile Art && Code, a gathering of digerati and hackers, mobile phone programming gurus and interactive artists. Saturday’s agenda was full of talks from sunrise to sunset.
But these were not lectures intended to educate the room on a chosen topic. This wasn’t a classically academic conference, but rather a gathering of like minds talking about a future that is already here. There is something inspiring about sitting among a group of people coming from diverse backgrounds, educations, and countries discussing the goals for a shared, better future.
A future with more art and more code. A time when both your niece and grandmother are contributing to an open ecosystem. The techno-optimists were seizing the day and pulling the rest of us along with them.
One “designer, technologist, and researcher,” Julian Bleecker, channeled another, R. Buckminster Fuller, to deal with getting us to the future: “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” This is the work of many in attendance: to create tools, programming languages, and workshops that put programming, hacking, and a belief in one’s own ability to create something new into hands worldwide. 
There isn’t anything related to art or code that inspired my thoughts. I wasn’t in a room full of people I adored. I hadn’t even bothered with any sort of technical solution to catch the fragments of what could be art. I just leave them behind like I do the countryside and I keep driving.
Marc Davis, a founding partner of Invention Arts, and once the chief scientist and vice president of early stage products for Yahoo! Mobile, described an understanding of attention through context. When tourists are standing around an object, a landmark or building, for example, they point their cameras at it and shoot. Their attention is drawn in exactly the pattern one would expect. While Marc spoke, the room’s attention was drawn to him in that same way.
And what is new is that everyone in the room is participating. Facebook status updates and camera phone photos are making content creators out of all of us. The new model is already coming; parts of it are here.
For the people who gathered at Carnegie Mellon last weekend, their combined efforts are a piece of the record they are making. They put a huge and concentrated amount of attention toward empowering every person who is ready to accept their techno-centric future.
There will be stereotypes to fight. Coding is still reserved for dorks, nerds, scientists, and hackers. But while those cultural reservations are real today, they are malleable. If the force fighting them is strong enough, they won’t be here tomorrow.
If I think about driving, it’s all a blur. My attention moves from place to place, and the change brings a cycling of thoughts that flicker out as soon as they occur. It brings a different inspiration that I haven’t yet harnessed — an untapped energy.
Maybe I am considering, for just an instant, Carnegie Mellon, in theory where some of the most creative artists and most brilliant hackers reside, and all of the potential that resides within — those who are not yet building code and are not yet designing something new. What an exciting thought — that they could reach out, with code or art, and begin creating some new marvel for our collective attention to focus on.
Or maybe I am thinking of something else, some four beat couplet, as I drive away, off into the dark.

Last year, conservatives waged war on Oscar the Grouch. When Oscar poked fun at “Pox News” and called it a trashy news source, conservatives said that Oscar was purposefully putting down Fox News, and thus showing a political bias.
This claim that Oscar was actually demonstrating a bias toward the political left wing is absurd. Oscar the Grouch is best known for his hatred of anything and everything. If Oscar were to express a liking for Fox News, or any news source, that would have been out of character.
Just last week, conservatives laid a similar claim, this time on the show’s decision to include Michelle Obama on their anniversary episode. This segment, “The First Lady,” features Obama talking about healthy eating. Her script includes such lines as “Veggies taste so good when they come fresh from the garden, don’t they? If you eat all these healthy foods, you are going to grow up to be big and strong. Just like me.”
To the conservatives, veggies must be a very political matter. Obama’s script never at any point goes near politics, and the fact that she was chosen to speak on the show is based merely on her role as the First Lady. Such a segment would include any First Lady of the time, whether she be from the Republican, Green, or Independent Party.
It is true that such a segment has never been created, but to lay such a biased claim on a show that must change content every day is unreasonable. The conservatives are just mad about Obama’s feature because the idea was never around when Laura Bush was the First Lady, said one blogger on jezebel.com.
Each day, Sesame Street writers must struggle to come up with new means of communicating messages of phonics, arithmetic, and growing up to millions of children. If they had to also consider politics when writing their scripts, their jobs would become virtually impossible.
Even if there were very clear political references on the show, which do not include Oscar’s poking at Pox News and Obama’s encouragement of vegetables, would the children really notice? The average age of Sesame Street’s target audience is aged three to seven. These kids are barely aware of what  the word “politics” even means, and can’t even spell the names of any political parties.
When these kids sit in front of their television to watch Sesame Street, all they see is Oscar the Grouch hating  the world, a soft-spoken First Lady encouraging them to eat vegetables, and just some good old sunny days sweeping the clouds away in their favorite television location of Sesame Street.

Most of my best memories of childhood are from summer vacation. It seemed to last forever, but by the end, I was rested and ready to get back to school. Now, some people think that children will benefit more by going to school year-round, and while I can understand their argument, I disagree with this idea.
In a recent Post-Gazette article, Brigid Schulte discussed her children’s experiences with a year-round school calendar. She pointed out that it was more convenient for parents to have shorter breaks and that her kids seemed to enjoy it. The article contains quotes from Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who thinks that children should be going to school more than they do. The idea is that the U.S. is falling behind other countries in education, so we should make the school year longer to teach the kids more. Problem solved — except that it isn’t.
While the system described by Schulte in her article seems to be a lot of fun, it has its problems, too. The system offers a five-week rather than 10-week summer break during which students — or their parents — can choose to take more hands-on classes at the school. Schulte believes that this is better than a traditional system, as it takes some of the stress off parents to find camps and arrange transportation, to find babysitters, and to arrange work schedules around their kids.
Schulte assumes that the majority of parents put their kids into these camps, which is not necessarily true. A lot of families use the summer to go on vacations or take part in activities like summer camps and sports. It’s important for children to have these experiences, as they introduce them to new people, situations, and interests that cannot always be found in a classroom.
There are problems with this sort of system in general, though. While I agree that these sorts of hands-on classes are very beneficial for students, and I fully support schools that choose to offer them, eliminating a much-needed summer break is not the way to go about solving the education problem. Instead, schools should make an effort to teach in less traditional styles during the traditional school year.
There are also a few practical problems, including funding. Schulte notes that schools have had to revert to traditional calendars because the activities are not cheap, which means that the students who would benefit from year-round schooling are likely those who attend schools with more resources. Schools in lower income neighborhoods would be unable to offer these programs due to their budgets.
In addition, one of the problems with education isn’t that students don’t go to school enough — it’s that the teachers are ineffective. A New York Times article suggests that this problem can be solved with stricter requirements for becoming a teacher, and I think that this has merit. If our teachers were more effective, more time wouldn’t be necessary.
Education should be a main priority, but that doesn’t mean that it should be a year-round time commitment. Education happens outside of the classroom, too, and these experiences are just as important.
Amanda Cole (acole@) wishes she had more summer breaks ahead of her.

Apparently, trying to broaden the minds of high-school students and treating them like adults is a crime. At least, that’s what the administration at Southwestern High School in Piasa, Ill. believes. 
Southwestern High School suspended English teacher Dan DeLong after he assigned his students an optional reading of an article about homosexuality in the animal kingdom. DeLong was reinstated after protests by his students, and even some parents of students, insisting that DeLong was an excellent teacher and that his suspension was unjust.
The article in question was from Seed magazine and discussed the findings of Joan Roughgarden, a Stanford biology professor, which show that nearly 450 species in the animal kingdom engage in some form of homosexual behavior. Although the topic might be controversial, there is no harm in asking students to read an article like this. Introducing students to different kinds of information and opinions exposes them to alternate ways of thinking that they might not have considered before. Controversial evidence such as Roughgarden’s, especially when backed by scientific facts, opens students’ minds. 
Furthermore, DeLong made the assignment optional; those who were uneasy about the topic didn’t have to read it. In fact, by assigning the reading, DeLong attempted to show his students the variety of opinions that exist in the real world, a gesture that is actually quite admirable.
We’re glad that the school reinstated DeLong, but the fact that he was suspended in the first place is quite ridiculous. We are unsure of what the school was trying to prove by taking such a step. Schools, especially high schools, serve to prepare the students for the real world outside of school walls.
If they want to put their students in a shell with no knowledge of the reality in the world, it defeats the purpose of having schools at all. We can only hope that other schools throughout the country are not as narrow-minded as Southwestern High and encourage the dissemination of all kinds of knowledge.

Fees, fees, fees.
It is again nearing that time of year when the leaves fall from the trees, Pittsburgh enters a phase of weather that ends in bitter cold, and the university instates more student fees. Indeed, student government last week saw three proposals for added or restructured student fees.
The first of these fees pertains to the Health Center. Traditionally funded through Student Affairs, it is now looking to add either a student health fee or a co-pay to defer costs. The second is an increase in the student activities fee to support the Collegiate Readership Program (the free newspapers in those red bins) combined with the removal of the Undergraduate Media Fee. The last proposal is to increase the transportation fee to permanently support the Loop Bus.
While the student government continues to debate these fees, we have to ask if these fees are a necessity. Is the Loop Bus really worth $4 per student per semester when, by all accounts, it is used by no more than 100 students per weekend? Is the Collegiate Readership Program even sustainable or worthwhile?
The Health Services fee is an understandable request for the student body to help finance. Health Services is the most convenient place for students to go for any health concerns they might have, and it is often the least expensive. It is not at all unreasonable to ask students to help pay to offset the costs of the hundreds of flu vaccines that have been distributed over the past weeks, in addition to the other benefits that health services offers. The raises for the readership fees and the transportation fees, however, are a different matter.
While the Loop Bus’s extended hours do give students an advantage when they’re coming home from a late night out on the town and the PAT buses have already stopped running, it seems a bit overdone to ask students to pay two fees for the PAT buses and for the Loop Bus, especially when only a small percentage of the student body rides the latter. And while the Collegiate Readership Program is a praiseworthy effort, we’re pretty sure copies of USA Today aren’t flying off the shelves to the point where more money needs to be added to the program.
We are in favor of new developments that help support Carnegie Mellon’s student body, but we believe that any additional fees that students are asked to pay should be ones that will benefit the whole student body.

The most important thing that journalists can have is their integrity. They must always be trustworthy, so that in a situation where sources believes that it is necessary to reveal their information anonymously, they know that their name will not be divulged. 
This is why we are glad to learn that President Obama and Congress are moving forward on a Federal Shield Law that would protect reporters who are unwilling to reveal anonymous sources, according to an article from The New York Times.
It is a journalist’s job to report on events that are happening. In some cases, these situations involve sensitive information — information that will not be freely discussed when the people involved are confronted with probing questions. This can mean listening to whispers from behind closed doors, or getting information from anonymous sources who don’t wish to lose their jobs because they are speaking to a reporter.
But currently, a journalist’s right to withhold the name of an anonymous source is in jeopardy. The new bill would, in some cases, allow judges to effectively cancel a subpoena that asks reporters to reveal information about their anonymous sources. The bill offers different levels of protection for different types of cases involved. In civil cases, the burden of proof for the need to reveal the information lies with those who want it to be revealed, while in criminal cases or those involving classified information, the burden of proof falls to the reporter to explain why it is necessary that the source remain anonymous. Subpoenas for cases regarding terrorism or national security cannot be eliminated at all.
We are in support of a law that would protect journalists’ rights, and hope that Obama and Congress see the situation the same way.

Often, in the midst of our demanding work as college students, our lives become centered on our schedules, and we forget that there is some greater pursuit than adequacy. We forget what we really seek: peace. But the environment we’re in often makes that pursuit difficult, with a never-ending list of things that must be done before we can rest. It seems there could never be time for prayer, reflection, or meditation.
November is Spiritual Development Month, and it’s a good time to discover the spiritual oasis right here in Oakland. With St. Paul Cathedral a stone’s throw away (Fifth Avenue and Craig Street) and the Oratory, or Newman Center, just a block farther (Dithridge and Bayard streets), the Catholic community is very accessible. On campus, the Catholic Newman Club also hosts many spiritual, social, and service events.
We are lucky enough to have 11 different Sunday Mass times to choose from each weekend at either St. Paul Cathedral or the Oratory. But Mass isn’t only offered on Sundays — there are also four or five times to choose from on any given weekday, including a 5:15 p.m. Mass at the Oratory.
Confessions are also heard every weekday at the Oratory at 4:30 p.m., and on Saturdays at 12:30 p.m. at St. Paul and 3:00 p.m. at the Oratory. If you seek to live close to the Sacraments, there is ample opportunity, no matter how busy your schedule is.
The Oratory also has perpetual Eucharistic Adoration. It is affectionately known as “ ‘wasting time’ with the Lord.” For all hours of the day and night, except during Mass times, the Eucharist is placed on the altar for anyone to spend time in prayer, spiritual reading, contemplation, or journaling in the immediate presence of our Lord.
The Catholic Newman Club also prays the Rosary together every Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. We pray and meditate on Christ’s life, passion and death, looking at it through the eyes of the person who loves Him the most, His mother Mary.
We also study the Bible together every week. After all, as St. Jerome said, “Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ.” And he’s a doctor.
This fall, we have two men’s groups which meet in Doherty Hall 1209 — one on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and the other on Thursday at 8 p.m. There’s also a women’s group that meets in the Carnegie Mellon Café on Thursdays at 8 p.m.
If you want to join in, even if you’ve never done anything like it before, we’d love to have you.
If you have any questions, please contact us at cmunewman@gmail.com.
