The Carnegie Mellon Tartans hosted the Ohio Wesleyan Bishops last Saturday in front of a roaring crowd. With festivities provided by the Alumni Association and Tartan Athletics, the fans came flocking in and the Tartans came ready to play.
The Tartans’ first possession ended with a 2-yard run by junior running back Jake Nardone, which closed out a 10-play, 57-yard drive. 
On the following Bishops’ possession, junior Vincent Brown intercepted quarterback Mark Espinosa’s pass. The following Tartan possession started from the Bishops’ 29-yard line and ended with a 1-yard run by senior running back Chris Garcia to bring the score to 14–­­0.
After a quick three-and-out by the Bishops, junior running back Patrick Blanks scored for the Tartans with a 24-yard run down the sideline, breaking tackle after tackle to find the end zone.
After the Tartans forced a second turnover, Nardone scored again, this time on an 11-yard run, extending the lead to 27–0.
The Bishops managed a field goal in the last possession of the half, capping off a 21-play, 63-yard drive.
But with just 30 seconds left in the first half, the Tartans scored again. After a fourth-down-and-one pass from sophomore quarterback Rob Kalkstein to junior wide receiver Alex Lum, Garcia ran for a touchdown from the 1-yard-line. At halftime, the score was 34–3.
The third quarter was scoreless until the 4:50 mark, when junior running back Jared Delello ran one in from nine yards out, bringing the score to 41–3.
The Bishops scored once more on a pass by Espinosa to Rayce Risser for a 9-yard touchdown reception, but that would be the last score of the game. The Tartans won 41–10.
The Tartans finished with 422 all-purpose yards, 300 of them with the running game. Garcia’s 76 yards moved him up to 13th all-time in Tartans rushing with 1,439 career rushing yards. Sophomore inside linebacker Eric Rolfes, who had eight tackles, led the stifling Tartans defense. Junior linebacker Nick Karabin forced two fumbles in the game, adding six tackles as well.
With this win, Carnegie Mellon football is at 499 wins since the team’s founding. After a bye in the upcoming week, the Tartans will play Wittenberg University on Saturday, Oct. 22, where they will look to end the journey to 500 wins.

The CMU Marauders are Carnegie Mellon’s newest club sports team on campus — Quidditch. The game of Quidditch is based off the game played in the Harry Potter series. Quidditch consists of players flying on brooms and shooting at hoops high in the air for points, while players hit balls at each other, and one player attempts to catch the Snitch. 
The Carnegie Mellon Quidditch team was founded by senior computer science major Shashank Pradhan on the predication that Carnegie Mellon students do not have enough fun. Over 100 colleges across the country have Quidditch teams. Right now the Carnegie Mellon team has about 125 members, although only about 18–20 of them are active participants in the organization.
The game of Quidditch is played very similarly to how it is played in the Harry Potter series. The only real differences are that players in this version do not have the ability to fly, the Golden Snitch is a player, and the bludgers do not fly. There are 14 people on the field, seven per team; the positions are one keeper, one seeker, two beaters, and three chasers. The chasers throw the quaffle, which in the muggle world is a volleyball. They try to throw the quaffle through various hoops that are attached to poles in the ground. The beaters throw bludgers (dodgeballs) at other players, who must freeze if they are hit by one. An adjustment to the scoring of the game is that the Golden Snitch is worth 30 points instead of 150. Instead of a winged ball, the Snitch is a person who wears a flag belt like in flag football and is allowed to run absolutely anywhere. However, they must return to the pitch every five to ten minutes.
The team is currently training for the World Cup in New York, which takes place from Nov. 12–14, in which over 100 teams will be participating. The Carnegie Mellon team plans to have a match against the University of Pittsburgh Quidditch team, which was ranked the No. 7 team in the world at the end of last month.
Captain Don Hood discussed the team’s development: “We are still a really young team,” he said. “We’re working on getting more athletic and strategic. Because it is such a young sport, there are not a lot of strategies in the game yet, so we are trying to figure out what our team dynamic is and getting that team together. We are really just hoping to get our name out there and stick our foot in the door.”
A typical practice for the team includes conducting skills and agility drills with brooms, as well as open scrimmages on Fridays for both members and newcomers. 
The team practices from 4:30–6:30 p.m. twice a week out on the Cut.

It finally warmed up in Pittsburgh, providing the perfect Saturday for the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team to host two matches. 
The first match started at 12:30 p.m. against Robert Morris University, where the Tartans were victorious by a score of 9–0, and the second one started at 4 p.m. against local Division I school Duquesne University, where the Tartans fell 7–2.
In the first match, the Tartans swept all three doubles matches. ITA doubles finalists No. 1 team of senior Duke Miller and first-year William Duncan won the pro-set 8–0. 
No. 2 doubles team of senior Jeremy King and first-year Bryce Beisswanger won 8–3, and No. 3 doubles team of junior Jooho Yu and first-year Thomas Cooper also took the pro-set 8–3.
In singles play, the Tartans were able to win every match without dropping a single set to Robert Morris.
In the second match against Duquesne, things were tougher for the Tartans. Carnegie Mellon was only able to capture one doubles match. 
At No. 1 doubles Miller and Duncan won 8–5, while the team of King and Beisswanger and the team of Yu and Cooper fell to the Dukes 8–5 and 8–6, respectively.
The Tartans took the court for singles play. Duncan was able to pull out a win for the team at No. 3 singles with a three-set match. Duncan won 1–6, 6–2, 10–8 in the third set tie breaker. 
At No. 5 singles Yu lost in a heartbreaking 10–7 match tiebreaker. In an exhibition match, first-year Vinit Paleyekar won a pro-set 8–2.
The Tartans took on Amherst College on Sunday, Oct. 9, and suffered an 8–1 loss.
This concludes the fall season for men’s tennis. They will now have off-season conditioning until they hit the courts again in the spring.

I know, I know. Just last week I said that the two favorites in the Major League Baseball playoffs were the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees. Given that both teams lost in the first round of the playoffs this past week, I guess it’s a good thing that I didn’t put any money on that. If there is one thing about the MLB playoffs that is certain, it’s that there will be upsets, especially in the first round. Now we are left with two unlikely, yet exciting, match ups. The Milwaukee Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals get to renew their division rivalry, and the Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers will battle it out in the American League. Both series should be extremely competitive with these teams being so evenly matched, so it should be an exciting League Championship Series.
The Cardinals and Brewers series is the more interesting match up, given the boiling hatred between these two teams. They are bitter division rivals, and this rivalry has only intensified this year with both teams in the thick of this year’s playoff race. But a primary promoter in this loathing is Brewers outfielder Nyjer Morgan. Morgan has been very active in the media through his Twitter alias Tony Plush, who is known for making outrageous statements while contributing his aloof attitude on the field. However, it is not always fun and games when Morgan is involved. 
Earlier in the regular season, Morgan and Cardinals ace Chris Carpenter got into a bitter exchange in a heated game between the two teams. Videos show Morgan throwing a wad of chewing gum at the veteran pitcher, further inciting a team that already hates the Brewers’ guts. Later on, Morgan called out the Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols, the best player in the game, on Twitter by mockingly calling him  “Alberta.” If there is anything we can expect from this series, it is that emotions will be running high and that there will be some competitive fire between the two teams.
In the American League Championship Series, there is not necessarily any bad blood between the Tigers and the Rangers, given that they are from different divisions, but that doesn’t mean this series won’t be a battle.
These two teams are built very differently, as Detroit relies heavily on having their ace, Justin Verlander,  pitching three games in this series. Verlander was almost unbeatable this year, notching 24 wins and posting a sub-3 earned run average. He is the best pitcher in the league by far this year, and many of the Tigers playoff chances rest on his right arm. 
On the other side, Texas features a very strong rotation, one where there isn’t much discrepancy between their No. 1 starter, C.J. Wilson, and the rest of the rotation. In fact, the Rangers are much like the Yankees in that they rely on the offensive side of the ball to get a pick-up if the starting pitchers struggle. A big loss in this series for Detroit is outfielder Delmon Young, who strained an oblique muscle in the ALDS against the Yankees after hitting three home runs in that series. Without Young’s bat, the rest of the Tigers will have to step it up if they want to compete with a team as good as the Rangers.
In both series, I expect a highly emotional, heated battle. My prediction is for the Brewers to edge the Cardinals, and the Rangers over the Tigers. But we all know how my last predictions turned out. I can be absolute certain, however, that both of ther series will be must-watch television. Maybe Morgan will get a game-winning hit that sends the Brewers to the World Series? Maybe Chris Carpenter will strike him out and send the Cardinals there instead? 
Get ready for some memorable competition, baseball fans.

With Major League Baseball playoffs here, the announcement of regular-season awards is fast approaching. The 2011 season awards races ended in a close finish, so despite the uncertainties as to who will win, let’s make some predictions.
There is one race that I would be willing to bet big money on. It is pretty much unanimously decided among experts and fans that Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander will win the AL’s Cy Young Award. His 24–8 record, 2.40 earned run average (ERA), and 250 strikeouts were good enough to capture the pitcher’s Triple Crown. Never before has a pitcher won the pitcher’s Triple Crown and not won the Cy Young Award.
On that same note, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ ace, Clayton Kershaw, is favored to do the same in the National League. He boasts a 21–5 record, a 2.28 ERA, and 248 strikeouts, leading all NL pitchers in those categories. Despite his astounding numbers, experts still give Phillies aces Cliff Lee and Roy Halladay, and the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Ian Kennedy, an outside shot to win the NL’s Cy Young. However, given the National League pitcher’s Triple Crown and the mediocrity of the Dodgers’ offense, I predict Kershaw will edge out the rest of the pack. He could become the first Dodgers pitcher to win the award since closer Eric Gagne won it in 2003. Kershaw’s improved control on his curveball, plus the addition of an effective slider and a change-up to his pitching repertoire, have proven to be burdens on opposing hitters.
The Most Valuable Player race leaders are more ambiguous than the Cy Young races, with no clear-cut candidate in either league.
Before I begin presenting my predictions for the AL MVP race, I want to eliminate Justin Verlander from the discussion. A pitcher can legally win the race, and Verlander might win it this year, but I believe that a pitcher should not win this award. A starting pitcher only pitches once every five games. How can he be the most valuable player to his team when he is only playing in a fifth of the team’s games? Sure, he has 24 wins, but the Tigers won 95. First baseman Miguel Cabrera has to be considered more valuable than Verlander to the Tigers’ successes.
The American League MVP race is a close one. If I were one of the baseball writers who had a vote, I would vote for the Toronto Blue Jays’ Jose Bautista. He had an MLB-leading 43 home runs, a .302 batting average, and 103 runs batted in (RBIs). However, the player who I think will actually win the award is the Yankees’ Curtis Granderson. He has had a spectacular season at the plate. His 41 home runs and 119 RBIs were good for second and first in the AL, respectively. Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano could take votes away from Granderson, but I don’t think it will be enough to prevent him from winning the AL MVP.
The National League MVP race is a two-player race between the Los Angeles Dodgers’ outfielder Matt Kemp and the Milwaukee Brewers’ outfielder Ryan Braun. Although Braun might be favored for being on a playoff team, Kemp’s flirtation with the Triple Crown makes him the favorite and my prediction to win it. The last time an offensive player won the Triple Crown was in 1967, when Carl Yastrzemski won it with the Red Sox. Therefore with Kemp coming close to leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs, he should be the sure pick for the NL MVP. He concluded the season third, first, and first in those categories, respectively, with a .324 average, 39 home runs, and 126 RBIs. Additionally, he was remarkably close to being just the fifth 40–40 player ever — that is, 40 home runs and 40 steals in a season. He finished the season just one home run short. If Kemp wins the NL MVP, he would become the first Dodgers player to win it since Kirk Gibson in the magical 1988 season.
The 2011 season was a memorable one, and the playoffs look to be even more enthralling. But before I start worrying about the journey to the World Series, I am excited to see where the regular-season awards fall into place.

Carnegie Mellon researchers have released new findings claiming that the use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs, or “all-electric vehicles”) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with large battery packs today are actually more expensive in the long run. 
The research conducted by Jeremy Michaelek, a professor in the departments of mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy, and his colleagues also suggests that BEVs and PHEVs offer diminishing returns on social benefits per dollar spent as compared to conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and PHEVs with small battery packs. A summary of their findings was recently published in the  scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The researchers’ conclusions came after an in-depth assessment into a wide range of factors influencing the aggregate costs and environmental impact of BEVs, including greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, gas prices, the financial and air emissions costs of battery production, limitations of current battery technology, and more. 
Various degrees of these factors were also taken into consideration to account for best and worst case scenarios for BEV utilization. For example, the researchers indicated  that in a world with high gas prices, durable BEV batteries that had a lifetime of 12 years and were charged by a hydroelectric power grid were optimistic conditions for justifying the use of BEVs. In these scenarios, BEVs presented an aggregate premium (private ownership cost, air emissions damages costs, and oil premium costs combined) of about $3,000 and $5,000 lower than HEVs and gas-powered vehicles, respectively. 
However, a drastically different picture is painted in the pessimistic case: Assuming BEV batteries last just six years and are powered by electricity from a coal-fired power plant in a world with low gas prices, the net premium of a standard BEV jumps to over $50,000 more than that of HEVs and gas-powered vehicles.
In regard to air pollution costs specifically, while a BEV could reduce these costs by $100 compared to an HEV in the optimistic case, costs could also increase by as much as $5,000 in the pessimistic case.
Even in the researchers’ base case — with average gas prices, a typical power grid, and the use of batteries with a lifetime of 12 years — BEVs still presented a $20,000 net cost over HEVs and conventional vehicles. PHEVs with large battery packs were almost $10,000 more expensive.
“Current government policy provides larger subsidies for vehicles with larger battery packs, assuming that larger is better,” Michalek observed in a press release on cmu.edu, referring to the tax credit of up to $7,500 available for purchasers of electric vehicles. “While larger battery packs allow plug-in vehicles to drive longer distances on electric power instead of gasoline, they are also expensive and heavy, they are underutilized when the battery capacity is larger than needed for a typical trip, they require more charging infrastructure, and they produce more emissions during manufacturing.”
The typical American is not oblivious to the disadvantages of BEVs, either. While a 2006 poll indicated that over 50 percent of Americans would buy a hybrid vehicle, a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year in May revealed that 57 percent of Americans would never buy an all-electric car, no matter how high gas prices go. 
These views seemed to resonate with Benjamin Pious, a Carnegie Mellon junior studying business administration and psychology.
“I wouldn’t buy one of the ones you plug into the walls,” said Pious. “The thing with those cars is that they’re fundamentally impractical. You can’t actually get where you need to go with them. But [my dad’s Prius] is pretty marvelous. The gas mileage is actually considerably higher than what Toyota quotes.”
Though there are plans for a 2012 Prius PHEV model, Toyota Priuses fall for now under the category of conventional HEVs, since they never need to be plugged in to charge their built-in electric batteries. They are instead charged by the car’s gasoline engine and regenerative braking system, both of which allow for greater gas mileage. PHEVs, such as the Chevrolet Volt, include similar technologies, but also allow their batteries to be recharged via an electric outlet.
Researchers are scrutinizing BEVs such as the Tesla Roadster or Nissan Leaf, which have no fuel cells, fuel tanks, or internal combustion engine, and are powered solely by their internal battery packs. The researchers’ data offers greater context for properly analyzing the role BEVs should play in our society.

Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., passed away this past Wednesday in his family home in Palo Alto, Calif., seven years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. According to a statement released by his family, Jobs died peacefully. He was 56.
He was born in 1955 to a Syrian graduate student and his American girlfriend. Jobs was put up for adoption and raised by Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, Calif. He enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Ore., but dropped out after just one semester. He continued to audit courses, including a calligraphy course that Jobs claimed influenced the typefaces that would eventually exist in the Mac.
A spiritually motivated visit to India and a short stint with Atari eventually led Jobs to co-found Apple Inc. in 1976 at the age of 21. One year and one computer design later, Apple released the Apple II, which “reflected the first stirrings of Jobs’ keen instincts” with its “emphasis on ease of use and its stylish case design,” according to Time magazine, and eventually became one of the first highly successful mass-produced home computers. After an industry-wide sales slump in 1984, the former CEO of Pepsi-Cola and then-president of Apple John Sculley stripped Jobs of his decision-making powers, which eventually led to his resignation in 1985.
Jobs made use of his time away from Apple by founding NeXT Computer, a company that focused on computer workstations for higher education and business markets, as well as buying the animated film studio that would eventually become Pixar. Jobs referred to this period with Pixar and NeXT as “one of the most creative periods of my life” during his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University.
After rejoining the Apple team in 1996, Jobs officially became CEO of Apple Inc. in 2000. Since then, Apple has become one of the leading consumer-electronics companies with its widely successful iMac and MacBook systems. It has transformed the way popular culture listens to music (through the iPod) while also influencing the way it communicates and shares information (through the iPhone and iPad). 
Speaking about Jobs’ success, Time noted that “some leaders push innovations by being good at the big picture. Others do so by mastering details. Jobs did both, relentlessly.”
The loss of Steve Jobs has been felt across campus at Carnegie Mellon. “I elected this field specifically because of Steve Jobs,” Ben Nimmons, a master’s student in human-computer interaction (HCI), said in an email. “When asked why I was quitting my previous work and going back to school, I explained my interest ... as simply as I could: ‘I want to learn to do what Steve Jobs does naturally.’ ”
Katie Rivard, another master’s student in HCI, reflected on her childhood and Jobs’ impact on it. “One of my favorite childhood photos is of my sister and I at the computer table in our living room,” she explained in an email. “My sister is hamming it up for the camera; I’m focused on the screen. The computer is a Macintosh SE.”
A private funeral service was held last Friday. Jobs is survived by his wife, Laurene, and their two daughters and son, as well as one other child from a former relationship.

The Rashid Auditorium in the Hillman Center was packed this past Wednesday afternoon as students eagerly awaited a presentation titled “Alternate Anatomical Architectures: The Cadaver, the Comatose, and the Chimera.”
The lecture was given by Greek-born performance artist Stelios Arkadiou, better known as Stelarc. An honorary professor of arts and robotics at Carnegie Mellon, Stelarc has focused his work on technologically augmenting human physicality in a variety of ways. According to a press release on cmu.edu, “[Stelarc’s] visit to campus this week, which will include interchanges with students and an invitation-only performance at The Andy Warhol Museum, is indicative of the university’s growing fusion of art and science.”
“The body is a chimeric construct,” Stelarc said Wednesday, and to introduce technology into the body is to allow it “to perform as an extended operational system.” The development of this technology, he continued, is what defines the meaning of being human, especially in modern times.
Stelarc began the presentation with several examples of ongoing endeavors in his field. These included notions of what he called “flesh circulation” in the sense of circulating blood and organs around the body via transplants; “remotely connected bodies,” such as the case of phantom limbs; and “micro-robots,” which can be inserted into the bloodstream to internally maintain body functions. Each of these, Stelarc contended, requires a leap from conventional human design to something more effective that can be engineered with technology.
To show the extent of this technology’s impact, Stelarc showed a somewhat humorous NASA video depicting floating human-like robots colonizing Mars. While unlikely, Stelarc noted, advances in technology could make such scenes possible.
The second half of the artist’s lecture focused largely on some of his own unique experiments. During the ’80s, he put his own skin to the test by suspending his body in the air via hooks in his skin to simulate the effect of what he referred to as a “true 1-G gravitational field” on human skin, applying the feeling of gravity to all parts of the skin as a result of his body weight. 
As a humorous aside, he explained how he was once arrested for hanging by his skin, naked, over the streets of New York — not because it was inappropriate, but because he was apparently inflicting potential danger to the people below.
Stelarc later experimented with prosthetics, devising a third arm that could function independently of the other two; he demonstrated this with a clip of himself writing the word “evolution” with three hands at once. This and other experiments with artificial appendages led him to the idea of engineering biological implants.
The concept of implants led Stelarc to implant an ear in his own left arm. He explained that he wanted to concatenate pieces of the human body into a system that is “spatially separated but electronically connected.” The extra ear, a prosthesis made from soft tissue and cartilage from his rib cage, can be connected to a microphone using Wi-Fi technology. To an astounded audience, Stelarc pulled back his left sleeve and lifted his arm, displaying the extremely lifelike ear embedded in his flesh.
The final slides of the lecture showed some of the cutting-edge technology in development today, such as the tissue printer, a device that can mass-produce living human cells. With a resounding laugh, the artist mused that there will one day be “organs awaiting bodies.”
Stelarc’s presentation was generally well received by the audience. Paul Andre, a post-doctoral fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, commented on the lecture in an email, saying that while he enjoyed the entertaining lecture, “it would have been interesting to hear more of his thoughts on the ‘obsolete body’ and the themes and ideas behind his work.”

The basis of any organism, from the small bacteria that live in volcanoes to the higher-functioning entities that we humans are, is the principle of homeostasis. The Discovery Health website defines homeostasis as “a state of balance within the body.” In other words, homeostasis is the act of maintaining the internal environment of an organism’s body to achieve optimal function. But why is this state important at all for the functioning of the organism, and how exactly does it work?
The answer to the first question is simple. We do so many things each day, and each function is carried out by a specific organ as it collaborates with the other parts of the body that need a very specific environment to function correctly. Homeostasis maintains these different environments so that each organ can function at maximum potential. For example, the human body maintains an average temperature of 98.6˚F; according to Gizmodo, this is warm enough to prevent fungal infection, but cold enough that our bodies don’t maintain a metabolism that requires constant consumption of food.
Even the slightest change in our internal environments can lead to significant impact on our bodies. Body temperature is tightly regulated and has good reason to be. According to the website Biology Reference, “If core body temperature goes below 33˚C (91˚F), a person is likely to die of hypothermia, and if it goes above 42˚C (108˚F), death from hyperthermia is likely.” With such consequences, it makes sense that homeostasis is an important tool in our bodies.
Homeostasis is a complex process, with every system working in sync to ensure that the environment is “just right” for their function. But mostly, homeostasis is controlled by negative and positive feedback loops.
Negative feedback loops generally involve receptors which detect deviations from normality; a control center, such as the brain, which integrates all of the information fed to it by the receptors; and effectors which receive messages from the control center and induce a change to correct the initial deviation. An example of this can be found in the body’s regulation of blood pressure. When receptors in blood vessels detect an abnormal amount of resistance of blood flow against the vessel walls, they send a message to the brain, which in turn commands the heart to lower its blood flow rate and the blood vessels to increase in diameter, lowering blood pressure.
The body also uses positive feedback loops to maintain homeostasis. In this method, an abnormality in the body that disturbs homeostasis triggers a cascade of events that then results in the abnormality disappearing and causing homeostasis to be returned. A good example of this can be seen in blood clotting. When one is wounded, the blood vessels in the area break, causing the blood in them to flow out rapidly. Thrombin, a protein that aids in blood clotting, rushes in and initiates the production of more thrombin to speed up the clotting process. While negative feedback loops slow down a process such as heart rate in response to high blood pressure, these positive feedback loops correct an abnormality by speeding up a process like the production of blood clotting proteins.
Positive and negative feedback are just two methods our bodies are known to use to keep the intricate balance of homeostasis. A stable internal environment is highly important for our bodies’ functions. As such, homeostasis is a key component of of life function and is what enables us to do the multitude of activities we participate in daily.

Plant ecologists study circadian rhythms
Circadian rhythms explain numerous biological processes in both animals and plants that arise in 24-hour cycles. Adding to this list, environmental scientists at Lancaster University report that circadian rhythms also influence the rate at which plants emit isoprene, an important chemical that reacts with nitrogen in the atmosphere to form one of the leading sources of ground-level ozone. The researchers also show that incorporating these body clock-influenced isoprene emission rates into atmospheric computer models improves ozone predictions.

Children act like scientists when they play
Four-year-olds use science, according to recent MIT research. In the experiments, children were shown how to activate a toy in one of two ways: Activating the toy by connecting its various parts was demonstrated in a straightforward way to some children, while the demonstration was ambiguous for other children. Those shown the ambiguous way of turning on the toy were frequently successful in doing so, while the other children did not experiment with the parts at all. The study concluded that young children seek information by experimenting when they are uncertain while playing, but not when games are straightforward or simple.

Paper receipts may contain carcinogens
Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical known to cause cancer and disrupt reproductive systems, is commonly used to develop color in paper receipts. Over 80 receipts from seven U.S. cities were analyzed by the Wadsworth Center, a public health research center in New York. BPA absorbed through the skin travels directly into the bloodstream, while BPA that is ingested in food can be inactivated by metabolism. This finding is potentially significant, especially for bank tellers or other people who handle many receipts on a daily basis. Whether or not the BPA levels on receipts are enough to cause negative health effects is still unknown.

Eating chocolate found to be good for heart
British scientists recently gave the world another reason to consume chocolate: Eating chocolate is tied to lower risks of cardiovascular conditions, such as high blood pressure and strokes. The findings came from an analysis of seven previously conducted studies that included over 100,000 subjects. The team warned that even though chocolate may possibly improve health, overeating would cancel out these potential benefits. Risk of heart failure and diabetes were not found to be lowered by consuming chocolate.

Crises in human history driven by climate change
What causes human crises such as war, epidemics, and population decline? Climate change, says a controversial study from a group of Chinese researchers. Statistical correlations between Northern Hemisphere temperatures and 14 agricultural, socioeconomic, and demographic variables (such as war fatalities, grain prices, number of plagues) were used to make the claim. The study was limited to the years 1500–1800 CE, so whether these results can be applied today, when scientific advances have decreased society’s sensitivity to climate, is unclear.

Hormone influencing obesity identified in mice
Mice lacking the hormone orexin were found to be obese, even when they ate less than a control group of mice with normal orexin levels, according to a new study from doctors at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute. An important type of cell that helps burn fat was found to be improperly developed in the orexin-lacking mice. “Without orexin, mice are permanently programmed to be obese,” said Devanjan Sikdar, the author of the study. The team plans to investigate next whether orexin might be used as a therapy to treat or prevent obesity.

Last week, from Oct. 5 to Oct. 8, the second-annual VIA Music and New Media Festival brought together visual artists and musicians from both around town and around the world to Pittsburgh. Although VIA only began last year, it has already garnered major attention: The music website Resident Advisor named VIA one of the top 10 music festivals in the world in October. WRCT, one of VIA’s media partners, covered the festival throughout the week.
WEDNESDAY
Driving bass, striking projections, and sounds of synthesizers filled the brillobox on Wednesday night for the opener of the 2011 VIA Festival.
Performances by Pure Hype, Trans Am, and Brenmar drew quite a crowd, and despite being the only 21-and-up show at this year’s festival, it was the first show to sell out. This was certainly evident that night, with a packed house in Lawrenceville.
The night kicked off with a performance by Pittsburgh’s own Pure Hype. Projecting images of vintage technology and clips from old films, Pure Hype combined a rich visual experience with driven electronic music. Its performance grabbed everyone’s attention and was an exciting start to the evening.
Trans Am took the stage next, performing the entirety of its fourth album, Futureworld, which featured its distinctive use of the vocoder, a synthesizer that produces sounds from an analysis of speech input. The lights then turned toward the white canopy over the stage, illuminating the performance like a photographer’s umbrella. Thunder Horse Video, an art collective and production company, provided not only the stage setting but also the visual accompaniment to both Trans Am and Brenmar.
To end the evening, Brenmar, a Chicago-based DJ and producer, performed his set, fusing mainstream R&B and hip-hop with other musical styles. His set filled the dance floor with people moving and grooving to the sound of Brenmar’s mix.
While the evening was comprised of three groups of varying musical styles, VIA certainly did not disappoint, leaving guests eager for VIA’s main events.
THURSDAY
Thursday’s events began in Kresge Theatre in CFA with a lecture by David Borden, minimalist composer and founder of the synthesizer ensemble Mother Mallard’s Portable Masterpiece Company. Bordern mostly discussed his experiences working with Robert Moog, inventor of the Moog synthesizer, and the evolution of the Moog as an instrument. The speech lasted a little over an hour, with Borden fondly recounting the various musicians he has worked with over the last several decades.
After the lecture, the FRKWYS ensemble, a self-proclaimed “electronic jam band” including David Borden, Laurel Halo, Dan Lopatin, James Ferraro, and Samuel Godin, performed for the audience, marking their international live premiere. After Borden’s lecture, which included music samples from landmark electronic composers, it was hard to imagine that the quintet would play anything as vivacious or organic as the hour-long set it performed. The music that FRKWYS 7 created was rife with analog sounds and filled with repetitive, yet engaging soundscapes in which listeners could lose themselves.
The events for the night continued at the Rex Theater, where concert-goers had the opportunity to come and go as they pleased and enjoy audio-visual performances by a variety of artists such as Wolf Eyes, Four Tet, Battles, Daniel Iglasia, and Abstract Birds. While the venue was nearly empty when Walls, an electronic-based musical duo, and Matt Wellins, a visual artist, began the night’s performances, the room was packed by the time Battles closed the show at 2 a.m. While each artist could be labeled as “electronic,” each act was easily distinguishable, whether it be Wolf Eyes’ industrial aural assault or Battles’ frenetic cyborg rock.
Despite the stellar performances by each musician (except perhaps for Four Tet, whose set still lacks fully integrated transitions), the audience seemed somewhat detached from the night’s performance. While there was a substantial number of people on the dance floor, there was also a significant number of people talking over the music, especially during the first three sets. In addition, the bar area was nearly full the entire night, and there were always a couple of groups of people outside talking and smoking cigarettes.
While this could be perceived to be a negative reflection of the night’s events, it can also be considered to be an ever-present aspect of festivals. Drugs and community are just as ingrained in the festival culture as the performances themselves. Given the impressive talent VIA procured and the large turnout, Thursday should undoubtedly be considered a success not only for VIA’s promoters but for the wider music community in Pittsburgh.
FRIDAY
Those who arrived late on Friday may have begun their VIA experience on a strange note: two gentlemen with greasy hair and uncouth mouths blaring obscenities and expressing their love for America.
Extreme Animals is, according to VIA, “a rare cross-over between art and music culture,” but a concertgoer provided a more fitting analysis: “hipster nonsense.” Nevertheless, the audience chuckled along as the duo played noise versions of ’90s gems like Darude’s “Sandstorm” and Alice Deejay’s “Better Off Alone” to visuals that VIA described as a “bewildering maelstrom of contemporary American pathos,” but seemed pretty absurdist.
The highlight of the night was undoubtedly Light Asylum, a Brooklyn-based duo: its live sound was a welcome departure from its flat, monotonous studio recordings. Lead singer Shannon Funchess’ croon would seem awkwardly misplaced in any other setting, but here on stage at VIA it felt like a Depeche Mode concert: dark and evil, yet simultaneously airy and spacious. It seemed like the audience agreed: there, in the haze of the fog machines, in a sea of flannel and tight jeans, everyone felt like a kid of the ’80s.
Pink Skulls, a Philadelphia electronic outfit with a live component, wasn’t exactly inspiring: one band member sat cross-legged on the floor with a flight case of unknown contents, while the lead singer, in all his indifference, repeatedly stated over the microphone, “that wasn’t the best version of that song we’d ever played.” Araabmusik’s set would have been delightfully eclectic had it not been so loud — instead, it came across as brash and unnerving.
The night had its uplifting ups and its not-so-remarkable downs; it was better to leave early that night and instead save one’s energy for Saturday.
SATURDAY
VIA continued on Saturday with performances at the Broad Street Mall in East Liberty. Early on, the crowd was fairly small as the electronic production duo Ford & Lopatin began its set. Ford & Lopatin put on a good show, playing pretty relaxed electronic music accompanied by awesome visuals by Spencer Longo. As the night continued on and the sun went down, the crowds grew — by the time Austra, a Canadian new wave band, went on, the venue was nearly full.
While all of the artists were enjoyable, Austra stole the show on Saturday. Lead singer Katie Stelmanis looked like an angel standing in the middle of the stage, effortlessly singing fan favorites. Her back-up singers were particularly entertaining; it was impossible not to enjoy the show watching them. The crowd clearly enjoyed every second of it — everyone was dancing and singing along. Goat Helper, a visual artist based in Pittsburgh, put on the visuals for Austra. It was hard to look away from Stelmanis and the band, but it was well worth it to pay attention to the visual art.
The main event closed out with Underground Resistance. According to the VIA website, Underground Resistance “is probably the most militantly political outcropping of modern urban American techno.” This definitely proved to be true during its set. While plenty of people were into the set, others seemed to be getting a little tired — four days of VIA takes some serious endurance, after all.
Sutekh, a minimal electronic DJ from the San Francisco Bay Area, kicked off the after-party around 1 a.m. His set was fantastically danceable and the crowd seemed happy to head inside for some dancing after Underground Resistance’s set. Following Sutekh was Donato Dozzy, an Italian vinyl junkie. Dozzy took control of the crowd for over three hours, never missing a beat. At times it seemed that the crowd was running on the music alone, since no one had any energy left after three continuous nights of music; however, everyone kept dancing well into the morning, soaking in the success that was the VIA Music and New Media Festival.

Returning for its second year, the PIX Indy Comics Expo was held this weekend on the top floor of Guardian Storage in the Strip District. The venue seemed odd at first, but as soon as the elevator door opened on the sixth floor, visitors could understand why it was chosen. The large, open space was perfect for the event: high ceilings, plenty of natural light, exposed brick walls, and beautiful wood floors.
The sense of community among artists was the first thing that stood out upon entering the Expo. The artists were hanging out at each other’s tables, promoting their friends and catching up. Some even had their children with them. The Expo was as much a social event for them as an opportunity to sell their work.
Bill Boichel, the owner of The Copacetic Comics Company and one of the organizers of PIX, has been involved in the Pittsburgh art and comic scene for a while. According to Boichel, PIX is an expo designed to promote “creator-owned comics” and a way for independent publishers and self-published artists to promote their work.
The artists were a mixture of both local and national artists. There were even a few Carnegie Mellon students and alumni with tables set up, including Juan Fernandez, a senior linguistics major, and Lizzee Soloman. Soloman, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2011 with degrees in fine arts and Hispanic studies, is now an artist in the Pittsburgh area. According to Soloman, her life is all about self-motivation and balance. She said that comics are the perfect medium for her art because “you can make as many copies as you want and go around selling them at various expos,” allowing her to “continue to produce artwork and still pay the bills.”
The artists were also diverse in age, ranging from current college students to artists who have been in the business for more than 25 years. Wayno, a freelance writer and illustrator based in Pittsburgh, has been involved with comics since the 1980s. He began self-publishing his work and then moved around with various alternative publishers. According to Wayno, the comic scene in Pittsburgh is strong, and it is a good place for him to work as a freelancer.
Many of the artists who were at the Expo are based in Pittsburgh, and some are nationally and internationally recognized for their work. According to Andy Scott, a Pittsburgh-based illustrator, “There is definitely a strong [comic] scene here,” and there are more cartoonists here than in most of the cities he’s visited. With places like Copacetic Comics and the Toonseum (one of only three museums in the United States dedicated to cartoons), there are plenty of opportunities for artists and illustrators to share their work in the community.
Editor’s note: Juan Fernandez is a staffwriter for The Tartan.

The Good Person of Setzuan by Bertolt Brecht, directed by the internationally acclaimed Peter Kleinert, opened to a crowded room bursting with enthusiasm and anticipation. Energy radiated from the stage as the actors prepared themselves for the performance, deeply involved in their pre-show warm-ups. The public nature of this activity — which usually takes place somewhere backstage, safe from the audience’s view — made the audience question if in fact this was a part of the production, setting the tone for the rest of the play. Setzuan was not a typical play in any sense, and this unique production certainly made it more than unusual.
The story follows a young prostitute, Shen Te (senior drama major Ava DeLuca-Verley), who, in the minds of the Three Gods, is the only representation of goodness still remaining on Earth. The play focuses on her identity crisis as she battles friends who attempt to take advantage of her “goodness.” The story looks at the concept of being good, leaving the audience with food for thought. To what degree does goodness exist? If it does not exist, what does that mean for humanity?
The play places a large emphasis on breaking the so-called “fourth wall,” or having the characters within the play, and the actors themselves, interact with the audience. For instance, when a new character would step into the story, the actor would introduce him or herself to the audience and explain the character he or she was to embody for the rest of the play. It was an atypical and welcomed aspect of the play. Nick Abele, a senior design major, said during intermission, “The CMU drama department always puts on great twists to the stories and adds a new style which makes it enjoyable.”
The costume, lighting, and set design were brilliant and truly gave the show a distinct flavor that enabled the audience to relate to a story written in the late 1930s. For instance, the Three Gods, played by Lucia Rodrique, Amanda Thorp, and Grey Henson, all senior drama majors, were clad in the most unusual and intriguing garb one would imagine three gods to wear. They boasted enormous black trench coats with outrageously tall black platform leg-high boots, the type that Gene Simons would be jealous of. Grey Henson’s character deviated from the other two and donned Alexander McQueen-inspired platforms, similar to the ones Lady Gaga wore in her “Bad Romance” music video.
The costuming was not the only component that made this production a pleasure for the viewer. The setting was a true oddity that one could not help but love. There was an industrial feel to the set, which was a disorganized, yet organized, mess. Set changes were made directly on the stage, making the audience feel like part of the interworkings of the production.
The musical performances were adequate, providing the audience with a nice break from dialogue. The implementation of electric guitar and  keyboard made the music much more vibrant and woke up anyone in the audience who may have been dozing off just a tad — it was an almost three-hour performance, after all.
The nuanced feel of the production proves that when it comes to theater, the success of the production is dependent upon the interpretations adopted by the director, the designers, and the actors. The show was magnificent on a superficial level, but it also had incredible themes and a wonderful takeaway message for the audience relating to goodness in humanity.
In fact, at the end of this unorthodox play (and production) the audience is literally called upon to be the judge. It is left to brainstorm a resolution, a satisfactory ending that it feels comfortable with.
Making the audience work a little? A brilliant move and the ultimate manifestation of audience interaction of which Brecht himself would have approved.

At first glance when you step off the elevator on the seventh floor of the Andy Warhol Museum, your eyes will widen. You have arrived at 5,500 square feet of gallery space decked out in bright blue, red, and gold. The likenesses of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and a plethora of other Marvel and DC characters that are iconic heroes of American childhood adorn the rooms. A viewer feels like he or she is looking into a separate world, as though these characters are part of their country’s physical history, captured in beautifully detailed gouache paintings and pencil drawings.
These glorious pieces are the work of Alex Ross, an artist who revolutionized the comic book industry. In [ITAL]Heroes and Villains[ITAL], the first-ever museum exhibit of his work, visitors can see over 134 pieces by the artist, spanning from crayon drawings by a 4-year-old Ross to the huge superhero and villain portraits by the matured artist. Ross is extremely inspired by the works of Andy Warhol and Norman Rockwell — thus, work from these artists, along with several other artists, is exhibited alongside Ross’ own. These inspirations are sometimes illustrated in the form of a pseudo-series of a character. For example, depictions of Uncle Sam can be seen in the work of Rockwell, Ross, and Warhol, highlighting the interplay of these artists and creating an interesting distinction between their styles.
The single portraits of heroes and villains appear to transcend the world that we live in. They illustrate the intense struggles of power, loyalty, and achievement that are common in the world of comic books. In this way, Ross has achieved something unique: He has epitomized the internal conflicts of the everyday man into a super-world of imagination and glory. He has also illustrated the darker forms of human nature, represented through bitter portraits of villains like the Joker. Alex Ross perfectly depicts the underlying emotions and disturbances found in these characters as if they were drawn from true observation.
The rooms that feature these depictions also include several glass table displays of old Marvel comics and Ross' sketches. There are cases containing his collection of the Batman, Iron Man, and Spiderman mask models, as well as a television playing old superhero shows. Perhaps the most impressive works shown by Alex Ross are the large horizontal group portraits, one of all the heroes, and a similar piece depicting the villains, much like a strange yearbook photo. These extremely detailed pieces reveal the interplay between characters and allow them to step into our own lives, a truly amazing feat that must be experienced in person.  
The Alex Ross exhibit will run until Jan. 8, and is free to enter with a Carnegie Mellon ID. Whether you have a passion for comics or not, this display will awe any viewer.

Emily Wobb, a junior art student at Carnegie Mellon, opened her first solo show at The Frame last Friday to a small crowd of friends and curious passersby. Her bright, experimental paintings alongside handmade plush whale sharks and interactive coloring pages lent The Frame a light, fun air not usually found within the sterile white walls of the art gallery.
“My work focuses on experimenting with different media,” Wobb said. “I painted one of the whale sharks with silk paint, and silk-screened a few more.” Mixed media was certainly a theme among Wobb’s work. Many of the paintings were made using a variety of methods, including stencil, Sharpie, print, and paint. Three “paintings” on the floor were made from 3-D canvasses shaped like pyramids, which were constructed by hand. Even the prints, pictures of veggies hidden inside a fridge in the back room, encouraged visitors to make their own mixed-media work by coloring in pictures with Sharpies, crayons, paint pens, and markers.
The experimentation found throughout Wobb’s work is what both grounds her as an undergraduate still trying to figure out her niche in the art world and what makes her work so simple and refreshing. There doesn’t seem to be a groundbreaking concept behind her work besides that of simple, innocent curiosity. “I’m influenced by arbitrary and absurd content and how I can juxtapose seemingly random imagery/objects together to allude to a narrative,” Wobb said in an email.
In other words, Wobb fits random images together coherently and forces her viewers to figure out why it works. Why does a group of possums huddled around a bowl of soup make so much sense when it’s presented as a work of art, when it would be so strange sitting in your kitchen? Similarly, why are we not disturbed when a giant stuffed whale shark has brightly colored images of ramen printed along its body?
From this “absurd” experimentation, though, comes small moments of conceptual brilliance. One of the whale sharks had a transparent “skin” that showed a belly full of stuffed garbage bags, some sewn into the shapes of starfish, some simply tied together and thrown in. In the midst of these objects is a baby whale shark — or a small fish, depending how you see it. Molly Swartz, a junior in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program, wondered whether the animal was “pregnant, or had consumed its young.” This juxtaposition of very different possible interpretations showcases the power of ambiguity in art.
Wobb’s work is a testament to the power of The Frame and a vote of confidence for future shows. See more of her work at emilywobb.com, and be sure to stop by at the next Frame event to see what’s being made at Carnegie Mellon.

Wilco refuses to resign itself to irrelevancy. Some critics have labeled the band washed up or have given the band the ugly title of “dad rock.” However, the group’s latest album, The Whole Love, revives its stagnant sonic attributes and dismisses its dreadful previous effort, Wilco (the album).
The experimental “Art of Almost” starts off the album with a bang. It struts a kraut-rock groove similar to previous jams “Bull Black Nova” and “Spiders,” but lacks their biting, grinding edge. Yet, as the track’s glitch appeal begins to wear off, Nels Cline, Wilco’s lead guitarist, hints at one of his premier guitar solos. It slowly builds, and his eventual feature is reminiscent of “Impossible Germany” and “At Least That’s What You Said.”
Characteristic of the band’s recent albums, this collection of tracks does not break any new frontiers in music. However, there is a sense throughout the tracks of exasperation, of the subdued dissatisfaction and unrequited love that defined Wilco’s previous albums, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born. 
Jeff Tweedy has a reputation for intertwining desperation and loneliness within lyrics and combining them with playful melodies. In “Dawned on Me,” an upbeat romp, Tweedy slurs, “I’ve been taken/ by the sound/ My own worries/ and voices in my head” before the band rolls into the quick refrain, seemingly dismissing the statement as a temporary psychotic mania. “Born Again” has Tweedy coolly singing “Loneliness postponed/ Mine eyes deceiving glory/ I was born to die alone” before moving into a section that features Cline’s guitar for nearly two minutes.
Both Sky Blue Sky and Wilco (the album) were filled with primarily sparse tracks — a significant shift away from one of Wilco’s most critically lauded albums, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The Whole Love seems to bridge the three defining stages of its eight-album career. The album clearly exhibits the country-folk roots from its earliest releases, A.M. and Being There; blends in the psychotic sonic attributes of Yankee and A Ghost; and tops it off with the maximally polished production values of Sky Blue Sky.
The band’s folk roots are never more present than in the excellent closer, “One Sunday Morning.” The track is a light folk-romp in which the narrator is the son of an over-imposing father. Though lengthy at 15 minutes, the song never drags along like “Bull Black Nova” and “Spiders” do at times. In “One Sunday Morning,” percussive drumsticks and lingering steel guitar weave around the main guitar, whose melody rises and falls willfully. The masterful piano pieces garnish any slow points, resulting in a track that is almost unequaled in Wilco’s discography. Tweedy eventually croons the track’s pivotal message: “I miss/ being told how to live/ What I learned without knowing/ How much more I owe than I can give.”
The Whole Love is the result of a band comfortable enough with its past to utilize the good aspects of previous experimentation. As a result, The Whole Love is a concoction of their past albums — an album that deserves better than the label of “dad rock.”

Pittsburgh doesn’t have a music scene, or so I’m told. Apparently Pittsburgh also doesn’t have anywhere good to eat, anything good to see, or anything else worth your while. Therefore you should hurry up and finish school, leave Pittsburgh, and never come back. But is this really true?
This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the 2011 VIA Music and New Media Festival. Four days and over 40 hours of music later, I’m starting to think that my peers might be wrong. As I left a relatively full dance floor at 4:30 a.m. after four hours of continuous, frenetic dancing and 40 hours of festival-attending, I couldn’t stop smiling. My back, my legs, and every other part of my body were in pain, but it didn’t matter. I was in a state of bliss.
I know techno isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but VIA brought so much more than bleeps and bloops. I’m not going to bother with a review of the individual acts and artists — go read the feature article, if that’s what you’re interested in. I want to make it clear that there is a music scene in Pittsburgh. It’s not about having a techno or hip-hop scene; it’s about the atmosphere. For so many Pittsburghers, it’s not about the genre of music; it’s about the quality of music. While at VIA, I saw a five-year-old girl dancing like there was no tomorrow. I wish I saw more of my friends doing the same.
A lot of unique, creative acts are coming through Pittsburgh; you just need to keep your eyes and ears open. WRCT and Pillbox both keep a well-curated list of events on their respective websites. Take a look, take a chance, and go exploring. You might find something you like.
If you’re still not completely blown away by the variety of music here in Pittsburgh, stop complaining and get involved. Join the Activities Board and get your favorite artist to come to town. Join WRCT and play your favorite tunes on the air. At Carnegie Mellon, we’re given so many opportunities to materialize our dreams — you just have to go take advantage of them.

100 YEARS AGO — Oct. 12, 1911
The Tartan half-apologizes for an article on “The Virtues of Raisin Bread” that ran the previous week. The piece, which “takes up the kneading problem, in a very thorough manner,” was apparently inserted by the printers when the newspaper’s editors failed to supply enough copy for the issue.
50 YEARS AGO — Oct. 11, 1961
Trying to maintain enthusiasm among their younger peers, two Carnegie Tech honor societies offer the first-years a test on the school’s songs, cheers, traditions, and history. The results will also be used as the honor societies’ acceptance criteria. Carnegie Mellon students have always been academically focused, but perhaps this is a bit much.
25 YEARS AGO — Oct. 7, 1986
A Pittsburgh city ordinance leads Carnegie Mellon to upgrade fire alarms in its campus buildings. The new system includes information sharing from pull handles, smoke detectors, sprinklers, hoses, and fire doors across the university’s dorms and apartments. Morewood residents have been regretting that decision ever since.
10 YEARS AGO — Oct. 8, 2001
It’s apparently a loud fall on campus, as an article in The Tartan explains that Student Affairs has received an increased number of noise complaints recently. Among the offenders: a rally and teach-in following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the Wats:on? Festival’s outdoor concert. WRCT DJs, who play music outside on Fridays, haven’t heard a peep.
FIVE YEARS AGO — Oct. 9, 2006
Fourth-year architecture student Benjamin Saks is honored by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. Saks had glanced out of a window the previous February and had seen a police officer wrestling alone with an escaped Florida drug dealer. Saks helped restrain the criminal, but not before getting shot in the hand.
ONE YEAR AGO — Oct. 11, 2010
Four weeks before the midterm elections, Glee star Matthew Morrison makes a quick trip to campus to speak in favor of Democratic candidates Dan Onorato and Joe Sestak. “As young Americans,” he said, “we can speak louder than any one individual voice.” He didn’t specify whether that voice should be Auto-Tuned or not, though.

Only a few hours into my stay in Korea and I was already sweating. No, it wasn’t my concern over starting a new job, nor was it my apprehension at moving to a country halfway across the globe. It was the ddeokbokki.
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon in 2009 with a degree in English and history, I decided to pick up my life and try my hand as an English teacher in South Korea. At the time, I knew almost nothing at all about Korea and its culture, people, language, or food. I wanted to see the world, and I had never been to Asia. The prospect of desperately searching for an offer in the black hole that was the American job market wasn’t especially appealing to me. Plus, I’d spent a semester as a junior in Barcelona and loved the experience of living abroad. “How different could it really be?” I thought.
As it turns out, I had almost no idea what I had gotten myself into. Nearly everything about living and working in Korea required a sizeable adjustment for me. Overcoming the red pepper spice found in what seemed like all Korean dishes was only the beginning. I had to get used to living completely on my own for the first time in my life. I experienced what it was like to stand at the front of a classroom rather than sitting at the back of one. I learned how difficult it can be to get around in a place where almost no one speaks English. Things I took for granted at home — ordering delivery or taking a shirt to the dry cleaners — became protracted events for which I had to work up a steady amount of courage and dedication.
And yet, here I am, more than two years since my arrival, still proudly calling myself a Korean resident. If you had asked me after the first six months of my stay if I would be here this long, I would have probably laughed in your face. So what am I still doing here? The short answer is this: Korea has grown on me in a serious way.
There are so many things I love about this country. Despite my old aversion to eating spicy food, I’ve come to love Korean food for its variety (it turns out that not everything has red pepper in it) and peculiarity (have you ever tried eating octopus that is still squirming when you put it in your mouth?). Korean nightlife is fantastic; there is no such thing as “closing time,” and you are never more than a few meters away from a bar, or at least a convenient store stocked with beer, soju, and munchies. The Korean landscape is extremely varied, and Seoul boasts a remarkable blend of old (think 1,000-year-old palaces) and new (think modern skyscrapers). Korean people have been, in general, extremely warm and welcoming to me as a foreigner, albeit in their own unique way. Strangers approach me randomly on the street to say “hello” and little children stare at me like they’ve seen some kind of giant white ghost.
Living and exploring in Korea is significantly cheaper in relation to the United States. Also, finding a job has never been a problem here. In fact, I’ve already had the chance to be a middle school teacher, professional writer, and wildly inconsistent travel blogger. I am now working as a professor at a university. If that isn’t upward mobility, I don’t know what is.
There are also many things that frustrate me about this country. Taxi drivers are nuts. Some elderly women push and shove other pedestrians with reckless abandon. Riding the subway during rush hour is more akin to trying to stuff fifty clowns into a Volkswagen than any kind of public transportation I’ve ever seen. Learning Korean is hard, although that might be more attributable to my lack of effort than any inherent linguistic flaws. Plus, I’ve still yet to find a place that will serve me a real deli sandwich.
The longer I’ve been here, the more I’ve realized that these are the kinds of challenges inherent to the life of an expat. Living in Korea has taught me more about myself than I ever could have imagined, and I really do believe that I’ve grown an immeasurable amount as a person, a professional, and a student of the world. Maybe that sounds corny. Maybe it is. But at least now I can eat ddeokbokki without sweating ... usually.

Kicking off a weekend of automobile-themed movies, Who Killed the Electric Car? is a 2006 documentary about the career of the electric car. Narrated by Martin Sheen (The West Wing), the documentary looks into the creation, commercialization, and subsequent downfall of the electric car in the 1990s while researching the roles that the oil industry, government, and car manufacturers played in that process. Fun fact: The film’s sequel, Revenge of the Electric Car, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on Earth Day this year.

Cars 2 follows the racing car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his tow truck friend, Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), as they traverse the globe for McQueen to compete in the World Grand Prix. However, their travels go awry when Mater unwittingly gets caught up in international espionage. The film was Pixar’s worst-reviewed film to date and was its lowest-grossing film in North America since A Bug’s Life; however, the film did rank number one its opening weekend and grossed over $550 million worldwide.

William S. Dietrich II, the former steel executive who recently announced a donation of $265 million to Carnegie Mellon, died this past Thursday, according to the John A. Freyvogel Inc. funeral home in Shadyside. The cause of death was given as complications from cancer. Dietrich was 73 years old.
Born in Pittsburgh, Dietrich made his fortune by transforming his father’s small steel warehouse and distribution business, Dietrich Industries, into the nation’s largest manufacturer of light metal framing for the construction industry. When Dietrich Industries was sold to Worthington Industries in 1996, Dietrich remained a director until 2008.
Dietrich was an active member of the Pittsburgh community; he served on the trustee boards for a variety of local institutions, including Carnegie Mellon, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, the UPMC Health System, and the University of Pittsburgh. 
Dietrich was also an author of many political and global history books. His recent works include In the Shadow of the Rising Sun: The Political Roots of an American Economic Decline and Eminent Pittsburghers, a collection of his essays. Before his death, he had been writing another book with the working title American Recessional: The U.S. Decline and the Rise of China.
Dietrich’s position on the boards of both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh reflected his commitment to fostering higher education in the Pennsylvania region. He also supported local universities with substantial monetary contributions.
On Sept. 7, Dietrich announced that he would be making a $265 million donation to Carnegie Mellon in the form of a charitable remainder trust. “This university puts Pittsburgh on anybody’s world map of great research cities,” Dietrich said at the celebration of his donation in September. “Brilliant people come here as students and faculty, and their presence in our community adds something extraordinary.”
University President Jared Cohon reflected on the event. “Since we all knew his days were numbered, the day of the announcement of his gift was not only a day to say thank you, but it was a way to say goodbye as well,” he said.
Near the end of September, Dietrich also announced his donation of $125 million to the University of Pittsburgh, the single largest gift in that school’s history. He was an alumnus of Pitt, having earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science there.
Each university renamed one of its academic colleges in honor of one of Dietrich’s parents. 
Carnegie Mellon renamed its School of Humanities and Social Sciences after his mother, Marianna Brown Dietrich, while Pitt’s School of Arts and Sciences will be renamed the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, after Dietrich’s father.
Dietrich is survived by his daughter, Anne Elizabeth Diemer, and nephew Kenneth Cascarella.
A private service will be held for Dietrich’s immediate family.
Cohon sent out an official school-wide announcement Friday afternoon giving his condolences and expressing his sympathies. “We have lost a great friend. May he rest in peace,” Cohon said in the email.

According to this year’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, which details campus crime and fire statistics over the past three years, Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus has faced more than 380 crimes since 2008, with 100 of them happening in 2010 alone. 
In contrast, Carnegie Mellon’s campuses in Qatar and Los Angeles have had three crimes between the two of them over the past three years, while the campuses in Australia, Silicon Valley, and New York have had no crimes since 2008.
Members of the university community familiar with the report, such as the Carnegie Mellon Police or students and faculty who have spent time abroad, speculate that a lot of the differences in the amount of crime are related to the location, setting, and size of the different campuses. “The other campuses are essentially buildings or small venues, and don’t compare in size or population to the main campus, which explains the higher number of crimes, incidents, or activity [at the main campus],” said Thomas Ogden, chief of University Police.
The Pittsburgh campus, with almost 11,000 students and spanning 144 acres, is significantly larger than most of its satellites. The New York campus, on the other hand, has only 110 students and is contained within a single building. So even though the city of New York may have a higher crime rate than the city of Pittsburgh does, this is not reflected in the comparison.
However, some of Carnegie Mellon’s satellites are actually bigger than the Pittsburgh campus in both area and population. For example, the crime statistics for the Qatar campus include the entire 2,500-square-acre Education City campus, not just Carnegie Mellon’s 460,000-square-foot facility on the campus. The fact that the Qatar campus has only faced three crimes in the past three years cannot be explained by size alone.
Christian Reyes, a junior information systems and human-computer interaction double major, attributed this phenomenon to a combination of high security and a friendly atmosphere. “Education City is gated and has security at every entrance. An Education City ID is required for entry,” she said. “There are also lots of guards and cameras — a big contrast with the Pittsburgh campus.”
Within the gated community, Reyes also pointed out how Qatari students have a very high-trust culture: “I was very shocked when I was studying there to find students leaving their laptops, backpacks, even purses out in the open unattended while in class or eating lunch. It is very common for a study group to leave almost all their belongings, leave the campus entirely to get food, and come back an hour later,” she said. “Everyone knows everyone. The friendly atmosphere and the building combined make it hard for someone or something to go unnoticed.”
Proximity to other urban developments can also affect crime rates. Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus, for instance, is located in a relatively suburban setting, whereas the main campus is in the middle of a large city. “Carnegie Mellon’s proximity to Forbes and Craig Street comes with the downsides,” remarked Todd Sedano, director of the campus’s software engineering program. “[The Silicon Valley campus’s] nearest Apple store is nine miles away.” 
Although the Silicon Valley campus is also within a gated community like Qatar, Sedano believes that the small number of people around is a big factor. 
“Someone could come onto the campus with the intent of misdoing and our statistics wouldn’t be as spotless,” he said. “I feel fortunate that this hasn’t happened. Every year we expect something untoward, but so far it hasn’t happened yet.”
Although Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus may not have some of the security advantages of its satellites, such as being a gated community or located in a suburban setting, Ogden pointed out the campus is still very safe. “Due to recent action by the police department, we have seen a decrease in crime and an increase in the number of arrests for crimes committed and a higher clearance rate,” Ogden said. “Our ultimate goal is always to decrease crime through education, awareness and enforcement.”

With the academic year now in full swing, Carnegie Mellon’s Undergraduate Student Senate hosted “Student Senate Week,” a series of events aimed to increase visibility and awareness of Senate within the student body.
Activities began last Tuesday with Senators greeting fellow students with free donuts and asking them to write down any suggestions or improvements they had for Senate or campus. The following day on the Cut, students who provided these sorts of comments or concerns were given the opportunity to pie a Senator. These activities led up to Thursday’s event, where University President Jared Cohon gave a speech to a Senate session. The purpose behind these events was “to get to know what the campus wants,” said Nancy Brown, an H&SS Senator and junior in ethics, history, and public policy. 
The Senators’ increased focus on student body awareness and visibility may be a response to past criticisms of the organization, which have included a lack of member dedication and transparency, as well as not accurately reflecting the wishes of the student body. 
The problems that plague Student Senate’s reputation were acknowledged by Senator Amy Quispe, a junior computer science major. She stated that the organization “usually doesn’t fill all of our Senate seats.” 
But the publicity efforts appeared to be fairly successful, with Breed Hall nearly filled for the beginning of Cohon’s speech.
“This semester started off with a bang,” remarked Cohon, who commented on the Bill Dietrich donation, the university’s new campus in Rwanda, and having Carnegie Mellon ranked 21st of the world’s top 200 universities by The Times of London.
The remainder of Cohon’s speech was devoted to discussing his goals for Carnegie Mellon during the final years of his term as president, outlining a “global vision for the Carnegie Mellon brand.”
Cohon described his hopes for Carnegie Mellon’s satellite campuses as well as future initiatives for the expansion of Brain and Learning Initiative. He also discussed future renovations to the university’s athletic facilities and a potential foundation to assist recent graduates who are starting their own businesses.
At the conclusion of Cohon’s talk at the session, a member of the audience asked why the university’s budget was not completely open, in a fashion similar to the student activities budget. In the theme of transparency and openness, Cohon suggested that a presentation could be given to Student Senate, and by proxy the student body, on the university’s finances.
The meeting then got down to regular business, featuring presentations by the Senate’s Special Allocation Committee and official Senate subcommittees. Senators also approved boards created for this year’s sessions.
On the topic of visibility, Quispe said that students have three options to voice their concerns to a Senator. They should first talk to a Senator for their specific school, but students may also come to Senate body meetings, where there is a specific time dedicated to hearing student concerns and suggestions. Finally,  students may also attend committee meetings, where suggestions and comments on that group’s specific topic may be heard.
Student Senate Week concluded with a free barbecue at the Fence last Friday, along with drinks and desserts at Saturday’s football game.
This week of events served to publicize the Student Senate as an organization and attempted to gain recognition among students. Whether these efforts will allow the Student Senate to overcome its past criticisms, however, remains to be seen.

Geoffrey Burns, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major and prospective physics double major, died on Thursday, Sept. 29, as a result of a car accident outside the Fort Pitt tunnel on Sept. 18. He is survived by his father, Richard Burns, and his sister, Samantha Burns Brantley. A memorial service was held last Saturday at Burns’ high school in California. Several of his friends and a member of the Division of Student Affairs attended. 
According to Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, the electrical and computer engineering department has created a memorial that will be displayed in Hamerschlag Hall, and a further celebration of Burns’ life will be arranged on campus in the coming weeks.
Friends say that Burns was incredibly curious and had diverse interests. On campus, he was involved in fencing; board game club; rocketry club; Atheists, Humanists, Agnostics; and Pugwash.
“He was the sort of person that really just wanted to know everything that he could,” said sophomore materials science and engineering major Daniel Terwilliger, who was Burns’s housemate. “If there was something that he didn’t know how it worked and it was remotely interesting, he would go and try to figure out how it worked.”
Senior mechanical engineering major John Howland agreed. “We could hold conversations for hours and hours, and often did, on such a wide variety of topics. He was so knowledgeable about such a range of things.”
Howland said that Burns loved challenging himself. “You certainly saw that, for example, in the board game club,” he said. “Not just trying new games because they were fun — there’s lots of people there who do that — but trying to be really good at them, and succeeding.”
Despite his wide range of activities, Burns always made time for his friends. “What took him the longest on every homework I’ve ever seen him do is explaining it to me,” said junior social and decision sciences major Maddison Brumbaugh. “He never left because he got frustrated.”
“He was always selfless about [helping friends],” Howland said. “He spent so much time with me on Physics III.”
According to friends, Burns was a brilliant student. “He was a procrastinator like the rest of us,” Terwilliger said, “but when he stopped procrastinating, he finished whatever he was working on really quickly.”
“He had a phenomenal ability to hear material once and not just understand it but retain it,” Howland said.
Brumbaugh agreed, saying that Burns never had to take a single note in the classes they took together. “I think he was the best of Carnegie Mellon nerds,” she said.
“You can’t really encapsulate someone’s life in a two-sentence sound byte,” Howland said. But he had an idea of one sentence that described Burns well: “You would have liked him.”

Second-year students in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture are currently building  a substantial structure that is meant to act as a shelter at the Fence. This structure is slated to be completed on Monday. The second-year studio project, which started at the beginning of the semester, aims to teach collaboration, construction, and environmentally friendly practices.
Students began the project by working in groups of six trying to conceptualize, as their assignment’s instructions put it, a “small structure to shelter students at ‘the Fence.’ ” They later discovered, however, that they would have to combine their efforts into a single, cohesive space. “Not only do you have to design as a team, but you have to construct, manage, and present as an entire studio,” said Kim McDonald, a sophomore architecture major working on the project. 
In terms of cohesiveness, associate professor of architecture and project coordinator Kai Gutschow stated that the students felt a “bit of an emotional resistance” to having the design become unified. “But I’m completely fine with that,” he said. “If it’s hard, then you’re learning something.”
Since the project began, students have been working in the studio, woodshop, and most recently outside between the CFA parking lot and the tennis courts. The assignment to create a full-scale structure is new to the students, and it presents a set of obstacles. “There’s an unimaginable gap between hot-glued basswood models and an eight-foot-tall inhabitable structure,” McDonald said.
Gutschow noted that the faculty were able to stress the importance of branching out from the studio, where it can be easy to become caught up in extravagant design. “When we make a drawing or a small chipboard model, we’re almost fibbing to ourselves as to how things will work together,” he said. He explained that building a full-scale model forces students to focus on such details.
The project also includes plans to go beyond the Fence. According to Gutschow, construction company DCK International “plans to have one of the structures dissembled and transported to their corporate campus in Large, Pa.” As for the others, the students will continue working on them, and Gutschow hopes that they can be displayed as public works of art around Pittsburgh. 
According to Gutschow and McDonald, the project will allow the School of Architecture to branch out to the larger campus community. The project seems to have already attracted other students’ attention. “It’s very interesting to see their work outside like this,” junior business major Stephanie Gill said.

The 17th annual Andy Awards celebrated the achievements of the Carnegie Mellon staff in McConomy Auditorium last Friday.
Every year, the awards are presented to staff members and teams who have shown outstanding performance in any of six categories: dedication, innovation, commitment to students, university citizenship, culture, and community contributions. “The staff has so much to do with everything that happens at this university. It’s not too much to say that we are what we are because of our staff. We are all very grateful for all that you do,” President Jared Cohon said at the ceremony.
This year’s awards were presented to Amy Wells for dedication, Renee Camerlengo for commitment to students, Steve Audia for innovation, Madelyn Miller for culture, John Lanyon for university citizenship, and Stanley Krowitz for community contributions.
Amy Wells works in the history department, Renee Camerlengo is the assistant dean of Student Affairs, Steve Audia is the Entertainment Technology Center’s technology manager, Madelyn Miller is the director of Environment Health and Safety, John Lanyon is the tutor coordinator of Academic Development, and Stanley Krowitz is in the University Center’s administration.
The community contributions category was added this year to recognize people who are not faculty but have greatly contributed to the campus community, according to Victoria Bushmire, the university events coordinator.
“Its goal is to recognize the people who are in the shadows, maybe the person who serves lunch in the Schatz Dining Room or maybe the person who sweeps the floors of our labs or classrooms — someone who isn’t often recognized, someone who kind of stays behind the scenes,” she said.
Nominees for the awards can be any staff member of the university. This year 39 members of the staff were nominated, including 20 individuals and three teams. To be nominated, staff members must show dedication to their jobs, provide guidance and assistance to students, demonstrate creativity and imagination in finding solutions, build a positive and supportive work environment, foster cooperation and collaboration between the university and its constituents, or benefit the campus community in some other significant way.
Awards were also presented to staff members celebrating 30, 35, and 40 years of service. These were presented to Charlotte Bartosh, Joan Maser, and Virgil Simplaceanu for 30 years of service; to Winifred Rossmont for 35 years of service; and to Marjorie Farinelli for 40 years of service.
“University-wide, [the Andy Awards] are the biggest thing as far as personal recognition,” said Ron Ripper, lab manager for the department of civil and environmental engineering and nominee for the outstanding commitment to students award.
“Winning would be great, but the fact of [my department head] putting me up there is really enough on a professional level,” Ripper said prior to the ceremony. “I come from private industry that didn’t do anything like this at all.”
“I think the staff get really excited each year,” Bushmire said. “[The awards] boost morale, and everyone’s really proud on the day of the Andy Awards. They’re really proud to be a part of this university.”

Traffic21 initiative develops app to solve parking delays
The Intelligent Transportation Society of America gave its national Smart Solution Spotlight award on Oct. 3 to Carnegie Mellon’s Traffic21 initiative. The initiative created a new smart parking application, called ParkPGH.
ParkPGH is the first predictive parking app in the country to direct drivers to available parking spots, in the hopes of relieving traffic congestion and delays. It predicts available parking space using an algorithm designed by Robert Hampshire, assistant professor of operations research and public policy in the Heinz College. The algorithm is based on historical parking trends and current events. Every 30 seconds, the program estimates the number of parking spaces available in the Pittsburgh Cultural District’s nine garages and delivers available locations to drivers through an iPhone app, websites, text messages, and a call-in telephone service. It can provide real-time information for the 2,500 parking spaces near the Cultural District.
Funded by Henry Hillman, Traffic21 is a Carnegie Mellon multi-disciplinary research initiative that strives to solve transportation problems in the Pittsburgh area through information collection and communications technology. So far, Traffic21 has completed 21 projects, including apps that provide commuters with bus schedules and arrival times, and apps that offer the safest and simplest routes for senior drivers.
Professors Liskov, Klemmer receive Katayanagi awards
Carnegie Mellon and the Tokyo University of Technology (TUT) have announced that Barbara Liskov and Scott Klemmer are the winners of the fourth annual Katayanagi Prizes. The prizes are endowed by TUT founder Ken Katayanagi to honor outstanding individuals within the field of computer science.
Liskov, recipient of the Katayanagi Prize for Research Excellence, is a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, Liskov has contributed to the development of several programming languages and developed the Liskov Substitution Principle, which has made software maintenance easier. In 2008, she received the A.M. Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery. Liskov’s Katayanagi prize is accompanied by a $10,000 honorarium.
Klemmer, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, received the Katayanagi Emerging Leadership Prize for his work in human-computer interaction, particularly in interface design. His prize comes with a $5,000 honorarium. Both Klemmer and Liskov will accept their prizes in person on the Carnegie Mellon campus. Klemmer will accept his on Thursday, Oct. 13, and Liskov will accept hers on Nov. 10. Both acceptances will be followed by lectures by the recipients.

In the Spirit of Cooperation
Monday at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
The U.S. State Department and Global Pittsburgh have asked five international public health professionals to convene and discuss their collaborations with Peace Corps volunteers. These professionals and volunteers have worked to control AIDS, malaria, and other public health challenges. This panel discussion is being held in conjunction with the Peace Corps’ 50th anniversary. 
School of Art Lecture Series
Tuesday at 5 p.m.
Kresge Theater, CFA
Los Angeles-based artist Simon Leung will be presenting his artistic media projects. His work focuses on the dislocation and disparities that are left in the aftermath of war. 
Leung pulls his inspiration from objects, people, and writings that have been removed from their origins — whether through time, circumstance, or historical violence. He then recombines these parts to form new allegories that challenge the accepted meanings of his source material. Using the media of video and performance, Leung attempts to reinvent war stories of modern times.
Cosmology Colloquium: “Where is the Dark Matter?”
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.
Doherty Hall A301D
Neta A. Bahcall, from the department of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University, will discuss her recent observations using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
The study used gravitational lensing to trace the mass distribution around galaxies and clusters of galaxies to the largest scale. Her research compared the observed mass distribution with light distribution; it showed that, while the mass distribution is considerably more extended than light on galactic scales, the mass follows light on larger scales. 
Bahcall will discuss the implications of her findings for cosmology and the mass-density of the universe, as well as galaxy and structure formation.
Fixing the Sky: Rube Goldberg meets Dr. Strangelove
Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
James Rodger Fleming will be discussing his book, Fixing the Sky. The book won this year’s Sally Hacker Prize, an award given to books that focus on the history of technology. Fleming is a historian of science and technology and professor of science, technology, and society at Colby College. 
In his lecture, Fleming will analyze the history of geoengineering since the late 19th century and its role in public policy. 
Fleming was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003 and a fellow of the American Meteorological Society in 2010.
Imagining Planetarity
Friday at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136A)
Joshua “Sha” LaBare, the Humanities Center Postdoctoral Fellow, will be discussing his recent work in a lecture titled “The Ecology of Everyday Life.” 
LaBare’s research focuses on studying the science fiction genre as a mode of awareness towards the everyday and questions how humans can better adapt to the changing global environment. His study frames adaptation as a scale-making process by which the local is made global and vice versa.

With Steve Jobs’ recent death, many have started to look at the history of Apple Inc. Jobs started the company in his garage in 1976, and it has become one of the largest digital media and computer companies in the world. Here are some statistics about Jobs’ most successful ventures:
$300 billion: Apple Inc.'s current net worth
25 million: The number of iPads sold
451: The number of parts used to assemble an iPod
312.5: The number of original Macintosh computers it would take to generate the processing power of an iMac

Student government has an image problem.
A common perception of student government at Carnegie Mellon is that it is ineffective and pointless. To some extent this perception is accurate, but it stems mainly from student government leaders’ inability to communicate their ideas and accomplishments to the student body. Student Senate attempted to address this difficulty with last week’s Senate Week events, and while they were a step in the right direction, they did little to inform the average Carnegie Mellon student about the role that Senate and student government play in undergraduate students’ lives.
Despite Senate Week and other modest efforts by undergraduate student government leaders to raise awareness, most students cannot name a Senator from their college; many also cannot identify the current student body president and vice presidents. While some of the responsibility for this ignorance lies with students for failing to be informed about their leaders, most of it lies with the student government leadership.
In January, we expressed our disappointment with the first half of the administration of then-executives Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith for their failure to achieve their campaign goals and to maintain a dialogue with the student body. Although current Student Body President Jake Flittner and Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma have been in office for close to two months now, we are dismayed to see the same lack of communication. 
On the student government executive web page, as of last Saturday, the “Members” list has not been updated since last year — Adams, Smith, former Vice President for Organizations Aaron Gross, and former Vice President for Finance Eric Wu are listed instead of the current leaders. The “Projects” page remains blank. The Tartan Rewards Program page still lists events from last semester. 
The @cmuexec Twitter account has been occasionally updated since the start of the semester, but with eight followers, it is hardly an effective way to reach the student body. Student government’s Facebook page, which has about 350 fans, has not been updated since the end of last semester.
If Carnegie Mellon’s student government leaders are serious about enhancing communication with the student body — and we hope they are — then they need to take advantage of the resources they already have. Although the Senate holds weekly public meetings, we believe that a separate forum needs to be created strictly for student feedback. At the very least, Senate needs to make its existing meetings more visible. 
This could easily be done by inviting students to meetings via Facebook events, actively expanding its official Twitter following, updating the student government executive web page, and utilizing all of the technological resources available to it. Furthering communication between undergraduates and their representatives should be a top priority for student government.

This weekend I went to what’s known as a “date auction”: Attendees bid on a guy or girl, and the proceeds go to charity. In this case, two of Carnegie Mellon’s great a cappella groups, Counterpoint and the Originals, auctioned off select members to the highest bidder. Out of the five guys and five girls auctioned, I don't think a single date will occur, so it obviously wasn’t done in all seriousness. And the people seemed really nice — it’s nothing about them. I just think that date auctions are an unwise way to raise money.
Let me set the scene. We met in The Underground, which coincidentally makes me think of a holding tank for slaves, but at least the singers looked dapper in their outfits. Of the 50-ish people there, most seemed to be unintentionally present — playing pool, eating with friends — although many were attentive. I was creepily off to the side taking notes. Several gaggles of girls were there to cheer on their friends. I think one girl’s dad was even there with a video camera, so now she can remember her auction forever.
The performances were captivating, so to speak. I don’t think the songs were intentionally self-referential, but when the girls sang about how there was a “Shark in the Water” and the guys sang (a fantastic rendition of) “Teenage Dream,” I did wonder. Pitches were full of innuendo and domination (“our next item up for bid”), and the bidding was about what you would expect from college budgets: a pretty consistent $25 per person price, except when one bidding war over a girl with a ring on her finger forced her significant other into valuing his girl at an awkwardly specific $38.
Now you may say to me, “Will, why ask someone on a consensual date when you can just pay for it at a date auction?” 
And I admit, now that Craigslist took down its “Erotic Services” section, there is more demand. But for one thing, think of the children! No, really, if the relationship worked out, it would be like the end of a bad MasterCard commercial: “Falling in love with my wife: priceless.... Well, actually it was $46.” If date auctions are harmless because they’re so slightly attended that they’re not really able to auction dates, then it seems silly to justify an event by its ineffectiveness.
At some point, I realized that there’s another comparison that can be made besides slavery and prostitution. Date auctions don’t only have you paying for sexual attention, they also have you paying for sexual attention. It’s like the ads on Google. (Now I see the Carnegie Mellon nods.) Companies bid for their favorite keywords. Even if they win, all they get is to show off to people who already see a lot of ads.
In connection with that, I will say that there was a lot of click fraud at the auction. Most people had arranged for their friends to buy them. One cute girl who actually tried to bid on a few guys kept getting shut down by artificially high prices. I thought about walking up to a girl at the end and saying, “Your AdWords were too pricey for me,” but I thought that even in my suavest tone it wouldn't land me a date.
There are alternative fundraisers to date auctions. Carnegie Mellon’s Donut Dash looks inventive and awesome, for instance. Even that entrepreneurship group that sold Indian food to win a class contest was working off of a cool idea. But date auctions encourage lighthearted enactments of human ownership, Facebook comments like “buyyyyy meeeeeeeeee (two people liked this).” One poor girl actually wrote that, and it reminded me of Gandalf the Grey’s cry as he fell down that chasm fighting the Balrog, never to be seen again. Except she would do it in perfect C. Next time we see that girl, she'll probably be like, “I’m Gandalf the White, suckers!” 
Now that would make a great fundraiser.

I’ll admit, I was both bemused and bothered by the letter to the editor regarding the article “Dietrich Pride Day Indicates Deeper H&SS Problems.” Let me preface this by saying that I am a junior in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and I love the school with all my heart. I really, truly do. Many of my friends, if not most of them, are fellow H&SS students. I have found a primary major in the college that has trained me and prepared me for a lifelong career in my areas of focus.
The problem isn’t with the academics in H&SS, nor with the high qualifications of the faculty here. The professors and coursework are excellent. The problem is that in terms of higher organization, the college becomes murky very quickly, despite the administration’s continual denial of any such problem. That’s the most unsettling issue we face as H&SS students, and one which was reflected not only in Joseph Devine’s letter to the editor but also in Tim Haggerty’s online comment left in response to the editorial.
It’s easy to draw the blinds and ignore these problems, of course, but those challenges remain. I watch my friends consistently worry about obtaining jobs and internships because the college lacks a solid technical core, despite Carnegie Mellon’s strong computer science and engineering programs. I see that even in a college which apparently is promoting (as Devine’s letter claims) “engaged and responsible citizenship,” students are entirely unmotivated to represent the college in Carnegie Mellon’s Student Senate — or even compete for leadership roles within the college itself. It’s a well-known joke that it’s possible to win an H&SS Student Senate seat with only a couple write-in votes — the post-vote proof is online for all to see. One Senate seat is entirely empty, and of the eight senators elected during 2011’s elections term, only five remain.
I have experienced firsthand that actively trying to locate current, consistent information regarding major and course requirements is a challenge — because of lack of unification, each major has radically different base requirements, many of which shift annually. And while the diversity might keep H&SS interesting, as acreative writing major, I have next to nothing in common with my friends from cognitive science or information systems. 
Haggerty’s comment states that “The interpretations of human endeavor that concern the scholars who reside in Baker Hall are necessarily multifaceted, complex tasks that belie any easy attempt to be branded. A unified H&SS — whatever that may mean — might be easier to discuss at college fairs or sum up in 140 characters, but it would be anathema to independent thought and intellectual inquiry.” But those qualities — independence, intellectualism, concern for human endeavor — are seen throughout the whole of Carnegie Mellon, and indeed every other higher academic institution in the United States.
The problem is that H&SS lacks cohesion beyond those generic qualities. According to the administration, some free food, a raffle, and a nice T-shirt should ameliorate all of this. Shockingly, it doesn’t. Also according to the administration, we should outright accept the chaos of having an education we cannot “sum up in 140 characters,” as Mr. Haggerty describes, and be happy. Unfortunately, I’m sure I speak for many of my peers when I say we’d also like to be employed, and elevator pitches are already hard enough to come by for us.
To the administration: Give us a relevant academic base we can use to relate to all of our peers, not just those in our majors. Make it known that you want to listen to our voices — the fact that there is an enormous silent majority should be telling. Give us a forum to express our voices to you directly, and you’ll see members of the college stepping up to fill seats they never realized existed. Put majors which are better academically served under other colleges — for example, information systems and economics — wholly within those colleges. I promise we can still keep the multifaceted-ness our college emphasizes. 
We will not lose diversity by re-clarifying H&SS’s vision and mission statement. We will only grow stronger. I want to be proud to be an H&SS student. Offer me the opportunity to feel connected to a whole, and I will seize it. I love this college, and I love Carnegie Mellon. That’s never been in question, and I know that many agree. H&SS, for most of us, has been more than just “a good choice.” That’s why we’re still here. Now it’s up to you to keep your end of the bargain. Do us proud.

Cynicism is incredibly prevalent in modern society. It has become a sort of cultural norm to expect empty promises, making skepticism the only reasonable way to view the world. I would be lying if I said there is no reason to be a cynic: We are facing turmoil as a nation, under the trials of a prolonged recession, an increasingly volatile political system, and countless other conflicts that plague the world. Often, glimmers of hope seem too far-fetched and are naturally disregarded, especially if they are only promises of good things to come. Yet hope should not be cast aside.
This week I learned that Arrested Development would return.
The rumor that the critically acclaimed television show would reappear in some format has been incubating since the show’s initial cancellation in 2006. The surprise, however, came when it was announced that the movie would be preceded by an extra season of the show focused on developing the individual characters’ whereabouts since the series ended.
I am thrilled by the prospect of more Bluth family shenanigans, yet I’m also cautious. If one were in need of a reason to be cynical, one would only have to look as far as one’s television or the silver screen. Numerous television shows and movies have inspired sequels and entire franchises, but more often than not they pale in comparison to the original work. When striking a balance between fan service and maintaining the appeal of the original show or movie, fan service usually wins and thus creates something that lacks the spirit of its predecessor.
The most notable instance of a franchise that has received fallout is Star Wars. Arguably the most classic film franchise of all time, its original trilogy ended in 1983 with the release of Return of the Jedi. Since then, there have been many additions to the story, including the prequels. As much as it pains this Star Wars fan to picture Darth Vader as a sexually frustrated boy with a hair braid, or to know that Jar Jar Binks is a thing, these facts are now canon to the story. Discontent is not only restrained to the prequels. The recent release of Star Wars: The Complete Saga on Blu-Ray saw numerous alterations to the original trilogy by means of “digital enhancement.” This sparked much protest among fans that were upset at a franchise they know and love being “tarnished.”
The differences between a comedy television show like Arrested Development and a blockbuster sci-fi movie trilogy like Star Wars are obvious, yet there are many questions that arise from comparing the two. Will a new season and a film enhance or disrupt the Arrested Development mythos? Will the spirit of Arrested Development live on in the new season and movie? And if it does, will that spirit still be as relevant and entertaining today as the original run was?
Not every franchise ends with mixed emotions. I had similar worries two years ago when I discovered my favorite movie was getting a second sequel, 11 years after the original premiered. I grew up on this series, and it has had more of an influence on me than I can put into words. The first installment was untouchable in my mind, so pure and perfect, and the second movie somehow managed to improve on this, making me fear that any further additions to the franchise would completely ruin it as a whole. 
The film I am talking about, of course, is Toy Story 3, and needless to say my fears were replaced by unadulterated love for how perfectly they concluded the trilogy. Stories are dear to us. We learn from them, they shape us as people, and thus we don’t want them to become corrupted. Arrested Development is a franchise no one wants to see blemished. The cynical view is to be prepared for disappointment. But you should remember: There is always money in the banana stand.

Cause of death: Hellfire missiles.
This could very well be part of the obituary of a high-profile terrorist, not an American citizen. But in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki, the government tells us that he was both. Regardless of his standing as an American citizen, he was placed on a “targeted killing list” and killed by drone strike last month in Yemen.
This targeted, military-backed killing of an American citizen is unprecedented. No information has been publicly provided to justify this killing, as no court and judge heard Awlaki’s case. When Awlaki’s father, Nasser al-Aulaqi, sued the U.S. government with the American Civil Liberties Union, the case was dismissed under the argument that his father lacked legal standing to sue on his son’s behalf. Aulaqi fought for his son’s right to trial, something we consider fundamental to American justice, and lost.
Awlaki was killed by two Hellfire missiles as he was getting breakfast and another American citizen, Samir Khan, was killed in the same attack and his death treated as collateral damage. Khan was not on any approved list; he was not deemed a national threat, yet his government killed him. Our government — President Obama, the National Security Council, and the CIA — has seemingly decided that it can now kill any American, without trial and without appeal. Moreover, the government can do this anywhere in the world. When fighting terrorism, there are no limits. We are not at war in Yemen, yet military force can be used on civilians there who may be terrorists.
Awlaki may have been dangerous and may have been guilty, but our justice system did not arrive at that verdict prior to killing him. While he was allegedly linked to several terrorism attacks and prevented incidents, none of those allegations were reviewed in a standard judicial process. He was judged by generals and politicians, sentenced in absentia without appeal, and killed. Establishing such a precedent is a dangerous and foolish thing to do. 
We condemn any assassinations, but this one is particularly alarming because of the way it directly contradicts our country’s justice system and the rights we are guaranteed as Americans.

Advanced technologies are transforming the way people learn. As the internet has gained prominence in global society, universities have tried to evolve their academic programs to keep pace with technological advancements. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s OpenCourseWare initiative, where some of the university’s courses — including problem sets, lecture notes, and exams — are available for free online, was an early example of high-quality instructional materials made available to people who could not normally attend college, much less one as prestigious as MIT. This semester, Stanford University’s “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course has been made available online to anyone around the world, and so far 130,000 students have enrolled. These programs are examples of the benefits that technology can bring to education, but they are only the first steps in what we believe will transform how students learn.
The current model of university education is the familiar one to Carnegie Mellon students. High school seniors apply to colleges, say goodbye to their parents, and head off to a university campus for the next four years or so. While there, they attend classes, join clubs, make friends, and occasionally sleep. But the MIT and Stanford programs, along with the many existing online degree programs, are the vanguard of a different model of education, one that will extend opportunities for advanced education to people who have previously been left out.
There has been no shortage of criticism of internet learning initiatives from the academic status quo. What seems to be a common fear is that non-traditional students will lose out on the defining aspects of college. They will not be able to form the same close bonds of friendship, nor will they have the chance to expand their interests through extracurricular activities or general education requirements. However, this view loses sight of the real reason for non-traditional education. The students who can attend four-year colleges and follow the traditional path are served by the current system. Future programs will give the economically or socially disadvantaged the chance to better themselves. They will allow unemployed workers to learn the skills they need to earn credentials that will allow them the freedom to change careers.
The future of education is far from certain. For every successful and rigorous online program, there are many that are just “degree factories” or simply failures. Instead of focusing on the flaws of online programs, we should find ways to improve them. Online and distributed academic programs should not be compared to traditional universities. They should instead be judged on how they expand opportunities beyond the status quo.

Every year, Nobel Prizes in chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine, peace, and literature are awarded: three to scientists, one to an activist, and one to an artist. 
That last one, we as a nation will ignore. We will not consider this year’s winner’s “condensed, translucent images, [which] give us fresh access to reality.” Even with the Swedish Academy’s compelling tweet-length press quote on this year’s winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer, we will not dive into his art. Despite the fact that he has just won the Nobel for artists and that his entire corpus is less than 300 pages, he will remain largely unread in America.
We as a country continue to be uninformed about actual literature, especially literature written by anyone outside of our country or by anyone who dares write in a language other than our own. We are so uninformed that we lack the ability to reason about the prize. Americans are not informed enough to call shenanigans on the Swedish Academy awarding the prize to a Swedish poet — what incest!
Even if we were aware that he was the eighth Swede to win the prize in the mere 111 years it has existed, seemingly a clear bias, we couldn’t actually argue that they were keeping it local because we simply aren’t aware of the whole field. Even if we think the prize should be less Euro-centric (10 of the 12 awarded since 2000), none of us is able to even name a writer from Asia or Africa. If we want to believe that this prize should be politicized, and overtly so, we cannot connect it with the Arab Spring, because we have not read artists like Nuruddin Farah or Adonis.
If you read the news reports last week, you will have seen Tranströmer described as “a well-recognized voice in Scandinavian countries” or “Sweden’s most lauded poet.” Who is America’s most lauded poet? When did you last read a poem? When our best-selling writers are Dan Brown, Stephenie Meyer, and Nicholas Sparks, who can we as a country unify behind for an American Nobel literature prize winner?
We seem to prefer sparkly vampires, wizarding schools, and endless easy-to-read series over literature that pushes the boundaries of identity, socioeconomic status, larger political issues, and human rights. Publishers have followed what we purchase, and the writers that are published, promoted, and acclaimed are those who sell books and e-copies. We remain in the dark, ignoring literature from abroad and anything that might make us question the way we see and think. We will write off the Swedish Academy as Euro-centric and irrelevant since they aren’t saying what we want to hear and they aren’t naming Americans. 
For those of you who aren’t satisfied with this, and have the ability to read a poem and reflect on it, pick up Tranströmer (especially over recent winners Vargas Llosa and Müller). I would specifically recommend Det Vilda Torget (The Wild Market Square in English). Step outside your comfort zone and join a world in which literature carries the import it once did — beyond the New York Times bestseller list.

The next 13 months are going to be a contentious time in politics. Not only do we have to elect a president, but it seems we also have to figure out how.
Republican Dominic Pileggi, the majority leader in the Pennsylvania state Senate, sponsored a bill last month to award Pennsylvania’s electoral votes individually, to the winning presidential candidate in each of the state’s Congressional districts, rather than by the traditional winner-takes-all method. Some state Republicans, including Governor Tom Corbett, are voicing their support for the measure.
It’s not difficult to see why. Pennsylvania awarded its full 21 electoral votes to Democrat Barack Obama when he won the state’s popular vote in 2008. If Pileggi’s method had been in effect then, Obama’s total would have been reduced to 11, leaving the remaining 10 for Republican challenger John McCain. In these partisan times, any scheme that would turn a 21–0 Democratic shutout into an 11–10 near tie is music to GOP ears. Just as obviously, Democrats are lining up against the proposal, using as their excuse that it would decrease Pennsylvania’s importance as a swing state in national elections and funnel away campaign spending.
Dividing Pennsylvania’s electoral votes by Congressional district, no matter how sensible the idea seems on the surface, is nothing more than a political ploy. Republicans proposed and support the method; they also — surprise — control the process that will determine the boundaries of Pennsylvania’s Congressional districts for the next three presidential elections. These districts are already heavily gerrymandered, and giving GOP mapmakers extra motivation to push and pull the lines just right shows a preoccupation with politics, not with representing the will of the state’s voters more accurately.
If our state legislators really wanted to represent vote tallies more accurately, they’d sign on to an initiative like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Under the terms of the compact, member states pass laws allocating their own electoral vote totals to the winner of the nationwide popular vote. The changes take effect when enough states to represent a majority of the Electoral College sign on, thereafter guaranteeing the presidency to the candidate receiving the most votes nationally. So far, the compact has the support of eight states plus Washington, D.C., taking it to 132 of the 270 electoral votes it needs in order to become active. Pennsylvania’s 20 votes would be a significant addition.
Lawmakers who want fair and accurate vote counting should know that one vote per person — equally counted regardless of state, Congressional district, county, or otherwise — is about as fair and accurate as you can get. We already have enough to fight over without worrying about how and when our votes matter.

California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law allowing children as young as 12 years old the power to consent to HPV vaccines on Sunday. Upon first glance, this does not seem like such a big deal. HPV vaccines are known to combat human papillomavirus, precancerous cervical cell changes, and (potentially the most important) sexually transmitted diseases. This should be considered an achievement; Brown should be commended for his forward thinking. The measure was even backed by groups including the California STD Controllers Association, the Health Officers Association of California, and the American Civil Liberties Union.
I couldn’t agree more with Brown and his supporters’ decision. If anything, this law is a step in the right direction for our nation’s youth. Yes, 12 years old seems incredibly young to start discussing the grim realities of adulthood. 
But by giving young teens the opportunity to reach out and find help for any STD related problems, Brown is encouraging an open discussion about sex. Talking frankly about the subject will make it less taboo and will make teens less afraid to ask questions and get information. And, let’s be honest, information is key when it comes to the topic of sex; misinformation is what leads to unexpected pregnancies and diseases. Only with accurate knowledge will young teens be able to judge how serious the act of sex is to understand the lifelong consequences of STDs. 
Yet Brown’s actions have ignited waves of resentment and backlash from hard-line conservatives. The bill was opposed by the California Catholic Conference, which also opposed previous measures to allow minors to consent to certain medical treatments without parental involvement. This hardly comes as a shock.
The HPV vaccine has been a hot-button issue for Republicans throughout their 2012 campaign trails. Representative Michele Bachmann (R–Minn.) and Governor Rick Perry (R–Texas) have especially targeted the vaccine, declaring it dangerous and harmful to minors. They and their supporters claim the drug inflicts ridiculously ludicrous side-effects such as mental retardation and autism. They refuse to allow the federal government to make such parental choices for them, given the so-called side effects.
“I’m not a scientist. I’m not a physician. All I was doing was reporting what this woman told me last night at the debate,” Bachmann said on Sean Hannity’s radio show in defense of her opposition to the vaccine. “As a mother, I would not want the federal government or a state government to mandate that my child have an injection, just because government says so.”
The Centers for Disease Control’s website reports that only mild to moderate problems are known to occur with the HPV vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil. Typical symptoms include reactions where the shot was given, general pain, and redness or swelling. More severe symptoms include fever of 99.5 ˚F or higher, headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and fainting.
Moreover, according to a recent article on The Hill, “A report released in late August by the Institute of Medicine found no link between the vaccine and autism, the most common link claimed by those who oppose inoculation. The study also failed to find adequate evidence to suggest that the vaccine causes a dozen other serious adverse neurological and physical effects. It did, however, find some evidence that the vaccine could lead to anaphylaxis, or a severe allergic reaction.”
So, faced with the insurmountable evidence against conservatives’ unfounded assertions, it is hard to believe that they are solely angry at HPV vaccinations and the potential side-effects. What they truly seem to be incensed about is the overarching topic I mentioned earlier: sex. Conservatives, for some unknown reason, want to keep this topic behind closed doors. This is rather foolish for the same reasons I praised Brown’s legislation. Conservatives need to come to terms that teaching abstinence will not keep their children from “exploring” and “hands-on learning.”
Until people can escape their politically partisan biases, legislation like Brown’s will forever incite backlash from hard-line groups. 
Until they can see the larger benefits of open discussions on sex, we will continue to see young teens fumble along the path to adulthood and make grave mistakes that will stay with them for the remainder of their lives.

People around you are complicated. Enough said. 
Eyes are the window to the soul — and I think you would benefit from some Windex.
Multitasking is a blessing and curse. This week, make sure not to abuse your powers, and give the things that are really important your undivided attention.
The weather is confusing, but try not to mix your summer and winter wardrobe. Nothing looks sillier than short shorts and snow boots.
As much as you like showing others all of the strong Leo characteristics you possess, the world knows that you’re as soft and sweet as can be.
Congratulations on being you. Only you could be as good as you are. Keep up the good work.
Your professor has so much work to do and you’re living fancy free. Wait, strike that and reverse it.
Expressing yourself can be hard, and what you mean to say doesn’t always equal what you end up saying. Don’t let that stop you: Your opinion matters.
Plan your mid-semester adventure now! Live that extra day of freedom to the fullest, and there will be no need to pray for Thanksgiving break to come.
Let’s try not make this week feel like the last few weeks, okay? I don’t know if you really want to deal with that interesting mix of emotions again.
Take my advice to not take all the advice you receive. It is all well and good to seek out all possible options, but only you know what’s right for you.
So last week’s predictions were kind of off, but don’t get upset. Life doesn’t always work out as planned, but your ability to change directions and overcome will make you great.
