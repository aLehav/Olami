The 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang has entered the second week of competition, and, at the moment, the United States sits fifth on the medal leaderboard, with ten total medals, five of them gold. Stellar performances in snowboarding propelled America to the front, but with plenty of events left to go, there is more than enough time to collect even more medals. With medals awarded for events in thirteen sports, and plenty more to come in the next week, let’s look back at the standout moments for America, before looking forward into the best events to watch coming up.
Snowboarding
The United States is known for dominating snowboarding in the Winter Olympics, and 2018 was no exception. With six events in the sport, the United States secured gold medals in the four individual events. 17-year-old phenom Chloe Kim won her first gold medal in the women’s halfpipe, with American Arielle Gold taking the bronze. Shaun White won his third halfpipe gold — a medal which also counted as the 100th gold ever won by America at the Winter Olympics. Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson won gold in men’s and women’s slopestyle respectively. Lindsey Jacobellis finished fourth in women’s snowcross. All in all, American snowboarders currently hold half of the United States’ medals as they continue to dominate the sport on the international level.
Alpine Skiing
While most of the American skiing world was focused on Lindsey Vonn’s return to competing after multiple injuries, she fell to sixth in the women’s Super-G competition. Earlier in the week, two-time Olympian Mikaela Shiffrin secured the gold medal in giant slalom, although she would later fall short of the podium by 0.08 seconds in women’s slalom, finishing in fourth. On the men’s side, two-time Olympic gold medalist Ted Ligety failed to complete the men’s slalom course.
Figure Skating
Despite a disappointing first short program from 18-year-old Nathan Chen, the United States secured bronze in the team figure skating competition due to amazing performances by skater Adam Rippon and ice dancing team Alex and Maia Shibutani. Unfortunately, no individual medals have been won by the United States yet, although Chen staged a miraculous comeback from 17th place after the short program to finish fifth in men’s singles. 17-year-old Vincent Zhou placed sixth, while Rippon rounded out the top ten. Pair skaters Alexa Scimeca Knierim and Chris Knierim finished 15th overall.
Luge
A normally uncommon sport for the United States, America’s first ever singles luge medal was brought home by Chris Mazdzer, with a silver in the men’s event. He is also the only non-European athlete to ever medal in the event.
Short Track Speed Skating
Olympic rookie John-Henry Krueger secured the silver medal in the men’s 1000m event, the first American medal in speed skating since 2010. After narrowly avoiding a three-skater collision near the end of the race, Krueger finished fractions of a second behind the Canadian skater.
The figure skating competition continues through Wednesday, with ice dancing on the weekend and ladies’ singles up next. Ice hockey enters the quarterfinals stage this week for both the men and women’s teams — the men are entering following a 0-4 shutout loss against the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR), while the women remain favorites for the gold medal even after losing a close game to Canada, 1-2. Curling is continuing to pick up, with the women’s team beating the OAR team before falling behind to Canada. They will continue to compete in the round robin competition.
With plenty of other events still lined up before closing ceremonies, the Olympics are far from over. There are countless story lines and narratives to follow, and history is being made nearly every second. If you haven’t already, take some time out of your busy day to watch the best athletes in the world do what they do best.

The Pittsburgh Pirates are going into the start of Spring Training with a hefty controversy on their shoulders, and, in a recent interview, third baseman David Freese spoke about the attitude of the team as a whole last season. His comments were honest, and strongly worded, which is surprising, coming from a player who is still with the team.
“You have to understand when you walk through the door why we’re here,” Freese said. “It’s to stay out of the red, I guess, a little bit, but it is about winning...You don’t have to make the postseason or this or that, but, at the end of the year, you have to say, ‘We honestly went for it.’”
These are harsh words to hear coming directly from a player, and they seem to make sense. After two consecutive losing seasons, it seems that the problem with the Pirates might not boil down to the talent that they have, but an inability to break out of the mindset of a historically bad team. Regardless of the troubles with Starling Marte and Jung-Ho Kang last season, one could look at the Pirates’ lineup and see a lot of good players. There’s no explanation other than a negative mindset. Freese just might be on to something.
After the Feb. 14 pitchers and catchers report, it’s safe to say that Spring Training has officially begun. Games start on Feb. 23, and if what Freese says echoes throughout the dugout, the Pirates may actually stand a chance to return to the caliber they were at three years ago.
The outfield need a bit of tinkering, but there’s no doubt you’ll be seeing Gregory Polanco and Starling Marte out on the grass. Marte, without a doubt, will be the starting center fielder after the Andrew McCutchen trade, and Polanco will likely reprise his role in right field, given his reported discomfort in left.
Polanco seems like he may be turning over a new leaf in terms of physical fitness. In the winter, he trained back in the Dominican Republic with the same fitness instructor that he had worked with until last year. Polanco says that his trainer focuses more on agility than pure strength, which is where Polanco seemed to struggle last year. Hopefully he can break out and live up to his potential.
There’s a race going on between the Pirates’ relievers. 12 different pitchers will be vying for just four open seats in the bullpen, and there are some interesting competitors who may prove to be what the Bucs have been looking for to re-establish their mid-2010s pitching strength.
Obviously, Felipe Rivero has the ninth locked down. There won’t be anyone replacing him in the closer’s role for quite some time, it seems. Setting up for the 100-mph flamethrower will more than likely fall on former San Francisco Giant George Kontos, who was impressive in his relief appearances after being claimed off waivers late last season, and Daniel Hudson, who might not be the best choice, after what was a lackluster 2017.
The other four spots, however, are open to whoever can prove themselves. Michael Feliz, Kyle Crick, Dovydas Neverauskas, Edgar Santana, A.J. Schugel, Josh Smoker, Jack Leathersich, and Jordan Milbrath will all get the opportunity to fit into the relief rotation. I like the look of Santana and Smoker, especially. Santana was a great strikeout guy after being called up in September of last year, and for Smoker, it seems like a change of scenery from the New York Mets could do him good. All of the relievers have the stuff that the Bucs will need from their bullpen, so whoever ends up grabbing the seats will hopefully make us proud.
Spring Training games start on Feb. 23, and the first few are only being broadcast on radio, so make sure to tune in and get an early taste of that baseball fever!

It makes for an image right out of science fiction: a mannequin named Starman, driving a cherry red Tesla Roadster, with his arm set on the windowsill, en route to orbit Mars as “Space Oddity” by David Bowie plays on the radio. Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX and car company Tesla, and his latest stunt have reignited a long-forgotten spirit to explore galaxies far, far away and meet life outside of Earth and someday, be able to actually drive sports cars, or their equivalents, in space.
On Feb. 6, SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy LC-39A SpaceX Launch Site in Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying Musk’s Tesla sports car. The Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world, and can carry almost 64 metric tons of load. Only the Saturn V, last flown in 1973, used to launch the Apollo series for manned missions to the moon, delivered more payload than the Falcon Heavy.
The Falcon Heavy consists of three Falcon 9 rockets strapped together; after the Feb. 6 launch, two of the three Falcon 9 rockets landed in sync on landing pads. The launch was meant to demonstrate the reusability of SpaceX’s rockets — a system designed to significantly lower the cost barriers of getting into space. 
At $90 million per flight, this system is significantly cheaper than NASA’s heavy launch system — the Space Launch System — which is under planning, and is already estimated to cost about $1 billion per flight. Another competitor in the reusable rocket race is New Glenn, a project by Blue Origins — a private spaceflight and aerospace company owned by entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. The pace of this new space race seems to have been accelerated by the privatization of space travel. Perhaps stunts like Musk’s are what drives the need to be faster, better and more visible in experimenting with space travel.
Musk’s Tesla Roadster will play the song “Space Oddity” on infinite loop (or until the stereo’s battery runs out) while in space, has “Don’t Panic” written on the center of its dashboard, and has “Made on Earth by Humans” written on a circuit board. The fact that there is no air to carry sound in space, and that “Don’t Panic” is a particularly cheeky literary reference to Douglas Adams’ novels, show that this is clearly an exhibit meant for humans, not extraterrestrials. The car also has Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy stored in a storage device, a miniature model of the car with Starman in it and the names of about 6,000 SpaceX employees marked on the actual car.
The car was supposed to orbit Mars, but overshot its aim and now, after surviving the Earth’s radiation-filled Van Allen belts, it’s headed for the asteroid belt. 
Scientifically speaking, the car is a dummy payload: it has no real scientific purpose. This is intentional. In response to a tweet asking what the Falcon Heavy’s payload was going to be, Musk said that it would be the “silliest thing we can imagine!” 
While it is a matter of taste whether launching his personal $250,000 Tesla Roadster was “silly,” it definitely was memorable.
In a press conference on Feb. 6, Musk said, “Normally, for a new rocket, it launches like a block of concrete, and that’s so boring. The imagery of [the car and Starman] is something that’s going to get people excited around the world … and it’s still tripping me out….Maybe it’ll be discovered by some future alien race thinking, ‘What the heck were these guys doing, did they worship this car? Why do they have a little car in the car?’ That’ll really confuse them.”
This event was live-streamed in 1080p to over 2.3 million people, and hyped up with a glamorous animated promotional video. The car also has three cameras at different angles that provided some glorious shots of the car against the Earth, the Moon and in space. The car faded out of the view of telescopes on Feb. 14. 
The popping red of the car, with Starman gazing at the stars against the pitch black of space, could perhaps be considered a part of the pop, postmodern art world.
As the CEO of Tesla Motors, Musk owns 27 percent of Tesla stock. Though Musk is a founder and owner of several companies, Tesla is the original source of most of his significant personal wealth (now around $21.5 billion).
Despite its fame in the tech world, Tesla is still a relatively lesser known car brand, at least to the general public — due likely in part to the fact that the company does not use traditional paid advertising. 
With Tesla Model 3’s production delays and dropping market credibility, this picture has the potential to give both exposure and sales a significant boost. The combined image of a Tesla Roadster and a human-like figure driving in space lends Musk’s brand a more sparkly, snazzy reputation. 
It’s easy to see how this  striking image, essentially an elaborate car advertisement, could be big enough to save sales from plummeting. Though Musk’s  personal Roadster model is from 2008 and no longer in production, and the next Roadsters won’t go on sale until 2020, the stunning pictures of the Roadster in space are expected to increase the value of Tesla’s brand as a whole, as well as the original Roadsters on their ten-year anniversary.
With sending Starman and his Roadster into space, there is no doubt that Elon Musk has sparked the feeling of “ad astra” back into space travel and has rightfully said, “Crazy things can come true.”

Getting sick with the flu can disrupt your entire schedule. Yet sick students still regularly show up to class, work, and meetings, potentially putting everyone around them at risk for illness. You might find yourself heading to the doctor’s office because of a classmate — or was it your roommate? Or your teaching assistant? Or someone you sat next to on the bus?
When viruses are going around campus, it can be hard to tell who was to blame, especially if many people are sick at the same time. But what if you could pinpoint who gave you the virus?
A research study called “Characterizing and Tracking College Health: The Virus Study” — known as C.A.T.C.H. The Virus — is trying to make that possible by tracking how the flu spreads from student to student on campus at the University of Maryland. 
But the researchers aren’t tracking virus transmission so that students can identify and get revenge on whoever got them sick — they’re trying to learn more about how and why viruses spread within a population.
The researchers, led by environmental and occupational health researcher Donald Milton, are building up a pool of data from sick students,through collecting blood, snot, and breath samples from sick students. 
The first two types of sample are relatively easy to collect. To get the breath samples, the researchers have to seat the students in a special booth (called the Gesundheit-II), and have them put their face in a cone, which they breathe into for half an hour. 
They have also installed carbon dioxide-sensitive instruments in dormitories that measure how much of the air has been exhaled by a person.
The researchers are interested in gathering data on a number of viruses, but they’re most focused on the flu. 
“Flu is important to everybody,” says Milton. This year’s flu season is the worst in the past 13 years, according to the Center for Disease Control.
Viruses mutate fairly quickly as they’re passed around campus. By tracking the people sick students have interacted with and the genetic changes within the virus samples, the researchers will try to “establish who infected whom, and where, and how,” Milton says.
Flu viruses spread in a few different ways — by touch, by large droplets that have been coughed or sneezed out of someone’s lungs onto a surface like a desk, and by smaller droplets called aerosols, which hang around in the air after being coughed or sneezed out. 
But it’s unknown how much each transmission method contributes to viral spread.
The aerosol particles are the area of most interest, because they can’t be controlled by washing your hands or sterilizing a surface, instead remaining suspended in the air. 
“This could mean that just having good cough and sneeze etiquette — sneezing or coughing into tissues — may not be enough to limit the spread of influenza,” says virologist Andrew Pekosz of Johns Hopkins University. “Just sitting in your office and breathing could fill the air with infectious influenza.”
But they won’t know for sure how much that factors in until the study, which has been ongoing since November, finishes. “If we don’t understand how [viruses] are transmitted, it’s hard to come up with policies that are really going to work,” Milton says.
This year’s flu hasn’t hit the University of Maryland dormitories yet, but the researchers are expecting to get a lot of data when it does.
“Once one person gets sick, it goes around to everyone on the floor,” says sophomore Parker Kleb, a research assistant on the study. “I’m very interested to see what happens in the next few weeks, and how the study will hopefully benefit.”

Penguins are bio archives of climate change
At the American Geophysical Union’s 2018 Ocean Sciences Meeting on Feb. 12, scientists reported that penguins feathers and eggshells preserve chemical fingerprints of climate and ecological changes. 
Penguin tissues store the changes in the food that they consume, which can be interpreted by looking at their chemical composition. For example, krill and fish have different nitrogen isotope proportions, which, when consumed by penguins, is reflected in the composition of their tissues.
Overfishing and climate change has led to some dramatic changes in the penguin lifestyle. Kelton McMahon, an oceanic ecogeochemist at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston is a member of this study along with his team developed tools to distinguish between changes in penguins’ diet and other climate change related changes. He says, “Penguins are excellent bio archives of this [environmental] change.
“This 80-year record is just part of a much broader record of change,” McMahon adds. Now, the team intends to study older penguin artifacts. Some excavations have unearthed penguin eggshells that are over 100,000 years old.

Brains think about moving while detecting rhythms
In a study published online in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience on Jan. 18, researchers found that if the region of the brain that planned movement is disabled, the brain has trouble detecting changes in rhythms.
The human brain understands rhythm by making predictions about the spaces between between beats, and essentially guessing when the next beat will fall. This helps us interpret repeated sounds, like music, and this prediction making is a part of the brain system called relative timing.
Jessica Ross, a coauthor on the study and a neuroscience graduate student at the University of California Merced, along with the team of researchers who worked on the study, rendered the areas of the brain responsible for movement - the posterior parietal cortex and the supplementary motor area - temporarily unable to function by applying a magnetic pulse to that area. 
The researchers tested 25 adults, and found that while the participants were able to identify the rhythms fine without the supplementary motor area, they couldn’t differentiate between rhythms without the the posterior parietal cortex.
“Music is basically sounds that have a structure in time,” says Sundeep Teki, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. According to Teki, studies like this one help illuminate how our brains  understand music.

Household chemicals pollute air as much as cars
A recent study shows that many common household chemicals contribute to urban air pollution at levels comparable to vehicle exhaust. This category includes not just household cleaners, but also products like nail polish remover, printer ink and even soap.
“The things I use in the morning to get ready for work are comparable to emissions that come out of the tailpipe of my car,” says lead author Brian McDonald, an air-pollution researcher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder, Colorado. “I think that’s what surprises a lot of people.”
Like exhaust from cars and trucks, household chemicals contain volatile organic compounds. When they evaporate, these compounds contribute to ozone and smog.
Despite increased regulation on vehicle emissions over the past four to five decades, many US cities, like Los Angeles, struggle to comply with air cleanliness standards. This study helps explain why: vehicle exhaust is a huge contributor to urban air pollution, but it isn’t the only contributor.
The research team used a variety of data, including existing datasets and both indoor and outdoor air samples, to support their hypothesis. “We had to collect an overwhelming amount of evidence to say that these sources are important,” says McDonald.

Tree rings in southwestern U.S. point to increased fire risk
Scientists at the US Geological Survey (USGS) study tree rings to understand the history of a region’s climate so they can predict the risk of future wildfires. 
When a tree is cut horizontally, the cross-section reveals layers of concentric circles. 
It’s common knowledge that one ring grows each year; but a ring can reveal more than just age: it contains details about what the environmental conditions were like during that year.
According to the patterns in this natural historical data, USGS scientists claim that New Mexico might experience a devastating wildfire season this year. The area of concern is the Sangre de Cristo Mountains outside Santa Fe. According to the tree ring data, the region hasn’t experienced a wildfire in around a century, which means that the forest constitutes a huge amount of potential fuel, USGS scientist Ellis Margolis explains. “We’re sitting on this powder keg,” he says.
By studying the tree ring histories, Margolis determined that the biggest wildfires occur in very dry winters that occur after two or three years of winters with a lot of precipitation. After wet winters in 2016 and 2017, New Mexico is experiencing a very dry winter right now. “The lack of snow is scary,” says Margolis. “We’re set up for a big fire year if things don’t change dramatically.”

Dear Izzy,
Do you ever have that existential feeling of dread and expectation of failure even before giving yourself a little bit of faith? Well that’s how I feel about my midterm. I just did so poorly on all my tests last semester (thankfully everything else just pulled up my grade) that I’m just worried I’m gonna fall into the same cycle. I’m worried that I won’t have enough time in the week to actually study effectively because of all my other classes, and that if I do have free time, procrastination will get the better of me and I will end up shamefully (or shamelessly, depending on my mood) watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians instead. I would ask for help or study with groups, but I feel like I’d just end up flopping like a fish in terms of my grasp on the material, because I’m so behind.  Is there anything that you recommend I should do?
Desperate On Options Making Exam prep Decent
Dear DOOMED,
As much as people hate to admit it, procrastination is something that everyone will struggle with so don’t be ashamed of that.  The TV show choice though is a tough call, but this is also coming from someone who worships Riverdale and its aesthetic in secrecy. But that’s beside the point.
One of the best ways to combat wasting your free time can be, ironically, planning it out. Identify when you’re free during the day: do you have a substantial amount of time in between two classes? Is there an adequate amount of time you have between two meetings? What time do you get home every night? Once you’ve gathered all those hours together, schedule out when you’ll do certain assignments. Be a fair judge on how much time you think you’ll take, and keep the schedule next to you while you’re doing work. And then — this is the most important — follow it. There will be distractions, but for the most part stay focused and on track. If you don’t finish something in the time frame you set for yourself, just stop and move on.
Secondly, office hours are there for the people in that floppy fish mood. At some point, maybe even the teaching assistants (TAs) of your class felt that way too. They will totally be open to you and your problems; that’s what TAs are there for, and the last thing they would want is having your insecurities and fears overtake your desire to understand and learn more. Your study group members will be like that too; heck, they might even learn a bit from you after your understanding of the concept clicks around them.
Finally, don’t forget to take a mental break once in a while and put it in your schedule. Get a healthy amount of sleep — it will do more for your concentration, mood, and brain than you think it will. It will give you time to process the material, focus on something else, and come back with a fresh perspective and energy to take on a challenge. Take care of yourself, eat some comfort food, or do something that you love. Or at the very least, watch something a little better on Netflix. You can study, attend office hours, and schedule all you want, but you'll do a lot better if you let your brain relax a little bit and maintain a healthy balance of work and leisure.
Best,
Izzy

“Three blind mice. Three blind mice. See how they run. See how they run…” And so the play begins in darkness, with a nursery rhyme and a scream.
Agatha Christie’s murder mystery The Mousetrap twists the already gruesome and disturbing nursery rhyme and takes it to a whole new level. Carnegie Mellon students swarmed the Cohon Center Studio Theater this past weekend to see Scotch'n'Soda’s production of Christie’s play, directed by junior computer science student Will Walters and first-year electrical and computer engineering student Kai Huizenga.
The stage is set on a frigid day in England at Monkswell Manor, where Mollie Ralston and her husband Giles are setting up their newly converted guesthouse for their first slew of patrons. With their guests arriving any minute, Mollie and Giles — played by first-year Dietrich student Hannah Cornish and junior information systems major Walter Donnellan respectively — are eager to have everything in order. Yet, a message on the radio warns of the trouble soon to come. If the Ralstons weren’t already anxious enough about their new business venture, the news of a murderer on the loose in the area certainly does the trick in worrying the couple. Quickly, however, they must compose themselves as their first guests begin to appear at the door.
In comes the strange and misunderstood Christopher Wren, played by senior and Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts student Alyss Weissglass. Later follows haughty old Mrs. Boyle, played by junior decision science and psychology student Heather Graci, with friendly Major Metcalf, portrayed by first-year engineering student Julien Buron. With Mrs. Boyle horrified by the Ralstons’ lack of experience and staff, a lot of pressure is building amongst the residents and their hosts. Just as they begin to settle in and Miss Casewell — their final expected guest, played by first-year biochemistry major Emily Schneider and first-year Dietrich College student and understudy Zoe Marshall — arrives, another knock at the door reveals a mysterious guest. Confused and a bit overwhelmed by the boisterous foreigner, Mollie Ralston still accepts Mr. Paravicini, played by first-year chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, and english student Olivia Olshevski, under her roof despite not knowing anything about him. She then realizes that she knows next to nothing about the guests that now occupy her house. And so the day ends, the guests are snowed in, and the police show up. Detective Sergeant Trotter, played by junior music student Jordan Speranzo, announces that the murderer is among them, and chaos ensues. The killer is still waiting to kill the last two mice, and anyone could be the murderer or the one in danger. Nobody is safe from harm, and nobody is safe from the scrutiny of the rest of the Monkswell occupants, particularly when all are harboring secrets. So who could the killer be?
To be honest, I’m not usually a fan of mysteries, but this one definitely kept me on my toes and surprised me. In the past, I’ve been pretty good at figuring mysteries out, but this show was different. You quickly learn to trust no one. As a good mystery should, there are so many twists and turns that force you to question everyone’s intentions. By the end, I had no idea who was in danger or who the killer was.
Each character was fascinating and many were delightfully quirky, bringing laughter to the audience amidst the dark themes and tragic backstories revealed throughout the show. I equally enjoyed and was annoyed by Mrs. Boyle’s continuously scathing and cynical commentary and Mr. Paravacini’s ridiculous antics.
Each actor seemed to be the perfect fit for their respective roles, with no character or actor seeming to outshine the rest. All commanded the stage in their own way and complemented each other superbly.
While the acting was absolutely fantastic, one of the most notable things about the show was the layout of the set. Typically, audiences are separated from the performance due to distance, elevation, and other factors, but here everyone was so close to the stage that it felt like we were almost part of the show. The audience was on the same level as the stage, and while difficult to see from the back at times, the effect overall was a positive one. Not only was the audience on the same ground as the performance, but the walls of the manor extended into the audience as well, making the setting more intimate and drawing viewers into the scene even more.
The overall talent of the Scotch’n’Soda cast and crew always blows me away. From the incredible set design that brought the scenes to life to the brilliant cast that truly embraced their characters, Scotch'n'Soda’s production of the The Mousetrap was a successfully chilling and humorous murder mystery.

“Ferox is primal. Ferox is chaotic. Ferox is a return to instinct. Embodied by the human species, Ferox represents a blind and reckless freedom that must be contained for the sake of maintaining the civility we all value and from which we all benefit. Ultimately…Ferox must be quelled.”
The theme description for this year’s Lunar Gala, Pittsburgh’s largest fashion event, held last Saturday at the Wiegand Gym in the Cohon Center, accurately described not only the event itself, but also its atmosphere and environment. Coming from someone who can’t go a single day without incorporating black in her outfit, has a lipstick collection that contains predominantly darker shades, and who experiments with bra harnesses, leather, ear cuffs, and heels when going to class, I walked into Wiegand Gym “dressed down” in my worn-down H&M jeans, beaten Steve Maddens, and dark plaid shirt feeling severely underdressed among the amount of suits, fur coats, fringe, and velvet that I saw among the audience members.
Everything about last year’s Lunar Gala felt primitive compared to the higher level of complexity, fashion, and innovation among the dancers, attendees, and the 19 collections featured on the runway in FEROX.  The show maintained a perfect balance of raw, visceral passion with modern, sleek talent among all the collections, and each one offered a different dimension, angle, and interpretation of combining those two very different worlds and concepts. Every component of the show worked harmoniously with each other, from the music choices of each collection to the overall program and order of each fashion collection to the choreography of each dance routine.
The first three lines of Lunar Gala, Maille, Chinoiseries, and Travaille, perhaps best describe FEROX’s pristine harmony under its chaotic aesthetic.  The medieval-inspired line Maille, created by fifth-year senior and psychology major Noa Wolff-Fineout, establishes a great contrast of elegance and history in preparation for the more futuristic looks from the later collections, while still feeling modern for the present day. Elaborating more on the historical foundations that Maille had established, Chinoiseries, designed by junior architecture students Kornrat Euchukanonchai and Shariwa Sharada alongside senior architecture student Gunn Chaiyapatranun, has a universal, timeless beauty to it that thoroughly explores both Asian and Western cultures. Sophomore art student Ava Kling’s Travaille follows, jarringly and masterfully subverting gender norms exemplified through traditional men’s workwear in a powerful artistic statement that received a ton of praise from the audience after it was showcased.
However, these three collections weren’t the only highlights of the show. Junior art student Tatyana Mustakos and senior humanities and arts student Soojin Sohn’s Morfologia were inspired by elements of the human body to create a line that was ethereal, flowy, and dynamic. Stack, designed by freshman Computer Science and Arts student Sebastian Carpenter, perhaps was the closest collection that resembled art through its use of inorganic materials to create organic structures on the models. My personal favorite (mostly due to the collection’s love affair with black), local designer Krista Wilhelm’s Nightmare, felt current, elegant, and breathtaking. Wilhelm's collection uses the color black as a tool to create an alluring collection pulled straight from my dreams.
2268, designed by junior architecture student Hamza Qureshi and decision sciences senior Anny Fan, is incredibly innovative in its use of plants and its statement on climate change. In addition, the collection feels very central to FEROX’s overall theme, a world where Lunar Gala is run by the fictional Interplanetary Federation and the event puts human culture, or “the savagery we have successfully contained,” on display. *2268’*s agenda that it seeks to promote mirrors the passion and overall storyline of Lunar Gala’s theme. The story of FEROX, as a theme and as a show, feels like a sci-fi novel masterfully interpreted not as a movie but rather as an art piece, with each act telling a larger story on the rebellious and primal nature of humanity, and how while the Federation aims to contain it, attempts are futile and how FEROX can’t be quelled, but rather stoked.
However, at its core, FEROX celebrates humanity – its history, its body, and its spirit. Latin for "fierce," FEROX celebrates our existence through its appreciation of our global and cultural history and its thoughts and dreams on humanity’s future with a fierce passion felt throughout the entire room. Lines seek to challenge social views and put forward a message with a fierce energy that refuses to be contained. It nurtures the spirit, and FEROX uses the restrictive Interplanetary Federation as a call for freedom and revolution in all senses.
Lunar Gala’s FEROX is a celebration of Carnegie Mellon’s innovation, culture, and talent among its student body. FEROX is a movement to promote greater action and creativity. And ultimately, FEROX cannot be quelled.

Last year, the Spark the Movement showcase served as a creative way for students on campus to express their thoughts and feelings on a variety social issues. Students used various forms of art forms, from dance to poetry, to bring light to relevant topics such as race, gender equality, and mental health. First introduced to the campus community as a project by former fifth year scholar Rachel Freer, Spark the Movement has now become its own student organization, which intends to host the showcase each year. The event is meant to inspire others to speak their minds on the current issues we face in society, and to create a safe space where all voices and perspectives are welcomed. 
This year’s showcase will be presented in two parts: the first will take place in Rangos Ballroom at 7:30 p.m. and will feature 12 live performances by various student dancers, singers, and poets. Viewers should expect the live performance part to tell stories of personal and social struggle, as well as hope and empowerment. The second part of the showcase will take place immediately after the first, during a reception at the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion. There, attendees can enjoy refreshments while viewing visual art pieces created by students; the visual art exhibition will continue to be displayed a week after the showcase. Events like this one are important for our campus, as they can help remind members of our community to be kind and take care of one another. 
The Spark the Movement showcase is funded by your student activities fees and the Division of Student Affairs, and the reception is being sponsored by the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion.

Could Yung Lean fill up a huge venue the way he might have been able to a couple of years ago? Probably not. But there is something about the nature of a small venue, packed to the brim that seemed to suit his concert last Saturday perfectly, lending it the energy of people bouncing off each other in a small space but also the intimacy brought by close proximity.
Many are surprised to learn that rapper Yung Lean's actual legal middle name is Leandoer, as in one who does lean. While this might make his career choice seem inevitable, apparently Leandoer is a pretty common name in Sweden. Jonatan Leandoer Håstad had been uploading tracks to Soundcloud produced by fellow "sad boys" Yung Gud and Yung Sherman when he released his first mixtape, Unknown Death 2002, in 2013, and quickly gained acclaim, which he has recognized is due in a large part to the shock factor of a Swedish person rapping in mediocre English about Mario Kart and being sad. Since then, he has released three full length studio albums.
His concert in Spirit Hall on Feb. 10 marked the last show on his tour promoting his latest album, Stranger. His openers were Thaiboy Digital and Bladee, both members of "Drain Gang" alongside Yung Lean. Contrary to the moniker, Thaiboy Digital and Bladee were an uplifting part of the evening, playing banger after banger, before being brought back during the encore for a energetic end to the Stranger tour.  
In an interview with Complex, Yung Lean called his past album, Stranger, his Pet Sounds and, though I do not count myself as a devoted fan who can chronicle his growth from a young (yung?) teenager dropping tracks from his parent's house, it is pretty easy to see how he has developed lyrically, rhythmically, and emotionally from his earlier days. Despite his belief that he has peaked in this era, his set included a lot of his classics, if songs from the early 2010's can be called classics. Perhaps this was a choice to pacify his fans, who have stuck with him through many artistic phases and life crises, but it sent the message that Yung Lean was not, by any means, attempting to bury his meme-y roots.
Where Thaiboy Digital and Bladee seemed to know that their job was to keep the crowd excited, Yung Lean was not afraid to shift the mood many times. Sometimes this meant a lull in the concert, but this was a lull I was occasionally grateful for because my face is the perfect height for being shoved into sweaty hoods of various sweatshirts. Accompanied by large inflatable sad boys on either side of the stage, as well as an audience member that clambered up to join him, Yung Lean sang favorites like "Afghanistan," "Kyoto," and "Oreomilkshake" as well as the most successful song from his new album, "Red Bottom Sky" and a personal favorite from Stranger, "Metallic Intuition."
Stranger is worth a listen, though I'm sure that some of the weaker moments translated better to a hazy, crowded, venue and the excitement of live music than, say, listening on a bus or a morning run.  Maybe Yung Lean's insistence that he is producing his best work now is not surprising, given that someone who markets themselves as a sad boy while relying on cliche to the point of absurdism will eventually have to have a reckoning where he decides if he wants to be viewed as a serious artist or a novelty. Or maybe he is just not a teenager anymore and his music reflects the growth and trauma of maturing in the public eye. 
Either way, this concert showcased both tortured artist Yung Lean and quirky weird Yung Lean from the internet, and proved that, though neither of those facets were life-changing for me, both were pretty solid. Bra jobb Yung Lean!

On Black Panther: The Album, Kendrick Lamar crafts a bold, uncompromising cinematic soundtrack while ceding the spotlight to its array of wonderful guests. Lamar's presence is felt all over the album, and yet he rarely dominates a single track. The only track where he is the sole listed artist is the opener, aptly titled "Black Panther." On it, Lamar opens the album with an experimental thematic unifier that carries through the rest of the project. That unification is the sound, which Lamar has crafted specifically for this project. His curative touch is felt on every track, even when he is completely absent. For an album that has such a substantial number of established artists, each with their own following and unique sound, Lamar and his producers manage to bring together a project far more cohesive than most modern records.
As he often speaks for numerous people in his life on his solo records, Lamar instead opts to adopt the personas of characters from the film, reserving his voice for introductions and transitions for several tracks. From King T'Challa to villain Erik Killmonger, all of Lamar's personas feel calculated, but they don't overstay their welcome. When Lamar delivers a proper verse, it is show-stopping. On "King's Dead," Lamar recaptures the lightning-in-a-bottle energy of last year's "DNA." Make no mistake, these tracks could easily find themselves on one of Lamar's seminal albums. They're developed well, produced well, provocative, intentionally crafted, and catchy as hell.
Perhaps most impressive is Lamar's predilection for taking the least famous artists on the bill and bringing them to the forefront. As Rapsody received the most prominent feature on To Pimp a Butterfly with "Complexion (A Zulu Love)," South African female rapper Yugen Blakrok steals the show on "Opps." Numerous South African artists appear on the project, from Saudi to Sjava to Babes Wodumo. It is amazing to see African artists appear alongside prominent African-American artists. The album stands as a unapologetic celebration of black culture across the globe.
The album seems like a sum of all the best parts of modern hip hop. From the trap-infused flute sample on banger "Big Shot" to the bouncy SoCal anthem "Paramedic!," the project brings an impressive array of sounds to the table while seeming consistent. Even "Redemption" - on which DAMN. collaborator Zacari returns - incorporates a native African sound courtesy of Wodumo. Perhaps boldest is "Seasons," a devastating song covering three artists' comeups. Most impressive, however, is that the song is bilingual. Sjava's opening verse is written and performed in Zulu. That one fact elevates the track to importance on the album, as it connects the struggles of black people all across the globe while calling for strength, resilience and perseverance. Thanks to the aforementioned Sjava verse and excellent verses from Mozzy and Reason, this track stands out, even with Kendrick only appearing in the outro in spoken word form.
Vince Staples delivers an excellent performance in "Opps," and The Weeknd brings his usual dark angelic energy to closer "Pray For Me." Jorja Smith steals the album with the darkly smooth "I Am," and Ab Soul, Anderson Paak, and James Blake team up on the wonderfully dreary "Bloody Waters." Everyone who appears on the project - aside from maybe Zacari, who is outshone by Wodumo during his appearance - justifies their place in the tracklist, and all feel committed to producing a quality, cohesive, unique album.
Black Panther: The Album stands as one the best albums of the year already, and it is a movie soundtrack. That is extraordinary, and it speaks to the vision and talent of Kendrick Lamar, who once again brings out the best in a long list of collaborators and delivers another fantastic project.

This weekend, Aisha and I really went outside of our comfort zone. It was the one night that we were able to get a big group of friends together, and we went all out. Venturing far outside of our usual domains, we found ourselves downtown at Sienna Mercato. This place has three different places rolled into one. The first floor is a meatball restaurant, Emporio, and much more casual, the next floor, Mezzo, is a pizza place that is a bit more upscale, and the final top floor, Il Tetto, is a rooftop beer garden. This was where we found ourselves spending most of our night.
The location: Located on Penn Ave., Sienna Mercato is in the middle of all the action downtown. This makes it a considerable ride away from campus, so it's not the place to just stop by on a night out, it's your destination for the night. Going downtown however, you're far less likely to see Carnegie Mellon students so if you're looking for a break from the campus scene you'll definitely find it here. I won't say that the people you'll find will be better, but they'll certainly be different.
The drinks: The drinks here were very strong because this is a bar where actual adults go and you'll think you're having a great time until you get the bill. Make no mistake, this is a rooftop bar in downtown with an amazing view when the rooftop is open in the summer. You are not going to get away with having a good time with just 20 bucks. But, if you're prepared to splurge, you'll get some nice drinks. Also, if you're an avid beer drinker, this is a beer garden, so you'll find a nice range of drafts. I didn't have any beer, but it certainly was tempting. Perhaps when I go back for a more calm night I'll just relax and have a beer on the roof instead of taking tequila shots.
The vibe: The vibe here is a bit more adult. There's a good mix of people wearing jeans but also suits here. It was a bit strange because the music was very hype and they played a lot of popular music. However, this wasn't really the place to dance. No one was really dancing and the people I was with seemed to be the only people that even recognized the music. The playlist made me feel like I was back in Shadyside buying songs on TouchTunes, but the environment was not like that at all. There could have been a better vibe if more people wanted to dance, but it was still nice.
Lit or nah: This is tricky. I really like the space and the drinks were good and the music was nice, but I don't know if the vibe here can be described as lit. I felt like my group was having a lit time, but everyone else kind of seemed to just be having a casual night out. So this place is kind of what you make it. With the rooftop part actually open, it's hard to not have a good time with the incredible view of downtown that it gives you. I'll definitely be going back to further gauge the situation, but not until I've gotten paid enough money to bounce back from the weekend I just had.

On Oct. 15, the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), along with the Student Government Executive and the Undergraduate Student Senate, issued an open call through The Tartan to the Board of Trustees, expressing our displeasure towards students being excluded from the Presidential Search Committee. 
More than four months later, we are writing to share our continued and increasing disappointment about this policy of active exclusion. The only thing more unfortunate than the lack of student representation has been the silence the Board of Trustees has adopted and an implicit refusal to reform in the future.
Through that open call, we asked for student inclusion in the Presidential Search Committee. We also asked for more campus forums than the two token 45-minute “listening” sessions that were organized to gather student opinion. 
Students who attended the fora decried the absence of student representation and the opaqueness with which the search process was being conducted. They also voiced frustration at the Search Committee’s refusal to answer direct questions. But, members of the Search Committee were steadfast in keeping up appearances and ignoring the students’ requests. 
We proposed that the process be amended to allow student representation on the Presidential Search Committee. We also proposed the idea of the creation of a student advisory body as a short-term solution and more engagement with the Board of Trustees at both undergraduate and graduate levels to ensure shared governance.
These simple requests for further student involvement were reiterated in numerous communications with the Search Committee  —  both over email and in two meetings. However, the Committee has taken none of these requests seriously. 
In the absence of any meaningful dialogue on student involvement, these meetings look like nothing more than a poor attempt at checking boxes. 
While the Search Committee was meeting with a few student leaders to understand what we sought in a new President, a report had already appeared in The San Diego Union Tribune proving this was all a pretense. The report stated the Committee had already made an unsuccessful attempt to recruit the Chancellor of University of California San Diego for the position of Carnegie Mellon’s next president. 
If the Committee was already attempting to recruit someone, it’s fair to assume they knew what qualities they wanted in the new president, without student input. What, then, was the purpose of those meetings?
It is important to re-emphasize that universities are places of higher learning which would not exist without students. When choosing someone to lead these universities, it should be a no-brainer that each of the university’s constituencies should have a voice in the process. 
We understand that the addition of a few students on the Search Committee may not accurately reflect the entirety of experience of this 13,961-member strong constituency. But surely, it will be better than having no students on the Committee. 
Current students would bring a lived student experience and a fresh perspective to the committee that no other group could bring. However, those calling the shots decided this important voice is not worthy of inclusion in the decision-making process. 
Some are concerned that, by opening the process to students, they would also have to invite other stakeholders, such as non-university residents of Pittsburgh. This is an egregious argument, as students are key stakeholders in the Carnegie Mellon community. Stated concerns, such as confidentiality or capping the committee size are condescending and show a lack of respect for our student body. In fact, the question of whether or not this process should be secret is an open one that merits a different debate altogether.
While many forward looking universities have progressed from this antiquated search process, Carnegie Mellon seems to be caught in a slumber —snoozing and refusing to wake up.
A noteworthy example is Harvard University, which has recently completed its 29th Presidential Search with the help of an 18-member student advisory board. This is not as recent a development as members of the Carnegie Mellon Board of Trustees would have you believe; Harvard first included students more than a decade ago in their 2006 Presidential Search. And Harvard is not alone. Princeton opened up the process almost three decades ago in their 1989 search, and Stanford opened it up in 1999.
The Presidential Search Process at Carnegie Mellon is “led by the Board of Trustees, in collaboration with the Faculty Senate.” The Search Committee is comprised of equal representation from the Board of Trustees and the Faculty. The leadership of the committee is also split between the two bodies. 
Given this reality, the blame for excluding the students from the Search Committee should also be split between the Board and the members of the Faculty. At the time of writing, there has been no public endorsement of student representation in the Search Committee by the Faculty Senate or faculty members of the committee — just silence and passing the buck to the Board of Trustees. 
Assuming that the decision on composition of the search committee rests solely with the Board, we would like to ask the Faculty Senate to weigh in on this debate and clarify whether they believe the search process and the Board of Trustees should have greater student participation.
For a university that prides itself on decentralization and shared governance, Carnegie Mellon fails to let some constituencies, namely students and staff, participate in key conversations. Without a better model for shared governance with students, what avenues do we have for improving the Carnegie Mellon experience for ourselves and those who come next?

On Feb. 14, the United States experienced one of the deadliest school shootings in its history. Nikolas Cruz, armed with an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle and magazines of ammunition, opened fire in the hallways of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. 
According to The New York Times, Cruz arrived at the school shortly before dismissal time via an Uber, and made his way towards the freshman building. Cruz shot at people in the hallways and in five classrooms on the first and second floors. He discarded his weapons on the third floor and fled the scene. As of Feb. 18, the death toll is 17 people: 14 students and 3 faculty members. Cruz is currently facing 17 counts of premeditated murder and is being held without bond at the main Broward County jail.
The incident in Florida especially hit home this week, as Carnegie Mellon faced a credible online threat by a student indicating a desire to go onto a roof with a sniper rifle. The email threat, sent to an internal Carnegie Mellon University web platform, contained threatening rhetoric possibly copied from a post on Reddit, an online discussion board, and pasted without further context. A Carnegie Mellon University professor, upon discovering the threat, immediately notified the police. 
The Carnegie Mellon undergraduate is facing misdemeanor charges for making terroristic threats, and was removed from campus. With a misdemeanor level offense, the student was charged by summons. He was not arrested but, according to an email from Interim President Farnam Jahanian, has been “removed from our community,” and is currently not being held in jail.
Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, reviewed the protocols of Carnegie Mellon University security when it comes to threats on campus in a statement to The Tartan. “No threat of physical harm to members of our community is acceptable... the stakes are too high,” she said in an email to The Tartan, “If we learn of a potential threat to this community, we work in consultation with law enforcement to immediately assess any risk. If we believe our community is in danger, we will use our emergency notification system, employing text, cell phone, and loudspeakers to instruct members of our community how to be safe.”
This year marks a gruesome year for gun violence in this country. According to The New York Times, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months. Among them are the Florida shooting this week, the Las Vegas massacre at the Harvest Music Festival where 58 attendees were killed, and the Texas Baptist church shooting in Sutherland Springs that claimed 26 lives. 
All three of these shootings have one commonality: the gunmen used assault rifles to commit their crimes. None of the FBI’s Instant Criminal Background Check Systems indicated that Cruz and the Texas gunman should be barred from owning firearms, despite their histories of agitation and misconduct.
The events contribute to a historically contentious debate on gun control between Democrats and Republicans, especially surrounding the availability of semi-automatic weapons such as the one Cruz used. Assault rifles like the AK-47 and AR-15 are relatively easy to acquire given their price and usability. Variants of the AR-15 were used in the mass killings of the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Additionally, according to The New York Times, there is little regulation on retrofitted accessories, such as the bumpstock the Las Vegas festival shooter used that harnessed recoil to accelerate a semi-automatic rifle’s rate of fire. According to law enforcement, the AR-15 Cruz used was purchased legally a year ago at Sunrise Tactical Supply in Florida.
Despite having unprecedented rates of gun violence among the most developed countries, the U.S. has done little to combat the problem. In fact, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, the number of gun deaths has increased in the past years; gun deaths rose by 5,000 between the years 2012 and 2016. U.S. Congress is gridlocked on whether tightening measures of gun control is constitutional, despite frequent outcries of harsher measures and universal background checks after devastating incidents such as the Florida school shooting. Given previous cases of school shootings, it is possible that the following debates on gun control in the legislature will not lead to momentous gun reform.
You can help out the victims of the Florida school shooting by donating to the Stoneman Douglas Victims’ Fund at https://www.gofundme.com/stonemandouglasvictimsfund. Proceeds will go directly to the families affected by the event, and will cover funeral and medical expenses. Please beware of fraudulent accounts that may pose as funds for the victims.
Lastly, the recent Carnegie Mellon University incident is a reminder of the chilling reality of gun violence in America. Educational institutions should take extra precautions. If you see something suspicious, do not hesitate to contact authorities. 
Vice President Gina Casalegno advised that “these episodes may be a good occasion for all of us to spend time re-familiarizing ourselves with university resources and guidance about staying safe.” She recommended reviewing The Word: Student Handbook’s section on emergencies and emergency notifications and safety tips on active shooters on the University Police’s website, both of which can be found at cmu.edu, before finally stating she was “deeply grateful to the expertise and care of our University Police Department every day in assuring our community’s safety.”

This past Thursday, Carnegie Mellon announced that five faculty members had been awarded the prestigious Sloan Research Fellowship. Sloan Foundation president Adam Falk, via a Carnegie Mellon press release, described fellows as “the brightest minds, tackling the hardest problems, and succeeding brilliantly — fellows are quite literally the future of 21st century science.”
The Sloan Research Fellowship is a unique opportunity for early-career researchers of Chemistry, Computational and Evolutionary, Biology Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Ocean Science, and Physics. In addition to the prestige, the Sloan Foundation, who awards the Fellowship, gives lump sums of $65,000 to winners, with very few strings attached.
As one might expect, the competition for such an award is fierce. The award can be used for anything that will further the research of early-career, distinguished scientists, and since its creation, it has been a contested and selective award. Over 700 researchers were nominated by their institutions this year for just 126 fellowships.
In order to be considered, one must be on track to receive tenure at a degree-granting institution, hold a Ph.D in one of the aforementioned disciplines, and have received it after Sept. 1, 2011. The applicant must also show strong ability to do independent research, and be in the beginning of their career.
In past years, Carnegie Mellon University has received far fewer Sloan Research Fellowships, averaging just under two a year. Receiving five fellowships in one year is a feat that has never been achieved by Carnegie Mellon faculty since the award’s inception in 1955.
50 Carnegie Mellon University faculty have been granted the fellowship since 1955. This year, five top campus scientists join this prestigious list. They come from different backgrounds and study a myriad of subjects but are now all members of a very select, elite group of scientists.
Venkat Viswanathan, an assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering, researches energy storage and battery technology, with goals of innovating a more sustainable economy. He received his Ph.D from Stanford University and joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty shortly after in 2014.
Assistant professor of Computational Biology Andreas Pfenning is studying computational and experimental genomic techniques, with a goal of understanding how speech developed and understanding Alzheimer’s disease. He received his Ph.D from Duke University, and joined Carnegie Mellon faculty in 2016 after post-doctoral research jointly with Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Andrew Pavlo, an assistant professor of Computer Science, studies database management systems and large-scale data analytics. After getting his Ph.D from Brown University in 2013, he joined the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon.
Jointly appointed in both the Computer Science Department and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, assistant professor Bryan Parno studies the design and creation of secure systems. He received his Ph.D from Carnegie Mellon University and was named a top 30 scientist under 30 by Forbes in 2011.
Assistant professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute Chris Harrison also directs the Future Interfaces Group, which researches sensing and interaction techniques in relation to mobile devices and touch interfaces. He received his Ph.D from Carnegie Mellon University, and was also named a top 30 scientist under 30 by Forbes in 2012, in addition to other awards.
All of the described Carnegie Mellon faculty do impactful and innovative research that will shape the future of our world. Their accomplishments so early in their career are sublime and indicative of the forward-thinking work of Carnegie Mellon researchers. Carnegie Mellon University is certainly lucky to have these professors all on campus, teaching and researching, and there is sure to be a lot to look forward to in terms of what they pursue with the force and the funding of the Sloan Foundation behind them.

Hillary Clinton's surprising loss in the 2016 presidential election still has not fully sunken in for me. Rather, Donald Trump's "victory" still has not quite sunken in, even as we collectively begin to understand the complex array of circumstances that caused the upset. We know voter turnout played a huge role; Trump supporters showed up in droves while hesitant moderates and liberals dissatisfied with Clinton's candidacy did not. We know that James Comey's last-second letter might have just given Trump the edge he needed to win. As important as it is to reckon with the significance of such a devastating outcome — with an egotistical, childish reality television star who has around 20 sexual harassment and assault allegations being elected leader of the free world — we must move forward in a way that is responsible in addressing the reasons Trump won and respectful of those left behind simultaneously.
For that reason, there is value to be found in examining the role of Hillary Clinton post-election. Clinton kept busy, publishing a book about the election not even a year after her loss. Now, she has turned her focus to speaking at events, giving talks about the effect of climate change on women specifically.
And yet, she has faced heightened scrutiny for not disappearing completely. Historically, coverage of losing candidates following presidential elections has been scrutinizing. Media outlets famously covered Al Gore's weight gain following his drawn out 2000 loss. But, none have faced the level of criticism Clinton has. Mitt Romney, who lost to President Obama in 2012, just announced a Senate bid to fairly widespread conservative fanfare (at least for conservatives disillusioned with Trump). Clinton went through the ringer during the election for a number of overblown scandals designed to vilify her. Some, like the disproved Benghazi scandal, were planned years in advance to tarnish her name. But she has continued to be Trump's favorite Twitter target even now, with the election over a year behind us. This is not to say that she has not criticized the President, but then again she never tried to #lockhimup.
But some, including many liberals, take issue with her continued presence in the public sphere. Some think Clinton's candidacy damaged the party and that Democrats should distance themselves from her in an effort to shake the narratives that made 2016 such a disaster. Others think Clinton has been victimized and deserves retribution for her loss in an election where she won the popular vote by three million votes. Either way, Democrats are still divided, and that is especially troubling for a party that has an opportunity to take back the House and Senate this year at midterms. That division would certainly be heightened by a sudden reemergence of Clinton into electoral politics.
So then, how can Clinton contribute to a country she has devoted her entire life to improving? Some might suggest her taking on the speaker role more regularly. To others, she would be best served to work in higher education like former Vice President Joe Biden at the University of Pennsylvania. Beyond that, work in civics like that of the newly formed Obama Foundation might be a healthy way for Clinton to engage with supporters without drawing too much scrutiny from fellow Democrats. I do not believe that simply fading into obscurity is productive, or even realistic for Hillary Clinton. She has proven to be one of the more resilient politicians of modern times and has drawn much admiration for it. So does the future of the Democratic Party involve Clinton at the helm? No. The party needs to get younger and appeal to a broader base of voters. As we learned in 2008 with the election of Barack Obama, the ability to mobilize voters from all sects of the population wins elections. Clinton did not do that and it was ultimately her downfall, but she has the opportunity to contribute to this country outside the electoral landscape. In the meantime, Democrats should look for a young leader to inspire young voters who are seriously disillusioned with Trump. As millennials become an increasingly large portion of the eligible electorate, Democrats should seek to appeal to them to aid their chances against an aging, shrinking Republican Party.

Yet again, America finds itself in a heated debate over gun violence. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) summarized the right's general consensus on gun control by stating that increasing gun control regulations would be ineffective because someone who wants to commit shootings "will find a way to get the gun to do it.” Conversely, Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) demanded "smart gun safety laws" and for us to "[not] tolerate a society and live in a country with any level of pride when our babies are being slaughtered."
No sensible person would look at a tragedy like the one in Parkland, FL and wish for such an incident to happen again. People on both ends of the gun control debate generally hold their respective views because they genuinely believe that the way to lessen gun violence is through their respective beliefs. Although this core intention may be similar across the spectrum, it often gets lost in the pathos-driven "debates" we see. We still have far to go in terms of initiating fruitful dialogue, listening, and creating solutions.
Already, there are attempts to change policies in wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Alabama has already introduced legislation allowing educators to carry firearms. State Representative Will Ainsworth echoed Rubio's sentiment, saying "more gun control will not stop someone who is intent upon inflicting harm in our schools, but someone who is properly trained and armed with the right equipment certainly can." Educators in the state had requested he introduce such a bill, showing that he is not alone in believing that increasing arms within schools will prevent another school shooting. Meanwhile, the left is clamoring and demanding tighter gun regulations, so much that political commentator Tomi Lahren tweeted "Can the Left let the families grieve for even 24 hours before they push their anti-gun and anti-gunowner agenda?... This isn't about a gun it's about another lunatic." However, she has yet to make such a statement towards Ainsworth and his use of the shooting to "push his pro-gunowner agenda." This kind of shutdown of dialogue to project one's own opinion further polarizes the two sides, making the chance of actually striking a solution even smaller.
Another common facet of the argument about gun violence is the "mental health" versus "gun control" mentality people seem to have. President Donald Trump, in response to the Sutherland Springs, TX church shooting in 2017, said that the problem "isn't a guns situation...[it's] a mental health problem at the highest level." On the other end of the spectrum, we find voices shifting the blame solely to gun regulation. This kind of mentality treats the problem of gun violence as if there can only be one cause. A need for reform in gun regulations is not mutually exclusive to a need for a reform in how America handles mental health, yet saying the problem lies in one area or another implies just that. Of course, there are people in the middle who think that the problem lies in between these two poles, or some new pole altogether. However, the prominent voices appear to be these two ends. If we want to get any closer to finding a solution to the prevalence of gun violence in America, we have to recognize all — meaning anywhere from one to infinity — factors that contribute.
Finally, we need to stop believing in this sentiment: "numbers don't lie." Quantifiable data can effectively strengthen ethos in one's argument, but we must consider the context in which we draw the numbers from. For instance, when pro-gun regulators bring up countries such as South Korea and their respective statistics to support their gun-regulation thesis, what the statistics fail to mention is that South Korea does not have the "gun culture," if you will, that exists in America. America is founded so heavily on the notion that gun ownership is a right, in no small part thanks to the Second Amendment and the reinforcement of the belief that guns are important to everyday people. Furthermore, guns are almost integrated into American culture; we live in a country in which a man in Decatur, AL can legally promote his roofing company by offering a free gun per roof and where a man can legally carry his AR-15 and walk into the terminal of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport — the busiest airport in the world —  with no legal consequences. However, none of this would be fathomable in countries such as South Korea. Hearing someone owns a gun would raise a few eyebrows there; in America, not so much. Thus, simply installing Korea's gun laws into America would not work. People in Korea have their optimal strategy: "given hardly anybody has a gun, I don't need one either." America lacks this given statement, thus our optimal strategy looks more like this: "given anyone around me probably has a gun, I might need one."
Alternatively, those who claim that guns don't make a society deadlier and bring up numbers to support this claim also fall guilty of believing "numbers don't lie." Conservative political commentator Steven Crowder has been a consistent opponent of gun regulations and throws in numbers to support his claims. However, about half of his sources for his video "'Common Sense' Gun Control Debunked! (Man-On-Street)!" were biased, leaning against gun regulation. Concepts such as p-hacking, where researchers select data that will provide them the results that they desire, are no stranger to the natural sciences, never mind the social sciences. Although Crowder did put two government websites, an overwhelming portion of his information came from less credible sources. Furthermore, the right bringing up countries such as Switzerland, which has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the world, to argue America doesn't have a gun problem is also naive at best. Switzerland takes gun ownership more seriously than America does. Whereas guns are often handed down in the US or given as gifts, the people in Switzerland are cognizant of the responsibility owning a gun entails. Qualities such as discipline, mandatory military service, awareness of the gravity of gun ownership, and more accessible healthcare all contribute; simply installing their gun ownership statistics to America without considering other cultural aspects would not work.
I understand such controversial topics such as gun control will not have a clean solution. Regardless of whatever is enacted, there will be many people disappointed. However, the fact that we cannot satisfy everyone — or even the majority of America — should not discourage us from having these difficult discussions. Although we should not detach from emotions altogether, we need to learn to have these discussions without making others feel as though they are attacked or allowing ourselves to feel attacked.

Sacred Heart Greenwich, a private Catholic school in Greenwich, CT, informed 16-year old student Kate Murray on Feb. 6 that if she did not remove her Planned Parenthood sticker from her laptop, she would be forced to leave the school either immediately or at the end of her academic year. Hundreds of alumnae of the high school spoke out, calling or writing to their alma mater to discuss their thoughts on the issue and voicing their disappointment.  In addition to voicing their outrage on the situation, some even called out the institution on Sacred Heart’s policies and overall environment through social media platforms. But no matter the response that these young women had towards it, I would bet that nearly all the alumnae, especially younger ones like myself, were all shocked and a little shaken.
Murray’s possible expulsion not only caught the attention of my town’s local paper, but also the attention of The New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, and even prominent British newspapers such as The Daily Mail and The Independent. And as I watched my alma mater get thrust in an unwanted and unneeded spotlight for 15 minutes of fame last week, I started to think more about my Sacred Heart experience, a time where people were already heavily pushed to excel in school and speak up towards injustice either within Sacred Heart or among the outside world. We should have pushed, or been pushed, more.
This is not the first time my high school has gotten into a larger fuss over, at their core, very small and petty situations. However, these were mostly dealt with internally and swiftly, becoming a gust in school culture and gossip for a short period of time. Murray’s possible expulsion — “an extreme reaction to a very small sticker” — was a hurricane, and Sacred Heart was unprepared. Murray’s “very small sticker” came up in discussion around the town of Greenwich, and Sacred Heart’s initial press responses felt too mechanical.
Sacred Heart finally came to the conclusion to allow Murray to attend Sacred Heart Greenwich with her Planned Parenthood sticker last Monday and is now “forming a working group to facilitate a transparent, thorough examination of the environment for independent thinking and the articulate expression of ideas within our curriculum and student life” made up of members of the school community that aims to “examine the clarity, consistency and appropriateness of [Sacred Heart]’s policies regarding personal expression,“ according to the Sacred Heart website. It is an acknowledgment that activism is alive and well within the Sacred Heart environment, and that maybe their goal to be a school “where young women become global leaders” is happening at a quicker pace than they thought it was. It is an acknowledgment of their faults and their efforts to regain favor within their community. It is an effort to facilitate a new stronger strain of activism within their 731-student body. It is an acknowledgment of the sharp cultural divide between abortion and the Catholic faith. But, it is also an acknowledgment on the power and necessity of change within their environment, and a realization that Sacred Heart needs to continue to nurture their students’ passion and energy to fight for what they believe in.
Within the span of a mere few days, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School has generated enough passion and energy to fuel their state, and it is already being cultivated with quick intensity. Students and survivors of Wednesday’s horrific shooting refuse to back down on their support for stricter gun control laws, and already have a battle plan on how to show it. The students started a rally in Fort Lauderdale last Saturday and Florida-based South Broward High School staged a walkout last Friday to voice their support, thus kicking off a schedule of several walkouts, protests, and rallies all across the country that support stricter gun control. The two most notable walkouts planned are one occurring March 14, which would mark the school shooting’s one month anniversary and is co-hosted by Women’s March; and one occurring on April 20, which would mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre. They are encouraging people to vote against politicians funded by the National Rifle Association, and have called out Trump and his administration to demand change to current legislation and to offer more than just thoughts and prayers.
As of now, Carnegie Mellon’s landmark The Fence is painted in all white with #MeToo written on its posts. Besides advertising club events and celebrating community pride, The Fence has also become a place to show support of important social causes and to cherish diverse opinions. This is just one of the many ways that Carnegie Mellon nurtures social activism and discussion, and in the wake of national division, high schools need to do the same. Activism has become necessary, and debates on topics such as gun control and abortion are becoming increasingly harder to avoid. There will be some instances where it will require regulation. Sometimes, there will need to be an established order, good planning, and moral boundaries on protesting and speaking your mind. But in our current administration, activism seems to be really the only way anything will ever get done and should be motivated and taught alongside.
High school student and survivor Emma Gonzalez remarked that “it is time for victims to be the change we need to see” during Saturday’s rally. In Sandy Hook, these are elementary school children and their parents. While not victims in the same sense, Sacred Heart students and alumnae are being incorporated into this group examining personal expression. But in Parkland, these are high school students. And if that’s the case, high schools should start building a stronger foundation in their students now to shape them into a better generation of representatives than what the nation currently has.

Literature is meant to be a lens through which we view the world. It's not the only lens, by any means, but it's one that is ingrained in our education systems and in our daily lives. From a young age, we learn about classic stories — books that everyone knows to some degree: Romeo and Juliet, Animal Farm, for instance. Books that have themes that resonate with all of us in their own ways, even if we've never read them. They're embedded in our everyday conversations naturally.
These books are important. They contain universal ideas and still have so much value today, but they aren't enough. They don't reflect the realities of people's lives today, of a world with everything from smartphones and police brutality. There's an implicit idea that the past is somehow more whole and purer; therefore, we should look back for ideas. Modern books, especially the books that become our pop culture moments that are usually geared towards teenagers, are meant to be thought as being on the opposing end of the spectrum from classic books. One holds the secrets of humanity, the other is bite-sized bits of colorful fluff, stories of teen angst and vampires. 
Here's the thing: pop culture moments reflect the world around us. Especially in the U.S., these books say important things about the state of our country. This is especially important in the context of diverse books. The publishing industry began to truly focus on diversity over the last few years, which has resulted in a dazzling array of main characters. There are stories with people of color displayed front and center on their covers, books about LGBTQ+ characters and relationships, and books featuring characters with disabilities that don't just use them as a plot function. These are books meant to share experiences that go beyond the basic narrative, and help people empathize with others and also examine features of their own lives. 
The viewpoint that modern books don't have the same weight as classics undermines the necessity to keep using literature as a way to understand the present and not just the past. It's important to respect and reflect on the realities of today, of stories that are anchored to the world we live in at the moment. This past week, the American Library Association announced its annual awards. These are the awards that result in the shiny metallic stickers on the cover of books, books that many of us read when we were younger, and continue to read today. The most interesting award is the William Morris Award, which is given to a debut author in young adult literature. The finalists this year were diverse in theme and scope, addressing everything from Islamophobia to race-based police brutality. These are books that discuss topics that aren't covered by classic books, and showcase narratives that are often forgotten. The finalists of that competition may now bear that shiny medal, but it's important that we still respect them and their peers even without those awards.
There's a tendency to diminish things that are geared towards young people. It's the same reason there are a million think pieces that bash millennials for avocado toast. We mock things that are new, that deviate from the known path. However, these different stories and perspectives are so important to recognize. They explore themes that aren't yet part of the public consciousness in the way that classics are. 
Literature is an important tool for sharing perspectives and ideas. It doesn't have to be limited to a set of old books. We should follow the lead of the American Library Association and seek out excellence in the books that are coming out, that push the boundaries of what we know and expect. So many books that we learn about in school vary from the experiences people go through in real life. We need to incorporate stories that students can truly relate to and deal with the themes that they think about. As we continue to challenge our societal norms and ideas, literature will only serve to help.

Why do we watch the Olympic Games?
Every four years, the Olympics, summer and winter, come and go. We hear the loud drum of NBC's Olympics musical theme. We watch sports that we’ve never heard of and we fall in love with athletes we don’t hear about for another four years. We get wrapped up in a national fervor, as if all the millions of people watching feel the same happiness or disappointment. There’s something magical about the Olympics: the human stories, the dreams coming true (or crashing to a halt), and the national pride.
But if dig a little deeper, these feelings of hope and joy and pride can start to feel a little contrived. These athletes around the world have dedicated their lives to their sport — nothing can or should be taken away from that. But after watching heavily-produced, tear-inducing athlete pieces (by NBC in the United States), these tactics can feel manipulative. After watching NBC cut events from the main broadcast because there are not any Americans competing, after hearing commentators rave on and on about American athletes without much notice to the other athletes, after we ourselves feed into this nationalism through social media, patriotism can bleed to jingoism, the type of nationalism that becomes chauvinistic, fanatical, and belligerent.
The ancient Olympics, which began no later than 776 B.C., was a sporting event held in Olympia, Greece, to celebrate the Greek Olympian gods. In 1896, the modern Olympics was revived by French noble Pierre de Coubertin to promote a physical education program. It is also a symbol of unity among the countries of the world. Despite this second purpose, the Olympics throughout history have been ripe for political controversy, with political antagonism between different countries bleeding into the Games, and these events being used as propaganda to show off the might of individual countries.
The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin was a perfect tool for this type of propaganda, feeding into the nationalist agenda of Hitler and Nazi Germany. The boycotts of the 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics in Moscow and Los Angeles, respectively, mirrored the Cold War animosity between the United States and the Soviet Union. Even one of the greatest moments in Olympic history (for Americans), the "Miracle on Ice", cannot be divorced from the context of the Cold War.
The jingoism of the Olympics is a necessary evil. They give countries an outlet to flex their muscles, to present the best of their best, to one-up of other countries without bloodshed. Before (and after) 1896, countries mainly exerted power over each other through war, conquest, and colonialism. This continued in the 20th century after the revival of the Olympics, but as independence movements spread around the world in the latter half of the century, the Olympics became an even more important way for countries to showcase their superiority. Athletic competition, no matter how patriotically it is broadcast, is a far better alternative than violent imperialism, though imperialism does still exist today (albeit in a slightly evolved version).
This potentially harmful nationalist perspective is not developed solely through NBC's coverage of the Olympics. We are part of the problem. We scream the "U! S! A!" chant. We provide fodder for other countries to resent our obnoxious bravado, our air of superiority. In the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, American swimmer Lily King took issue with Russian competitor Yulia Yefimova's history with performance enhancing drugs. King defeated Yefimova for the gold and told reporters that she believed athletes with histories of doping should be barred form competition. Twitter immediately exploded with celebratory memes and jokes at Yefimova's expense. Generations of negative feelings about Russians came out, as they are wont to do whenever they are given the chance. The use of performance enhancing drugs and how governing bodies address it is a serious one, but keyboard-happy people turned it into a funnel of one-sided patriotism.
Sometimes, however, the Olympics have fulfilled their original purpose, uniting countries and their citizens as the world watches. During the Olympics, we often see athletes from different countries congratulating each other, celebrating a healthy competitive spirit. We have witnessed powerful moments of hope and strength that transcended national boundaries: Britain's Derek Redmond's race finish, Kerri Strug's one-foot landing, the Black Power Salute of Tommie Smith and John Carlos. In the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the athletes of North and South Korea marched together. This also happened in the opening ceremony of the current Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, although the motivations for this attempt at unity have been met with some skepticism.
In its essence, the Olympics ultimately serve as a form of entertainment, a way to bring a family together around a television. It’s fun to learn about unfamiliar sports and unfamiliar countries, to watch people do things we could never do before our very eyes, and it’s truly inspiring to see athletes fight through adversity in pursuit of their dreams. We experience the Olympic spirit that we hope to carry on in our own lives. But as we watch enthusiastically from our couches, as we yell and scream and cry and cheer, let’s remember to watch with our minds as well as our hearts, and take it all in with a grain of salt.

The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights started off 2018 with a published report on public education funding inequity, a 100-page briefing on the organization’s key findings on public education in K-12 schools. The Commission majority found that “many students in the U.S. living in segregated neighborhoods and concentrations of poverty do not have access to high-quality schools simply because of where they live.” The problem, according to the commission's report, is that too many schools remain segregated along racial and socioeconomic lines. Moreover, there are significant disparities in school funding from state to state, district to district, and school to school. These disparities exacerbate the problems of struggling students, and research even shows that students living in poverty often show up to school needing extra help and extra resources. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who has stated that “equal access to a quality education should be a right for every American,” has been consistently under fire for school privatization efforts, putting a disproportionate amount of attention on charter school, private school, and religious school systems.
Perhaps her neglect of public school systems is rooted in the scope of its complications. Since the 1954 court ruling of Brown v. Board of Education that public education is a “right which must be available on all equal terms,” racially segregated public school facilities have been unconstitutional. However historic the decision is, the ruling provided little guidance on how to desegregate schools, moreover on how to provide equal access to educational facilities across all socioeconomic and racial platforms. With little practical guidance and resistance to reinforce the law in the South, desegregation took decades to fully occur. The South's segregation in housing policies exacerbated the problems black Americans faced as well, while efforts to change it, such as the 1968 Fair Housing Act, were palliative, piecemeal, and not thoroughly effective. As school enrollments changed, many predominantly minority schools experienced double de facto segregation, or segregation by both race and concentrated poverty. Because schools are largely funded by revenue generated from local property taxes, schools in poorer communities are often underfunded. This is part of a negative feedback loop that contributes to the “dropout factory,” where students in these communities face challenges in achievement, lower graduation rates, high teacher turnover, and instability of enrollment.
If the country is intent on fixing the existing side effects of school segregation and housing discrimination, the Commission provides a handful of recommendations to start. Among them is a need to develop a national standard for eliminating school segregation, and increase federal funding for desegregated school districts. This is a tricky suggestion in that precedence from court rulings such as San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez Supreme Court declared that the federal government is not constitutionally obligated to provide public education. However, such decisions should be revisited, especially in the wake of a broken system of under-performing public schools overcome with poverty, and financial disasters that struck poorer states the hardest. The longstanding and persistent reality is that the vast funding inequities in state public education systems are significant in rendering the education available to millions of American public school students profoundly unequal.
In the end, the debate on equal funding for public schools is centered on whether the role of the federal government in providing resources to ensure equity on a state level is compulsory. However, what is indisputable is that the federal government granted that public education is a right which must be available on all equal terms. Implementation of that right has been insufficient since the Supreme Court’s declaration, and because the federal government has decided to act upon the precedence by enforcing desegregation by the 1970’s, it must finish its job by establishing long-term policies that will grant equal opportunities for all children in the public education system.
