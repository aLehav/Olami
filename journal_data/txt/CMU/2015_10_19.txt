The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team took the field on a brisk evening Friday night to face off against the University of Rochester Yellowjackets. This game was truly a tale of two halves, capped off with two nail-biting periods of overtime that ended the game in a 2–2 draw.
Coming off a win last week against New York University, the Tartan men were looking to fight for a winning record in conference play to determine their seeding in the playoffs, and the first half certainly seemed to be putting them on the right track. The Tartans came out strong in the first half with an aggressive offensive push, and they were rewarded for their efforts early with a goal in the seventh minute from first-year midfielder Sean MacPherson off a deflection from an opposing defender. The Tartans continued this pressure with another goal in the 10th minute from first-year forward Philip Petrakian as he touched the ball swiftly around a defender for an unassisted goal.
While the Tartans did gain an advantage, the Yellowjackets were persistent. The game was fast and physical from both sides, remaining fairly even after the first goal as both teams showed strong defensive fronts. While Rochester managed to keep the ball away from their side of the field for the last minutes of the half, the Tartan defenders played well near their goal and only allowed the Yellowjackets one shot in the entire half.
The first half belonged to the Tartans, but the Yellowjackets would not be silenced and took control of the second half at the outset when in the 47th minute, a Yellowjacket defender made a miraculous diving header off a corner kick to give the visiting side their first score of the game. Carnegie Mellon began to play defensively, trying to preserve their lead, but in the process giving up crucial pressure that allowed Rochester to find offensive opportunities. The Tartans could not seem to find a way to get the ball on the Rochester side of the field and keep it there. Carnegie Mellon had the lead, and it appeared to be their game to lose. The Tartans were finally punished for their inability to control the game in the 77th minute when another Yellowjacket defender beat the Tartan keeper to tie up the game and give his team a chance to win it — Rochester was in control. The Tartans played sound defense for the rest of the half, however, and allowed no further goals, sending the game into sudden death overtime.
Rochester maintained the control they had gained at the end of regulation time, but Carnegie Mellon was not giving up. The Tartans tried again and again to keep the ball on the Yellowjacket side of the field, but to no avail. With sound defense from both sides, it appeared that the first overtime period would end with no victor. Tartan keeper Eric Bykowsky saved a shot from a Rochester player in the 98th minute, dulling the Yellowjacket energy for a brief moment. This lasted until the 100th minute, when the crowd held their breath, as in the final 30 seconds of overtime Tartan first-year midfielder Zack Masciopinto attempted a backflip bicycle kick to beat the Yellowjacket keeper, but Brown was quick with both his feet and his hands, diving with full extension to catch the kick and save the game for his team. The first overtime concluded with the score line remaining at 2–2.
The game headed into the second overtime period with no clear victor emerging and the crowd on the edge of their seats. Neither team had significant pressure over the other. Tartan senior midfielder William Webb managed to get a shot on goal in the 101st minute, only to be thwarted by the Yellowjacket keeper, who proved to be pivotal in the outcome of this game. The Tartan side managed two more shots on goal in the period, both being blocked by Yellowjacket defenders. Valiant last-ditch efforts from both sides fell flat to strong defensive play, which seemed to be the story of this game. The second overtime period ended with no change in score, making the game a draw at 2–2. While the Tartan men certainly did not lose the game, it seemed that they gave up a lead that could have been kept. To Rochester’s credit, they forced a draw in a game that many less disciplined teams would have given up on. The Tartans will need to play the second half of their games with the vigor of the first if they want to succeed further in conference play.
There are things to work on, but for now the Tartan men will be at least content with not losing. But they cannot be satisfied, and with four more conference games to play, they will need to step up their game if they want to compete with the top squads in the playoffs.
The Tartans also tied Emory 1–1 on Sunday. Despite the Emory lead since the 17th minute, an 88th minute goal by MacPherson forced the game into overtime, where both defenses prevented any further scoring.
The Tartans are at home for a third week in a row this week and will look to improve on their 8–2–2 record against Mt. Aloysius in their last non-conference game of the season on Wednesday, Oct. 21 at 7 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took on the University of Rochester Yellowjackets on Friday. The Tartans built up a 2–0 lead in the first half, and the defense held that lead to the very end, bringing Carnegie Mellon to a 12–0–1 record overall and a 3–0 record in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
The Tartans got off to a fast start, driving the ball to Rochester’s side of the field early and often. Pressure on the Rochester defense resulted in a foul deep in their territory. Sophomore midfielder Tori Iatarola took the free kick attempt and sent it flying toward the goal. Sophomore midfielder Haili Adams attempted to head the ball in, but a defender blocked it at the last moment. At this critical juncture, senior midfielder Carson Quiros located the rebounding ball and booted it into the corner of the goal, putting the Tartans up 1–0 in the eighth minute.
Rochester attempted to answer, but their attempts ended up in the hands of junior goalkeeper Katie Liston. The Tartans offense pressed back against the Yellowjackets, racking up more shots against the visiting team’s defense. In the 37th minute, Quiros found another opportunity after shooting past Rochester’s defenders. A low shot to the near post netted Quiros her third goal of the season, putting the Tartans up 2–0 before the first half finished. Though this would be the end of scoring for the game, the continued pressure of the offense evidenced by the 11–4 advantage in shots and 8–2 edge in corner kicks helped cement the team’s performance.
In the second half, the Tartans defense took the stage as Rochester attempted to get back into the game. Though the Yellowjackets were able to take some close shots, Liston came up with the saves she has made all season long. Carnegie Mellon was also able to keep the ball on Rochester’s side for a fair portion of the half, limiting the number of opportunities the Yellowjackets had to attempt a comeback. As time ticked down, Rochester attempted goals from long distances in an effort to earn a better position for a comeback. Though they would occasionally be afforded some opportunities, the Carnegie Mellon defense remained stout, clinching their eighth shutout of the year and Liston’s fifth this season.
“It feels really great to get another win,” Liston said after the game. Though obviously pleased with the team’s victory, she and the rest of the team have not taken their performance this season for granted. “Every game is a battle. The teams we play are very evenly matched, and it can go any way in any game.” Going into that day’s games, all of the UAA teams had overall winning records, showcasing the enormous amount of skill between the Tartans and their rivals. Though she recognizes and respects the degree of talent among the team’s opponents, Liston is still proud of what the team has accomplished and what the team can continue to accomplish going into the final games of the regular season. “We have the skill and talent. We just need to keep playing the way we know we can. We have such a deep bench; we have 20 players who could go out and play well.”
On Sunday, the Tartans pulled off a stunning victory over Emory in double overtime. Junior forward Megan Bartoshuk tucked a ball into the corner of the net with six seconds left in double overtime, securing the win for the Tartans as multiple Emory players collapsed in agony.
The Tartans will take on Washington University in St. Louis next on Friday, Oct. 30.

When Pep Guardiola first arrived at FC Bayern Munich, the manager had just revolutionized football. His Barcelona team of 2008–09 won every trophy available and is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest club sides in history. However, he took over Jupp Heynckes’s side of treble winners, which will frequently be mentioned in the same breath as that Barca side. In a weak league where Bayern’s only real competition is from Borussia Dortmund, the expectation was set simply at Champions League title or bust. In his two seasons so far, he has not managed to accomplish that, and his two league titles there will always be marked with an asterisk. Coming in to the final year of his contract, which he is not expected to renew, the only way Guardiola’s tenure at Bayern would be considered a real success is if he wins the Champions League this season. He needed to make changes to his tactics, some personnel, and the mentality of the team in general to get there. With a 1–0 victory against Werder Bremen this weekend to make it 12 straight wins to start the season, it’s clear that Bayern is up for the challenge this season.
However, it’s not the run of victories and results here that matters. There has been a profound change in Guardiola’s philosophy this season. No more is his team passing sideways and lulling the opponents into mistakes. No more is Barcelona striker Lionel Messi using his otherworldly skills to create and score goals. The shift in tactics and playing style was exemplified by Bayern in their 5–1 thrashing of supposed challengers for the title Dortmund. Strikers Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski’s first goals of that game were both from long balls played by center back Jerome Boateng. It would’ve been unthinkable for a Pep-coached team to play those kind of balls prior to this season.  What are these changes and which personnel have made this possible?
Guardiola’s transfer strategy has been questioned since the beginning of his Barcelona days. Striker David Villa and defensive midfielder Javier Mascherano qualify as the only undoubted successes he had as Barca manager, while at Bayern, only Lewandowski and Xabi Alonso come close. This season was no different, as the signings of Juventus natives, midfielder Arturo Vidal and winger Kingsley Coman, were considered unnecessary and not fitting his style of play. However, both of those players, along with the irrepressible winger Douglas Costa — signed from Shakhtar Donetsk — have been instrumental in helping him play a more direct game. Costa has arguably been the signing of the season because he has contributed the most assists in the Bundesliga while also being influential in nearly every single Bayern attack. Both Muller and Lewandowski have constantly commented on how much they’ve benefited from playing alongside him. While wingers like Frank Ribery or Arjen Robben, Bayern’s two superstar wingers, are prone to cutting inside and are going for goal themselves, Costa and Koman tend to cross the ball or look for a creative outlet like midfielders Gotze or Thiago in the middle. The results are clear — Muller has 12 goals already this season while Lewandowski has been going toe-to-toe with Real Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi’s legendary goal-scoring feats in scoring 16 goals so far. The effect has been so good that neither Ribery nor Robben have even taken the field this season, but their impact hasn’t been missed one bit.
The major tactical solutions have come in the formations Guardiola has chosen to deploy this season. A loose 2-3-3-2, it involves Boateng being partnered by David Alaba in defense, while Philip Lahm, Xabi Alonso and Thiago Alcantara make up the first midfield three. The front two has consistently been Muller and Lewandowski, while the trio behind has included players such as Costa, Koman, Gotze, Thiago, and Vidal. Youngsters like Juan Bernat and new signing Joshua Kimmich have also been given starts in the defensive midfield, and so has record signing Javi Martinez returning from a long term injury.
The squad available now to Pep allows him to modify this formation to his will and select exactly the players he needs for every situation. Take, for example, the game against Dortmund. Under Thomas Tuchel, this team has continued former manager Jurgen Klopp’s pressing methods, but in a far more controlled fashion and with a lot more emphasis on controlled possession as well. Pep recognized that his team would have a deeper sit than usual and would not see as much of the ball as they usually do. He modified the formation to a slightly more defensive 4-1-3-2, with Javi Martinez partnering Boateng in middle and Alaba and Lahm taking up more traditional full back roles. Coman was dropped to make way for the additional defender and the results on the pitch were startling. Bayern dominated from the start as Alaba and Lahm pushed in to make it a 2-3-3-2 again when in attack and provide support to Gotze and Thiago in attacking midfield. The space was completely cramped for Dortmund’s midfield, but Bayern’s nifty passers meant they were still able to make good plays.
Alonso and Boateng, excellent long-range passers, were given license to aim for Muller or Lewandowski’s frequent runs behind the opposition defense and two such balls resulted in goals. Gotze playing in an unnatural wide role meant Dortmund did not keep cover for him as he constantly drifted inside. However, as soon as he went wide again on the counter-attack, he had acres of space to work with and one such foray into this space on the right channel resulted in another Lewandowski goal. Pep’s team this season is not just finding the smallest weaknesses in the team and exploiting them as is expected, but they are adapting to the opposition strengths to the extent that even Plan Bs are being thrown out of the window. At one point this season, Pep indulged every football fanatic’s fantasy by choosing not to play a central defender when Boateng was suspended for a game and choosing to play a back three of Alaba, Lahm and Bernat instead. The result? A resounding 3–0 victory against one of the division’s best teams in Bayer Leverkusen and some breathtakingly beautiful football.
The freedom provided by this formation to the central midfielders — players like Alonso, Thiago, Gotze and Vidal — has allowed them to develop a style of play suited to break down teams playing any style. If a team chooses to press high up, the ball is quickly shifted to the wings, where Costa, Koman or Gotze wreak havoc in the space left by players too worried about chasing defenders. If a team sits deep, Gotze and Thiago have played some delightful passes between them to unlock defences with the creative powers they possess. If a team plays a possession based game, Alonso, Boateng and those like him have been picking out passes to the two strikers the moment they win the ball in defense. Given the high intelligence of nearly every single player on this team, it’s rare that they’re caught so severely out of position that the supposedly undermanned defense is caught out. Opposing managers have repeatedly talked about how currently they don’t even have a concrete game plan to beat this Bayern team.
Guardiola’s famous stubbornness, which once resulted in an icon such as striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic leaving Barcelona, has been loosened and his mind is working at its apex. On this form with this setup, and with players such as Ribery and Robben to still come into the team, it’s hard to bet against Bayern in absolutely any competition this season.

My intuition was right going into last week. I lost 63–84, bringing my two game winning streak to a speedy, painful end.
Russell Wilson, Le’Veon Bell and Brian McManus were my only players to score double digits. When my kicker is in my top-three scorers, that’s a really terrible sign, even if he is my favorite kicker in the universe.
What’s especially annoying about the loss is that only three of his players, Ryan Matthews, Julian Edelman, and the Broncos D/ST scored 56 of his 84 points on their own. The most hilarious match-up was at D/ST, where the Broncos scored and insane 23 points against the Raiders. I unfortunately had to start the Giants, and they only managed one lousy point.
I’m feeling better about this week, though. I have the Jets D/ST and Eric Decker back, so thank goodness. That should amount to another 15-20 points, assuming no disasters. I also did end up dropping disappointing wide receiver Justin Hunter to pick up Dexter McCluster, who may not actually end up making any difference. I’m starting him as my flex this week.
This week’s match-ups against Team Telly should be interesting.
At quarterback, he will be starting the Jets’ Ryan Fitzpatrick, but good for me, Russell Wilson is just better.
Usually I’m pretty confident about my running back set-up. Blount is good enough, and Bell is great. But unfortunately this week finds us (Bell, Blount, and I are a crew) matched up against Matt Forte and Chris Ivory. I honestly think we’re going to lose this match-up. A point of interest, Team Telly has six complete loser running backs on his bench. I don’t understand the logic behind this.
I’m equally confused about the wide receivers on his roster. He has Jordan Matthews from the Eagles, who is solid, and Tampa Bay’s Vincent Jackson, who is pretty inconsistent but sometimes great. Jackson also has a bye this week. On the bench he has two more wide receivers, who are also complete losers, which I still do not understand. Needless to say, I’m confident about starting Decker and Garcon. Neither are total stars, but they’re consistent performers.
The tight end match up should actually be interesting because I have Ladarius Green of the San Diego Chargers, and Team Telly has Antonio Gates, also of the San Diego Chargers. Gates was suspended through week four, and then in his first appearance, he scored 21 points. His return means more targets for him and less for Green.
I feel pretty good about both defense and kicker. My Jets are better than his Bills, obviously. And I don’t care who McManus is matched up against because he will do better. I know it in my heart.
I also don’t know how I’m supposed to feel about the fact that the Jets play Washington this week. That means I have the Jets D/ST playing against Pierre Garcon. Who do I root for? Is there any way for this to go well for me? It is like a tug-of-war?
I’ve also been considering starting to propose nonsense trades just to see who’s paying attention. Perhaps I’ll offer Ladarius Green to Team chitown DEZZ_NUTS for Rob Gronkowski. Or even my favorite loser Jerick McKinnon to Team eatda groceries of week one in exchange for Devonta Freeman. Maybe if nothing else, it will be funny.

The Carnegie Mellon Athletics Department released its annual Equity in Athletics report this Thursday, a data set on varsity athletic programs, collected annually from colleges and universities around the country.
The report shows growing participation in the Women’s Varsity teams at Carnegie Mellon, buoyed by the addition of the varsity women’s golf team. The data also indicates another year of strong athletic participation on the varsity teams and a continued investment in all of the teams. Previous results of the Equity in Athletics Data are available online for Carnegie Mellon and all other schools on the United States Department of Education’s website.
In 2013, 278 men and 143 women participated in varsity athletics at Carnegie Mellon, good for eight and six percent, respectively, of the male and female undergraduate populations.
The report shows that male athletic participation has grown by five athletes, while female participation has grown by 14. In fact, female participation is up 29 people, or 23 percent, since 2003, while male participation has dropped 21 athletes over the same period.
Since the report is broken down by gender, it is easy to see general equality between support for the men’s and women’s teams.
Although the men’s teams receive slightly more funding, this is proportional to the higher number of male participants. Overall, the athletics department spends slightly more per female athlete, spending $4238 per woman to $3809 per man.
The coaches’ salaries are likewise similar and inequalities are getting smaller, with women’s coaches averaging a salary $2825 less than those of men’s teams in the current report, but averaging a salary $4023 more than those of men’s teams in 2013–14.
The report does show that Carnegie Mellon still has progress to make, with only two female head coaches across all athletic teams, for women’s volleyball and women’s basketball.
Carnegie Mellon lags a little behind rival schools like Washington University in St. Louis, whose report from last year indicates four female head coaches.
Outside of the gender gap, the data gives some useful information about the Carnegie Mellon athletic program. In terms of expense, football — unsurprisingly — leads all sports, costing $602,106. The sheer number of athletes on the team helps account for this, with more participants than any other two teams combined (122 athletes).
The next most costly teams behind football are Men’s Basketball ($225,233), Women’s Basketball   ($217,010), Women’s Volleyball ($171,108), and Women’s Soccer ($170,398).
Interestingly, due to the much smaller team sizes, all of these teams have significantly higher expense per athlete than the football team does, led by Women’s Basketball, which, with only 12 players, boasts an average cost per athlete of $18,084.
These statistics actually indicate that Carnegie Mellon focuses on football more than the other schools in the University Athletic Association (UAA), the conference that the university competes in. While the Carnegie Mellon football team leads the conference in terms of football expense by a small margin, other schools outspend Carnegie Mellon dramatically in most of the other sports. During the 2013–14 seasons, the Carnegie Mellon Athletic Department fell in the middle of the pack in terms of spending, fifth of the eight schools in the conference, with some schools, like Washington University and New York University, spending over 150 percent more on their athletics.
Other noteworthy information includes the breakdown of total cost and expense for Carnegie Mellon relative to other universities in the conference.
The report shows that Carnegie Mellon has similar revenue levels for the 2013–14 athletic season, with an slight increase largely offsetting additional expenses for the new varsity women’s golf team. As a result of the small increase in revenue, the Athletics Department maintained nearly an identical net income to the previous year.
The report indicates a profit of $300,900 in 2014-15, a bit more than the $289,051 from 2013–14.
Carnegie Mellon’s reported profits are well above average in the UAA, where four of the eight participating schools have listed no profit at all for the 2013–14 season, and only Washington University, with a listed profit of $843,743, has a higher profit margin.
Overall, the report shows a relative stability throughout the programs, which hopefully indicates another strong season for the Carnegie Mellon athletic teams.

The Boeing Company, the world’s largest aerospace company, has partnered with Carnegie Mellon to establish the Boeing/Carnegie Mellon Aerospace Data Analytics Lab, a new academic research partnership that will take advantage of Carnegie Mellon’s involvement in data analytics. Over the next three years, Boeing will provide $7.5 million for the lab, which will involve both Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute and the machine learning department. 
Jaime Carbonell, an Allen Newell University Professor in Carnegie Mellon’s computer science department and the director of the Language Technologies Institute, will lead the new research team. John Vu, a professor in the Language Technologies Institute and the computational biology department and a former Boeing chief software engineer, will also be involved in developing and overseeing the project. 
In an interview with The Tartan, Vu explained that the Boeing/Carnegie Mellon Aerospace Data Analytics Lab has been a long time in the making. Although Boeing and Carnegie Mellon just signed the partnership a few weeks ago, foundations for the lab started several years ago. The lab has already discerned more than six initial projects, and hopes to involve at least 20 faculty members and graduate student researchers.
Few people know that aeronautics is one of the most data-intensive businesses around. Airplanes contain embedded computers and thousands of sensors that are constantly collecting data, and taking large amounts of measurements is an integral part of making flight possible. These data are collected and analyzed to gain useful insights to improve airplane efficiency and safety. Boeing, with 8,000 to 10,000 sensors on each of its aircrafts, has begun to take the massive amount of data collected during each flight and use it to improve fuel efficiency, increase the speed at which parts are delivered, and find better flight paths to reduce airline delays.
The Boeing/Carnegie Mellon Aerospace Data Analytics lab is a continuation of this effort to make sense of the large amount of aerospace data. The goal of the partnership is to discover ways to take advantage of the large amount of data generated in the design, construction, and operation of aircrafts by applying Carnegie Mellon’s expertise in language technology and machine learning in order to optimize various aspects of Boeing’s operations.
Ted Colbert, Boeing’s chief information officer, talked about the high-level goals of the lab in a university press release. “We’re aiming to push the technology envelope,” Colbert said. “We have the best and the brightest faculty at a leading institution focused on how we can innovate and solve business challenges for today and into the future.”
Nancy Bailey, vice president of Boeing IT Business Partners, also commented on the new partnership. “We couldn’t be more excited to engage with and leverage the research power and incredible knowledge of a premier academic institution,” Bailey said.
One of the main challenges the lab will address is how to apply machine learning in order to develop new maintenance schedules for planes based on flight history and component performance instead of following historical maintenance schedules. By doing this, the lab hopes to make airplanes safer for passengers and reduce time lost on the tarmac due to last-minute mechanical failures. The lab will also work on implementing evidence-based predictions to enable preventive inspections or replacements before a failure in order to lower the cost of coping with unscheduled failures and to increase safety.
“The mass of data generated daily by the aerospace industry overwhelms human understanding,” Carbonell said in a university press release, “but recent advances in language technologies and machine learning give us every reason to expect that we can gain useful insights from that data. The new algorithms and methods should create a stronger aerospace industry and be applicable to many other important endeavors.”
According to Vu, the collaboration between Boeing, a major industry player, and Carnegie Mellon will provide new opportunities for faculty to solve real problems with real data, and will benefit Carnegie Mellon students by giving them an opportunity to learn practical skills so they will be ready to work with minimal training when they graduate.
“Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and Boeing have enjoyed a collaborative relationship for more than 30 years, and we’re proud of the fact that hundreds of our graduates are working at Boeing,” said President Subra Suresh in a university press release. “This new agreement will extend this relationship even further, leveraging the distinctive intellectual strengths of [Carnegie Mellon University] to benefit everyone who steps onto an airplane.”

New robotic hands with advanced sensing capabilities, developed in part by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, have brought humans closer than ever to robots. This project, led by assistant professor of robotics Yong-Lae Park and developed with researchers at Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corp., with support from NASA, aims to create structurally sensorized, three-fingered soft robotic hands that are more similar to human or animal limbs, which have thousands of nerve endings. Using fiber optics, the researchers embedded 14 strain sensors into each of the fingers in the robotic hand, which allows the hand to determine where its fingertips are in contact and detect forces of less than a tenth of a newton.
Traditionally, industrial robots are only equipped with a few sensors, which are usually resistive or capacitive. This small number, however, limits the ability of robots to operate autonomously without instructions from humans.
“If you want robots to work autonomously and to react safely to unexpected forces in everyday environments, you need robotic hands that have more sensors than is typical today,” said Park in a university press release. “Human skin contains thousands of tactile sensory units only in the fingertip and a spider has hundreds of mechanoreceptors on each leg, but even a state-of-the-art humanoid such as NASA’s Robonaut has only 42 sensors in its hand and wrist.”
“We wanted to build a more sensorized robot, that would be more autonomous,” Parks said. Another benefit of robots with more sensors is that they would be better equipped to interact with humans, where safety concerns require more emphasis on tactile and force sensing.
Adding additional pressure or force sensors, however, is difficult since they are prone to breaking and interference from electrical motors and other electromagnetic devices. In order to resolve this problem, the team turned to optical sensors. A single optical fiber can contain several sensors, which allowed the researchers to incorporate a larger number of sensors with fewer limitations.
The robotic hand, developed in part by senior mechanical engineering students Leo Jiang and Kevin Low, includes Fiber Bragg Grating sensors in the rigid bone structure that detect strain by measuring the wavelength of light reflected by the optical sensors. Each of the fingers of the team’s hand is composed of four optical fibers that connect all of the sensors in the finger.
Structurally, the robotic fingers are similar to human fingers, with a fingertip, middle node, and base node connected by joints. A single active tendon can bend the finger while a passive elastic tendon straightens the finger by providing an opposing force. The sensors detect strain caused by small structural deformations, which allows robots to react to changes in their environment.
There are, however, limitations to this model. Despite their advantages, conventional optical sensors don’t stretch much. Glass fibers barely stretch at all and polymer fibers only stretch approximately 20 to 25 percent, which is a problem for the device as it requires a large range of motion.
In order to address this issue, Park, along with Celeste To, a masters student in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, and Tess Lee Hellebrekers from the University of Texas, developed a stretchable optical sensor using commercially available silicon rubbers. This new optical sensor is able to measure strain and deformation, and could potentially be used in future versions of the robotic hands.
Integrating the fiber optic signals is also a challenge. The electronic signal detector, which is located in the back of the robot, is quite bulky and awkward. With continuing advancements in technology, a more compact interrogator would make these robotic hands more useful in a variety of applications, including human friendly robots.
The researchers discussed the robotic hand and a report on the highly stretchable optical sensors on September 29 at the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2015) in Hamburg, Germany.

Imagine a war where the only soldiers on the ground are made of metal and plastic. They rove the terrain, scanning for enemy combatants with infrared sensors and shooting to kill when they make contact. The other side has a similar army of electronic brains, and the winner is decided by who has the most robots standing. It might sound a little absurd, but wars don’t need to be completely post-human to bring up ethical issues. In Pugwash’s last meeting, we discussed the implications of battlegrounds distanced from people.
The discussion began with a clarification of terms. Were we referring only to on-the-ground combat robots, the likes of which don’t quite exist yet? Or were we also including drones and other technologies that distance warm bodies from the battlefield? We agreed that discussion could be about any technology that works to put fewer people on the ground, and we ended up using “drone” as a catch-all term.
The first opinion on the topic was in favor of drone battles. This member noted that if both sides are fighting entirely with drones, then there’s almost no cost of human life. Wars then become economic battles, with the deciding factor being who can build more or better drones.
There were some problems raised, however, about a war fought entirely with robots. If the only things doing the fighting are drones, then it would make far more sense to target the other side’s drone-production facilities than to send waves of drones crashing into each other. What would prevent one side from sending a sneak attack and killing people, instead of matching drone against drone?
It was also noted that if war between two industrialized countries was solely comprised of drones fighting other drones, it would hardly be war at all. There would have to be rules to stop attacks on civilians or production facilities, but there would be no way to enforce them. Instead of war, it would be a ritualized game between two honorable opponents.
War will never turn into a game, though. If a country is going to war, do they really just want to blow up the other side’s toys? Whoever loses the most playthings wins? Not likely. The threat of war is in its human cost.
It was suggested, however, that even though no humans would die on the battlefield, there would still be human consequences. Forcing countries to focus their whole economy on producing more drones to win wars would cause suffering; think of rationing during past wars, or economic sanctions against Iran and the pain civilians face because of it.
Even if these sorts of wars did start, there would be much better ways to end them. Since World War II, no major country has fought a fully-mobilized, all-out war of attrition against another major country. If that were to happen, there’s really only one solution: nuclear weapons.
Because no one wants to use nuclear weapons, most recent wars have not seen the full mobilization of two industrialized countries against each other. Because two industrialized countries going all-out against each other is a requisite for the type of drone-vs-drone battles we had been imagining, those sorts of battles are highly unlikely.
What is more likely, Pugwash agreed, is something like what is already happening as a result of the United States’ drone policy. Non-humans will be brought in to aid local proxy wars, usually in situations where only one side has access to the technology. Drones will be used to “precision strike” targets or establish no-fly zones over small areas in pursuit of a goal other than total and complete annihilation. One Pugwash member even suggested that this could be accomplished with less human suffering than in traditional war.
But even though the new technology claims to lessen human suffering, that isn’t always the case. It does take boots off the ground, in the case of a technologically advanced nation using the drones, but there can still be terrible accidents. Even if the end goal is to produce a more stable region, such as the United States’ actions in Libya or Afghanistan, those end goals aren’t always realized when the military objectives are reached.
Some questions were brought up about the amount of civilian casualties related to drones compared to more traditional wars. When Hannibal invaded Rome, the war elephants stomped on anyone in the way, soldier or civilian. Using non-human war machines, whether elephants or drones, makes it harder to control who is going to die.
Another issue with fighting from afar is that it can be hard to tell what the civilian casualties are. 
If a soldier lobs a grenade into a building, and then goes in to see the results, they’ll have a different reaction from a drone operator who pushes a button and then is told, “Great job, more terrorists killed” by their commander. Drones make it much easier to classify everyone as an enemy combatant, which makes it harder to get accurate civilian casualty counts.
The argument was also made that drone operators might be able to make more rational decisions. Because they’re not operating under a “kill or be killed” mentality, they will have a clearer mind and be able to fully understand their actions. This does have negative drawbacks though. One member was insistent that it wasn’t fair to kill people halfway across the world.
Although there wasn’t much consensus as to whether adding drones to battlefields made war better or worse, it was agreed that there will always be a need for humans on the ground. War isn’t just about killing everyone in a certain area. Especially in counter-insurgencies, war has to include winning over the hearts and minds of the local populations, through learning their customs and way of life, and not indiscriminately killing them with robots. Drones might help fight battles, but they won’t win wars.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on drone warfare.

Even if Matthew McConaughey hadn’t been in it, Interstellar still would have been a nerd heartthrob sensation. The movie incorporated real scientific theory — backed by California Institute of Technology physics professor Kip Thorne — into its storyline in order to depict the harsh realities one might actually encounter during space exploration. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey saves the human race by traveling into a black hole, communicating with his daughter in the past through mysterious means, and then somehow escaping the black hole. Okay, so maybe not everything was realistic.
Despite the fictitious components of the movie’s ending, black holes are real phenomena, and their properties pose daunting questions to the field of modern physics. Black holes were first postulated by Albert Einstein in his paper The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity as the byproduct of a collapsing star.
A star is essentially a ball of immensely hot gas. The high temperature of a star causes the gasses within it to fuse together to form other atomic elements, one of which is iron. According to Einstein’s famous equation E=mc2, the mass loss associated with fusion can be converted into energy. Iron, however, does not release energy when produced through fusion. Instead of transforming into energy, it sits in the star’s core as mass. 
According to Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation, the gravity a body exerts increases as its mass increases. Einstein’s theory predicted that the gravity of a star could become so massive that eventually, its mass could not stably resist its own gravitational pull, and a star could thus collapse inward on itself. If a star is massive enough, when it collapses inward, it condenses so much mass into such a small space that the gravity generated is strong enough that an object traveling at the speed of light cannot escape the gravitational pull. In other words, the gravity is so strong not even light can escape, making the condensed star appear black. This condensed star is what we call a black hole.
If black holes have such an incredibly strong gravitational pull, why doesn’t everything in the universe get pulled into them? The answer to this question has to do with Newton’s theory of gravitation and a term called the “event horizon.” Although Newton’s theory of gravitation states that the gravity a body exerts increases with mass, it also states that gravity decreases proportionally with the distance between the body exerting the gravitational force and the body experiencing the gravitational force. 
In practice, this means the farther away a body moves from the center of a black hole, the weaker the black hole’s gravity is for that body. The event horizon is the threshold outside of which a black hole’s gravity is too weak to pull something in. Anything inside of the event horizon cannot escape the force of the black hole’s gravitational pull, and anything outside will not fall into the black hole.
One of the many amazing properties of black holes is the time dilation that occurs between a body falling through a black hole and an observing body outside of the black hole. For example, say you and a friend decide to determine how much time it takes to fall through a black hole. Feeling brave, you tell your friend you will travel through the black hole while she remains a safe distance from the event horizon. How do you and your friend’s recorded time differ? For you, it takes a finite amount of time to travel to the event horizon, and a finite amount of time to reach the center of the black hole. For your friend, however, the situation appears differently. 
As you get closer to the event horizon and thus farther from your friend, the light beams your body emits take a longer time to travel to your friend. The instant you cross the horizon, however, the light from your body cannot escape the black hole, and thus cannot reach your friend until an infinite amount of time has passed; thus, you appear to your friends to be frozen at the event horizon, despite the fact that you have crossed the horizon.
The above scenario ignores the crushing forces that are exerted on a body as it travels through a black hole. In fact, the gravitational forces in a black hole are so sensitive to distance that the forces on the bottom of your body would be significantly greater than the forces on the top of your body, and the black hole would rip you apart. Fortunately, we don’t have any stars in our solar system that have nearly enough mass to collapse into a black hole and turn us into Silly Putty. If we did, though, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to have McConaughey on speed dial.

Blood­cleansing device transforms sepsis treatment
Sepsis, the leading cause of hospital deaths, is an infection that causes the body’s organs to swell up and subsequently fail. Sepsis is currently treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but it still kills about 50 percent of affected individuals. Scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a new approach that reports a 99 percent pathogen reduction when tested on animals.
It uses FcMBL, a genetically engineered protein created by binding Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin. MBL has the ability to bind to various pathogens and, together with Fc, it makes it easy for the body’s own immune system to eliminate the infection. The research team worked with the Food and Drug Administration to simplify the product and recently launched Opsonix Inc., a startup developed to prepare the treatment for clinical use as sepsis therapy.

Ebola virus persists in various “immune ­privileged” sites
Researchers from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research have confirmed that the Ebola virus (EBOV) can be transmitted sexually. The team reported that the body’s immune response against the virus did not extend to certain “immune ­privileged” sites, or areas of the body which tolerate antigens without stimulating an immune response, including the testes, central nervous system, pregnant uterus, and eyes. 
A female patient who contracted the disease after no new Ebola cases had been reported for 30 days initially raised suspicion. The virus genomes from the female patient’s blood and those from her EBOV negative partner’s semen produced similar results to that of a direct transmission case. This led the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to modify their recommendations regarding sexual contact for convalescent patients until a definite “persistence” time can be found.

MIT develops machine that replaces intuition
Max Kanter and Kalyan Veeramachaneni, research scientists at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), have developed a system that uses big­-data analysis to search for patterns and design a set of features to analyze. Traditionally, choosing features to analyze has relied on human intuition, as opposed to technology. Their prototype, which aims to remove humans from big-data analysis, outranked 615 teams out of the participating 906 in three recent data­-science competitions. 
The “Data Science Machine” will be described in a paper that will be released next week at the IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics. The machine works by first importing data from different tables, then executing operations to list possible features. It combines categorical data and the feature list to produce a reduced list derived from correlation. It then tests these values to optimize accuracy.

Dell buys EMC for $67b in biggest tech deal ever
Dell, known to be falling in the consumer PC market, bought EMC, a computer storage company, which signals Dell’s transformation into an IT solutions provider. Dell agreed to buy EMC for $67 billion in what is the largest tech deal of all time. The deal is almost two times larger than the second largest merger between Broadcom and Avago. 
Both companies have been struggling financially to stay afloat due to their inability to keep up with changing technology trends. EMC has been suffering largely due to the growing popularity of the cloud while Dell, the second-largest server maker, has had its shipments drop in the second quarter as companies handover their file storage to services such as Tech30, Amazon, and Google. This merger goes against the recent trend of companies becoming smaller, as shown by Hewlett-Packard, which is planning on splitting in two. One key factor here, however, is the private shareholder status of Dell, which it intends to maintain.

Woolly mammoth extinction caused by excess hunting
It has long been unclear whether the extinction of woolly mammoths was due to climate change or excess hunting by humans. Recently, however, researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered compelling evidence suggesting that excess hunting was behind the extinction. The researchers looked at the chemical composition of mammoth tusks leading up to their extinction, specifically analyzing 14 tusks from mammoths aged three to 12. They noted that the tusks’ isotopic signatures, or ratios of various isotopes, dramatically changed in the years leading up to their extinction. 
By analyzing these signatures, the researchers determined that the mammoth weaning age decreased by approximately three years before the animals went extinct. Since excess hunting is associated with forcing animals to mature faster, but climate change is not, this data suggests that excess hunting was to blame.

Apple loses lawsuit over patented microchip technology
The federal court in Madison, Wisconsin ruled that Apple was guilty of using the University’s patented microchip technology, which was developed by computer sciences professor Gurindar Sohi along with a team of researchers to improve the performance of computer processors, in its iPhone 5S, 6, and 6 Plus without permission. Initially, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation of the University of Wisconsin-­Madison, which handles patent licensing at the university, demanded $862 million. 
However, the court concluded that the infringement was unintentional and therefore lowered the payable charges to $234 million. Apple said that it would appeal and refused to comment further. Another lawsuit making the same claim against Apple’s iPhone 6S and 6S Plus has also been filed. The University of Wisconsin also sued Intel over the same technology in 2008. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

Howdy Joshua,
I'm having a bit of a personal problem, so I thought it'd be a great idea to have it published in a public newspaper. I'll preface this by saying that I have never shared a space with anyone in my life. My family's pretty well off, so we have a pretty big house with some pretty big rooms, and one of those is my bedroom. When we get hotels, I get my own room, the whole nine yards. I'm pretty territorial, like an eagle or something.
**So this year, I'm living on campus, right? So I requested a single room, and the [lovely, lovely individuals] in housing put me in a Mudge quad with three bozos. I mean, sure, there's a bathroom and a closet, but the beds are so close, and one of them keeps the lights on all night, and the other one never shuts up, even when I put my earplugs in, and the other one has really quiet, really kinky sex at weird times while we're all sleeping. I guess my question is: how do I deal with these people invading my huge personal bubble? They're savages, man — they leave their dirty dishes in the bathroom sink and don't even move them when they spit after brushing their teeth. Like come on, what is this, the middle ages? I'm about to go ballistic on these [lovely, lovely individuals]. **
Cordially,
REBECCA
Dear Raging Enraged Babe Ending Calamitous Cohabitation Aggressively,
(You didn't give yourself an acronym, so I did it for you, you're welcome)
Living with other people, especially those you haven't spent a lot of time with, can be very difficult. Ideally, you would all share some basic rules about bedtime and room etiquette, or at least you would have had a conversation about those basic things. That would be what I suggest — talk to your roommates and try to sort things out. You may have to make some compromises as well, but in the long run, it will make your stay more enjoyable. If there are any major problems, you can talk with your RA, and she will be happy to help you sort things out. Also, I know you've said that you like your space, but it couldn't hurt to give your roommates a chance. Dismissing people as bozos — especially when you're going to be living with them for a year — isn't always the best decision. They might end up being some great friends! Or you'll never see them again, and they'll leave an eternally bitter taste in your mouth with their very existence. But that's largely up to you. 
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

In most television shows, the kidnapping of a baby would take center stage and become the focus of one — if not more — episode of a season. For Jane the Virgin, it's a storyline that is quickly resolved to make way for more important things: the trials of becoming a mother for the first time.
Jane's second season premiered last Monday, picking up on the cliffhanger of Jane Villanueva's (Golden Globe winner Gina Rodriguez) newborn son, Mateo, being kidnapped by the crime boss, Sin Rostro. In the show's typical fashion, though, we see the newest member of the Villanueva family returned fairly quickly so that the show can use that trauma to bring out Jane's frustrations and fears at becoming a new mother. 
We spend the bulk of the episode exploring how her fear from the kidnapping lead to insecurities about how she can function as a mother — not wanting to sleep for fear of losing him, how often he seems to be feeding, and other baby issues that everyone faces.
In the background, we see how everyone else is coping with the same types of insecurities: Jane's mother, wanting to be the second mother to Jane's child; Jane's father, who never had to deal with raising a baby; and especially Mateo's father Rafael, who wants to be the father he wished he had, while also balancing his feelings for Jane after their very recent break-up.
Add in all the weird connections, zany subplots, and multiple storylines expected of a telenovela, and you get a premiere chock-full of things happening. It could very easily have descended into a mess, but Jane's writers have proved time and again that when you know what your show's about and have a clear vision of how you want to show that, you can balance even the craziest of stories.
For Jane, it's a show about relationships and dealing with the known in unexpected circumstances. So, we are given a story about a new mother dealing with new mother things, along with a kidnapping.
Besides that story, we have a recurrence of Jane being hailed as a miracle by the nuns from the school she taught at. Reporters and believers flock to her house to be in the presence of the "blessed" Jane, only to be disappointed by Jane's faux-admission of not being a virgin anymore.
We also see a potential new major storyline with Petra, Rafael's ex-wife and current owner of his family's hotel. As she sees Rafael bonding with his new family, she takes the extreme measure to self-inseminate herself with the one remaining sperm sample of Rafael's. Will we see a new Solano baby this season? Anything is possible in Jane's world.
Rodriguez deftly comes back after her Golden Globe win, perfectly balancing Jane's organized, controlled personality with the inevitable breakdown expected from her character's situation. She's a wonderful physical actor and is able to play that out many times in this episode, most hilariously as she runs (or waddles) around trying to keep up with Rafael and Michael as they search for the broach they need to trade with Sin Rostro for Mateo.
The always present love triangle between Jane, Rafael, and Michael reared its head again, not overtly, but enough to be present. With everything else Jane has going on, it would be nice to see that storyline tabled for a few episodes, giving her (and viewers) time to adjust to motherhood before jumping into yet another romantic relationship. Plus, the story between Jane's parents was fairly comedic last season. With the wedding already done, it would be interesting to see how they develop together as grandparents and a couple.
Overall, it was a strong opening episode for the most emotionally grounded show on the CW, with enough tidbits of what's to come to keep viewers intrigued for the season, while keeping a sincere focus on the relationships that make this show great.

Go-go boots, glamour and tons of glitter, 54: the Director’s Cut was the perfect way to close Pittsburgh’s 30th annual Reel Q film festival last Saturday night at the Harris Theatre. Following the screening, the Pittsburgh Lesbian & Gay Film Society (PLGFS) board of directors among other spirited guests dressed up in their funkiest '70s garb and got down to hip jams like "Stayin’ Alive" and "YMCA" at the disco themed after-party to celebrate the film festival’s longevity and success.
Originally released in 1998, 54 tells the story of a young adult, Shane (Ryan Phillippe), born and raised in Jersey City, as he pursues fame and fortune at a New York City nightclub, “Studio 54.” The film’s original release was heavily edited, cutting out a third of the original footage including key scenes that display the fluidity of Shane’s sexual orientation as he struggles with his sense of identity. The cuts were made by an executive producer of Miramax that feared the public’s reaction to bisexuality, and the film was diluted to suit the current social climate. Its original release was successful, but not lasting. The watered-down version lacked the emotional stakes and was unable to hook its audience. 
Eventually, director and writer Mark Christopher and his co-producer Jonathan King pitched the idea of a remastered “director’s cut” of 54. The controversy surrounding the severity of Miramax’s original cut was kept alive in cult-film circles where a bootlegged VHS copy of the original footage had been circulating since the 1998 release. This resurrection was not picked up until 2014 and by then, some of the original footage could only be found on these bootlegged VHS’s. The incorporation of distorted footage only served to enhance the film, melding the societal controversy with the trials of the film’s characters. 
As a final result, some scenes of the director’s cut are grainier, darker, and have distorted audio. These seeming impairments actually serve to highlight Shane’s confusion as he attempts to navigate the moral ambiguity of Studio 54. In particular, the relationship between Greg (Brekin Meyer, who you may remember as the lovable pothead of the 1995 romantic comedy Clueless) and Shane as well as the villainy of club owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), is stunted in the original release. In the director's cut, however, their turbulent relationship and the horror of Rubell’s irresponsibility are displayed in full, increasing the stakes and making the film a more cohesive and compelling experience. 
After beginning to work as a bartender at Studio 54, Shane is disowned by his Jersey City family and finds a new home with Greg and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek), both working at the club as well. Greg and Shane’s kiss (and Meyer’s first onscreen kiss) is one of the scenes recovered for the director’s cut. It illustrates the height of Shane’s confusion as he tries to reconcile his need for family, which he has left behind in Jersey City, and his misconceptions of love, which he observes at Studio 54. In the pursuit of fame, Shane has lost what it means to express familial love. The pulsating lights of the dance floor, dark alcoves, and seedy basement rooms of the club paired with the distorted audio and visual heightened the sense of moral ambivalence which Shane, Greg, and Anita all experience in different capacities. 
Other recovered scenes involve the compelling and colorful Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), the co-founder of Studio 54. Rubell is characterized off-the-bat by his obsession with beauty and wealth, which are played off initially as comical, and even charming. He intelligently explains his unapologetic hedonism through philosophy where he subscribes to the belief that “excess is the path to wisdom.” Rubell’s recovered scenes for the director’s cut characterize his descent into villainy through the sexual exploitation of his bartenders and abuse of drugs which nearly incapacitated him. These intermediary scenes, originally omitted, are invaluable to the setup of Rubell’s part in the film’s tragic climax, which drives Shane to finally leave his legacy at the sordid night club.
The Reel Q film festival has “grown substantially in sponsorship over the past three decades,” said Mitchell Leib, executive director of PLGFS. They now have the freedom to show a wider array of films from around the world. Other notable films included in the festival were Baby Steps (Taiwan), Liz in September (Venezuela), and While You Weren’t Looking (South Africa). Finally, 54: the Director’s Cut was a high-energy finish to the festival and a film that Leib has been wanting to incorporate ever since the original controversy of the 1998 release. The disco-themed after-party was the icing on the cake. Reel Q has established itself as a fixture of Pittsburgh’s film scene with a successful 30th annual week of screenings.

Godzilla vs. Kong officially confirmed
About a month ago, we learned Universal Studios had transferred the rights of King Kong to Warner Bros, undoubtedly to setup a Godzilla vs. King Kong movie. That dream has now officially been realized! The formal joint release came from Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures describing the trilogy of films coming down the pike, leading to its culmination in Godzilla vs. Kong.
The press release read, "Following Legendary’s and Warner Bros. Pictures’ 2014 success with the global reinvention of the Godzilla franchise, the companies have come together to create an epic, new shared cinematic franchise. All-powerful monsters become towering heroes for a new generation, revealing a mythology that brings together Godzilla and Legendary’s King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new. Monarch, the human organization that uncovered Godzilla in the 2014 film, will expand their mission across multiple releases."
Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures have slated a new trilogy incorporating the biggest, baddest monsters ever seen on screen beginning with Kong: Skull Island, set for release on March 10, 2017. The following is Godzilla 2, bringing back director Gareth Edwards, which is set for June 8, 2018. Godzilla vs. Kong follows in 2020.
Mark Ruffalo's Hulk to appear in *Thor: Ragnarok*
The Marvel Cinematic Universe expands wider and wider every year. They add new characters and they expand the characters we've seen already. After Avengers: Age of Ultron, the MCU looked forward to Ant Man, Captain America: Civil War, and Doctor Strange.  We've deduced the roster of heroes making their appearance in Captain America: Civil War (including Spider Man), and the two missing pieces are the Mighty Thor and Hulk, which makes sense. In Civil War, the heroes get divided and have a standoff with each other. Which squad will win? Whichever squad has Thor or Hulk. Making their story peel away from the other heroes was a brilliant move on the part of Marvel Studios. The last we saw the big green guy, he was flying off into space in a Quinjet. It has been confirmed, that Hulk will land in Thor's third standalone film Thor: Ragnarok. The Hulk will join the God of Thunder on a new planet facing the Norse Apocalypse.
Bringing back the Hulk before Avengers: Infinity War means the character is not being left behind, which was a genuine fear many fans felt after seeing the character evolve in Age of Ultron. Hulk is not a versatile character. Audiences want to see a lot more of the Hulk and not as much of Bruce Banner. Using him as a side character, in Avengers or any of the other characters' standalone films, allows Marvel to give us plenty of Hulk without slowing down the film. This is a power Marvel uses well and I'm excited to see that the character will be returning to the Universe. Thor: Ragnarok is set for release on July 28, 2017.
Robin Hood: Origins delayed to accommodate Taron Egerton
Some two weeks ago, Robin Hood: Origins was on the verge of delay due to Kingsman star Taron Egerton. His contract binds him to play "Eggsy" for the Kingsman sequel, which starts production next April. His lead role in Robin Hood: Origins was planned to begin a lengthy production in February. See the problem? Lionsgate, who is producing Origins, had two options: recast Egerton's role or push the production schedule. Choosing the latter, the studio will begin production on Origins after Kingsman 2 closes principal photography late-next summer. This move will undoubtedly push back the release date on Origins, but fans will now get the film the producers envisioned, with the actor they wanted cast for the main role. Kingsman 2 and Robin Hood: Origins are currently set for release in 2017.
George Miller comments on future of Mad Max franchise
After Mad Max: Fury Road, director George Miller revealed his conceptualization for two separate sequel films, one focusing on Max and the other on Charlize Theron's character "Imperator Furiosa." Whether they both get made is still up in the air, but the acclaimed director spoke with DigitalSpy about whether Furiosa will appear in the next film: "I'm not sure, is the answer. She's not in the Mad Max [sequel] story, but in one of the stories there's an interaction between [Max and Furiosa]. I can't really say more than that because it's still in progress." 
Regarding the next film, Mad Max: The Wasteland, and future films, Miller said, "That name came out, that was just a working title. Nico Lathouris (Fury Road co-writer) and I wrote deep backstories on all the characters and they eventually became screenplays — so we have two [more movies]. I'm happy to say that there's discussions about them right now, but I hope the next film I make is a very small without any special effects and not many stunts."
As far as the Mad Max franchise goes, I'm interested in seeing both films. Tom Hardy's character in Fury Road was not explored very much. He barely had any dialogue with other characters, but the moments when he was on screen were not wasted. We learned that he has a deep history that should be explored. Even though Max's name is in the film's title, Fury Road was Furiosa's movie. Charlize Theron played the role beautifully. Furiosa is the only female Imperator, as far as we know, and is more intellectual than any other Imperator. I am excited to see the rich history Miller has also fleshed out for her character. I could not be more thrilled to further explore the Mad Max world. Fury Road is in my Top 5 of the year.

California natives The Neighbourhood, also referred to as The NBHD, came to Stage AE as part of their Flood tour last Monday. This band became famous after their hit song “Sweater Weather,” and infuse elements of electronic, rock, and hip-hop music into their songs. The show featured Hunny and Bad Suns as the opening acts. Both bands have a similar alternative rock sound to The Neighbourhood, but Bad Suns seemed to draw more excitement from the crowd.
Despite the fact that the concert was on a Monday night, fans still came out to see the bands perform. Keeping true with their overall black and white aesthetic, the band came out in predominantly black clothing and a black backdrop with white stage lights. The band opened with a song from their album [ITAL]I Love You[ITAL] called “W.D.Y.W.F.M.?,” an acronym that stands for "What Do You Want From Me?" The infectious chorus had everyone in the crowd — those who were there for more than just “Sweater Weather” — singing along with lead singer and certified heartthrob Jesse Rutherford as he sang about wanting to know what his girlfriend wanted from him. One thing about the concert that caught me a little off guard was the lack of communication between the band and the audience. After every couple of songs, Jesse would look out into the crowd and say “thank you” as if he suddenly remembered that we were there. Aside from that, there was no band introduction or interesting stories to accompany songs or anything. While this made much of the concert feel very formal and impersonal, it also allowed listeners to just focus on the music.
The band also played several songs from their EPs I’m Sorry… and Thank You, such as “Let It Go,” “Baby Came Home,” and “Female Robbery.” “Let It Go” was accompanied by an amazing display of white lights flashing every time the chorus came around. This, accompanied with the lyrics of letting go, helped to ease all the stress that any students at the concert had about not being at home doing homework on a Monday night. While the band’s use of lights and a black and white backdrop added to the chill ambiance they usually provide, it made it difficult to actually see more than just their silhouettes the whole night. Jesse’s smooth voice serenaded the crowd during “Baby Came Home” as he sang with so much passion and sadness that you almost felt as if your baby left you. They finished the set of old jams with “Female Robbery,” a song about wanting to just be kidnapped and escape the current life you live. Although we all sang along about wanting to escape, there was nowhere else that we wanted to be than stuck in the black and white haze of The Neighbourhood.
The band also played a few songs from their upcoming album Wiped Out!, set to release on Oct. 30, such as “The Beach” and “Wiped Out!” Even though many people did not know the words to these songs, the audience was still filled with excitement at having the chance to get an exclusive listen of their new music. Probably the best moment of the entire show was when the entire band silently left the stage and only Jesse reemerged wearing no shirt and a fur coat. This marked a transition from their alternative rock music to their more hip hop influenced music. He rapped a few songs from their mixtape #000000 & #FFFFFF. This mixtape includes several collaborations with hip hop artists such as Dej Loaf, YG, and French Montana. 
By this point in the show, if they hadn’t realized it already, audience members realized that The Neighbourhood — and particularly Jesse — were cool in every sense of the word. As he stood on stage rapping about his California roots in his song “When I Get Back,” it was hard not to want to either be him or be his best friend. He closed the set with “#icanteven,” a song about getting cheated on. During this time, the backdrop also changed from a predominantly black backdrop to a white backdrop with pictures of pop culture references and California. This change of pace kept the concert exciting and reminded the audience of just how diverse their music can be and how much they allow other genres to influence them. 
They closed their set with “Sweater Weather” and their new single “R.I.P. 2 My Youth.” Of course everyone was excited to hear “Sweater Weather” as it instantly transported the crowd back to 2012 when the band first emerged on the scene. Even people who didn’t know the words to any other songs sang along to the chorus of this pop hit. “R.I.P. 2 My Youth” then took the crowd in a much different direction as Jesse sang about the loss of innocence and his late father. Despite the sad message behind this song, it still filled everyone with anticipation for what’s to come on the new album. 
Overall, the concert was an amazing time. It wasn’t as hyped and exciting as you would expect a concert to be, but that’s just the aura that comes with The Neighbourhood’s black and white aesthetic. I do wish that the band would’ve talked to the crowd more to make it feel more personal, and it would have been great to hear more songs from their studio album I Love You. I also wish that the lighting was slightly different so that the audience could’ve seen their faces better. Despite these hangups, however, I left the concert with good memories and even more reassured of my interest in this band. They’re suave, cool, and chill, and their concert embodied those three defining elements.

If you are a student at Carnegie Mellon University and have never been to the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum on the North Side, you are seriously missing out. Even if you have been to the Mattress Factory before, there is a good chance you haven't seen the current installations as they bring in new artists to construct site-specific art. The collection of permanent exhibits — my favorite of which is doll creator Greer Lankton's It's all about ME, not you room of dolls and madness realized — is also worth the trek to the pioneering museum, whose gallery space inhabits three historic turn-of-the-century buildings. The buildings themselves are worth the visit, as it immerses you in the Pittsburgh architecture of a bygone day.
Because the gallery spaces aren't huge, it is more fun to go the museum when it is not flooded with patrons. This means either during the week or early in the morning on the weekends — the museum opens at 10 a.m. If you are like me and need a muffin or a caffeinated pick-me-up for an early morning museum visit, there is a café downstairs where museum-goers can buy La Prima coffee and food starting at 11:30 a.m.
The more temporary exhibits currently at the Mattress Factory are part of the museum's Factory Installed exhibition, one that stretches multiple buildings and a variety of artists. Gallery staff recommend starting at the top of the main building, the fourth floor, and working down when appreciating the art. The fourth floor is currently home to a couple pieces of work from the Factory Installed exhibition. The first piece that catches the eye after leaving the elevator is Faculty, a sculptural piece of art by Rob Voerman, filling the whole room. My initial impression of this piece was that of a cardboard box fort on steroids. According to the artist, the piece is reflective of the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, and indeed the piece does look like a tower lying on its side. The piece is so large that there is space inside, in which there are some tables, a strong smell of epoxy, and an eerie green light shining in through cool makeshift stained glass windows at the "base" end. A nearby museum visitor noted that the inside looked like the interior of a house after rolling down a hill in an avalanche, leaning precariously in one direction and looking kind of smushed. It did feel like an eerily beautiful and ostentatious children's fort, and the artist himself encourages individuals to utilize [ITAL]Faculty[ITAL] for projects and meetings. 
My other favorite work on the floor was a floating orb in a very dark room. Made primarily of high carbon spring steel wire, Bill Smith's Spherodendron used light that bounced off the acrylic beads on the structure to imitate naturally occurring structures. My initial reaction was that it looked a lot like a neuron. The artist himself defined a "Spherodendron" as an "idealized network," and a structure that becomes "increasingly structurally complex as the building process evolves," yet remains cohesive. The word "Spherodendron" itself translates to "round tree," which the art was definitely reminiscent of. In an explanation by Smith located near the piece, he likened Spherodendron to structures such as computer generated models of the universe, layered cell structures found in the brain cortex, and visual representations of the internet. The piece definitely provoked thought about the patterns of interconnectedness between various things in the scientific and social worlds. Bill Smith also had other components of his exhibition, including a video called chimpanzee, which is exactly what it sounds like. I love monkeys and apes — I think they are fascinating — but I think I was almost too distracted by the general cuteness of chimpanzee babies to think thoughtfully about the video's contribution to Smith's message.
In the basement of the main building was an exhibit titled The Ghost Train, by Marnie Weber. According to the artist, the art installation was designed to create "a metaphorical journey into another state of consciousness." It really seemed to me, however, to be more of a spooky Halloween trip. A giant train-like structure covered in torn white sheets that fluttered in a creepy way dominated half of the large basement room. The other half contained terrifying masks of various creatures and structures of their bodies. The "music" amplified in the room was a combination of train noises and other strange sounds, and in general I found the room kind of trippy and more haunted house-esque. This stood in stark contrast with the semi-demure art gallery experience I was expecting to have. It is definitely appropriate for Halloween, but given that it has a more enduring stay, it definitely seems out of place and it's hard to see past the theatrics. That being said, I kind of loved it. 
In one of the other buildings with pieces from Factory Installed, visitors walk in to an art piece by two recent Carnegie Mellon graduates. Jacob Douenias (CFA '13) and Ethan Frier (CFA '13) created a piece called Living Things, which occupies a large space in front of the door. Their work uses live spirulina algae-filled containers to communicate an idealized future wherein "the symbiosis between human beings and microorganisms is externalized and celebrated in the built environment." The pieces both have a social message, and are incredibly beautiful; the central element of the Living Things consists of three beautiful orbs hanging over a table and chairs like a chandelier, the algae filled containers with a translucent and gorgeous green color. Not only were all elements of their pieces awesome and interesting, but it is impressive that individuals so young got the honor of having their work displayed at this critically acclaimed museum. 
In the third and final building, all three floors were dedicated to work by a single artist. While this exhibition has been up since 2013 and is not technically part of Factory Installed, it will be gone this spring, so see it while you can! Chiharu Shiota's piece Trace of Memory has taken over the old Pittsburgh building with black yarn. Thousands and thousands of randomly crossing yarn strings line the walls, stapled to the floor and ceiling, forming a dense and mind-blowing web. On the upper floors objects are suspended or partially obscured by the yarn, depicting how memory works to trap things in the web of the mind, where it is never possible to totally access or view the memory in its complete and accurate state. After viewing other art where it was more tricky to pick out the intention behind the piece, Shiota's three story yarn frenzy seemed almost too easy to understand. I thought that the exhibit could have been a little smaller, because it didn't take three floors to understand. That being said, I could have missed something.
This is not a comprehensive list of all the art at the museum by any means, neither the permanent nor temporary exhibits, but I highly recommend heading out and making your own judgments. Enjoyment of certain kinds of contemporary art is always conditional on the type of person you are and what is important to you, and the museum certainly offers enough variety to intrigue almost anyone.
The Mattress Factory is located at 500 Sampsonia Way and admission is free with a valid Carnegie Mellon ID.

While many come to Carnegie Mellon for the promise of making big bucks after graduation, few can say they are rolling in the Benjamins during their time on campus. At the same time, this is a school that demands quite a bit, so having fun and being social is a must for a healthy outlook on life. So, if you’re looking to have a solid night, (afternoon, morning) out but are working on a shoestring college budget look no further than this handy, day-by-day guide to all the best local food/drink specials. 
Monday
It’s Monday, the Meg Griffin of the days of the week: nobody’s happy about it. So why not use chemicals and a little Monday Night Football to change that? Will Penn Tavern in Shadyside offers 20 oz drafts of craft beer (so, like, Blue Moon and stuff) for $4, and at Mario’s East Side Saloon in Shadyside you can load up on $0.39 wings from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. before hitting $2 well drinks from 10 p.m. to midnight. The Yard in Shadyside also offers half-off all grilled cheese sandwiches from 7 p.m. to midnight, and if you’ve ever been there you know how big a deal that is. About half their menu is comprised of more variations on the grilled cheese sandwich than you could ever hope to imagine. 
Tuesday
Tuesday, the younger sibling of Monday that’s slightly easier to get along with. At Stack’d in Shadyside (and soon Oakland, huzzah!) you can get burgers for half-price from 9 p.m. through midnight, and at the Garage Door Saloon in Oakland, feel free to drown yourself in the fountain of youth that is Bud Light with $1, 16 oz drafts until midnight and $4 pitchers all day. 
Wednesday
Wednesday is the day of the week where everything starts to turn around; you’re over the hump, and and you've hit cruise control ready to glide into the weekend. It’s only fitting that today there are quite a number of specials as well. If you’re a vegetarian who also likes to get his drank on, Stack’d offers half-off veggie burgers from 9 p.m. to midnight and half-off drinks from 10 p.m. to midnight. Shady Grove in Shadyside offers half-off bottles of wine if that’s more your speed, and The Yard also offers half-off wine bottles as well as $4 on certain glasses of whiskey. If the act of drinking itself isn’t fun enough for you, hit up Gene’s Place in Oakland for their trivia night beginning at 10 p.m. today. It’s a great bar that offers $5 pitchers of Old German, though I suggest getting a different beer first before switching to the Old German. Trust me.
Thursday
Here we are. Thirsty Thursday: a staple of every college student’s schedule as true as finals week and mom-and-dad-coming-to-visit-so-I-don’t-have-to-eat-at-the-cheapest-places-around-weekend. On any given Thursday, the two most popular options are usually the $1 well drinks at Stack’d from 10 p.m. to midnight or the college night special from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. at Hofbrahaus in Southside. College night, though, is much more than a drink special, but an experience all Pittsburgh students should experience at least once. They offer two liter steins (yes, two liters) for $6 a piece, as well as half-off their bier cheese pretzel appetizers, and a house polka band runs through a set list of everything from Taylor Swift to “Sweet Caroline” and various patriotic anthems. Everyone stands up on long benches and sings and toasts each other and you’ll swear you’re in a beer hall in Munich. Lots of fun; don’t miss it. In addition, Mario’s offers a trivia night with $2 Miller Lite drafts and Cappy’s Café in Shadyside has $4 Guinness drafts and half-off wine bottles. 
Sunday
Sunday, Sunday, brunch day! Some genius devised the idea that if you served alcohol with breakfast food and called it “brunch” it was all okay, and that person deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for sure. The two best brunch specials I know of are served at The Yard and Shady Grove. The Yard offers $2.50 pints of Blue Moon as well as bottomless mimosas for $15. Yes, they are bottomless. Across Walnut Street at Shady Grove, you can get mimosas, appleosas, or cranosas for $3 each. I never knew there were so many –osas. There are also food at these places too, but let’s be honest: that’s not the point of brunch.

Diwali, or the Festival of Lights, is an ancient Hindu festival celebrated in the Fall. Having the same connotation in India that New Year’s Day does in Western cultures, the festival celebrates the brightness and color in life. 
While Diwali’s official celebration is only in a few weeks, the student organization OM organized it the past week between Oct. 13 and 17. OM grouped Diwali festivities together with the celebration of Navarathri, because it is a well-liked festivity among all students on campus.
Navarathri, a festival dedicated to the Hindu deity Durga, is celebrated over nine nights with each day being represented by a different color — usually expressed through colorful outfits — depending on what events are happening on a certain day and how auspicious it is.
The club organizes this week-long celebration at Carnegie Mellon every year by putting together a series of events where the main focus is light. 
Some of the events organized this year included a Pujan (a traditional praying ceremony in the school chapel), the lighting of candles in front of the Jared L. Cohon University Center, and a Garba dance workshop. These events are directed not only at the Indian community at Carnegie Mellon, but also at the whole student body. According to Vice President of Communications of OM and junior economics and statistics major Srishti Jain, these events attract large crowds. The praying ceremony on Tuesday was comprised of twenty students. The students sang a common Indian prayer song and took a moment of silence to pray for good things to come.
For Jain, this is an important moment, especially because students are far away from their families at school. Thus, the organizers hoped to convey a homey feeling to those that are present. An event on Wednesday titled “Lights will guide you hOMe” gathered students on the Merson courtyard to light diyas — a kind of oil lamp — symbolizing lighting up one’s life and the world. The culmination of Diwali Week was Saturday in an event called Diwali Garba. In a combination of all that was celebrated during the week, this is the club’s biggest event. Diwali Garba took place in the CUC’s Wiegand Gymnasium, decorated with saris and lights, and it usually gathers three hundred to four hundred people in a family-style celebration that includes dinner followed by several performances of students such as the Raas dance team, folklore dances, and a cappella singing. It is also a good time to have fun with friends and dress up, as Srishti recalls sharing some of her traditional clothes with girls on her floor during her first year.
In order to sell tickets, OM has tried something different by posting the event on Carnegie Mellon’s new online ticket office to facilitate the process and broaden the spectrum of guests able to attend.
OM is one of the most prominent organizations on campus for Hindu, Sikh, and Jain spirituality and culture. The club organizes events throughout the year which focus not only on religious aspects of these groups but also on their cultural significance. Some events to look forward to are the Lohri in the Winter — a Sikh event where people gather around a giant bonfire while enjoying music, performances, s’mores and Indian-style corn — and Holi in the Spring, known as the festival of color, where people sing and dance, while chasing and coloring each other. 
Around 1000 people went to OM’s Holi celebration last year.

Bob Moses is a transformative figure in the African American community and in the United States. He leads the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which sought to end racial inequality and to increase voter registration in Mississippi during the Civil Rights Movement. He is also the founder of the Algebra Project, an organization that uses mathematics as an organizing tool to ensure quality public school education for every child in America. This Thursday, Carnegie Mellon hosted “An Evening with Bob Moses” to hear his opinions on the current educational setbacks the country still faces and what action needs to be taken in order to fix them.
Surrounded by a group of young, enthusiastic Carnegie Mellon student panelists, Bob Moses stood cool and collected. This behavior was highlighted by his quiet assertiveness over Carnegie Mellon’s overpopulated audience in Porter Hall 100. “People who know Bob Moses repeatedly underscore his quiet demeanor, and his inner resolve, courage, and determination to lead not by preachment…but to lead by example,” said director of Carnegie Mellon’s African American Urban Studies and the Economy (CAUSE), Dr. Joe William Trotter. 
Dr. Trotter reflected back on his time growing up in the south and his generation’s association with Bob Moses on the same level as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Many audience members shared their gratitude at the fact that Moses was gracious enough to spend time and share his words of wisdom with the Carnegie Mellon community. Bob Moses began his talk by reflecting on his time on the witness stand during a court case that occurred in 1963, which brought to light the issue of sharecropper illiteracy being a subtext of the right to vote. Back then, sharecroppers were denied literacy because of their line of work. Moses recalls that this was a direct result of this country’s tendency to “pre-assign” work to people and then giving them the education they need for it. Because of their illiteracy, sharecroppers were denied their right to vote.
Moses connects this point to the 1970 case of San Antonio vs. Rodriguez, which was the result of 400 disgruntled Mexican American students demanding the federal government provide them with a better high school and better teachers. Moses summarized the court justices’ denial of their demands as hinging on the fact that “there is no substantive constitutional right for education.” He cited the constitution of New York, which states that young people should be educated to serve on juries and to vote, which gives them adequate knowledge to be able to perform low paying jobs. “This is your 21st century version of sharecropper education,” Moses said.
One of the student panelists sought Moses’ opinions on the differing college preparation programs that this country offers. She recounted her realization that “in order to get to a competitive college like Carnegie Mellon, my public school in Baltimore was not going to be able to do that for me” which led to her switching to a more advantageous school. There are many failing public schools that, instead of being fixed, are simply left to run. This has led to the creation of various rescue programs, such as magnet schools, the voucher system, A Better Chance program, and affirmative action.
“Lately, this country seems to be focusing on ways to close the widening achievement gaps between students,” Moses said. Moses believes that in place of this, this country should work on creating a standard that will provide structured opportunities for students that are at the bottom. “It was radical to do voting for sharecroppers in Mississipi,” Moses said. “It’s radical to make sure that kids at the bottom get the math they need so they can meet a standard.” Moses defines this standard as having students “leave high school, graduate on time, ready to do college math for college credit.” Moses believes that this is a necessary step to stop kids from graduating directly into the American criminal justice system. 
From 1970 to 2010, the Southern Education Foundation observed the percentage of students that graduated from college in terms of their income brackets. Mr. Moses said, “For the top quarter of the nation’s income bracket in 1970, 40 percent graduated from college; 40 years later in 2010, 80 percent graduated from college.” This shows a very impressive trend of upward educational mobility, right? Mr. Moses goes on to relay that “In 1970 for the bottom quarter, 7 percent graduated from college; 40 years later, 9 percent graduated.” These numbers were received by the audience with staggered gasps of surprise and dismay. If students do not demand the change they seek, it won’t happen. The current generation needs to be more focused on finding ways to form an alliance between lower tier students and officials that can incite educational change, Moses said. This may seem like a large task to tackle, but in the words of Bob Moses, “You’ve got to think really small about how you’ll get your start, because everything starts really small.”

Every Wednesday, the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens hosts “Farmers at Phipps,” where vendors of all kinds can sell their certified organically grown food and plant products. Among the many tents set up along Schenley Drive, a one-man organic salt business and a 64-year-old family-owned vegetable farm stand. Families, young professionals, and students alike have been frequenting the market every Wednesday from June to October since its inauguration in 2011.
Richard Piacentini, the Executive Director of Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens was the original founder of “Farmers at Phipps.” the Internal Events Manager at Phipps Marla Checchio said that the initial stages “took some time to build” but they have been pleased with its recent success. Their goal with “Farmers at Phipps” is to “reach out to residents in urban areas to show them that you can buy fresh and local produce in an easy way, here at the market,” Checchio said.
Currently, 16 unique vendors travel from far and wide to set up shop in Farmers at Phipps. They include Apoidea Apiary, Atelier Glass Studio & Gallery, Blackberry Meadows Farm, Brenckle’s Organic Farm and Greenhouse, Cherish Creamery, City Grows, Clarion River Organics, Friendship Farms, Olive & Marlowe, Pastamore, Randita’s Vegan Café, Son Shine Farm, Steel City Salt, and Una Biologicals.
Tom Brenckle of the 64-year-old Brenckle’s Organic Farm and Greenhouse described the trade-offs of switching to all-organic produce. 
When it became too difficult for Brenckle’s Farm to compete with large agriculture companies, turning to organic farming seemed like the best way to attract a reliable customer base. Even though the organic crops are harder to maintain, he stressed that, “You have to have a niche.”
Some vendors are newly formed businesses hoping to spread word of their products. Doug Pinto started his one-man company Steel Cup Coffee in April 2014. He sources all of his beans from inside the U.S. and roasts them locally in Pittsburgh. 
Pinto even has a “Black & Yellow” blend to represent his Pittsburgh pride. Pinto says he participates in the market mainly “to get people tasting the coffee, and seeing the name.” He is growing his independent business by selling his coffee at Phipps as well as at other farmers’ markets around the city.
Since so many of the businesses have profited from Carnegie Mellon, University of Pittsburgh, and Carlow University students, businesses have now started to provide incentives to students to get them to continue trying out their products. 
Patty Logan of City Grows, an organic garden shop in Lawrenceville, offers a 10 percent discount on any item at her store when students present their IDs. All of her plants are certified organic and locally grown.
Checchio commented on the importance of organic products and stressed that the organizers “strive to reach all ages,” especially students, with the market. They are focused on showing that buying locally grown food not only keeps small, local businesses running but also promotes a healthier diet.
Although there is a variety of vendors at the market, most agreed on the positive relationships they formed with the Pittsburgh and student communities. Terry Seltzer of Son Shine Farms said, “This has been the most beautiful farmer’s market.... The people are wonderful here.” Ms. Seltzer sells fish, meat, honey and dairy products. She’s been farming since she was 16 years old.
Paula Kedgwick of Cherish Creameries expressed similar sentiments regarding her experience at Phipps. “We get all the students,” she added. “They love the cheese, and I’ve met so many nice kids.” Kedgwick has been running her goat dairy farm for just over a year and a half. She and her family bought the farm on a whim, and moved to Western Pennsylvania to run it.
Checchio said that there is definitely room to grow for Farmers at Phipps. By adding vendors and raising awareness about the market, they hope to have more local community members as regular customers in the next year.
Most of the vendors depend on successful markets like Farmers at Phipps to stay up and running, so they are happy to see urban communities like Pittsburgh supporting local, organic farming. One thing is certain: Farmers at Phipps offers an impressive variety of healthy, local food options, and it can only continue to grow with the help of the Pittsburgh community.

At the beginning of her speech this Wednesday, teacher, writer, and LGBT rights activist Robyn Ochs addressed her audience: “On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution of the United States guarantees all people the freedom to marry.” Of course, this fact was met with an overwhelming chorus of hoots and hollers from the audience. She followed this with the question: “So what’s next, folks? Are we done?” An overwhelming “no” resonated from the audience.
This question accentuates a key message in Ochs’ speech, titled “What do we do after ‘we do?’ ” According to Ochs, though the nation made an extreme stride with marriage equality, total equality is not yet fully realized. This is a fact not unique to the LGBT population in America; African American civil rights are in a similar place. Even after the movement in the ’60s, civil rights have never stopped being a contested issue in the United States, and LGBT issues seem to be no different. The crowd unanimously agreed on this point.
Suffice it to say, progress has come more swiftly than expected. When Ochs asked the crowd if anyone once believed that marriage equality would never occur in their lifetime, nearly half of the 40-some attendees rose their hands in agreement. Similarly, half of the audience raised their hands when asked, “how many of you identify as LGBT and plan to be closeted at work?” Ochs pointed to both of these engagements as a representation of both the success in recent years, but also existing social stigmas regarding the LGBT community that should change.
To show the audience’s agreement with these facts, Ochs engaged attendees in an open discussion about what has changed for LGBT youth in students’ lifetimes. Positive changes mentioned included the elimination of homosexuality as a mental disorder; the increasing awareness of multiple sexual identities; the first usage of the terms “bisexual” and “transgender” by a U.S. president in a State of the Union address; more open professionals in politics, sports, the armed forces, and in the media; among many other positive social shifts.
At the same time, Ochs asked attendees to express persisting issues, or new issues that have arisen, pointing to the fact that there is still action that needs to be taken. Very subtle, but very notable, is the absence of homosexual relationships in sexual education in schools nationwide. A tragedy, and a more pressing issue, is the fact that 50 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT. Attendees scoffed at the fact that blood donation requires that an individual be straight to donate blood. Ochs followed this with the joke “let’s just eliminate heteronormalcy altogether.” Heteronormativity is a big contributor to mental health issues among LGBT youth, and still stigmatizes homosexual couples. Heteronormativity also allows homophobia to pervade certain parts of U.S. society.
“In 29 states, you can be fired for being LGBT,” Ochs said. State law does not regulate the discriminatory firing of LGBT employees simply for the reason of their sexual identity. This is something that can be solved simply through legislation, and it’s actually easier for a citizen to get involved in lawmaking than one might think, Ochs said.
“U.S. citizens out of state, mail in and set up your absentee ballot now. It’s essential that you vote in the coming months,” Ochs said. This is merely the first step. Local representatives, senators, and federal congresspersons have a more influential role in lawmaking than the president does. In last year’s midterm elections, voter apathy was a main contributor to the major swing from left to right in both houses of congress.
Preventing this swing is not the only thing that allows students to involve themselves in legislation. Mailing lists keep constituents aware of what legislation comes up in state lawmakers’ offices. This is a low time commitment, but can keep activists up-to-date on what type of lawmaking decisions are facing the lawmakers from their district. “What a mailing list means is if they’re trying to get a bill passed, such as non-discrimination, legislators need to vote for that bill. Mailing lists may email blast you saying ‘we want to pass bill blah-blah-blah: Click to see who your state legislator is,’ ” Ochs said.
This brought Ochs to an important point: calling your local legislator. Most people are averse to calling their local lawmaker, but it’s not as daunting as they might assume. “I want to say something about calling a legislator. 
It can sound really scary, calling to lobby for a bill, but here’s the truth about it: On a legislator’s aid desk, there is a sheet of paper for every issue, and what they do is tally the number of yes and no votes for each issue,” Ochs said.
All a constituent really needs to do is call in the office, and tell the senator or congressperson where they stand on a bill, and nothing else. Ochs noted that because so few call in to lobby for their opinion, legislators typically take these few opinions as an accurate representation of what their district wants. A question then presents itself: Why isn’t there more equality legislation passed nationwide if the LGBT community is so politically active?
It is an incorrect assumption that the LGBT community is overall proactively involved in civil rights legislation, Ochs said. Objectively, it may seem that the community is not very involved in promoting its own positions. 
“One of the statistics that most analysts make is that only something under five percent of the LGBT community give any money at all to groups who support their causes,” Ochs said.
The change can happen from without, but it was clear during this whole discussion that first it must come from within the LGBT community. “I want to challenge every single person, including every single person in this room, to step up to the plate,” Ochs said.
LGBT students on Carnegie Mellon’s own campus can reach out to their community and can stop minority stress (“the concept that stigma prejudice and discrimination create a hostile and stressful social environment”) themselves, and can start pushing for more equality legislation. — it is really about getting out there and actively solving problems and less about pontificating over what problems persist.

“Do things that matter to you, and people will notice,” Director of Strategic Initiatives and Engagement at Carnegie Mellon Rick Siger said to an audience at Hamburg Hall on Wednesday.
Siger talked about how he started from Pittsburgh, worked in the White House under the Obama Administration, and finally went back to Pittsburgh to join the faculty of Carnegie Mellon. In his speech “From Pittsburgh to the White House and Back: My Time in the Obama Administration,” Siger offered advice and stories from his journey to help students develop.
“Work hard, always follow through, and people will notice,” Siger said. He observed that people who did not work hard hardly followed through, so he concluded that success entailed being a person that people could rely on. Furthermore, Siger said that governing is not just about skillful management, not just about relationships, and not just about good ideas — governing is also about persistence. “Keep going at it. Keep going at it,” Siger said.
Siger recalled that his big wins in the Obama administration came after he and his colleagues “tried and tried and tried.” When working in the White House, holidays were rare for him, Siger said. But he enjoyed what he was doing, and at his lecture he encouraged students to do things that were important to them. Siger emphasized that one should be confident. “At some point in your career, you will realize that people are looking for you to lead. Be ready, and buy into yourself,” Siger said. By saying that, Siger reiterated diligence as an important virtue for one’s success; however, Siger reminded the students that this simply was not enough. Students should never be afraid to take a risk, and they should be able to seize any chance. To do that, Siger said, one should “buy into” himself.
Siger also said that good motives should not be questioned. Politics is serious business, and audiences should know that not everything on TV should be trusted. The in-fighting between parties was not the whole picture, because politician’s main goal is to work for the prosperity of the country. For example, Siger recalled the moment when Obama’s team won the election. 
In that solemn moment of power transfer, Bush shook hands with Obama and wished Obama and his team the best. Siger remarked that people at Washington DC work hard with the hope of moving the country forward “because they love this country.”
Siger’s job required him to organize people from several different backgrounds. When asked how to work with such disparate groups, Siger advised listeners to read as much as possible and to ask a lot of questions in order to know enough to make the right decision.
Raised in Pittsburgh, Siger left after high school to pursue an undergraduate degree at Columbia University. He graduated with a B.A. in Political Science, and shortly after served as Deputy Secretary of Commerce and Trade in the Cabinet of Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. In Virginia, Siger led government-wide initiatives on rural economic development, energy policy, federal base realignment, closure actions, as well as travel and tourism. He served on the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign for nearly 18 months as Director of Advance for the Iowa Caucuses, National Advance Lead, and then National Trip Director for Vice President Joe Biden.
In Washington, Siger served as Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Commerce. As a member of Commerce’s Executive Management Team, he partnered with the Secretary and Deputy Secretary in the general management and strategic decision-making process for the Department. Siger served the Obama Administration in other key roles at Commerce beginning in January 2009, including Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary and Director of the Office of White House Liaison. 
Siger also served as Chief of Staff at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). At OSTP, he facilitated policy development and implementation across a broad spectrum of science, technology, and innovation issues, including global climate change, privacy, and cybersecurity.
About a year ago, Siger decided to go back to Pittsburgh. “Pittsburgh is awesome,” Siger said. Siger believes in this place and this university, and he wants to “help Pittsburgh grow.” Now Rick Siger is the Director of Strategic Initiatives and Engagement at Carnegie Mellon. In that role, he serves on the University’s senior management team, focusing on strategic planning, economic development, and stakeholder engagement.

The Carnegie Mellon Student Government held its first town hall of the year in Doherty Hall last Thursday. Though the event was advertised on Facebook as “Not Your Mother’s Town Hall,” the turn-out was much lower than expected.
Students (not including members of the president’s cabinet, vice president, and president) only managed to fill out a sparse, single-digit number of seats in the 2210 lecture hall. Regardless, those who did show up managed to have a robust dialogue with Student Government members about improving the campus experience for the whole student body.
The student government holds regular monthly meetings with administrators, and within those meetings tries to represent the voices of all thirteen-thousand graduate and undergraduate students. “We have direct contact with Dining Services, Housing Services, Suresh, and others,” Student Representation Chairman and sophomore business administration major Thomas Preite said. “If we want to get something done, they will do everything in their power to get that done.”
Along with Student Body President and senior policy & management and Chinese studies double major J.R. Marshall and Student Body Vice President and senior information systems major Jibby Ayo-Ani, cabinet members in attendance included: Head of Student-Faculty Relations and senior psychology and French double major Siriana Abboud; Chief of Staff and sophomore biology major Apeksha Atal; Chief Design Officer and fourth-year architecture major Aileena Gray; Chief Marketing Officers, junior information systems major and junior history major respectively, Jen Han and Gwen Luvara; Head of Events & Logistics and sophomore psychology major Kevin Wainczak; and finally, Preite himself.
After various members fumbled around with the PowerPoint projector and house lights, Preite kicked off the town hall by stating the Student Government’s platform: Reorient, empower, serve.
Members of Student Government want to direct students from Carnegie Mellon’s growing stress culture to resources that could help them maintain their mental and physical health. Another issue central to “reorienting” the student body is educating people on sexual assault and relationship violence and how to prevent it.
Student Government members brought out a large sheet of paper scribbled with suggestions from students and faculty, written during a “tabling” session on the Cut. These suggestions included implementing a plus/minus system for grades, having a longer fall break, and solving the troubling segregation between the undergraduate colleges. 
Food was another pressing issue brought to StuGov at tabling — in particular, working on making Dinex more useful for students. “I don’t even know what [off-campus locations] accept it; but not enough,” Preite said. 
In addition to food, many students had brought up expanding the shuttle service, and offering Carnegie Mellon students access to different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.
“Pittsburgh’s such a great city, and a lot of people don’t get to know that,” Preite said. Senior psychology student Tyler Novet concurred. He mentioned that until earlier this year, he had “no clue” how the shuttle system worked. Even so, Novet admitted that the service was often not available at a convenient time.
The most robust dialogue of the evening, however, surrounded the topic of bringing back a student mentorship program. The program allowed upperclassmen to guide incoming first years within each college, according to Abboud, who also stated that Dietrich College is making an effort to have such a program this year. Currently, mentorship programs exist for international students as well as students within the architecture program, and a voluntary sign-up for the Mellon College of Science, according to Ayo-Ani.
Town hall guest and computer science exchange student from Carnegie Mellon Qatar Aliaa Essameldin outlined the academically-centered mentorship program at the satellite campus, as well as the currently-existing “buddy program” for exchange students. “You can easily find [social] guidance,” Essameldin said. “The problem is finding someone who can be helpful in your professional and academic career.” 
On the contrary, Luvara suggested a mentorship program that instead could promote having relationships across disciplines. Han agreed, stating that having students reach out across majors could perhaps guide those who are undecided, or willing to change colleges or departments. 
After echoes from Abboud and Ayo-Ani for a type of “half-and-half” academic and social program, town hall guest and junior economics and professional writing major Barbara Samaniego spoke up, suggesting that perhaps such a program could remain interdepartmental over the summer and shift mentors across majors throughout the school year, or perhaps mirror the “bigs and littles” pairings often seen within Greek life.
In the vein of mentorship, Novet brought up aspects of the orientation program that could further benefit freshmen students — specifically, giving the orientation counselors a more concrete job and “putting it on [them] to get to know the students, and find them a mentor.” To close the discussion on mentorship, Atal brought up a Facebook about the roles of Orientation Counselors in Orientation week, and whether their role was really “for fun and raising school spirit,” or for actually helping first years become acclimated to the campus.
Toward the end of the town hall, Student Government discussed issues brought up in the Student Initiative Poll, emailed out to the student body earlier this year. Along with widening shuttle and escort service, tobacco and alcohol use on campus were among the most talked-about issues in the poll.
“[A tobacco-free campus] is something that we are working on, that has been voted on by different bodies,” Ayo-Ani said. “Undergraduate and graduate just barely made it to tobacco free [in the polls], and faculty wanted to move to a smoke-free campus.” The staff senate, though, was very against the idea.
As for alcohol use, when students suggested that the university should deal with cases internally rather than processing them to the Pittsburgh Police Department, Ayo-Ani pointed out that the majority of the time, a magistrate would be willing to appeal a citation for underage drinking. “There is a way we do it at [Carnegie Mellon], where we make sure that someone doesn’t get forever-penalized for a mistake that they made,” Ayo-Ani said.
Finally, Abboud brought up the limitations of the SafeWalk program, which only assigns volunteers to accompany students to on-campus housing locations. Pointing out the ineffectiveness of the shuttle services, she recounted the fear that many students felt in regards to going off-campus.
Marshall closed the meeting. When he and Ayo-Ani took on their jobs as student body leaders, they “wanted to be the best representation of the student body as possible,” which proved to be a challenge, as they would have to represent thirteen thousand distinct voices. By holding a town hall, “This is the best way we thought we could approach it,” Marshall said.

Ursula Burns currently serves as the Chairwoman and CEO of Xerox, a Fortune 500 company. She is both the first woman to succeed another woman as CEO (Anne Mulcahy) of a Fortune 500 company, and the first female African-American CEO. Burns frequently appears on Fortune’s and Forbes’ most powerful women lists, and was rated the 22nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes in 2014.
Burns was the second speaker in the W.L. Mellon Speaker Series, a series of lectures aiming to provide students with insight into the work of global leaders, CEOs, and management experts. During her time at Xerox, Burns succeeded in making the company a more diversified business enterprise. In her lecture, Burns discussed Xerox’s business transformations, described her leadership brand, and offered useful advice for succeeding in all types of careers.
Like David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric and previous Mellon speaker, Burns believes that a company’s ability to change and adapt holds the key to the company’s success. Burns believes that, in today’s changing world, “if you don’t transform your company, you’re stuck.”
Before certain advances in technology, Xerox led the market in document printing and production. The new technological advances greatly diminished the value of the company’s product, and Xerox needed to evolve into an enterprise more apt for the changing world. Burns detailed this evolution in her lecture, introducing and describing two main parts to the discussion of company transformation: “What [the company] does” and “How [the company] does it.”
What Xerox Does
Burns began by introducing the notion of adding product and customer value to company goods. To illustrate this, she explained how the value of the printed page changed, forcing Xerox to adapt. In this case, the actual demand for printed pages hadn’t decreased, but the value customers derived from them plummeted. Customers no longer valued printed documents; new technologies enabled them to print hundreds of document copies at relatively low costs. To work with this technological change, Burns transformed Xerox into a business process development company, and expanded to include more valued services of document technology.
How Xerox Does It
To expand, Xerox started buying small companies that provided similar services. As Xerox purchased enterprises around the country, it quickly realized that it was losing its company identity due to the distinct nature of each enterprise. Fearing the consequences, the company worked to solidify the identity it had. Xerox stopped purchasing the small enterprises and focused on becoming primarily customer based.
Burns believes that what the company does is simple and straightforward. The way in which the company transforms, however, is far more complicated. To further explain why Xerox transformed as it did, Burns talked about her leadership style and her qualities as a CEO.
Ursula Burns as a Leader
“I was the only person in the room who looked like me,” Burns said. People noticed that Burns was different; Xerox noticed that she was different.
In the business world, Ursula Burns is a triple minority; she is black, a woman, and an engineer. But, what do these differences really mean? During her lecture, she highlighted two main differences between her and other CEOs: gender differences and practical approaches to problem solving.
Burns says, “gender differences are real, and I like them.” She asserted that there are differences in how men and women approach problems, run enterprises, and make decisions. Furthermore, she argues that these differences are highly beneficial for a company. According to Burns, these differences help steer the company towards toward success, providing a variety of well-constructed options and diverse ideas.
As an engineer, Burns has a far more practical mental framework than other CEOs. Her decisions and reasoning are rooted in practicality. Her practical framework further enhances the company’s decisions, offering a logical perspective to business proceedings.
Burns’s method of approaching problems differs from that of other CEO’s because of gender differences and her highly practical frame of mind. Other than her method, her employees described her style similar to that of previous male CEOs. 
“Breaking and Sweating,” Burns said, is a Company’s Perception of its CEO. Most CEO’s believe that their company employees must never see them “break a sweat.” These CEOs feel compelled to create the illusion of a nonplussed corporate authority, an authority that never outwardly reveals its personal fears or company concerns. For Burns, creating such a facade feels wrong and counterproductive.
“My team sees me sweat. When I’m crazed, they know it; when I’m happy, they know it,” Burns said. She esteems this type of transparency in her company for the sake of a better team effort. Burns believes that, as a team of members, the company makes up the whole. Her leadership style is to be authentic, even in the bad things.
Burns describes herself as a “missionary leader.” A dedicated, driven individual, she goes “in for the long.” All of her personal milestones are making Xerox better and improving her relationship with the company.
Advice for The Ambitious Student
Long before she was a CEO, Burns attended an all girls Catholic high school in the middle of Manhattan. For those students graduating the high school, there were essentially only three career options: becoming a nurse, a nun, or a teacher. None of these professions appealed to Burns, so she took to the library to research other career options. Burns initially studied chemical engineering, but soon realized that she was not passionate about the field, and switched to mechanical engineering. Burns graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and accepted an internship at Xerox. At Xerox, Burns fell in love with the company, and returned to work full time. During her time at Xerox, she was offered two tantalizing positions with other companies, but she refused them because she was dedicated to her work.
This kind of dedication and hard work greatly impressed the audience. Inspired by Burns’s lecture, one audience member raised her hand and asked Burns for advice on having a successful career. Burns in turn stood up, picked up a piece of chalk, and wrote three keys for success on the chalkboard.
To succeed, every person needs to work hard. Hard work is inspired by the passion influencing that work, and all people must realize the career path that gives them joy, Burns stated.
Burns believes that the only way one can truly work hard is if they have joy, for truly hard work depends on the level of one’s passion for his subject. The higher this level, the more invested individuals becomes in their work.
A successful individual cannot see money as an end goal. Monetary gain is a poor incentive and won’t lead to truly hard work. As Burns assured, “one more dollar doesn’t make a difference,” and in the grand scheme of the world, the extra money one could have earned without dedication and joy is insignificant. Finally, Burns reminded her audience that, “the world is too big and life is too short to either not like what you do or to not like where you work.”
She closed by reaffirming her key advice, “the only way to succeed is to work hard, have joy, and remember that money is not the end.”

Carnegie Mellon University and the Hillman Foundation announced the establishment of the Henry L. Hillman President’s Chair last Wednesday. The inaugural holder of the endowed position will be President Subra Suresh.
The idea was realized through a seed donation of $11 million, courtesy of the Henry L. Hillman Foundation. This, added to contributions of other Pittsburgh-area philanthropies, totals to almost $20 million collected thus far. The university aims to raise $30 million as it continues its fundraising efforts.
The endowed chair and the revenue stemming from the endowed fund will be used at the president’s discretion for extra-budgetary purposes. President Suresh said in a statement that he would be using the annual payouts to fund special initiatives in key areas and to seed innovative ideas, among other projects. Last year, the president used endowed funds to match separate fundraising efforts by the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the College of Fine Arts of $1 million each. These funds, dubbed “challenge grants” were put toward faculty research and creative work. The endowed chair will provide Suresh with even more flexibility to pay for anything that may fall outside of set budgets.
With regard to the contribution, President Suresh said, “This gift provides a permanent stream of critically needed resources to attract and support talented faculty and students. That is an essential responsibility for me and for all presidents who follow, and I am deeply grateful to the Henry L. Hillman Foundation for this support.”
Mr. Hillman, on behalf of his foundation, said, “We view this as an investment in the future, a way to help fuel and accelerate the momentum generated by Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh in recent years.” He added that his foundation is “delighted that this chair will help support Dr. Suresh’s vision and work for Carnegie Mellon.”
Forbes magazine listed Hillman as having a net worth of $2.5 billion, making him the wealthiest person in the city. His assets mainly come from early investments made in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Kleiner Perkins, large multinational private equity and venture capital firms, respectively.
Hillman has historically been a large patron of the University. The foundation he established in 1964 is dedicated to improving society with a focus on southwestern Pennsylvania and the city of Pittsburgh. Staying true to his foundation’s goal of improving the quality of life in Pittsburgh and the surrounding region, Hillman noted that his discussions with President Suresh over the last year centered around the ways in which the university positively impacts the economic and cultural environment of the greater city.
In 2008, the foundation donated $10 million to support the Hillman Center for Future Generation Technologies, a part of the Gates-Hillman complex. Other donations include a $5 million grant for the BrainHub research initiative in 2014, as well as $2.75 million for the Traffic21 and Metro21 projects in the same year.
Carnegie Mellon Board of Trustees member John Rohr said that the foundation’s largest donation to the university is “particularly timely” for the institution, where change is ever-increasing.

IBM and CMU create platform to aid blind 
Last Thursday, Carnegie Mellon and IBM scientists announced the launch of the first open platform intended to facilitate the creation of smartphone navigation apps for the blind. Researchers created an app with the new program, NavCog, for use around campus.
The app works by people “whispering” into the user’s ears through headphones, aided by vibrations. According to a university press release, the app uses “signals from Bluetooth beacons located along walkways and from smartphone sensors to help enable users to move without human assistance, whether inside campus buildings or outdoors.” It was announced that updates might include notices about who is approaching, and will detect the moods of surrounding people.
Developers can access the platform online through IBM Bluemix, a cloud-based site for managing apps. Tools for navigation and map editing can be accessed through the site, including a means for the blind to find their location in real time.
Visiting faculty member and IBM fellow Chieko Asakawa, who is visually impaired herself, noted in the university press release “While visually impaired people like myself have become independent online, we are still challenged in the real world. To gain further independence and help improve the quality of life, ubiquitous connectivity across indoor and outdoor environments is necessary.”
Six Degrees of Francis Bacon launches
Earlier this week, The Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences launched a new website called “Six Degrees of Francis Bacon.” Through a partnership with Georgetown University, Carnegie Mellon has created a way for users to track the personal relationships between the likes of Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Shakespeare, and countless others. According to the university press release, “the site currently identifies more than 13,000 individuals and highlights approximately 200,000 relationships.”
Project director Christopher Warren pointed out that site users are able to instantly learn about the relationships between prominent historical figures, regardless of how obscure their connection may be. Students, professors, and other history enthusiasts will all be able to benefit from the site’s services.
According to the university press release, Georgetown University’s Daniel Shore,and Carnegie Mellon’s Jessica Otis are spearheading the project. The two relied on Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Statistics as they mined data from 62 million words in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. “Every early modern document is a record of complex relations between authors, printers, publishers, booksellers, dedicatees, polemical opponents, and so on. Students can often add to the social network just by studying the relations documented in the title page and front matter of a single 16th-century book,” said Shore.
Through the use of the site’s meticulous color-coding system, which indicates the extent to which each figure has been studied, professionals and amateurs alike will be able to benefit from the integration of technology and the historical world.

Which is more harmless — a handgun or a dildo? Surprisingly, this seems to be a question that stumps a lot of Americans. Last June, the Texas state legislature passed the “Campus Carry Law,” which allows students at University of Texas campuses to carry guns on campus with a concealed carry permit. Meanwhile, it is against university policy to display anything or engage in any public demonstration that is “obscene.” Therefore, students on the Austin campus decided to protest the new law with a Campus Carry of their own. 
The Campus Carry, responsible for the trending #CocksNotGlocks on Twitter earlier this week, encourages students to carry dildos in their backpacks to make a statement about what should be considered obscene and dangerous. But it is not just students who are joining the protest. A professor has announced that he will quit teaching next year due the new law, which he believes will jeopardize his safety on campus. Even William McRaven — Chancellor of all University of Texas locations and former Navy SEAL admiral who helped organize the Bin Laden raid — stated “I like guns, but I just don’t think having them on campus is the right place,” according to CNN.
This law and subsequent protest bring up a lot of discussions concerning America’s ongoing struggle with the limits of the Second Amendment and how to truly keep students safe on campus (Hint: it's not by allowing them to secretly carry their own guns). But the issue also brings up the idea that Americans are more frightened and uncomfortable with the presence of genitalia than of violence and possible death. 
When the film Fifty Shades of Grey was released in the United States, the public debated whether it would receive an R or NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. After cutting certain scenes, it would go on to receive an R.  In France, meanwhile, Le Centre National du Cinéma intended to release the film without any restriction, but it was concerned that BDSM relationships were portrayed poorly in the film. Ultimately it was given a "12" rating, meaning anyone over the age of twelve was allowed to view the film, even without a parent or adult accompanying them. Violence tends to earn films a more restricted rating in France; for the United States, sex is the greater evil. 
Allowing your young child to watch a movie like Fifty Shades of Grey probably isn't the best parenting choice. But it's also probably not healthy for them to watch the Dark Knight Trilogy, each of which received a PG-13 rating despite its portrayal of intense violence and psychological fear. Why are Americans so willing to accept violence as an everyday situation, while sex and even nudity remain taboo? Surely, it is more detrimental for young people to see advertisements and propaganda displaying weapons and violence than it is for them to see a pair of breasts. 
The United States, which has had 294 mass shootings this year, needs to reevaluate its stance on the norm of violence. Between 1968 and 2011, almost 1.4 million Americans died from firearm deaths. For perspective, the combined number of casualties for every war fought by Americans is 1.2 million. Perhaps if we taught our children that loving is more normal than killing, those numbers would decrease.

Well, that’s a wrap. Bernie Sanders has won the 2016 Democratic primary.
No, he will not win the nomination. He likely did not even win Tuesday’s debate, giving some embarrassing answers on questions about gun control and foreign policy. The Internet polls showed him winning in a landslide, but Internet polls are a classic example of a biased sample, drawing the demographics most likely to use the Internet (college students) and those more likely to have very strong opinions and vote for more extreme candidates like Sanders. This is the reason Internet polls said the same thing about Ron Paul during his 2012 presidential run. The first poll with something like a random sample emerged Thursday showing Hillary Clinton had won the debate by a hefty margin.
What Sanders has done, however, is pull the party so far left that this Democratic primary lacks a candidate who can be reasonably described as moderate, or at least a moderate Democrat, for those still holding out for the Webb surge. Many people’s answer to the moderate gap would be Clinton, who some would have you believe is politically somewhere just to the right of Barry Goldwater. This is nonsense. Hillary Clinton may be a bit more moderate on foreign policy than Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley (who was either aligned with Sanders or to his left on every issue), but domestically she is aligned with or to the left of both of them on every issue except Glass-Steagall and (maybe) college tuition.
The problem begins with the discourse surrounding Clinton. Her voting record in the Senate and her achievements as the First Lady of the United States and the Secretary of State point to a very liberal candidate (FiveThirtyEight’s methodology places her slightly to Sanders’ right, on par with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren). But before the election, the public called for a more progressive option. In 2008, when President Obama answered a similar call, it became clear that he was firmly to Clinton’s right on nearly every issue the two disagreed on, making him very popular with the Democratic base. In this election, however, an Obama-type candidate — one who remains progressive on social issues while bringing common sense and evidence, rather than ideology, to issues that are less one-sided — is nowhere to be found.
This is a giant problem on two levels. The first is that it’s bad for democracy when the country’s largest voting bloc does not have a candidate. The second is an issue of policy. A very liberal candidate will have a two-year period with a similarly liberal Congress, but the president’s party basically always loses midterm elections. A Clinton or a Sanders might have too liberal a mandate to work with Republicans in any meaningful capacity. This could lead to continued and intensified gridlock in Washington.
There’s one hope for moderate Democrats, and that is a Joe Biden candidacy. However, the base of one of America’s two major political parties should not have to wait and hope that a candidate shows up that is to their liking. Even this circus of a Republican primary has candidates across the Republican ideological spectrum who are sticking to their guns despite the outspokenness of the one leading the polls. 
Moderate Democrats having to watch the presumptive moderate option be forced to say things like “I love Denmark” in order to be viable is a painful vision of what the Democratic Party has become. While it's certainly Sanders's prerogative to drag the race to his preferences, it is disconcerting that the center of the party is so sparse there is no one to counterbalance him.

Here is my political philosophy in a nutshell: I am passionately against anything that delays the future in which humanity is out there, exploring the stars. This basic policy has allowed me to separate right from wrong in many instances, giving me a sense of where to stand on even the most controversial of issues.
Perhaps I am no realist, but I am not delusional either. I understand that space exploration does not, and should not, attract the same social attention as healthcare. I understand that building rockets that can reach the moon has no practical value, unless you are trying to propagandize and scare off Soviets. Capitalism and curiosity do not speak the same language. Therefore, space exploration can be nothing more than a luxury in today’s world. I merely yearn for the day that it is a luxury that we can afford.
Given all that, you could easily assume that I would be excited about a private space transport company such as SpaceX — led by Elon Musk, the billionaire/genius/science-fiction geek/real life Tony Stark — receiving billions of dollars in federal grants. You would be easily mistaken.
SpaceX is a company that develops rocket science, based on the same idea NASA developed decades ago: burn fossils, discard empty tanks, get into orbit. But SpaceX is much more efficient, so efficient that NASA itself is likely to send cargo to the International Space Station using Musk’s rockets and other companies likely prefer to shoot satellites into the sky featuring the enchanting “X” insignia. All of this until now is perfectly acceptable; the problem begins when you visit the firm’s website.
There it stands: Mars, in all its might. The caption reads “Road to the Red Planet.” Clearly, SpaceX not only delivers a very cool service, but ultimately aims to make human civilization multi-planetary. This is the part where you go “whoa.”
To Elon Musk, the future of the human species is quite binary. Either we stay confined to Earth and wait for an eventual extinction event, or we settle on other planets, terraform them so that they can sustain human life, and voilà — we just bought ourselves a few more million years. Devoting your life to this goal sounds very philanthropic, even noble, except that it's not. 
It is profit-oriented and manipulative. SpaceX recently received $6.7 billion in funding from NASA, and all of it will be going to a "space-taxi" infrastructure. "The next step in human space flight," they call it. But what is the difference between developing rockets that could take millions of people to Mars and developing a “taxi” that can take a handful around the Earth? Well, one of them is doable in the near future, for a start. The same one can also earn you a fortune. But the other one has vision; it's philanthropic. So what do you do? You put a sublime image of Mars on your website to receive public approval, while diverting your entire capital to space-taxis.
A friend of mine gave a TED talk recently, idealistically asserting that we need to spark, or re-spark, public interest in space exploration. But why, might I ask? So that these private firms can devour more and more tax-payer money that should rather be going toward healthcare or renewable energy subsidies? So that corporations can profit from offering super-rich space enthusiasts round trips to the ISS, pointlessly releasing carbon into the atmosphere? It is easy to delude ourselves with vague notions such as “inherent human curiosity” and “the need to become explorers once again” while skipping these fundamental questions.
Unfortunately, the hypocrisy of SpaceX does not stop there. The truth is, even if it could take people to Mars in a viable manner, it wouldn't do humanity much good. Elon Musk likes to claim that the real challenge in creating a self-sustaining colony on Mars is getting there — the rest is easy. But how can we live in a planet that lacks atmosphere, decent temperatures, minerals, gravity, stability, or, in short, anything and everything needed to sustain human life? How can we even think it possible to terraform a dead, red mass, when we cannot even geo-engineer our way out of the comparatively small climate hazards (global climate change, pollution, etc.) we have created back home?
There is no miraculous techno-fix to wait for. The irrational mentality that it is possible to make Mars more Earth-like is the same that allows humans to frack the soil incessantly to obtain fossil fuels, believing that we can deal with whatever consequences we create. This mentality supposes that we are all-powerful, that we can dominate nature. But it is wrong, distorted, and corrupted. We are not gods, nor will we ever be.
Despite my relentless passion about space travel, I cannot possibly support what companies like SpaceX are doing right now. I’d like to think that when we embrace the environment fully, protecting it from any further harm, we will have plenty of time and resources to explore the stars. Until then, we should focus our energy and resources on fighting the corporate structure that exploits the environment, rather than subsidizing it. And that, Mr. Elon Musk, is a philanthropic goal worth devoting your life to.

You wouldn't normally think, especially at Carnegie Mellon, that it’s possible to “exceed” a workload. However, even here, there are students who apparently work more than their share — the overachievers. The term “overachiever” is typically said in jest or mockery, with an underlying tone of mixed admiration and envy.  
An example of the overachiever is the student with a double major and triple minor, participation in two sports teams and casual mastery of an instrument, or leadership in a sorority while organizing a dance team and studying for a BXA degree. The term, according to common understanding of it, essentially covers the majority of the Carnegie Mellon population. However, most students don’t consider themselves overachievers.
In fact, there is a distinct sense of jealousy associated with the word. When we witness another student’s overwhelming success and teasingly call them an overachiever, we tend to feel a slight accompanying sense of guilt or inferiority. This may be because these “overachievers” remind us of our own shortcomings and lack of perfection that they seem to possess.
However, lesser known are the downsides to being an overachiever and the difference between being an overachiever and a "high performer.” Overachievers are reputed to be very productive, but they are excessively single-minded. They tend to be too eager to please, and to have anxiety and an acute fear of failure. They try to achieve perfection, and when that proves impossible, self-esteem problems can lead to stress or distaste for their work. On the other hand, high performers aim for excellence in a strategic way, so as to achieve it without working more than necessary.
At Carnegie Mellon, "overachiever" is normally used as a joke, or even a veiled compliment, to describe someone who works excessively hard. However, good grades or participation in numerous activities don’t necessarily qualify someone to be an overachiever. If a student achieves their desired goals while maintaining a healthy lifestyle, then the term becomes untruthful. That student is not an overachiever, but the most admirable kind of achiever: someone who successfully handles their classes, extracurricular interests, and health at the same time.
At this notoriously challenging university, the danger lies more often in becoming an overachiever than an underachiever. Only a few students manage to acquire that delicate balance of success and sanity that is the true challenge of Carnegie Mellon.

Although it pains me to say it, I will not be voting this November. I woke up on Oct. 6 to a sinking feeling, immediately realizing I had missed the voter registration deadline. In order to vote in Pennsylvania on Nov. 3, you have to send in your registration form by Oct. 5. While this may seem like a trivial hassle, this limitation has real effects on voter turnout and the integrity of our democracy. 
Eleven states and the District of Columbia allow same-day registration (SDR), and these test cases show that these policies are feasible and beneficial. There is simply no reason for the Pennsylvania State Senate not to pass a SDR bill. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t hear a peep about the November elections on Oct. 5. Next week, however, the media hype will kick. 
In the final push for support, candidates splurge on ads, raising public awareness and excitement about Election Day. Some of that election fever might even slip into the campus bubble in the form of junk mail and newspaper editorials. The average voter isn’t thinking about politics for most of the year, but it's easy for them to ride that election hype to the polls, register, and vote. SDR allows this cycle to occur, and keeps voting from being the activity of elites and political junkies. 
The benefits of SDR aren’t just theoretical. In 2012, SDR state Wisconsin experienced 70 percent voter turnout while the national average was down to 57 percent, according to FOX News. These benefits are reproducible in many states, with a study published in Social Science Quarterly finding that SDR raises voter turnout by an average of 7 percent. That doesn’t sound like much, but the American public should be grasping at anything that increases turnout. This year, Pennsylvania can expect only a third of eligible voters to turn up to the polls, and that’s a sad thing in a system that’s supposed to be majority rule. 
The voter turnout crisis is more than disheartening — it’s discriminatory. As noted by the [New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/11/07/should-voting-in-the-us-be-mandatory-14/same-day-voter-registration-would-improve-turnout), the people who make up the voting minority are usually older, richer, whiter, and more educated than the general population. This means that the government is tailored to their needs and interests. 
Young, college-age people in particular tend to have low voter turnout. If our generation wants to be heard politically, we need to start voting en masse. The wave of political hype that propels people to register and vote at the polls surges through social media, but it can only do its job and get the young vote out if the registration date hasn’t passed.
One of the strongest arguments against SDR is the cost. Any change in policy involves transition costs. New people have to be hired, different fliers have to be printed and posted, and volunteers have to be trained. However, the states that have implemented SDR have shown it’s very affordable. The cost for implementing the new policy in Iowa in 2007 was $50,000. I know $50,000 seems astronomical, particularly when it could pay my tuition for a year, but in state budget terms it’s “a pretty minor cost,” according to Iowa Deputy Secretary of State Linda Langenburg.
Ongoing costs from the switch were minor, and studies have found the costs were balanced out by the reduction of provisional ballots. With tax revenue in 2014 at $34 billion, over four times Iowa's tax revenue when it implemented SDR, it seems Pennsylvania should be able to shoulder the down payment for increased democracy.
At the end of the day, I’m still not voting this year. The best I can do is submit my application on Nov. 4 and get into the system for the presidential primaries. Still, I hope Pennsylvania can join the ranks of forward-thinking states that are doing right by their citizens and implementing SDR.

Scottish economist and Princeton University professor Angus Deaton received the 2015 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences last Monday. He won the prestigious $975,000 award for his ongoing work on global poverty and inequality trends, which the award committee stated has "immense importance for human welfare, not least in poor countries."
Deaton's work is focused on the distribution of consumer spending, the spending and saving of society's income, and the best system for measuring and analyzing poverty. His 2013 book, The Great Escape, questioned the effectiveness of international aid to developing countries and was subsequently criticized by Bill Gates, one the world's biggest poverty-fighting philanthropists. According to the award committee's press release, "By linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes, his research has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics."
Deaton is the first economics Nobel laureate to address poverty since 1998, when Amartya Sen won for his work on the welfare committee. Meanwhile, the last three winners were honored for their work on market power, asset prices, and stable allocations — all more traditional "Wall Street" topics. 
The Tartan applauds the award committee for highlighting important work on poverty, even if such attention is long overdue on an issue that affects billions worldwide. 836 million still live in extreme poverty and inequality is worse than ever. 
The United Nations (UN) recently unveiled its new Sustainability Development Goals for 2030, and first on the list is eliminating poverty "in all its forms, everywhere." A lofty goal, many would think, but — due in part to the UN's Millennial Goals — global poverty rates have been cut in half since 1990. We can neither accept poverty as inevitable, nor become complacent when so much progress has already been made. 
By honoring Deaton, the Nobel Prize committee proved that fighting poverty is a worthwhile career paths for economists. It took a major step toward shifting the public's attention away from Wall Street and toward more broadly impactful goals.

Carnegie Mellon awarded an honorary degree in 2007 to America's former favorite sitcom dad, Bill Cosby. Cosby gave Carnegie Mellon its unofficial mascot on campus, the scotty dog, a legacy that lives on. 
In 2014, comedian Hannibal Burress called Bill Cosby a rapist in a stand-up routine that soon went viral. Hannibal wasn't the first to accuse Cosby of sex crimes — women have been accusing him for decades — but he was the first accuser people took seriously. Soon after, scores of women came forward to publicly accuse Cosby of sexual assault going back to the eighties. Currently more than 50 women have accused Cosby of date rape and other forms of sexual assault and harassment, and he is engaged in five related lawsuits.
Before his crimes were made public, Cosby had received over 20 honorary degrees from schools including Boston University, Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Fordham University. Although Cosby has not been convicted of a crime yet, several of these schools have rescinded his honorary degree. Last week alone, Tufts University and Baltimore's Goucher College rescinded Cosby's degrees. 
Carnegie Mellon, however, has let Cosby's degree stand. The allegations against Cosby are serious and undeniable, and seven colleges of the 26 that have given Cosby honorary degrees have already rescinded them. Carnegie Mellon should join their ranks, and rescind Cosby's honorary doctorate of Humane Letters. 
Despite the lack of a formal conviction against Cosby, it's unacceptable for the university to continue to tacitly endorse a public figure who has fallen so far from his pedestal. The university should retract the degree of a man who's not fit to be a peer to Carnegie Mellon's other honorary degree recipients.

The Affordable College Textbook Act was introduced to Congress on Oct. 8. The act seeks to lower the cost of educational textbooks and reading materials used by college students across the nation by "expanding the use of open textbooks (and other open educational resources) that everyone can use, adapt and share freely," according to the website for Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). 
Given that an individual student's annual budget for textbooks has risen to a nationwide average of over $1,000, it is high time that the government acknowledged the outrageous amount of money necessary to receive a college education. 
Why stop at open access for textbooks? The price of textbooks is just a small part of the larger cost of college education. The passage of this act would signify a step in the right direction, but it could also be used to start a larger conversation, both about overall college costs and other legislation related to open resources for education that is currently being discussed. For example, the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR) would mandate that the results of research funded by taxpayer dollars be released earlier in order to improve accessibility.
This legislation shows American society's commitment to education, as it provides opportunities to better students' lives through learning and to advance society through important research that should be easily accessible. 
These acts seem self-justifying, and yet they are still up for discussion amongst our political leaders. The Tartan hopes that not only will this legislation pass, but that it will spark a larger conversation about the cost and value of education and the ways we make knowledge accessible.

Carnegie Mellon’s Open Access Week, part of a worldwide event, focuses on all things openness. It started last Thursday and will run to Thursday of next week. Open access is the principle that all forms of scholarly work, from data and methods to final published output, should be free to read and free to reuse.   
Open access has a significant impact on how our tuition money gets spent. Hunt Library spent nearly $3.9 million in 2015 on subscriptions to journals across all fields at Carnegie Mellon, but not all fields are equally expensive. On average, the natural sciences cost the most: chemistry journals are worth about $4,370 each, biology is $3,290, and physics is $3,841. 
But these prices are increasing at a rate of two or three times the rate of inflation. The library’s budget cannot keep up with this increase, and they have been forced to make tough decisions about how many resources to commit to non-STEM fields, including books that are the main form of scholarly communication in the humanities.
Additionally, upon graduation, students lose access to the cutting edge research required for competitive innovation. Most startup businesses can’t afford subscriptions to research journals. This is why squatters from Pittsburgh’s innovation community are competing with students for space and access to Hunt Library resources. This can impair students’ ability to do work for class and research.
Carnegie Mellon is a strong supporter of open access through efforts such as the Research Showcase. It is also important for research funders to support open access because research funded by taxpayers should be made freely available to taxpayers. Recognizing the benefits of open access for graduate students, the Graduate Student Assembly signed the "Student Statement on the Right to Research." But open access also benefits undergraduates, so the Undergraduate Student Senate should sign on as well.
There are things you can do. Learn about Open Access. Attend an event this week. Deposit your work, including senior honors theses and capstone projects, in the Research Showcase. Most importantly, help build a culture of openness at Carnegie Mellon.

Drink the optimal amount of water. Winter dries out your body. Stay hydrated to keep your body working effectively. 
Keep stress to a minimum. High stress levels make a person more susceptible to catching colds. Aim to spend at least one night per week with friends and family. 
Eat a healthy diet. Try eating an extra piece of fruit or more vegetables each day to keep your body healthy. 
Exercise regularly. Get outside, take a short walk, and enjoy the cooler weather. 
Sleep enough each night. The average person needs 6-8 hours of sleep per night. Any less sleep makes your body vulnerable to illness. 
Wash your hands often. Keep bacteria and viruses off your hands and out of your mouth and eyes. 
Lessen sugar intake. High levels of sugar from cakes, cookies, or store-bought fruit juices can compromise your immune system. 
Dress appropriately. Layer your clothing so you can remove items as you warm up. Cover your head, hands and feet to keep your appendages warm.
Wash your sheets. Toss your blankets and pillowcase into a hot wash once every couple weeks to wash away any bacteria that accumulate. 
Protect your skin. Sunscreen is important during winter. Colder seasons mean a thinner ozone layer to absorb the sun's UV radiation. 
Add garlic to your diet. Raw garlic has natural nutrients that boost the immune system and fight off the common cold. 
Be smoke-free. Smoking weakens the immune system by depressing antibodies and cells that are in the body to protect against viruses.
