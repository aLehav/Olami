When Jason Li was five years old, his parents took up golf, but also decided to take him and his brother along with them in lieu of hiring a babysitter. Li picked up one of the kids clubs and has never looked back.
A first-year Business Administration major at Carnegie Mellon University and member of the men’s golf team, Li was recently named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Rookie of the Year, as well as a first-team selection, voted by the association coaches. In his first season as a Tartan, Li averaged a team-best round of 73.9 through 15 rounds and finished a season-low round of 70 four different times.
Li grew up in Cranberry, PA, about 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh. For him, golf started as a family activity. As he continued to play and continued to improve, golf became something more.
“Growing up, it was always just playing with my family,” Li said in an interview with The Tartan. “As I continued to play, people started suggesting to my parents that I should try to compete in junior tournaments in the area. Once I got started in competing, I really started to enjoy being out there and playing and competing, just always trying to get better.”
Li played throughout his childhood and high school. When it came to playing in college, it wasn’t much of a decision of whether or not to continue.
“I just got so invested [in golf] it was hard to see myself not playing in college,” he said. “It’s such a big part of who I was in high school and who I was as a person. I just love being out on the golf course. Even if it’s not competitive, even if I’m just playing with my family, it’s a lot of fun to be out there.”
Li’s decision was focused on where he would play in college, rather than if he would play golf in college. He wanted the opportunity to play golf, but more importantly, was looking at the best schools for him.
“My older brother actually just graduated from [Carnegie Mellon], so combine that with being so close to home — [being] very familiar with the campus. Just the high level academics really drew me here, because academics always came first in my family, so that was the first consideration. I decided to come here for the academics, and as a bonus was able to play golf.”
Being close to home helped Li with the transition from high school to college. If he ever felt homesick, or wasn’t feeling well, or simply just wanted to go home, he could. If he had an emergency of any kind, he had the comfort of knowing his family was a relatively short drive away.
The transition to being a collegiate student athlete was challenging at first, but something Li learned to balance throughout his first year.
“You kind of have to pick and choose your battles,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to understand that stuff won’t get done or you won’t perform as well as you want to. It’s finding that balance. A lot of times that means on our way to a tournament or in between rounds when we have a break, just doing work.”
Something Li has found unique and fun about playing golf in college is the team aspect of it. Typically, golf is an extremely individual sport where each player is his own team. For tournaments, college teams will enter a group of their five best players to play through each of the rounds, and the four best scores are counted. Teams can also enter single players in an individual competition.
“You’re on the same team with a couple of the guys. Even though you’re out there, doing your own thing during the round, it’s always nice to know during the round or after the round, if you see one of your teammates, they’re always going to support you, they’re always going to try to pick you up. When you’re not having a good day, you know the other guys on the team are doing their best to pick up your slack.”
Spending so much time together on and off the course allows the team to bond and form close friendships, through golf and other activities. Li appreciates that he gets to spend his time with people who are just as passionate about golf as he is, and just as driven to continue to get better every day.
“That’s what’s driven me, up until now — just always trying to get better, always trying to beat myself, beat everybody else, just trying to work my butt off,” Li said.
This year marks 14 years since Li first picked up a golf club, and he is looking forward to his second season as a Tartan, starting in the fall. He hopes for the team to grow and keep improving on the golf course.

It’s the best time of year once again, ladies and gentlemen. April is almost finished, and it’s about to be May. The weather is starting to warm up, school is almost out, and the NHL playoffs are in full swing. And what better tradition to kick off your summer vacation than watching the Pittsburgh Penguins eliminate the Washington Capitals in the second round of the playoffs for the third year in a row?
I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but it’s just so perfect. The Capitals have been defeated by the Penguins in the second round for the past two years on the Penguins’ way to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles, and with how little the two teams have changed from last year to now, there’s not much of a doubt in my mind that the Pens are going to wipe the floor with the Caps.
History clearly favors the Penguins. This will be the 11th time the two clubs have met in the playoffs, and the Pens have lost to Washington in the playoffs only once, back in 1994. The Pens have made a tradition of beating the Capitals, beating them down in a playoff series en route to each of Pittsburgh’s five Stanley Cup victories.
And, with the way this Pens team looks, there’s little doubt that they have the talent and ability to grab a sixth cup. Captain Sidney Crosby was dominant in the first round of the playoffs, a six-game series over the Philadelphia Flyers, scoring an incredible six goals and totaling 15 points. He played mean and aggressive against Philly. Nobody could stop him in that series.
And even if they could stifle Crosby’s efforts, the Flyers just couldn’t contain the explosiveness of winger Jake Guentzel. Like Crosby, he scored six goals and had 13 points against Philadelphia, and he really came alive in an incredible four-goal effort to shut down the Flyers’ playoff hopes in Game 6 of the series.
In terms of goaltending, Matt Murray has been no slouch. He has already recorded two shutouts against the Flyers and has had moments where he’s looked incredibly dominant. However, he’s still going to be one of the Pens’ biggest question marks (along with their entire defense), thanks to a few shoddy performances in the Philadelphia series and a really weird, up-and-down regular season this year. Hopefully he’ll return to be the playoff Murray we know and love.
The Capitals have been no slouch of a team, either. They finished first in the Metropolitan division this season above the Pens and have the most complete team that they have in years. After a rough start to their first round against the Columbus Blue Jackets in which they lost the first two games at home, the Caps bounced back and defeated the Blue Jackets in the next four straight games, winning the series in six.
Washington captain Alexander Ovechkin scored five goals in the Caps’ efforts against Columbus, and they also saw the return to form of goaltender Braden Holtby, who had a rough enough end to his season to see him benched in favor of back-up Phillip Grubauer for a few games.
Don’t let my wild optimism fool you. This Washington team has the ability to take care of the Penguins. If Pittsburgh shows any of the signs of sloppiness or unpreparedness as they did during the regular season, they are going to get burned. However, when they are the Playoff Penguins, when they are on, they are dominant, and nobody can come close to the talent that they have.
If Thursday night was any indication, we’re in for a great series. 17 seconds into the first period, Ovechkin connected with Evgeny Kuznetzov on a two-on-one to put the Caps up to an early lead, and Holtby helped shut the door on the Penguins through the next forty minutes with some incredible saves. After Ovechkin ripped another shot into the back of the net 28 seconds into the third period, things looked bleak for the Pens, but they battled back.
Later in the third, defenseman Justin Schultz ripped a harmless wrist shot from the right faceoff circle and Patric Hornqvist put a stick on it in front of the net to sneak it in past Holtby to get the Penguins on the scoreboard and back in the game. Then the Penguins went to work to make the comeback.
Minutes later, 2:21 to be exact, Guentzel threw a cross ice pass through traffic that glanced right off the stick of Ovechkin and to the waiting Crosby, who rifled it through the wickets of Holtby to tie the game up at two.
Quickly after, it was Guentzel who put one home on a beautiful redirection from an innocent Crosby shot from the far side of the boards. Guentzel barely touched it, but the puck had eyes and snuck right under Holtby’s blocker arm, putting the Pens up 3-2.
After that, Pittsburgh went into shutdown mode. Murray made an impossible save on a Brett Connelly shot to keep the lead, reaching out with his blocker to deny Connelly a sure goal, and the Pens never looked back. The two teams battled for more goals, but time wound down and the Penguins took Game 1.
My prediction: I’d say Penguins in six. I’m hoping for four or five, but Washington is too good a team for things to not get interesting.

Imagine the perfect burger.
It’s a full sensory experience: taste, smell, sound, sight, and feel. It’s fragrant and savory. It sizzles on the grill. It has a browned exterior and a pink, juicy middle. You know to make sure there’s a napkin nearby before you take your first bite.
Now imagine all that, but the patty is 100 percent plant-based. Sound impossible?
But, that is exactly what the aptly-named company Impossible Foods has done. Started by Dr. Patrick Brown in 2011, their mission is to reduce the environmental impacts of the meat industry by creating foods that could fool even the most hardcore carnivores. They claim their burgers use 95 percent less land, use 74 percent less water, and emit 87 percent less greenhouse gases than the real thing.
Their food scientists have been working hard to mimic the qualities of ground beef. And, they have a lot of support — the company has received nearly $400 million in investments.
Beef is widely recognized as one of the worst foods for the planet. For each kilogram on your plate, about 27 kilograms of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Beef consumption has been decreasing in the U.S.; according to a study by the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the average per capita consumption went down by 19 percent between 2005 and 2014, which they estimate is the equivalent to removing the annual tailpipe pollution of 39 million cars.
This study is a good indication that Americans want to reduce their beef consumption, but there is a long way to go. Beef still is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other food in our diets; 34 percent of our per capita food-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2014, per the same study. There are also concerns that eating a lot of beef can lead to negative health effects such as increased cancer risk and heart disease.
So, how do we get the burger without the beef?
Like any good veggie burger, the “Impossible Burger,” which was first sold in 2016, has a base of plant protein. Wheat protein (also known as gluten) provides the “chew”, while potato protein is responsible for water retention, creating that juicy consistency, as well as the crispy seared exterior. Binders, including xanthan and kojac, hold the patty together. Coconut oil makes the burger sizzle when it’s on the grill; like beef fat, it’s solid at room temperature, but melts when it hits the heat. Flavors, vitamins, and one special compound round out the ingredient list.
The team at Impossible Foods worked hard to figure out what it is that makes meat taste so meaty. They identified the compound heme, which they claim is what sets the Impossible burger apart from all other imitation meats.
Myoglobin is an abundant protein in muscle cells that carries oxygen and contains heme, an iron atom bound in the center of a ring. 
As the meat cooks, the myoglobin breaks down and releases heme. Some of the iron escapes and catalyzes reactions responsible for the characteristic flavor and aroma of beef. It is also what causes the color to change as beef cooks: it is red to start, but then turns brown as it oxidizes.
Nodules on the roots of legumes, such as soy, contain leghemoglobin, a heme-containing compound similar to myoglobin. Instead of digging up lots of soy plants to get the heme, the team at Impossible Foods took the genes responsible for leghemoglobin production and engineered yeast that can make the protein in a fermentation process. 
When added to the mix, it gives the plant-based burger a meaty flavor and the same color-changing abilities as a beef burger.
You can’t buy the Impossible Burger in grocery stores just yet (though Whole Foods carries the Beyond Burger, which is similar), but you can see (and taste) for yourself just how convincing it is at 18 different restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.

The planet Uranus not only looks like an egg, but also smells like one.
Planetary scientist Leigh Fletcher and his team from the University of Leicester in England analyzed Uranian chemicals and determined that Uranus’s atmosphere has a rotten egg smell.
“Uranus’ upper clouds are made of hydrogen sulfide — the same molecule that gives rotten eggs their noxious odor,” explains science writer Lisa Grossman.
Scientists have long suspected that there was  some hydrogen sulfide in Uranus’s atmosphere.
But, confirming this hypothesis has been a challenge, since Uranus is 1.85 billion miles away from the sun. Voyager 2, the only spacecraft to visit this blue-green ice giant, attempted to find out what Uranus was made of in 1986, but the composition of the clouds was not certain.
So, how did these scientists confirm what Uranus smells like? 
It was all thanks to a spectrograph, a sensitive instrument that can see light that is invisible to the human eye. The spectrograph helped scientists determine what gases were present in Uranus’s atmosphere.
Since both Jupiter and Saturn — other giants in our solar system — have ammonia cloud tops, the recent find of hydrogen sulfide on Uranus’ clouds is quite an interesting find. 
However, it “wasn’t a complete surprise,” Grossman adds. “Observations from the 1990s showed hints of hydrogen sulfide lurking deeper in Uranus’ atmosphere. It just had not been ‘conclusively detected’ earlier.” 
This recently found quality helps us better understand the details of our early solar system. The more we know about the exact makeup of these planets, the closer we get to figuring out how the solar system was formed. 
It is very likely that hydrogen sulfide ice crystals were abundant deeper in the early solar system since hydrogen sulfide freezes at much colder temperatures in comparison with ammonia. This find suggests that “ice giants Uranus and Neptune were born farther from the sun than Jupiter and Saturn,” explains Grossman. These giants migrated closer to the sun after their formation. They were even farther away than they are now!
These giants “had access to different reservoirs of material back in the forming days of the solar system,” Fletcher says. He hopes to send a spacecraft to the ice giants to find out more about how these giants were formed. The team is working on pinpointing the birthplaces of Uranus and Neptune.

“We live in a world in which visible matter isn’t the main kind of stuff.”
This is how renowned astronomer Robert Kirshner introduced dark energy and dark matter, two of the main topics of his 2018 Buhl Lecture.
The Buhl Lecture is an annual lecture sponsored by Carnegie Mellon’s physics department and is typically given by a leader in the field of physics research. Kirshner, a professor at Harvard for over 30 years, used observations of supernovae to track cosmic expansion. His research was foundational to the discovery that the universe’s expansion is accelerating. An accelerating universe, in turn, indicates the existence of dark energy.
Kirshner’s lecture, entitled “Exploding Stars, Dark Energy, and the Accelerating Cosmos,” gave an overview of the history of cosmology, explaining landmark discoveries one-by-one and tying them together to give non-technical listeners a well-rounded picture of the field of cosmology — culminating in current research that attempts to understand dark matter and dark energy.
Kirshner’s story, beginning in the 1400s and continuing through the present, illuminated the connections between advances in technology and advances in human understanding of the cosmos — and the fact that often, the two do not advance at the same rate. The well-known research 
Kirshner covered included Henrietta Swan Leavitt’s work on variable stars, as well as Hubble’s famous proof that the universe is expanding based on observations that when you look at objects in the cosmos, everything in the universe appears to be moving away from you.
“Now, doesn’t this mean that you’re at the center of the universe? I have to say, at Harvard, many of the faculty believe that’s true,” Kirshner quipped (in truth, the universe has no center).
With each historical example, Kirshner noted that our capacity to observe cosmological phenomena is usually far ahead of our capacity to determine what’s causing the phenomena we see. 
This theme set a precedent for the talk’s culmination in the introduction of dark matter and dark energy. 
Kirshner stressed repeatedly that dark energy really exists — because its effects are observable and documented — even if we don’t know exactly what it is.
The lecture was peppered with humor and rich analogies. At one point, Kirshner put up a slide showing a Japanese woodcut of a landscape featuring snow-covered mountains. “What do you see?” he asked.
“Mountains? Not really. What you’re looking at is the snow on the mountains. If you were to travel here, what you’d actually see is the light reflected off the snow, which is in the shape of the mountains.”
It’s the same with dark matter: “We know it’s there because we can see its effects.”
As Kirshner explained, astronomer Vera Rubin observed in the mid-twentieth century that there was a discrepancy between how fast galaxies were expected to rotate and how fast they were actually observed to be rotating: galaxies were rotating much faster than they should be able to. The gravity of the stars within them was not strong enough to hold them together at those speeds, and it seemed as though they should be flying apart — unless there was more matter there, that had somehow not been detected. This theorized extra, undetectable stuff holding galaxies together is dark matter.
Dark energy, though a completely separate phenomenon from dark matter, was discovered in a similar situation, where the values predicted by known physics differed from what was actually being observed.
If the only substance universe was matter, as known physics tells us, the universe’s expansion would not be speeding up. All the galaxies in the universe would gravitate toward each other.
But observations tell us that on average, most things in the universe are moving away from each other, and their speed is increasing. Something is counteracting gravity and accelerating the universe’s expansion — a kind of negative pressure, or anti-gravity force.
Despite not really being a kind of energy, this unknown pressure has been labeled “dark energy” to reflect the mystery of “dark matter.”
After the talk, members of Carnegie Mellon’s Society of Physics Students presented Kirshner with a physics department t-shirt. Though most were already familiar with the subject matter at a depth beyond what the lecture covered, they appreciated Kirshner’s expertise and lecturing style. 
“The analogies he used were really well chosen. They helped me understand it at less of an academic level and more of an intuitive level,” said Dylan Steele, a senior studying physics.
Physics professor Scott Dodelson, who heads the department, agreed. “The lecture was great. He was funny, and very clear... He was one of the leaders [in cosmological research], and he probably should have gotten the Nobel Prize... When a leader in the field can explain things that clearly, it’s very impressive.”
Kirshner finished the scientific portions of his talk with musings on the proportions of unknown materials in the universe. At 73 percent dark energy, and 23 percent dark matter, “96 percent of the universe is in some not-understood form,” he said. “Regular atoms make up only four percent of the universe.
“I don’t know how that makes you feel. It makes me feel pretty special.”

NASA cancels only moon rover
Scientists working on NASA's only lunar rover in development, the Resource Prospector, have been told to end the project in May. The move has come as a shock to the research community.
The Resource Prospector was intended to excavate materials from the lunar surface, such as water and oxygen. This work was viewed as a possible foundation for building permanent human colonies on the moon and Mars.
“This action is viewed with both incredulity and dismay by our community,”  wrote the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (a scientific analysis organization) in a statement.
NASA has not released any official statement on the decision. However, NASA's new administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted on Friday, "We’re committed to lunar exploration @NASA. Resource Prospector instruments will go forward in an expanded lunar surface campaign. More landers. More science. More exploration. More prospectors. More commercial partners. Ad astra!"

Brain shape, not size, may have helped early humans
About 40,000 years ago, modern humans emigrated from Africa into Europe, replacing the Neanderthals that had lived there for 200,000 years. A new reconstructive study suggests that humans replaced Neanderthals so rapidly not because their brains were bigger, but because they were differently shaped.
An interdisciplinary team including anthropologists, engineers, and neuroscientists created digital reconstructions of Neanderthal brains using a method previously tested on ape brains. 
First, they carefully measured the dimensions of Neanderthal skulls. Then, they manipulated a digital model of a human brain to fit the shape of the Neanderthal skulls.
The team found that Neanderthal brains likely had the same overall volume as human brains, but the shapes were markedly different. The variation in overall shape allowed human brains to have a larger cerebellum (which deals with speech, memory, and cognitive flexibility) and Neanderthal brains to have a larger occipital lobe (visual processing center) than humans.
This method of digitally reconstructing brains is very new and could likely be improved in the future. "We would like to further elaborate our methodology by exchanging thoughts and ideas with researchers in the related fields working on human brain evolution," said Naomichi Ogihara, a mechanical engineer at Keio University in Yokohama, Japan, and a study contributor.
The research was published Thursday in Scientific Reports.

Geothermal power plant caused 2017 earthquake
A 5.5 magnitude earthquake that struck South Korea in 2017 was likely caused by the Pohang geothermal power plant, according to two new analyses published this week in Science.
The Pohang plant used enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) technology. With this system, cold water is injected into the ground under extremely high pressure, making tiny cracks underground. The cracks allow the water to circulate underground and be heated by hot rocks. The heat from the water is converted into power by the power plant.
The researchers behind the recent analyses both came to the conclusion that the 2017 earthquake was induced by the Pohang plant's water injections.
The first analysis was conducted by geologist Kwang-Hee Kim's team at Pusan National University in South Korea and relied on local seismic data. The second was led by Francesco Grigoli of ETH Zurich in Switzerland and used regional and international data. The government of South Korea is currently undertaking its own separate investigation of the earthquake's cause.
The 5.5 magnitude earthquake is the largest to be triggered by EGS.

Grammy-winning artist, Kimbra, is a free spirit. Her newest album, Primal Heart is raw, honest, and it tells the story of her journey to musical success. In her interview with Pillbox staffwriter Natalie Schmidt (N), Kimbra (K) opens up about the inspirations for her music and new album, as well as her plans for the future. 
N: Your music has really evolved into this experimental electric pop style since Vows. What was something new that you were experimenting with in this album?
K: I think I’ve always had an experimental approach to music, even when making Vows. I just naturally have more to draw from these days and a deeper understanding of production, and as my tastes in music keep widening, so does my desire to expand my own music. On this album, I experimented with my lyrical approach being a little more deliberate and grounded, less escapism and more direct in nature. 
N: What were some inspirations for the visuals of the album?
K: Emergence. Instinct. Sensuality. The animal self. The spirit. Connectivity. Intimacy with my audience. 
N: A lot in this album deals with discovering yourself and turning towards a more honest view of yourself/the world, which we saw particularly in our favorite song on the album “Recovery.” How did you consolidate these experiences into the writing process of this album?
K: They surfaced quite naturally. I had made some very deliberate choices in my personal, professional life and I think as a result my music became more deliberate and lyrically grounded. I tried to envision myself less as an entertainer in a highly curated universe, and more like a person sitting down to coffee with a friend and explaining the journey of my late twenties, as I began to discover myself in ways beyond my career, which has been such a driving force for me, since I was quite young. I wanted to retain mystery as always, but let the listener see the texture of my voice and emotions in a more exposed way.  
N: How do you manage being honest and vulnerable in the age of social media? Do you feel pressured or obligated to share your life through your music?
K: Yes, it’s a constant expectation to be spontaneously candid, charismatic, funny, real, or raw. And, although these are qualities we all admire, we are not all of these things all of the time. I can be very introspective and contemplative when I am not on stage and it doesn’t come naturally for me to reveal my daily rituals because the sacredness often exists in them being a private endeavor. I find stillness in the mundane parts of life sometimes, but there is pressure for your life to always appear interesting! Like everyone, I am trying to navigate this. Trying to share myself with others while accepting that I need a space that is reserved for myself and my closest loved ones also. 
N: In your song “Recovery,” you say, “no I don't need your remedy I just need to find all kinds of health active recovery.” What does “active recovery” mean for you in terms of working on yourself?
K: The striving toward self-awareness and acceptance of oneself. Acceptance seems passive, but it’s very active to me. It’s a constant journey of waking up and observing what is outside of you and within you on a given day and working with that. Stepping into that. Turning up to the day, in all of its mess and glory. 
N: Can you compare the Australian/New Zealand music scene with your experience in the American music industry?
K: We tend to take ourselves less seriously, to be honest. New Zealanders especially have a way of constantly down-playing themselves and we are terrible at self-promoting, ha! This creates a nice kind of democratic environment but it also means there is less celebration of the exceptional, which I think is something quite beautiful about American culture. People here love to see others take a hold of their dream and run with it. There are pros and cons of course, but I think this has had a positive effect on my sense of ambition. 
N: How has kiwi culture influenced your music throughout your career?
K: I grew up listening to many wonderful female singer songwriters from New Zealand who informed my love of classic songwriting, I also sung Maori music at school which I loved. I also think I subconsciously took influence from the rhythmic urban roots and hip hop scene that New Zealand really embraces. My favorite punk rock band called The Mint Chicks (members of this band later went on to form Unknown Mortal Orchestra) also sound tracked my high school years and are a great example of super original Kiwi music that inspired me. 
N: You’re going to be in the musical-drama production Daffodils. Can you tell us more about it? What’s the difference between preparing for this musical versus creating your own music?
K: For Daffodils, I am playing a character called Maisie. Although I draw a lot from my own musical experiences and upbringing in New Zealand, I am there as an instrument for the director and that was quite liberating for an artist like myself who is often very involved in my own videos and image etc. I truly had to let go for this and trust the people around me. I loved the experience and I prepared by allowing myself to be flexible each day and ready to work with the team to serve the vision of a larger story. Acting and performing music are not largely dissimilar, they both require you to draw deeply from your own experience but acting requires the finer art of achieving a 'lack of self-consciousness.'  
N: You mentioned that Primal Heart is a very experimental album, but if you had to pin down one core theme or message of it, what would you say?
K: 'I see in you what I see in myself.'

Tim Bergling, more well-known as Avicii, was found dead in Muscat, Oman on April 20, 2018. Six days later, his family heavily alluded that his cause of death was suicide. His family released a statement saying "our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who travelled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress...When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be happy and be able to do what he loved most — music."
Bergling came up with his name Avicii from Avīci, which, in the Buddhist faith, is believed to be the lowest level of the Naraka ("hell" realm). That name that he initially created for MySpace would soon become his brand name. After years of releasing his remixes in online forums for electronic music, he got his breakthrough in 2011 with his song "Levels." Since then, his career skyrocketed.
However, things quickly took a turn.
In 2014, excessive partying and alcohol consumption led to him developing pancreatitis, causing him to have both his pancreas and gallbladder removed. In his Netflix documentary True Stories, he shared that "I won't be able to play anymore. I have said, like, 'I'm going to die.' I have said it so many times. And so I don't want to hear that I should entertain the thought of doing another gig." His deteriorating health ultimately forced him to announce, on a now-deleted Facebook post, an end to his touring career in 2016. "I know I am blessed to be able to travel all around the world and perform, but I have too little left for the life of a real person behind the artist," he announced. Although he still had a passion for creating music, he needed to be separated from the business machine he found himself trapped in. 
"One part of me can never say never. I could be back...but I won't be right back," he concluded.
The response to his retirement was anything but positive. "When I decided to stop, I expected something completely different. I expected support, particularly considering everything I have been through. Everyone knows that I've had anxiety and that I have tried. I did not expect that people would try to pressure me into doing more gigs." Already, his decision to quit was difficult enough; his management team had pushed him to the core to continue his career.
Perhaps he'll be forever known as the DJ who made hits like "Levels" and "Wake Me Up". However, there was far more to him and his art than just hit songs. He revolutionized electronic dance music (EDM). He was a compassionate man who cared for others. He was a young man who, like many others, wanted meaning and purpose in life.
Bergling showed strong support for the LGBTQ+ community. Although he "never had any friends being homophobic or never heard any parents being homophobic," he saw that there was still miles to go. "[LGBTQ+ rights are] really not that much of an issue in Sweden the same way it is for gay marriage in America," he pointed out. However, he expressed his support through his music. In 2012, he released a music video for his song "Silhouettes". The song celebrated a new generation, the "newborn." Bergling saw this as an opportunity for LGBTQ+ representation and portrayed the journey of a transgender woman who went through transitioning and found acceptance from others and herself.
On Valentine's Day in 2014, he made room for LGBTQ+ visibility in his music video for "Addicted to You" by featuring a lesbian Bonnie and Clyde couple. However, the fact that the protagonists were a same-sex couple had no bearing on the storyline. Bergling successfully made an enticing music video to complement the sexy beat, but he did so in a way that did not objectify the women or hypersexualize them. The girls were simply a couple madly in love with each other and the adrenaline rush from crime sprees, just as any other Bonnie and Clyde couple would.
His impact extends to the realm of EDM and music in general. In 2013, Bergling was one of the artists who teamed up with Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply Mix. Previously, Ralph Lauren tried to keep a more classy and preppy brand image; pairing with Avicii gave it a fun and modern twist. Ralph Lauren wanted to "merge fashion and art," and Avicii provided fresh beats and a more carefree take on Ralph Lauren's classic style.
Most importantly, Bergling was a man who was struggling and needed help. Even before his career launched, Bergling suffered from anxiety. Touring only made matters worse; to cope with his anxiety and panic attacks, he resorted to alcohol. His management did not see a man who needed to make his physical and mental wellbeing a priority; they saw a cash cow whom they could continue to churn until he gave out. When Bergling tried to push back on a tour schedule, his team put emphasis on how much money he would lose. Ash Pournouri, now former manager, scorned Bergling's inability to "understand the value of money" when he decided to retire his touring career. True Stories really did tell the true story of Bergling: a man who fell victim to a toxic culture that values a person's monetary gain over the person.
Comparisons have been drawn between Bergling and Kurt Cobain, the late singer of Nirvana. Although most of the comparisons are based on how they revolutionized their respective genre of music, the similarities between the two musicians run far deeper. Nirvana represents the ultimate spiritual goal in Buddhism. Both men suffered greatly from anxiety and resorted to alcohol, leading them to have both their pancreases removed. Both felt a lack of purpose in their lives and unfortunately couldn't find a possibility of one in their grasp. Bergling died at the age of 28; Cobain, 27. Regardless, there is no denying that Avicii dominated the EDM scene and has left a legacy for this emerging genre.

It is May 2010, and I am sitting in my old Honda while my dad drives our family to AMC Loews Port Chester 14, one of the movie theaters near my house. We were going to see some movie he’d been excited about for a while called Iron Man 2. He’d been talking about how much he loved the first Iron Man and was really excited to see the next one, so naturally he dragged all of us to watch it with him. Honestly, I was just a little annoyed, because I hadn’t seen the first film. While Iron Man 2 ended up being regarded as one of the worst movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), I was still somewhat charmed by the movie and went on to watch the MCU films that followed: Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, and Iron Man 3.
It is August 2016, and I am sitting in a classroom filled with students I don’t recognize, but all are taking the same class: the StuCo 98-275, Marvel Film and Media Studies. I was really intrigued by the idea of student-taught courses, but at the time I didn’t feel like a big enough Marvel fan. But, throughout the semester, we’d learn about a different movie or two each week, generating deeper discussions about each film itself and its social themes and messages. The two teachers of the StuCo encouraged me to participate in class discussions, and, over time, not only did they help me become a more outspoken, confident person, but they have also become two of my closest friends.
It is April 26, 2018, and I am sitting on the 61D bus, on the way to AMC Waterfront 22 to meet up with past and present students of 98-275 before seeing the most ambitious crossover event in history. I promise this will be the only time I reference that meme in this article. It isn’t quite ten years later, but the magnitude of the event feels the same. We all had dinner at Burgatory beforehand and shared our speculation and the same anticipation. One of the guests dressed up as the Hulk, painted green and all. All of the course’s past teachers were in town — the founder of the course had graduated, and the other four teachers were still current Carnegie Mellon students.
As I’m standing in line, two hours before me and the other 34 people in the group enter Auditorium 1 to see Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel Studios’ 19th film, I can’t help but worry that this movie will suck. I can’t help but panic over the fates of these 27 characters I’ve grown up seeing on screen for pretty much all of my teenage years. I can’t help but wonder if directors Anthony and Joe Russo have taken on too gargantuan of a task, worrying they’d crack under pressure and produce only a subpar movie that, in Marvel Studios’ near-perfect record, would actually end up being a pretty big stain on it.
Thirty minutes later, the doors of Auditorium 1 open and our group takes up a substantially large portion of, if not all of, the large middle section of unreserved seats. We pass the next hour and a half catching up with each other, making final predictions, and barely containing our excitement. We also end up participating in a round of HQ Trivia with each other, alongside other Marvel-obsessed moviegoers near us in the theater. As more people start to pile in, including familiar faces from some of my classes and people I lived with in my freshman dorm, I couldn’t contain my excitement alongside my four other StuCo teachers. 
And, despite its whopping runtime of 149 minutes, Avengers: Infinity War passed by with a snap of its fingers.
Hyped up as the culmination of the last ten years of Marvel Studios movies, Avengers: Infinity War is not meant to have a social agenda like Black Panther, or kickoff the start of something greater like Iron Man. It’s a marvelous (sorry), astounding movie, and lives up to its grand, impossible scale. In all senses — from its cast, to its visuals, to its sweeping, tragic, epic tale, Avengers: Infinity War is ambitious, daring, and lives up to its praise and anticipation, launching the MCU and its fans into a familiar yet new, uncharted atmosphere within Marvel Studios’ legacy. Everything passes by so quickly because from the first minute of the film, you are engaged and pulled into this world once again, and you can’t let go.
Thankfully, the Russo brothers have delivered a magnificent entry into the MCU that only further shows their cinematic skills. Granted, this movie still has problems: the plot is not as airtight as the Russo brothers' other Marvel Studios films, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War; sometimes the balance between humor and darkness gets erratic, and some characters retract rather than progress and grow. 
And, most importantly, you need to do your homework. If you had walked into this movie missing some key films, like the Russo brothers’ previous two Marvel movies or any of the previous Avengers films, you would have been lost. While waiting for the movie, we made one of our friends who hadn’t seen Thor: Ragnarok before, (attempt to) finish it while waiting for the movie to start.
But, it is evident that the Russos know what they are doing. The one-liners stick a near-perfect landing, especially those that are effectively timed to fit the movie’s tone. The visuals of the movie are breathtaking, inventive, and creative, truly expanding into the imagination of the MCU. The movie’s huge action sequences (think of the airport scene in Captain America: Civil War but around three of them) are engaging and incredibly immersive, only pulling the audience even more into this world that they love. And perhaps most shockingly, each hero feels like they’ve been given an equal chance to shine. 
But, notice how I didn’t say each character. And, by not doing so, the Russos made their smartest decision in deciding to position the story from Thanos’ perspective. In an interview with mpaa.org, the Russos mentioned how “Thanos is the one thing that unifies them all in this movie. So, orientating our story and telling it from his point of view had a lot of practicality to it as well.” Shattering Marvel’s villain problem, Thanos stands out from other Marvel villains in that he’s the only one that’s predominantly menacing out of Marvel Studios’ 19 other cinematic rogues. He barrels through all those that stand in his way, and his moments of heart and emotion shake you to your core because they’re completely unexpected coming from this absolute, intergalactic monster. It feels like actor Josh Brolin knows the villain and his motivations completely and wholeheartedly, delivering an amazing performance that is masterfully written and executed.
It is a little over 1 a.m. on April 27, 2018, right after the post-credits scene of Avengers: Infinity War plays, and I am looking down from the back row at my friends and students alongside my four other teachers, astonished at the turnout and the community that the five of us have nurtured and grown over two and a half years. None of the people have left the theater yet because they all know to stay, and they’re all still in utter disbelief by the Russos’ latest and greatest movie for the Marvel machine. As our group exits the theater to head back home, there’s an aura of shock among us. But, among our group, there’s a sense of a stronger bond and excitement for what’s to come.
Because, amidst everything, the Russos remembered to keep this movie incredibly fun. Apart from the experience of watching the movie with dozens of Marvel fans, there were many moments of the audience openly cheering, laughing, and sobbing together, cherishing in this feeling that you won’t be able to replicate again, even a year from now when the fourth Avengers film is released. Avengers: Infinity War is a great embodiment of Marvel Studios’ current legacy and never manages to lose its heart even when its tearing out the hearts of others.

Poignant and succinct, expressive and concise.
These words describe the style that poet and author Scott Laudati utilizes, seen particularly in his newest work, Bone House. Bone House is a collection of poems that combines the urban energy of New York with a melancholic longing. Laudati released his first collection of poems, Hawaiian Shirts in the Electric Chair,  in 2014, and has also written a number of award-winning short stories and a novel entitled Play the Devil. Influenced by the intrusive nature of the big city and a desire to express emotions before it’s too late, Bone House tells the story of what it feels like to “stand at the edge of a cliff.”
To further discuss his writing and his newest book, Bone House, Pillbox sat down with Scott Laudati.
For our readers who are unfamiliar with your work, could you tell us a little about yourself?
I grew up in New York City where there is no time to take a breath and you can never sleep because there’s always a firetruck or taxi horn roaring outside your window. And, I think my poems read like that. The energy and music are coming out of the windows, the subway grates, and they’re embedded in the sidewalks you walk above. I love this city and I want my work to reflect it, and if I’m really lucky, someday I’ll be known by it. 
What draws you to poetry?
If it’s done well, it’s the ultimate art. Poetry is the mainline of the universe. 
Is your approach to writing poetry any different from writing prose?
I don’t know. I’ve never made a choice between the two. Usually, if I’m drinking wine a poem appears. If I take an Adderall or get a good nights sleep, it’s prose. 
There’s a certain melancholic nostalgia to Bone House – elements of longing and looking back at the past. Did you start out with a theme or feeling in mind when writing these poems?
Honestly, I thought (and still think) with our new Idiot-In-Chief, the world was/is about to end. I was working on a novel, but writing a novel takes forever and there were a lot of things I wanted to say, some scores I wanted to settle, and especially let a particular girl know that I was wrong for everything. I thought the clock was running out and I wanted to say everything before it was too late. That’s the feeling behind Bone House — standing at the edge of the cliff.
One line that particularly struck me was “My real education began after college,” from your poem “coast to coast,” and you’ve mentioned before how you started writing poems in college. How has education helped or influenced you as a writer?
College makes everyone a better person. Before college your life has been a microcosm, everything can be new now if you let it. You date new people, eat new food, etc. But it’s also a system your parents are still paying for. After college you realize no one cares about you. The government just exists to steal your money. Your boss exists just to exploit you. I guess I’m being annoying and talking about “the real world” everyone’s dad says they don’t know anything about.
How do you differentiate Bone House from Hawaiian Shirts in the Electric Chair?
Bone House is more polished, but I’m not a kid anymore. The background is the same, though. I wrote it with all my heart and I tried to capture everything. The subject matter is a bit wider in Bone House. I tried to leave politics out of Hawaiian Shirts. At this point in history, though, that’s unavoidable — I’ve seen what this country demands from it’s citizens. It’s not good.
You’ve mentioned in the past how writing lyrics has helped you develop your writing style; has music or the experiences of being in a band influenced your work in other ways?
The lifestyle did. A lot of people refer to my poetry as “road poems” or kind of Kerouac or Beat style. I think that’s because of touring in bands and driving between New York and California over and over. Something happens on those endless highways. You never read a newspaper. Your friends stop calling after two days. You’re a ghost for months at a time. Nothing looks the same when you get home.
You have a few music videos to accompany your poems, like “Buffalo Bones” and “grit.” Are you looking to integrate more media-based art into your work?
I just figured that since the music video is essential to a bands album it should probably be the same for a writer with a book to promote. I don’t have any money or a team behind me so I have to continuously think of new ways to reach people. Everyone likes music videos.
Who is one poet or author you think everyone should know?
That’s easy — Thom Young!

It’s the end of April. The cold Pittsburgh weather is finally relenting, giving us some sun and warmer days (with some wind thrown in, of course). As this is the last issue of the semester, I thought I’d finish off with a review of the perfect place for the summer: Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream.
There are two Millie’s locations. There is one downtown in Market Square and one in Shadyside. They also sell pints at various grocery stores around Pittsburgh, including the Giant Eagle Market District. 
The Millie’s location in Shadyside is the closest to campus. The shop is right next door to the popular Thai restaurant, Noodlehead. Whenever my friends and I grab dinner at Noodlehead, it’s tradition to go to Millie’s after. It’s up S. Highland St. and is a short walk to Target and Trader Joe’s in East Liberty. The 71B bus will take you straight to the front door of Millie’s from Fifth Avenue. The 71D stops at Fifth and S. Highland, but the walk up the street is nice and short. Another possibility is the 75 bus through Ellsworth Avenue. 
Walking up to Millie’s, you already know what to expect: pink, pink, and more pink. Two picnic tables are in front of the store, and the neon pink sign of the door welcomes everybody in. The inside of the store is all striped white and pink wallpaper. The moment I stepped in for the first time, I was thrown by the intense smell of cinnamon. That’s their one-of-a-kind waffle cones. They make them right behind the counter, so you can see them making fresh cones as you pick out your ice cream flavor(s). 
Milllie’s ice cream flavors rotate month-to-month, but there are some staples, like The Best Chocolate, Chad’s Vanilla, and Vietnamese Coffee. Some unique past flavors include Olive and Lavender. The ice cream itself is not super strong: the Lemon and Lavender flavors, among others, taste like lemon and lavender, but you won’t get an intense taste of lemon, or the particular aroma of lavender. The ice cream, regardless of flavor, is mild and creamy, a great snack anytime, but especially on those hot summer days.
Without a doubt, Millie’s is my favorite ice cream place in Pittsburgh. The store itself is cute and welcoming, as well as family friendly. It can get extremely crowded on hot days or weekends, but the inside is relatively spacious for a typical ice cream shop. There are several tables and benches, as well as standing space. There are also tables outside in both the front and in the back for particularly nice days. 
The ice cream is great, and there are some unique flavors that are worth a try. But for me, it’s the waffle cones that seal the deal. I haven’t ever had a cone quite as fresh or crispy. The cinnamon also really comes through in the recipe and helps create its unique taste.
With the weather warming up and finals looming, Millie’s is a great spot that is a short bus ride from campus to take a break and #TreatYoSelf between essays, term projects, and exams. Once summer arrives, I'm excited to enjoy great ice cream in the great weather.

College is a wonderful, engaging, and exciting, yet challenging adventure. But, what is it like to be a vocal performance major? To be honest, the beginning was difficult. Knowing that everyone is talented, hardworking, and motivated, it is hard not to compare yourself to others. Although it took me an entire year to understand this, I have realized that it is almost impossible and not beneficial to compare yourself to others in this field, or any field of study for that matter. Each student in the voice department has different strengths and weaknesses. For some, learning new languages such as Italian or German may come naturally, while for others, singing in solfege is effortless or building French augmented sixth chords in Harmony is a piece of cake. Learning to take pride in one's abilities and identifying weaknesses is one of the most rewarding aspects to grasp and has helped me tremendously in my first year in college. 
This year was packed with 17 classes ranging from traditional music classes such as Harmony, language classes such as Italian, all the way to the infamous Interpretation and Argument. Though it was stressful at times, I found that I would not want to be anywhere else except this school. The year has challenged me, pushed me way beyond where I thought my limits were, and began building the foundation of my upcoming career. My passion for music has grown out of the love that my teachers have to pass their knowledge to their students. My desire for singing has grown continuously, because everyday my classmates challenge and push me to become the best performer that I can be.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Part of being a vocal performance major is the performances. While first years and sophomores are unable to participate in the staged operas, there are surprisingly more opportunities to perform than I originally thought. For example, each year, everyone performs in four seminars, two juries (exceptions are juniors and seniors), and multiple choral performances. The seminar is essentially when vocalists can try out pieces to perform, while dressing up as if they were auditioning. The seminars take place in front of the entire vocal performance department, students and teachers alike. While intimidating at first, I realized just how incredibly supportive the community I was learning in really was. The upperclassmen especially made me feel welcomed into the voice community. This is special because a lot of times there is a disconnect between the upperclassmen and the first years and sophomores. Knowing that the people you look up to also have your back and want you to succeed at everything is the best feeling in the world. Juries are a whole different level. There are two per year with upperclassman as an exception, and you sing a couple of pieces in front of the entire voice faculty for grades. It can be an intimidating process, but it is a great time to showcase your skills in front of the faculty.
But, what are the most important things that I learned after my first year in college? I compiled a list of specific things to consider as a first-year vocal major:
1. Understand that music itself is hard. Music is a complex art form that takes a lot of patience and willingness to work hard at the craft. Aspects of the art form may not come as easily as you think and may in fact take a whole year to start to understand.
2. You will have moments of self doubt. These moments are there to remind you to take a step back and reflect on why you selected music and why it is so important to you to pursue as a career. 
3. Competition is part of the everyday routine of singers. Regardless of comparison, competition for roles, mock auditions, and more, are included with daily practice and class work. It is how one composes oneself in order to perform to the best of their abilities. Healthy competition in the classroom setting is necessary in appreciating that this career is difficult to be good at. 
4. You have to learn to embrace failure. Being a perfectionist myself, this was certainly not easy and still is not. Perfection is emphasized in society today, through media and other platforms. However, the thing to recognize is that perfection is not the quality that will get you the furthest, but embracing failure is. With failure also comes success. You can’t have one or the other. In order to build, you need failure. It is what will push you to try harder, practice a little bit more, and achieve the goals you set for yourself. 
5. But, perhaps the most valuable thing that I learned this year, was that confidence was and still is essential. Having confidence in myself and my abilities was the key to success throughout this academic school year. 
Overall, the year has been a successful one with many valuable lessons. I have learned so much about myself as a singer and performer. And, at the end of the day, I could not picture myself being anywhere but in the Carnegie Mellon School of Music.

At Carnegie Mellon University’s Carnival Concert three years ago, indie-pop duo Matt and Kim took the stage. Many students at the time were full-fledged fans, pushing their way closer for the best view while others who weren’t as familiar with the band waited at the fringes, curious about the band who they knew from hits like “Daylight” and “Good Ol’ Fashion Nightmare.” What ensued was a typical Matt and Kim set, a performance that felt more like a music festival or a party than an ordinary live show, punctuated by Kim Schifino’s heartfelt dance moves, Matt Johnson’s energy, and the pair’s infectiously joyful vibe. Students went wild singing along at the top of their lungs and jumping around. By the end of the night, everyone in attendance had been transformed by the “Matt and Kim Experience.”
Flash forward to 2017 where Matt and Kim put on an equally energetic performance at Vaiven Festival in Mexico. But, this time, when Kim launched herself off stage as she’d done countless times in the past, she landed funny and collapsed. Kim was ushered off stage and back to a doctor in the U.S. The diagnosis: a torn ACL. The prescription: nine months of rest and recovery. And so, Matt and Kim took an unexpected step away from the music scene, leaving fans anxiously awaiting news of Kim’s progress in hopes of the return of their music, their shows, and of course, Kim’s famous dance moves.
The wait is finally over; Matt and Kim are back. Their new album Almost Everyday, which has been described as their most “personal” release yet, drops May 4 and coincides with a North American tour (the band hit Pittsburgh’s own Mr. Smalls for a concert last Saturday). 
As a fan myself, I can guarantee that Almost Everyday doesn’t disappoint. Their new songs “Forever,” “Happy if You’re Happy,” “Like I Used to Be,” and “Glad I Tried” still provide the hopelessly catchy and exclamatory sound of their previous albums while ensnaring you with lyrics that crawl under your skin and settle near your heart. Amidst the negativity that seems to overwhelm the world some days, the duo’s intricate blend of introspection, resilience, and a little bit of crazy, remind us what hope, joy, and togetherness feel like. 
Amidst the craze of promoting their new album and getting back into the groove of touring, we were lucky enough to talk with Kim about the personal significance of Almost Everyday, the band’s musical growth, and how they’re feeling about returning to the scene after their time away. 
The following conversation has been lightly edited. (WILL BE CLARIFIED)
Q: Almost Everyday has been described as one of your most personal albums so far. What makes it so personal to you guys?
A: We had a really tough 2017.  It was a combination of all the crap going on in the world with all the awful headlines popping up daily and the fact I was injured onstage and Matt and I were forced to take a year off. It became a very dark year for us. We used all of that emotional experience in our writing process in a therapeutic way, and that really made this album hit home for us.  
Q: Is there any significance to the album title, Almost Everyday?
A: Almost Everyday came about because it seems like almost everyday there is another awful headline in the news about horrible things going on.  
Q: The Matt and Kim “sound” is incredibly unique and immediately identifiable. How after so many years and albums do you keep true to that sound while still exploring and growing artistically?
A: I like that! I don’t know if I ever thought about that. I guess we keep true to the sounds we love; there hasn’t ever been a song that I don’t want to put horns into! I hope we keep growing artistically and trying new things, because I feel like it would be super boring if we kept doing the same thing over and over again. 
Q: Your upcoming album features many guest vocalists. Why did you decide to include other musicians on this album, and do you feel that featuring other artists had any effect on your process or your sound?
A: We wanted to recreate the experience we get at a live show where everyone sings along for the album. When we decided to include other musicians on the album, we felt it was fitting to reach out to friends and see if they would be down to be part of the group vocals. Everyone was so awesome to help us out, and it’s great to have such talented friends agree to be a part of [the album] and add to the songs we wrote.  
Q: Your live performances are legendary. After taking a break from touring, how are you feeling about hitting the road and the stage again? Is there any aspect of touring/performing live that you guys particularly missed?
A: I am so excited to be back on tour. Playing shows is “home” for us. On stage is where we feel the most comfortable. I do not like sitting still, and after a year of doing that, I was dying to be back on stage. It made us appreciate the experience of being on tour and playing live shows even more than we already did. I am so thankful to everyone who has come out already to dance and rage with us on this tour. Our Pittsburgh show last week got nuts and I love that.  
Q: Your band is known not just for your music but for your music videos as well. How do you translate the theme and feeling of your songs into videos?
A: The video stuff is all Matt, he’s a genius. I will say sometimes I think his ideas are crazy. There are definitely ones that I didn’t want to do, and he had to do a lot of persuading, but after we executed them and we won a [MTV Video Music Award] for them, I have to admit it was a genius idea. 
Q: You guys seem to have forged your own unique path from the beginning of your career, from the fact that neither of you had too much musical experience prior to starting the band, to the kinds of music videos you create, to the times and places you’ve recorded albums and EPs. How do you maintain your identify and freedom in the music industry?
A: From the beginning we did everything ourselves and had control of everything.  We kept doing this 'cause we know what we want, and we know how to make it happen. Our record label Fader has also been awesome with giving us the freedom to try out all our crazy ideas and never forcing us to stay within the lines. We love them for that, because the worst thing is when someone tells you you can’t do what you want...that just makes me want to do it even more!
Be sure to check out the Almost Everyday tracks and videos that have already been released to get a taste of the new album before it drops on May 4! And, if you want to be part of the “Matt and Kim Experience” check out mattandkimmusic.com for upcoming tour dates.

Dear Alexandra,
I’ve never felt so trapped, stranded, and lost by everything going on in my life right now. I feel like I’m so far away from getting the grades I’m striving for, and it seems impossible to motivate myself academically. I feel like I STILL have no idea what I want to do with my major and what I want to study so I keep hitting my head on this existential, abstract wall every day. And, worst of all, I feel like I can’t go to people for support, because one of my other friends kind of took my core group of friends as a support system away from me after something kind of terrible that she did. I don’t want to confront her about it, and I don’t want to start any fights and choosing sides, so I feel like I have to lie to everyone and put on a happy face when really sometimes I’m low-key dying inside.
Wow, I’m sorry this is really heavy but do you have anything to cheer me up?
Silently Avoiding Drama
Dear SAD,
Confrontation can be hard, and what you’re going through definitely isn’t easy. While I agree that confrontation is not necessarily the best plan of action, silence is not a good route either — I’d recommend talking with someone. It’s not good to keep these feelings bottled up, and I’m sure your friends are worried about you, even if your other friend took them away from you. Friends are still friends, and they wouldn’t want you to go through this alone, even if it meant making the friend group dynamic a bit awkward. Your mental health is extremely important, and your friends should care enough to put any awkwardness aside to help you with whatever you’re going through. I know you’re worried about making them choose sides, but it seems like you don’t want whatever happened between you and your friend to ruin your relationship, so as long as you’re not picking sides, I’m sure no one else will have an issue either. You deserve to be heard and shouldn’t feel like you have to tiptoe around them and act like everything is okay.
If you don’t feel like you can talk to your friends here though, I would recommend reaching out to friends from back home. I know it’s hard with different schedules and everything, but when I feel down and don’t know how to bring things up with my friends here (or just want a distraction from everything going on here), I reach out to my high school friends and try to set up a time to FaceTime or talk on the phone or something. I was going through a weird time earlier this semester, and connecting with one of them really grounded me and cheered me up. Whether you want someone to give you a new perspective or be a shoulder to cry on, or you just want someone to hang out with and distract you from all the stress of your social life and academics, talking with an old friend is a great way to decompress and also catch up with someone you may not have the chance to talk to very often.
I don’t want to get too cliche here, but it’s easy to get so caught up in the stress that you forget to take a break. Burning out is perfectly normal, and while academics are important, make sure that you take time for yourself. I know finals season is quickly approaching, but even taking a few minutes out of your day to take a walk in the (finally!) nice Pittsburgh weather or jam out to your favorite music could be beneficial and help alleviate some of your stress.
Ultimately, the most important thing is that you’re taking care of yourself. Whatever you need to do to feel better, do it. Don’t be afraid to take a break, from academics or your social life, even if it’s just for a moment or two.
Hope this helps,
Alexandra

It's been the best of times, it's been the worst of times, and now it has finally come to an end. For my last week as your official bar buddy, I felt I had to do something beyond the ordinary. Over the semester, I've been to Southside, Shadyside, North Shore, and everywhere in between. There was one place however that I had yet to tackle: Mount Washington. A friend I was with described it as "the best place to be a casual alcoholic" and, while I was content just coasting at "casual drinker", I wanted to understand what about the neighborhood sparked this claim, so I set out to try and experience all of it in one night.
Shiloh Grill
This was my first stop of the night. I can't speak too much on the alcohol, because all I had here was a beer, but there was one thing on their drink menu that caught my attention. Their Moscow Mule requires a $25 deposit that is refunded to you provided that you return the mug. Maybe I'm still a noob even after drinking my way across Pittsburgh for the sake of The Tartan, but I had never seen this before. I found it especially odd considering that this place was more restaurant than bar that someone would get rowdy enough to destroy a copper mug. Since it was a restaurant and my first stop of the night, I decided to also grab some food. I had been here before and remembered the mac and cheese being amazing but expensive, much like the rest of the menu. In the end I settled for a few appetizers to pair with my beer.
The Summit
This was probably the highlight of my night. If you're a regular reader by now, you know I like to go for one drink on the menu to get a feel for the place before resorting to a tried and true (and cheaper) mixed drink. I must've been feeling festive this weekend because I threw that rule right out the window. The first drink I had here was called something that I can't remember with cucumber in the name and it was very refreshing. There are two types of drinks that I fear the most: ones where I can't taste the alcohol and ones that are super strong and come with what seems like a shot's worth of actual liquid to drink. This type was the former. It featured cucumber vodka, lemonade, and soda and drinking it made me feel like I was coming into the clubhouse after a long tennis lesson on a summer day. 
The second drink I ordered was something I never would have thought to order called the Neon Carrot. This drink was the latter of my two fears that I was clearly planning to conquer that night. There are two main ingredients that I remember from this drink: carrots and cayenne. I was on the fence about if I wanted to try something this unconventional, but our waitress really talked me into it. The bright orange drink came in a very tiny glass garnished with what I think was parsley that was attached to the glass with a tiny clothes pin. As I'm writing this, I am only just now realizing that it was meant to resemble a carrot. It was a lot sweeter than I expected it to be, but I still enjoyed it. I personally think it tasted a bit like ketchup, but if you can get past that then I'd say give it a shot. Another notable thing about this bar is all the graffiti art on the lower level where the bathrooms are. You wouldn't expect it when you walk into the bar, but it was an interesting touch.
Coughlin's Law
I finished my night at a bar that was just as new to Mount Washington as I was. A friend informed me that this bar was named after a movie reference to the 1988 film Cocktail with "bury the dead" being Doug Coughlin's most infamous law. This place is new, and everyone was just as curious about it as we were, so there was a bit of wait to get inside as they had reached max capacity. However, even if you're stuck standing outside for a bit on a cold night like we were, there's heaters and an outdoor bar to keep you warm. We stayed close to the bouncer so we quickly made our way inside, where I opted for a fruity, Hawaiian-themed beer thats brewed in Pennsylvania. It was a lot sweeter and a lot fruitier than I'm used to for a beer, but it was very tasty. A friend of mine got a blueberry beer that came with actual blueberries in it. I can already tell this place will be packed when the weather is nicer and people intentionally opt for the outdoor bar.
These places all have a really good happy hour and weekly specials if you find yourself in the area from 5 –7 p.m., so I'll be keeping my eyes on those. All in all, I've had a lot of fun writing this column. I'll be living in Pittsburgh after graduation so my exploration of the bars here won't stop, I just won't be able to say "I'm working" when I go out twice in one weekend.

My conversation with Lawrence Gowan, lead singer of iconic rock band STYX, began in the most interesting way: with a compliment from him on the title of our newspaper, The Tartan which led to a brief conversation about the pattern, tartan, and its connection to his Scottish roots. Gowan is currently having the time of his life touring the U.S. with STYX, alongside other legendary rock acts Joan Jett & The Blackhearts and Tesla. On July 14, their tour will be heading to Pittsburgh at the Keybank Pavilion, and Gowan was happy to share some of his experiences and hopes for the tour. 
M: How’s your experience touring with Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, Tesla, and your other band members?
LG: I would recommend it to anyone. If that opportunity ever comes your way I would highly recommend it. Whatever you’re doing in life, I would consider dropping that and getting on board with something like this. That’s how much fun I have doing it. 
M: What’s your favorite song and/or songs to perform?
LG: ["Renegade"] is one of the songs Tommy Shaw sings lead on and it’s always towards the end of the night. I had great experiences with that song with just observing where the audience is at emotionally; they’re so effusive in their emotive state, no matter where we play around the world. I’ve seen audiences that start out a show very differently in Japan or Sweden or England or America and yet they’re all so alike by the time we get to the end of the night and that’s usually [with] “Renegade”. So that always kind of holds its attraction to me as the most fun song for me to play because I really get to enjoy [the song] from an audience perspective as much as a band perspective at that point... It’s just one of these marvelous things that I’ve witnessed in life, where it really speaks to the universal language of what music can do to people and how alike we are in our response to it when it meets our expectations or when it goes well beyond them. 
M: Wow, that’s amazing! And that also says a lot about STYX and how the band’s music can really move people across the world.
LG: It really does speak to that, and why wouldn’t it? You know, classic rock or rock music is a gigantic musical statement of the last half of the twentieth century, and that’s indisputable. It really had a profound impact on such a large part of the planet, you might even say the entire planet, to where these songs are not just the soundtracks to [people’s] lives, but they are like a vibrational call to their very existence. I mean, that sounds way overstated, but I witness it all the time so I can’t deny its existence. People really do have this deep and abiding love for this type of music. It’s gone well beyond being a fad, it’s much more a part of the fabric of their lives. 
M: I heard you’ll be performing the band’s hit "Mr. Roboto" when you come to Pittsburgh. What are you most looking forward to in that performance? 
LG: Well we’ve been playing it for a few weeks, so I look forward to playing it every night. I really enjoy doing the song and I love watching the audience’s reaction to it. It’s really a song that’s lasted and it’s well into its fourth decade of existence. Some people make some smiles and it pushes a button in people that I enjoy pushing. 
M: Could you explain the evolution of the band’s music over the years?
LG: One of the things I love about STYX music is that it always had a bit of a classical underpinning to its structure and the way it’s approached. I’m in my twentieth year in the band right now. I studied classical music growing up, and I actually got a degree in classical piano but with the intention of bringing it back to rock. But it’s that aspect of it, and the lofty pathos that goes into a lot of classical music, that is in a lot of STYX music. That’s something that’s been an ongoing and developing thematic part of the band. 
Gowan then begins to talk about the unique combination of pop, rock, and classical music genres often found in STYX music, and how it’s used in their most recent and highly acclaimed album, The Mission.
LG: It goes from pretty straight-ahead rock with, let’s say “Gone Gone Gone,” and then it runs across an arch of a wide emotional spectrum, and then concludes, well not quite concludes, but towards the end it comes to a very classical piece with “Khedive.” And, you know, those two pieces couldn’t be further apart as far as emotional intention. And yet, they’ve lived in existence alongside each other on the same album, and one is kind of necessary for the other one to really have its moment. 
M: I was listening to The Mission, and I found it fascinating how it tells one story but by using very different genres of music. I don’t really see that a lot in current music. So I wanted to know, in your opinion, when the band makes new music do you do your best to maintain your old sound or do you try to incorporate newer and more popular music styles from this generation?
LG: There’s something about the classic sound of this band from the era of the late '70s that is really resonating with the younger contingency of our audience. Because on any given night, half the audience can be under 30 years of age, so they weren’t even born when some of the biggest STYX records were made. And yet, they respond to [the records] as if they’re completely concurrent with their lives. So, when we made The Mission, we decided, “Well look, obviously the audience has been with the band ever since the beginning. They’re still loyal to the band and they want that sound; that’s the sound they’re drawn to. And then you have these younger people who very much are drawn to that sound as well. So let’s make sure that we write a record that sounds like a STYX record, which has all those particular elements that they gravitate to.” And that’s how The Mission was formed the way it was, and that’s why it wound up really doing as well as it has done, because it really does connect to that era. 
M: I heard the band was working with a non-profit called Rock to the Rescue while on tour. Could you talk a little bit about that? 
LG: I’ll tell you how that began. After 9/11, everyone in the country and around the world felt it incumbent upon them to do something proactive and positive as a reaction to that event and tragedy. And for us, a couple of months after it happened, we decided to do a concert. We got a bunch of classic rock acts who came and did it with us in a couple of cities, and we raised money, I think about half a million, maybe even more than that. But we needed a name for the charity, and so the name Rock to the Rescue came up and that became an ongoing thing for probably two or three years. 
It was revived again with the idea of every city we play in has some charity that needs some financial assistance. And we come back to these cities over and over and over and people there have been so faithful to the band for decades. But it’s a small but meaningful gesture on our part to leave some of the money in a community with some, what we see as, worthy cause of the day. 
M: What’s next for the band, in regards to the tour and/or new music?
LG: Well, there’s always new music. It really comes down to whether we carve out the time from our very intense touring schedule to actually go and record. But I would say that given the success of The Mission, something will emerge at some point if things keep going the way they are. We’re very much a band that stays focused on the day. I look at the schedule ahead and I see there’s always cities that we’re going to. It can look quite daunting quite frankly, and you can begin to look at it like, “Oh my god, we gotta get all this done,” but it doesn’t work that way. We really try to live by the philosophy of embracing the day and not really relying on, or assuming that the future is just going to simply be there for us to live out our plans. So we really hope to have a record, we hope to keep doing this basically for as long as our time on earth will allow. 
M: Anything you’d like to the say to your fans in Pittsburgh before they come out to see you? 
LG: Looking forward to sharing another STYX epic adventure with you this summer, and having Tesla and Joan Jett & The Blackhearts along is only going to make the party that much more fun. Looking forward to seeing everyone!

The first time I was exposed to classic rock music was when I was in third grade. My dad would play his favorite Journey, KISS and Queen albums whenever he drove me to school. I learned all the lyrics of each band’s greatest hits and even discovered a few of my own favorites, which I would usually play on repeat during those car rides. 70s/80s rock music became the first music genre that I had ever felt a deep emotional connection to, and it helped me get through my middle school and high school years. Once I got to college, I stopped listening for a while and it wasn’t until I attended the recent STYX concert in Burgettstown, PA that I began listening to classic rock on an almost daily basis again, ultimately remembering why I love the music so much. 
The connection that I’ve made with classic rock is not just tied to my emotions, but also to my parents and their generation. Listening to older music gives me a small glimpse into their youth and the trends that my parents were (or might have been) into. When I first told them over the phone that I would be interviewing Lawrence Gowan of STYX and seeing the band in concert, both my parents screamed with excitement. To be honest, I knew very little about STYX at the time so I couldn’t really relate to that excitement. My parents had to explain to me all they knew about the band and gave me suggestions for some songs I should listen to. After listening to more of their hits, I became an instant fan of STYX and understood a little better my parents’ fangirling for the band. 
Being able to attend STYX’s concert in Burgettstown was something I had been looking forward to for a while, mainly because I knew I would get to experience a part of the past. I expected the audience to consist mostly of adults around my parents' age, reliving that time when they were around my age. As someone who is nearing her twenties, I was curious to see what this whole scene would look like while also contemplating if I would be doing the same thing twenty years from now. 
Because of traffic, I arrived a little late to the concert. However, the first thing I heard was Tesla’s rocking performance of their song, “Modern Day Cowboy” blasting through the speakers, and my friend and I weren’t even inside the venue yet. I had never listened to Tesla before, but just hearing them play, especially their amazing guitar solo in the song, made me feel so excited for the rest of the concert. 
Once I finally got in to the venue, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts were getting ready to perform. A large screen with the band’s logo hung right in the center of the stage with the full drum set, all the guitars, and microphones set and ready to go for the next act. The moment Joan Jett walked out on stage, I was immediately starstruck. She wore what looked to be a leather sleeveless top and skinny leather pants, with sneakers to complete the outfit. Her presence, performance, and well really everything about her represented authentic classic rock. She performed some of her most famous hits like “I Love Rock 'n' Roll,” “I Hate Myself for Loving You,” and “Bad Reputation.” For each song she performed, there was a different background on the large screen behind her; there were some images taken from scenes of her movie Light of Day with Michael J. Fox during her performance of the song “Light of Day,” as well as images of splattered paint during her performance of “Love Is Pain.” Joan Jett ended her act with an encore and performed the song “Everyday People,” spreading only good vibes throughout the entire atmosphere of the venue. 
Around twenty minutes after Joan Jett & The Blackhearts’ act, STYX came out ready to “get this show on the road,” performing “Gone Gone Gone” from their most recent album, The Mission. I definitely did not expect STYX’s entire performance to be one huge rock 'n' roll party. Especially once they started playing “Rockin' The Paradise” from their Paradise Theatre album, I saw all the members of the band starting to dance, goof off, and have the best time of their lives up on stage. STYX’s free spirited nature was contagious, and almost instantly they had the entire audience dancing as well.
The musical journey that STYX took the audience through during their concert was an experience like no other. The moods and atmosphere from the audience changed so naturally to match the tone of each song. The nostalgic feeling that most of the audience members had was very present, especially when the band brought out Chuck Panozzo, one of the founding members of STYX, to play “Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)." One of the most amazing moments for me was seeing the audience at one point hold up a mix of lighters and using the light from their phones. That image vividly showed that even with the change in times, the impact of music on people is timeless. Throughout the whole concert, I saw people my parents' age dance like no one was watching and even adults my grandparents’ age were swaying to the beat of the music. I don’t know if it was during the “Bohemian Rhaphsody” piano solo by STYX’s lead singer, Lawrence Gowan or when the band ended the night with “Mr. Roboto” and “Renegade” that I remembered how it felt listening to my dad’s rock music in the car. It was a unique and awesome feeling, like even though I didn’t grow up during one of the peaks of the classic rock movement, I was proud that I was still somehow able to be a part of it.

As established in a joint ceremony this past April 17, Carnegie Mellon University has joined the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)’s Open Campus initiative, bringing a new long-term research partnership to the College of Engineering.
Director of the ARL Philip Perconti and Dean of the College of Engineering James H. Garrett, Jr. signed the collective partnership with the goal of addressing “homeland and national security issues by providing soldiers with the most cutting-edge equipment and technology to ensure their safety and increase their effectiveness,” according to a university press release. Topics of future research include “digital engineering, machine learning, autonomy and artificial intelligence.”
This partnership is far from the first of its kind, as the ARL has a network of 15 research centers throughout the United States that focus on specific facets of military and defense research. According to their website, “leveraging expertise, facilities, and capabilities on an international scale to address challenging research problems critical to the U.S. Army and National Security,” is the primary purpose of the program.
In 2016, while attending the Defense Manufacturing Conference, Carnegie Mellon University representatives were “briefed on the Open Campus initiative and established a strategic relationship with Dr. Philip Perconti,” the office of Dean Garrett told The Tartan.
Upon further consideration, it was determined that developing this relationship could provide “faculty and students with access to real-world, challenging problems and data sets, as well as access to ARL facilities, infrastructure, and equipment,” thereby “drastically [enhancing] our research,” they continued.
Dean Garrett speaks with clear optimism about the partnership, saying at the ceremony, “ARL's Open Campus is transforming the national security research culture by bringing together researchers from varying backgrounds and providing a framework for collaboration,” and continuing, “the initiative will have a profound positive impact by accelerating the pace of innovation to provide increased capabilities for national security and defense.”
This being established, not everyone is as optimistic as Dean Garrett about the prospect of the Open Campus partnership on campus. Amelia Smith, graduate student in the Department of Philosophy and researcher on the ethics of autonomous weapons systems and moral responsibility in mixed human-machine teams, told The Tartan, independently from her department, that statements like the partnership’s stated goal of making “soldiers safer, stronger and more effective” is “designed to appeal: it focuses on the moral positives of the research and obscures some less desirable features.”
She does elaborate that “depending on how research is conducted,” being able to have a role in the direction of research “enables us to be in a position (potentially) to examine and discuss how technology should be developed and implemented.”
The ethical debate over military and governmental funding at Carnegie Mellon University is longstanding and unresolved. According to a 2015 research report by Vice News, Carnegie Mellon University ranks as the 27th most “militarized” university in the United States, with $72,511,000 of research and development funding coming from Department of Defense and with governmental affiliations including National Intelligence, the NSA, Homeland Security, the FBI, and Military ROTC Programming.
Events regarding this debate in the past have included an anti-war demonstration at Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Engineering Center in Lawrenceville in 2007 that led to the arrest of 14. Unofficially led by former Carnegie Mellon Philosophy Department PhD student and locally-prominent anarchist activist David Meieran, the Pittsburgh Organizing Group that engaged in these protests was a constant voice against Carnegie Mellon University’s military ties. The organization leveled critiques including, but not limited to, the university contributing to a “war economy” that leads to jobs depending on war.
The Pittsburgh Organizing Group disbanded in 2011, and since then, local discussion of the role of military spending on university campuses has seemingly decreased, apart from some broader anti-war demonstrations and the occasional published opinion piece. Academic partnership with the military, and using military funds for research remain a point of contention for students and faculty  at Carnegie Mellon alike, though evidently not something Dean Garrett or the College of Engineering has ethical qualms with.
When questioned on how the new partnership was going to be funded, or if funding had anything to do with the announcement of the partnership, the office of the Dean initially stated that the partnership was more designed to “facilitate collaborative research,” but would leave the university “well-positioned for competitive research opportunities from ARL and across the Department of Defense.”
Upon further questioning, Tara Moore, who works in the communications branch of the College of Engineering, clarified that “the initiative is not about funding — it's about collaboration and shared resources, which is why we don't really have an answer about funding,” and that “the point of the Open Campus initiative is for everyone involved to work together to make our soldiers, and our country, safer and stronger.”
All this being said, the announcement of the Army’s Open Campus initiative in 2014 notes that “cooperative agreements,” which are when “parties wish to work together on the same project while sharing each party's expertise, facilities and equipment,” allow for “funds [to] be passed from the government to the partner,” but not the reverse.
It is not made clear whether the agreement between Carnegie Mellon University is this type of agreement or what they note to be “Educational Partnership Agreement,” a STEM education and research encouragement program, and thus the transmission of funds from the Department of Defense to Carnegie Mellon University remains an unanswered question. The Tartan has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to determine if any amount of money has been exchanged, and if so, how much, but a response is not expected within this academic year.
Ms. Smith concluded her statements to The Tartan with the notion that partnerships like this one require “asking hard questions about what certain types of technologies (drones, algorithms, and so on) should be responsible for or how and what values we use when assigning them their duties.” She also urged researchers to understand that their work will be used in ways they need to be fully understanding of, something also raised by Meieran in peak times of his anti-military spending activism.
The issue of military funding and involvement on campus has sparked discussion and protest in the past, but as of now, it is unclear how this partnership is to be received in the campus community. It is an ongoing discussion, and events like the newly announced partnership with the ARL’s Open Campus initiative will certainly contribute.

Bill Cosby was convicted of  drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. This announcement on Thursday marked the end to a legal battle that has spanned more than a decade, which led to more than 50 women stepping up and saying that they, too, had experienced sexual violence at the hands of Cosby. It also marked the end of another debate that directly involved the Carnegie Mellon community as the university announced that same day in an unsigned statement that they were going to revoke the honorary degree they had granted Cosby in 2007.
The university first commented on the issue in 2015 when the University of Pittsburgh revoked the degree they had granted Cosby after the outpouring of public interest that comedian Hannibal Buress sparked in the issue with his 2014 act calling Cosby a “rapist.” Associate Director of Media Relations Abby Simmons said at the time to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the “university is having internal discussions about Bill Cosby’s honorary degree. The university has not made a decision at this time.”
Evidently, what they, like many other universities who had granted Cosby an honorary degree, were waiting for was for the actor to be officially charged with the crimes he had been accused of. This move drew much criticism, including from the 2015 Tartan Editorial Board, as many felt that the accusations of dozens of women or even the deposition that was made public in 2016 that shows Cosby admitting to drugging women before sex should have been sufficient reason to revoke Cosby’s degree, as a charge seemed more and more uncertain when the legal battle dragged on. Institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh, Tufts University, Fordham University, and Brown University chose to rescind the honorary degrees they had granted him before a conviction was made.
The Provost at the time Cosby was awarded the degree, Mark Kamlet, Professor of Economics and Public Policy and Provost Emeritus, said in an email interview with The Tartan, “Others may well disagree with me about the fact that Carnegie Mellon waited until Mr. Cosby was convicted to withdraw his honorary degree. But, ‘innocent until proven guilty’ remains one of the central tenets of our government and legal system. Mr. Cosby has now been found to be guilty and within one day Carnegie Mellon took its action — as did Temple University, his alma mater, and others — I wish he were convicted far sooner.”
This year’s criteria for nominees for honorary degrees called for candidates who have “reached preeminent levels of distinction in their fields and demonstrated extraordinary achievements, preferably those associated with educational, research or performance programs at Carnegie Mellon,” and “demonstrated respect and appreciation for the responsibilities of citizenship and service to society.”
At the time Cosby was selected to receive an honorary degree in 2007, several women including Andrea Constand, Tamara Green, and Beth Ferrier had gone public with accusations that Cosby had sexually assaulted them. Carnegie Mellon was certainly not the only institution that chose to not heed these accounts and award Cosby an honorary degree, as the accusations did not receive much widespread public attention until Buress’s comments in 2014. The New York Times reported in 2015 that he had over 60 such honorary degrees.
Kamlet, who along with then-President Jared Cohon, was responsible for awarding Cosby with the degree at the commencement ceremony but was not involved in the selection process, said that most of the Carnegie Mellon community was “thrilled that Mr. Cosby agreed with enthusiasm to be Carnegie Mellon’s graduation speaker and to be awarded an honorary degree,” which, he continued, made it “certainly devastating to learn the truth.”
While many other universities have chosen to follow in rescinding degrees after the charges were made public, with Boston College making Cosby the first person in the history of their institution to have their honorary degree taken away, still others insist that there is either no process or no point to revoking degrees they have awarded.
“Any future decisions to revoke honorary degrees will be made by university leadership on a case-by-case basis,” Simmons said in an interview with The Tartan. She also reinforced the statement made by the university that “Carnegie Mellon University has long had a clear and unwavering commitment: The university will not tolerate sexual violence, intimate partner violence, stalking or sexual harassment. These acts are against the law and violate our core values.”
Professor Kamlet reiterated that this consideration has long been an important issue for those responsible for governing Carnegie Mellon. “Promotion of diversity and proactive action against gender discrimination let alone sexual harassment and sexual aggression have been and must be key priorities for Carnegie Mellon. I can say, firsthand, how important this was to President Jared Cohon, and I strongly believe these are central priorities for President Jahanian.”
The conclusion of that commitment was the same as the conclusion of the two-paragraph statement released by the University: “In order to fulfill that commitment and in light of Bill Cosby’s criminal conviction for aggravated indecent assault, Carnegie Mellon University has decided to revoke an honorary degree it awarded to Mr. Cosby in 2007."

This past Thursday, April 26 a joint meeting led by the Student Body Vice President of Finance (SBVPF) between Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and Undergraduate Student Senate was held to ratify the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) slate for fiscal year 2019. The purpose of this meeting was to not only approve the JFC slate, but also to host student organizations’ second-round appeals for specific line items on their respective FY19 budgets.
Some of the organizations that attended were the CMU Club Swimming, Tepper Finance Group, Redeem Campus Fellowship, and the Figure Skating Team. The crux of the meeting consisted of the appeals brought forth by the organizations attending. The appeal process involved the SBVPF stating her reasons and defending the JFC’s allocation, while the appealing organizations gave their presentation on why they were appealing for a higher amount. From there, there was a two-minute question and answer session followed by a five-minute discussion session.
The whole meeting went smoothly without any major issues. The most important outcome was that each club and organization was properly allocated the amount they need to operate next year. One of the most fundamental principles of the student government at Carnegie Mellon is to ensure that the Student Activity Fee is distributed in a manner in which it benefits the community as a whole.

Jonathan Turley is one of the most cited law professors in the country right now. However, when he came to Carnegie Mellon this Thursday to give the seventh annual Thomas M. Kerr lecture on Law and American Society, he did not focus on a topic that directly pertains to the law; instead, he focused on what he saw as the extralegal suppression of free speech on college campuses.
The event took place in the Lee Gregg Lecture Hall, and the large room was filled almost to capacity, with professors taking an interest in what Professor Turley had to say and students seeking extra credit alike. Turley’s lecture was introduced by Joseph Devine, the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies at Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences and the advisor for the pre-law program, who spoke, as Turley did in his introduction, of the work of Thomas Kerr, the late Carnegie Mellon professor for which the lecture series was named, who was dubbed "Mr. Civil Liberties."
Turley began by discussing what he saw is a grave trend in European laws on how speech can be regulated. He found that European law “looks through the eyes of a person that was insulted,” where American law focuses on the rights of the speaker to speak. He gave examples of this sort of regulation that he found objectionable, from the attempted regulation of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo to Germany's prohibition of Nazi imagery or ideology. This talk came on the heels of a visit by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Congress about how the U.S. should follow Europe's lead in regulating false news on the internet. This exchange left Turley incredulous as “virtually every member of Congress [was] wildly applauding” for something that Turley felt amounted to censorship.
The threat to free speech in the United States was less pronounced, Turley found, but “pretty much where [he] think[s] the problem is growing” is in the area of campus free speech. "First, the problem is you," Turley found, before clarifying that he meant not the older members of the audience but the younger people that he felt were part of a generation that took free speech too lightly. He observed that while young people tended to say that they valued free speech, they would rank it lower when they were asked to weigh it against other values, like diversity. "If you put anything that’s not abstract against free speech or civil liberties, we lose."
His opinions are heavily informed by the fact that Turley is a staunch civil libertarian, something which he acknowledges that he is a bit of a "dinosaur" in regards to. One of his primary complaints is that this ideology is increasingly being rejected by young activists. Turley opined that “free speech is now being denounced as a form of oppression.” He, like many free speech absolutists, emphasizes that those who object to the speech being defended, which is often offensive and repugnant, don't understand that "we don’t need free speech to protect popular speech." Instead, the dangers to free speech happen "at the edges" with statements that people find distasteful or offensive.
Turley was asked about many of the hot-button issues of free speech today. While he had previously criticized platforms such as Facebook or Twitter for removing news they deem to be false and users who spread Neo-Nazi ideology, respectively, he found that it was also objectionable for the government to tell platforms what they could and could not remove.
When asked what he thought people on campuses should do to work against what Turley identified as repression of speech, he said that universities should send out letters like the one sent out by the dean of the University of Chicago, telling incoming students that the university would not provide "safe spaces" or shield students from any kind of free speech.
There are a lot of voices who think, like Turley, that suppressing any voices has darker, more insidious implications about free thought and discourse in society. There are also those that think there are some people with ideas so objectionable that giving them a platform to spread these ideas is unthinkable. The debate over speech on campus will doubtlessly be continued to be spurred by sporadic incidents of people trying to stop speakers, and committed civil libertarians like Turley who think that this behavior violates how discourse should be structured.

“People didn’t want any more diversity.”
That’s what David Gabriel, vice president of sales at Marvel, told ICv2 last year. While Gabriel later backtracked on his comments — he noted that female and diverse characters like a revamped Muslim-American teenager, Ms. Marvel, and a black Spider-Man, Miles Morales, were still some of the company’s most popular characters — this did not stop those affiliated with the movement #Comicsgate from continuing to harass diverse comic book artists and writers. In fact, Gabriel only made the movement worse.
Earlier this decade, Marvel Comics made some pretty big changes to some of their classic characters. Captain America was no longer the white, All-American boy Steve Rogers, but rather the black, still All-American Sam Wilson, previously known as “Falcon,” inheriting the title from Rogers. Thor is now a woman, with a dying Jane Foster taking over from an unworthy Odinson. In similar genderswaps, Captain Marvel was now female and the mantle of Wolverine was taken over by X-23, a teenage descendant of Logan, who previously held the moniker. Those changes were met with pretty steep division, and those vehemently opposed soon decided to take action and make their voice heard.
Starting in late 2017, #Comicsgate is a movement that’s been rising in power made up of comic book fans who “want quality comics without radical far left propaganda destroying the stories and sales of the books,” according to Urban Dictionary. It’s a horrifying child of the #Gamergate movement from 2014, a harassment campaign targeting women in the video game industry and put the ethics of video game journalism into question while trying to preserve the “gamer” identity. Similar to #Gamergate, #Comicsgate supporters continually troll comic book creators and artists who support increased diverse representation, including those of women, different races, and the LGBTQ+ community. Gabriel’s comment affirmed to these supporters that they were right and that they were carrying out some kind of good, God-sent work by continuing to bully female writers and other comic book creators off of Twitter-like middle school children. 
In addition to sending tweets to comic book creators that make playground insults look like Shakespeare, actions taken by #Comicsgate supporters include a blacklist of progressive writers in comics entitled “cancer in comics" and making a meme out of a Mockingbird comic cover in which the heroine wears a shirt saying “Ask me about my feminist agenda." Those with enough power in the comic book industry, such as Green Lantern writer Ethan Van Sciver, to nearly set up a cage match-like discussion on YouTube, despite saying that he wants “to bring peace through conversation.” To make matters worse, supporters claim that they’re the victims, claiming how “social justice warriors,” or SJWs, are equally harassing them on social media, calling them right-wing and Nazis.
It’s a conflict that easily feels like a mirror to November 2016, and it would be stupid to ignore the fact that politics play a huge role in #Comicsgate — and it’s pretty clear which side each group represents. It’s a statement that #Comicsgate supporters easily utilize in their tweetstorms towards comic book creators, and often cite as a reason for their allegiance to the movement. However, what’s incredibly hypocritical in this is that they instead retaliate and call SJWs themselves Nazis, describing #Comicsgate supporters as the Jews in peril. In the meantime, these supporters are further putting the lives of complete strangers, comic book creators, and their families at risk in pointed attacks against who they are and what they believe and stand for. However, in this conflict, there’s no winning authoritative figure, but rather just a whirlwind conflict of people versus people. In fact, the authority on this matter, comic book industry titans Marvel and DC, have stayed mostly silent and dismissive, which may be worse than having a Cheeto leading a country.
But why am I bringing this up now? There are two reasons.
It has been six months since Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assault allegations kick-started the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements across the country, calling for an end to and a greater accountability for sexual assault and harassment. It led to a rise of a proposed sixth wave of feminism, and the respect, courage, and bravery of women are all still growing today from it. It is appalling and confusing that a movement like this still somewhat permeates a geek sub-culture. It is alarming how, in a “rock-and-a-hard-place” situation where they are trying to please all possible markets of their audiences, Marvel and DC sit on the sidelines simply enforcing their own policies and not protecting their employees. This sixth wave of feminism that has arisen from the #MeToo movement should have led to the termination of a movement like #Comicsgate, but instead, it has continued to grow in the shadows.
Just this past weekend, a large portion of the world watched Avengers: Infinity War, or as the kids call it, “the most ambitious crossover event in history.” We’re watching ten years’ worth of Marvel Studios films pay off. We’re living in a period where superheroes and comic books are as popular as they ever have been. We’re seeing 27 different heroes duke it out against the most menacing villain they’ve ever faced, and you can’t deny the pretty solid amount of representation and diversity in this movie. On the diversity front, Marvel Studios has made a lot of progress since their days of three white Chrises. Comic books should still maintain that same progress. 
I watch and love these superhero movies and comics for many reasons, but the biggest reason is that they give me hope. They’re a form of escapism into a world where good can triumph over evil, amidst all conflict and strife. And seeing someone who looks like me conquer those obstacles and defeat the villains before her gives me that hope that I’m able to do that with the demons of my own personal life as well. It gives me a sense of belonging, comfort, and empowerment in a world where that feeling can be taken away all too easily. #Comicsgate goes against the very purpose of those comic books and superheroes that they’re defending by taking away that hope, belonging, comfort, and empowerment from comic book creators and fans, and supporters are only cementing themselves more in the reality that they’re trying to escape from rather than running away from it.

While Twitter has become one of the most popular mediums of communication for millennials nowadays, the situation is a little different when it comes to the President of the United States. Not only are his tweets an English teacher's nightmare, as Ruth Ben-Ghiat describes them in a CNN opinion piece, but they tend to be angry and full of political accusations. As an obsessive Middle-Eastern Twitter user, watching the transition from the Obama presidency to Trump’s has been interesting, to say the least; American politics have never been more accessible. 
One of the most significant things that Trump’s constant tweeting has done is take Middle Eastern involvement in American politics to a whole new level. Experiencing political changes in one of the world’s major powers hands-on and by the second is quite different from merely seeing it on the news. The fact that Trump frequently uses Twitter to make announcements and release statements makes it easier to understand how the political arena in the U.S. is changing straight from the source. This is not to say that reading hardly legible tweets is a good thing but having a clearer picture of events as they happen is useful to someone who lives halfway across the globe. Perks of globalization and weirdly capitalized tweets, you could say.
Another thing that is different because Trump uses Twitter so much is the extent to which we understand how the current President thinks and goes about life. It is one thing to listen to a president make official statements on television in a formal manner, but it is completely different to read daily tweets that give us insight and a deeper understanding of his mentality. I do not think that this kind of relationship would have been possible without globalization and the internet. It was just a few years ago that transparency was an alien concept when it came to country officials. This is not just important because the U.S. has so much influence all over the world, but especially because of its extensive involvement in the Middle East. The simplest and most recent example is when Trump first tweeted about the Gulf crisis and Qatar’s alleged funding of radical ideologies. This is particularly intriguing because the internet does not forget, and Trump, surprisingly enough, is now one of the major players in mediating between Qatar and the countries blockading it.
One more way that we can tell how Trump thinks through his tweets is his constant slander towards the Obama administration. While it is normal for a president to want to implement new changes and correct wrong decisions that he does not see as wise, it has not been known to be a very diplomatic move for one to tweet about it. On March 23, Trump tweeted about the Obama administration legalizing bump stocks. It does not matter whether they did, or they did not, or whether it was a good move or not, but describing it as a “BAD IDEA” is certainly not the kind of diplomacy the U.S. is used to from its presidents. It is therefore interesting for us as people living in the Middle East to keep track of how recent events are unfolding through such a convenient medium.
Something that Twitter users and non-users have equally heard about is the ongoing feud between Kim Jong-un and Trump. The way Trump tweeted about it by calling him a fat pig more than once has surely made history. If we were to contrast how this situation was handled on social media to how a similar one would have been, hypothetically, in the Obama presidency, the two are not even comparable. I think Trump’s Twitter would probably be a good thing to keep an eye on when anticipating a third world war.
Something that I think is very crucial for the world to know is how minorities are being treated under the new presidency. It is no surprise that Trump wanted to change policies concerning immigration, but his Twitter says a lot more about that. The things he talked about doing if he became president during the election, like the border wall, are actually coming to life. Even though many thought he was all talk, this kind of thing is not limited to the American people to know about because he openly discusses the wall and other immigration policies online. I think this is important because this kind of thing seems more fictional than realistic but when we actually see it coming to life, that changes how much we are willing to do about it.
The reason why this kind of "transparency" is important with a president like Trump circles back to the kind of irrational behavior he is known for. As someone who does not live in the U.S., Trump’s tweets act as the only outlet through which I can see the difference between his mentality and the U.S. foreign affairs. Otherwise, we would only get one side of the story. The boring one, that is. 
Another reason why keeping up with what Trump has to say (or tweet) is that despite him being controversial and whether we like it or not, he is influential. One example that can demonstrate this is how his Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries tweet tipped the scales and changed the market within seconds. All he had to say was that oil prices were artificially high and that is unacceptable.
Everything I talked about here, whether foreign or internal American affairs, is not limited in its effect to the U.S. Trump’s tweets might be offensive and ridiculous at times, but they sure do open up a window for the rest of the world to see what is going on in the U.S. They also provide quality content for sarcastic grammar-obsessed Twitter users, so I’m not complaining.

Conspiracies are usually things we laugh at. The claims are so often outlandish with little to no credible evidence supporting it. Whereas most of us can laugh off the absurdity of the theory claiming Katy Perry is secretly late child star JonBenet Ramsey, there are some that gain followers and turn sinister quickly. With the help of publicity, these can reach large audiences and blur the line between theory and reality.
Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist and founder of Infowars, has quite the imagination; he has theorized that the government manipulates weather and puts chemicals in the water that "turns the friggin' frogs gay." However, his theories have seeped their way into politics. His show heavily propagated the Birther movement, which questioned the legitimacy of Barack Obama's birth certificate, and the Pizzagate conspiracy, which claimed that Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, had emails that made way for several restaurants and ranking officials to create a child-sex ring. Both of these theories had strong effects on the 2016 presidential election.
In light of the heated gun control debate, he questioned the existence of school shootings. He denounced the 2017 Vegas shooting "as phony as a three dollar bill or as Obama's birth certificate." His most vocal conspiracy pertaining to gun violence is the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting and whether it actually occurred or not. Although he has been heavily criticized, three parents of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting have now sued Jones for defamation.
On one hand, it's easy to laugh at Jones angrily yelling and slamming papers on a desk and dismiss him as a lunatic. However, we must keep in mind that too many people in this nation actually accept what he says as truth. His theories raised skepticism that ultimately impacted many Americans' political actions and voting decisions. In June of 2017, political commentator and journalist Megyn Kelly hosted an interview with Jones on NBC.
Jones did not stop at Sandy Hook or Vegas to perpetrate conspiracies surrounding gun violence. In a now-deleted YouTube video, Jones claimed that the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland was a "false flag operation" carried out by the "deep state" to push for gun control. Furthermore, he claimed that the Parkland students were "crisis actors." Again, this is a claim that nobody should take any heed in. Unfortunately, this sparked violent threats against the survivors of the shooting who have been vocally supporting tougher gun restrictions.
I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment. Despite that, I do not find that believing freedom of speech contradicts finding Jones' accusation justified. Jones markets himself and his website as a news source. Had he been some YouTube blogger filming in his mother's basement and racking up thousands of subscribers, defamation would be debatable. However, Jones gets on the radio and presents himself as the "#1 Internet News Show in the World." If he wants to advertise his website and himself as such, he must have some sort of responsibility to provide credible information at least. Freedom of speech entails the freedom to voice one's opinion without censorship or government restriction. It does not warrant freedom from consequences, nor does it warrant freedom to say anything. Jones is not presenting his content as an opinion; he presents it as facts. He implements an unhealthy level of skepticism into his viewers, instilling fear of a sinister world taking advantage of an uneducated and misguided public.
Of course, having falsities in the news is somewhat inevitable, especially in light of how instantaneous the transfer of information has gotten. But what separates such falsities from fake news, such as that coming from Infowars, is that these falsities are usually quickly corrected due to a responsibility to provide factual information. Jones is not held accountable for the accuracy or credibility of his information, yet he is currently free to present his theories as factual content. Whether Jones truly believes in his theories or not is irrelevant; he is able to present them when there is irrefutable evidence against them and yet avoid liability for whatever his misinformation may have brought on.
Biased news is not inherently an impediment to freedom of speech either. Sure, it is detrimental to our polarizing political climate that we have content that appears to demonize the source's respective political leaning, but having some sort of political leaning in and of itself is not against the First Amendment. Yes, Jones definitely appeals to the far-right audience, but the fact that he garners support from the far-right does not make Infowars a fake news site that deserves to be held accountable for the damage of misinformation. If we had a commentator who accused countries with single-payer healthcare of feigning deaths to perpetrate conservatives' disapproval of single-payer healthcare, the same standard would apply to them. Infowars' content is not only partisan; it is factually wrong and deserving of the lawsuits it has already received and more.
Whether he will be found guilty is an entirely different question. More than likely, he will be found innocent by claiming that he was providing an alternative perspective that contrasts with that of traditional news sources. Regardless, the lawsuits and the publicity that Infowars garnered shows that freedom of speech has limits.

Attending Carnegie Mellon University isn’t cheap. If you live on campus and pay for full tuition and room and board, then you can expect to spend over a quarter of a million dollars for your Bachelor’s degree. This assumes, however, that you graduate in four years. Universities are required to report six-year rates, meaning that there is a non-negligible number of undergraduate students who could owe over $400,000, possibly without any form of financial aid or support. A substantial, though often overlooked, consequence of this financial burden is food insecurity, such as limited access to sufficient and nutritious food. 
Faced with a myriad of daily living expenses, at least 19 percent of Carnegie Mellon students, based on a 2018 study conducted by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, face food insecurity on a regular basis. On any given day of the week, nearly one in five students at Carnegie Mellon don’t know whether they will have a full meal. Imagine feeling pressured to choose between eating or paying a university fee, purchasing course materials, or simply doing laundry. Notably, campus food insecurity disproportionately affects historically underrepresented and minority groups, including Black, Hispanic and Latino, LGBTQ+, and first-generation students, and is often coupled with unstable housing situations. Living off pizza and ramen, as a common college trope, puts a light-hearted spin on students’ struggles. However, it masks the social and economic factors that explain why food insecurity exists on our campus in the first place, how it manifests, and why it affects some students more than others. More importantly, it trivializes the problematic realities of malnourishment and undernourishment that not only undermine our students’ academic performance and community-centered endeavors but also make them feel excluded from their own campus. 
As a university, we can take action to advocate on behalf of students facing financial precarity. Last November, our very own Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) garnered national attention about the financial burden that also impacts graduate students, some of whom earn incomes near the poverty line. On top of that, many students on government funding or particular visas are forbidden from working outside of their research to earn a livable income, which weighs on their ability to pay bills, make rent, and, for some, support a spouse or young children. Thankfully, the GSA amplified Carnegie Mellon students' voices both around the country and, especially, within the chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate about tax reforms that threatened the livelihoods of countless graduate students. Now, as we have done time and time again, dedicated Carnegie Mellon students have come together as the Basic Needs Working Group to propose and champion a burgeoning, and hopefully sustainable, set of initiatives to combat these issues.
The Basic Needs Working Group is a GSA-sponsored coalition of graduate and undergraduate students working to fight for our namesake: the basic needs of students at Carnegie Mellon. Together, we are working alongside student government and administrators to ensure that all students get to enjoy the best of the Carnegie Mellon experience, regardless of their socioeconomic status. For those of us with some form of social or economic privilege, we must make it our collective mission to awaken ourselves to the reality that some members of our campus community are disproportionately affected by university policies and national, state, and local politics. We ought to accept the charge of breaking the uncomfortable silence surrounding economic injustice. And most importantly, the vision of Basic Needs involves transforming our renewed consciousness into concrete action and sustainable policies that will support all of our students far into the future.
Upon our formation this semester, the Basic Needs Working Group proposed and advocated for the establishment of an on-campus food pantry. These efforts are a direct response to the dire fact that so many of us are forced to choose between basic needs like food and other academic or life expenditures. The Basic Needs Working Group together with a number of administrators on the newly-formed Campus Food Insecurity Committee have developed a recommendation to the university administration for the establishment of an on-campus food pantry. This recommendation brings us a step closer to eliminating food insecurity for the campus community.
With nationwide initiatives to increase the diversity of their student populations, universities cannot afford to overlook the intersection of socioeconomic status with multiple facets of individual student identities in their efforts to promote inclusion. We can neither afford to allow bureaucratic bottlenecks and barriers impede or extinguish the progress that our students have already made toward advocating for the health and well-being of our campus community. We must scrutinize our own university’s current policies and initiatives while continuing to work together as a community of students, staff, faculty, and administration by taking a critical perspective on the financial burden and food insecurity that mar the Carnegie Mellon student experience. 
If you want to get involved with raising awareness and advocating for the issues listed here, or any others that negatively impact the Carnegie Mellon student experience, you can email Sarah Pesi in the Basic Needs Working Group (spesi@andrew.cmu.edu) and Phoebe Dinh in Call to Action (pdinh@andrew.cmu.edu).

At the close of every year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and society at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the campus and our society.
A thistle to Marvel's 18th installment Black Panther for not only smashing numerous records at the box office but for taking the leap to provide audiences with a predominantly black cast, proving that there is a market for such diversity in film. Not only was it an important film, especially for this period in history, but it also gave us another amazing character to root for in the upcoming Infinity War.
A thorn to The Simpsons for the show's dismissive response the criticism over the character Apu, who has been called out for being a racist stereotype. Instead of acknowledging this, the show blamed it on PC culture and suggested it may never be dealt with. Come on.
A thistle to Kendrick Lamar for his masterful album DAMN. and for winning the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music. And another thistle to the Pulitzer Prize for finally acknowledging and awarding non-classical genres of music.
A thorn to the Grammys for ignoring hip-hop and gifting the Album of the Year award to Bruno Mars over Kendrick Lamar. 24K Magic is not a bad album, and Mars is clearly a very talented singer, but with this being the first year hip-hop has actually surpassed rock as the most popular genre, an album as powerful as Lamar's DAMN. deserved the award. 
A thistle to women everywhere! From marching for your rights to proudly proclaiming #MeToo and finding the strength to let your voices be heard, this was definitely a year that made great strides towards equality.
A thorn to the continuation of the Trump administration who stands directly opposed to a large part of our perceived national ideologies and underscoring the overlooked divide between the people of this country. 
A thistle to the Pennsylvania Supreme court's decision that their districts were indeed politically gerrymandered. This sets a precedent that will create a more representative democracy.
A thorn to current United States Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, for her dangerous decision to have teachers carry guns in schools and her continuous failure to be educated, factual, or considerate in the policy she passes.
A thistle to the students of Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL who took a stand against gun violence after the shooting at their school. By advocating for stricter gun control and organizing the March for Our Lives, the Parkland students have become inspiring leaders for the entire world.
A thorn to the Task Force on the CMU Experience, who announced that starting Fall 2018, the course drop deadline will move from ten weeks to six weeks, and the withdraw deadline from the last day of the semester to ten weeks. The changes take away some students' freedoms in their course schedules and add even more stress to their already excessively stressful lives. The changes also encourage students to stop trying new things or step out of their comfort zone because they don't have the safety net of a later drop deadline. The Task Force itself is problematic: of the 31 members, only four are actual students (two undergraduate, two graduate), and they do not represent all the colleges.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon student Rosana Guernica and her team for their relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. They have raised over $221,000 to date and continue to work to help the victims of the storm whose lives will never be the same.
A thorn to the former adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon who tweeted that he did not "spend a lot of time catering to struggling students" because it "diverts resources from those who are going to succeed and make a difference." His words sparked outrage and some very important conversations. 
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon’s response to the repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Not only did Carnegie Mellon give its open support for DACA and all "Dreamers", but it reassured its students of the university's administrative commitment to inclusivity in light of our current national administration. 
A thorn to the Carnival concert. I honestly didn't know that Com Truise was not Schlomo or Wale.
A thistle to the upcoming Tepper Quad for being nearly ready and for allowing more space to free up crowded buildings. Plus, it adds another beautiful building to the view downtown from campus! 
A thorn to the copper thief in the Tepper Quad. We know that copper is cool, but we all need the Tepper Quad finished ASAP so we can get at those new food places!
A thistle to the Wean Hall stairwell for adding some funky, colorful lights to liven up the formerly dreary ambiance. 
A thorn to this awful, unpredictable Pittsburgh weather which consistently confuses Pittburghers and non-Pittsburghers alike. Every time we think we have you figured out, you trick us once again with your fickleness. Get it together!
A thistle to the many scientific feats reached in the last year, from studying the effectiveness of opioid treatments to drawing brain maps of a moth’s sense of smell and everything in between.
A thorn to Larry Nassar, USA Gymnastics, and Michigan State University. Nassar for his despicable sexual abuse of countless young girls, and both USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University for turning a blind eye to his actions and his victims' complaints when he was in their employ.
A thistle to Farnam Jahanian for being named President of Carnegie Mellon University. We are lucky to have you and are eager to see the plans you have to improve the Carnegie Mellon community. 
A thorn to Facebook for giving user data to Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm that used the information to influence political campaigns around the world. This blatant breach of privacy made us all wonder how much we can trust companies with our data. 
A thistle to the longevity of Carnegie Mellon University, the CMU Children's School, and Academic Development. The first two celebrated their 50th anniversary, and the latter celebrated its 20th.
A thorn to the measles outbreak that happened at Carnegie Mellon. It wasn't even the fault of the weird anti-vaccine movement; the graduate student in question was vaccinated!
A thistle to our readers for trusting us to give them up-to-date information about important news on campus and beyond. Thanks for another great year!
