“It’s all about finding something you like and sticking with it,” distance runner George Degen said about balancing the academic rigors of Carnegie Mellon and athletic demands of his running lifestyle as we met in Doherty Hall. The senior chemical engineering major with a computer science minor has successfully balanced them so fluidly that those around him who haven’t quite yet mastered time management can only look on enviously.
The Madison, Wis. native first became interested in sports at young age, adopting soccer as his fall sport from kindergarten to ninth grade in addition to tennis in the spring. After failing to make the soccer team for 10th grade, he quickly found a new home with the cross-country team, where the strong team atmosphere helped him realize his passion for running. “I wasn’t that good in high school,” he readily admitted. “Out of the seven guys good enough to make varsity, I’d always be the eighth.” Nonetheless, he found great satisfaction running with the team and hoped to continue doing so beyond high school.
He considers himself very lucky that Carnegie Mellon had everything that perfectly suited his needs, even if it did so in completely unexpected ways. His initial considerations revolved around a strong engineering program outside his hometown where he could explore beyond the bounds of his prior experiences. Although sports weren’t a factor for him in deciding where to go to college, he found the school atmosphere and athletics program at Carnegie Mellon very favorable for what he wanted to get out of both academics and athletics. His relationship with his fellow teammates is very tight knit. “Living with them is great,” Degen said, “since we have the same schedule.” Obviously, this includes a lot of running time during which they have ample time to talk about anything.
Degen considers his role in the men’s cross-country team’s victory in regionals last year his proudest accomplishment in sports. “It felt great getting that win for Coach Donnatelli,” he said. “Since it was his last year, it felt right that he could go out on top.” Degen credits the coaching staff for being an integral part of keeping the team together. He has praised Gary Aldrich for running the team in the interim with only two other assistant coaches.
Beyond sports, Degen is proud to be able to balance the academic rigors of Carnegie Mellon, including his involvement in research, and his dedication to athletics with the people he considers to be part of a really fun team. “It’s a lot easier to keep up with something when you actually like and have friends that like it too.”
As he looks toward the future, he knows that running will certainly be a part of everything he does. With plans to go to graduate school, he wants to continue running either on a club team or through using his final season of collegiate eligibility. “I’ll keep running until I keel over,” he summed up.

It is no easy feat to captain a team from a slump to back-to-back home wins. What makes this accomplishment even more eye-popping is that the last back-to-back home wins occurred 5 years ago, and this time around, both games were won by double digits against teams that are highly ranked. For senior guard Seth Cordts, doing all of the above was not impressive enough, as he went on to be the leading scorer in both games. In his time off from being a basketball hero, Cordts is on the verge of completing his B.S. in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering — a degree that in and of itself is a phenomenal undertaking.
Cordts’ foray into sports began way back in the second grade in his elementary school league with baseball, soccer, and basketball. Soccer piqued Cordts’ interest for his first few years, but he eventually succumbed to the influence of his older sister and her own basketball exploits. By the sixth grade Cordts was reporting to a school coach, having been coached by his dad up to that point. He greatly credits his first school coach for providing him with a strong foundation in the sport. This foundation is visible in Cordts’ incredible fundamental understanding of the game and the strength of his base skills. Cordts basketball journey had begun and much like his shooting streaks, there is no stopping him once he starts.
Meanwhile, Cordts’ interest in technical hands-on projects was pushing him down the mechanical engineering track. Consequentially, watching his sisters incur basketball injuries (like torn ACLs), he began to wonder about the ability of technology to help people recover from sports injuries. As one can see, Cordts was not just concerned about his impact on the court, and always focused on developing all aspects of his personality.
Simultaneously, his improvement over the years was almost magical. He went on to play varsity basketball at the high school level for Souhegan High School in New Hampshire. He capped his colorful high school career by being appointed to captain of the varsity team and voted to the First Team All-State. Cordts turned heads with his basketball prowess and one of the heads that he turned just happened to be Carnegie Mellon’s then-assistant basketball coach Justin Jennings. It was during a “Hoop Group” showcase that Coach Jennings spotted Cordts and recognized his immense potential. Jennings approached Cordts and they talked about basketball at Carnegie Mellon. It was from then on that Cordts started looking at Carnegie Mellon as a strong option to pursue his education and basketball.
It is common knowledge that college basketball is faster, more physical, and a lot more competitive than high school basketball. Cordts, however, did not shy away from the challenge, and exhibited great tenacity in his freshman year by sticking with the sport and changing the way he played to become a more dominant figure on the court. He also did not give up on his desire to use technology for the betterment of athletes and began pursuing his dual major in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering. As usual, Cordts would be active in all spheres of his life and when asked about his favorite memories at Carnegie Mellon (barring the dazzling memories he has on the court) his mind jumps to all the times he went paint balling and white water rafting with his friends.
Although Coach Jennings was no longer at Carnegie Mellon when Cordts arrived, Cordts found a mentor in Carnegie Mellon’s then-assistant coach Andrew Garcia. Coach Garcia helped Cordts understand his role on the team and the importance of leadership. This was reinforced by the example that Cordts’ seniors set, and, when coupled with his work ethic and dedication, his tremendous success as the Tartans’ captain comes as no surprise. Cordts’ relationship with fellow teammate and roommate Matthew Loebbaka has been a mutually nurturing one and is one that Cordts deeply treasures. As teammates, they support each other on and off the court and as roommates they share a connection that goes beyond basketball well into other areas of college life.
When asked about how he manages basketball alongside his double major Cordts explained the importance of time management and of avoiding mixing one with the other. According to Cordts, wins and losses on the court make it hard to focus on the week’s homework and vice-versa, so he tries to keep a divide between them mentally. It is no secret that at Carnegie Mellon the burden of work increases exponentially as one climbs from freshman year to senior year. Therefore it is only natural to expect basketball to take a back seat more often in later years. Yet Cordts went from scoring 6 points in his freshman year to scoring 363 points this year (and the season is still not over). While these numbers have some great stories behind them, the one that Cordts holds most dear is the story of his away game at New York University last year. Having shot 100 percent from behind the arc, Cordts shot the game-tying three points with seconds left on the clock, in front of a massive audience. It’s obvious now why Cordts’ favorite drill during practice is the shootout between the guards and the centers, and for the first team to get 10 baskets from the elbow, wing, baseline and behind the arc.
Cordts has had multiple pillars of support and motivation over the years. Having numerous siblings that play basketball alongside a supportive and loving family has kept Cordts on track even during the toughest of times. Cordts’ father flies out from New Hampshire to watch every game, acting as a great source of reassurance for Cordts, who also spends hours off the court talking to his dad about basketball and life. Cordts has always looked up to his idol Kevin Garnett, forward and center for the Brooklyn Nets, for his passion about the game and the reasons that he plays it. Cordts’ high school coach Sudi Lett was a huge influence and his words of “Do your best and leave the rest” will forever instill confidence in Cordts in his personal abilities.
While this season has had its ups and downs — the Tartans have gone from winning against ranked universities to losing to weaker universities — Cordts has done his best to keep his head down and pull his team through, and indeed he has done a marvelous job. It has been a pleasure to follow his basketball journey, and if the past is any indication, he will keep rising as a person and as a player.

As each season comes to a close, NFL coaches fly around the league’s sidelines as teams attempt to find a new face to manage their personnel. This year was no different, as seven teams will begin the 2015 season with a new head coach. The various hires are listed here from worst hire to best.
Denver Broncos: Gary Kubiak
Most recent job: Offensive Coordinator (OC), Baltimore Ravens; Career wins-losses as a head coach: 61–64
This hire is somewhat confusing. The Broncos might be preparing for a future without quarterback Peyton Manning as we once knew him, but none of the Bronco’s personnel is proven in Kubiak’s zone blocking scheme, and the team was built to pass anyways. The Broncos’ success waned rapidly as they shifted to a running-focused attack at the end of last season, culminating in a playoff loss to the vastly inferior Indianapolis Colts. Now they hired a coach who is known for his running strategy and not much else. This hire is just confusing.
Chicago Bears: John Fox
Head Coach (HC), Denver Broncos; 118–89
John Fox clearly has a knack for developing defensive talent, which makes him quite a good fit with Chicago’s barren roster in a vacuum. The Panthers and Broncos teams both improved vastly on defense every season with him at the helm. The problem here is with John Fox on the sideline: he is absolutely atrocious as a game manager. He consistently makes needlessly conservative play calls that have cost his teams high profile games (re-watch the Broncos vs. Ravens playoff game from 2013 and try not to cringe as Fox attempts to run the clock out rather than have Peyton Manning try for the win). He is a mess with the timeouts, often burning them to do things like ice kickers rather than strategically stop the clock or substitute players on the field. Fox also tends to challenge at horrible moments, seemingly throwing his challenge flag the first two times he disagrees with a call rather than waiting for high leverage moments with lots of yards involved where winning the challenge might actually matter. Given this Bears’ team’s defensive woes, John Fox was probably a decent hire, but not a good one.
San Francisco 49ers: Adam Tomsula
Defensive Coordinator (DC), San Francisco 49ers
This is a sensible hire. It is unfortunate that we don’t get to see Jim Harbaugh’s creativity and exquisite abilities for player development in the NFL anymore, but his relationship with the front office broke down so publicly and uncomfortably that a change was probably necessary. 
Tomsula is a solid defensive coordinator, consistently developing talent and putting together a string of successful seasons. Many of the players who leave the 49ers defense, such as Buccaneers safety Dashon Goldson and Browns safety Donte Whitner, go flame out on lesser teams, so he seems to understand how to maximize a player’s talent. We know nothing about his offensive acumen, and historically there is a learning curve for coordinators in their first head coaching job. However, hiring in-house means there will be some continuity and there’s certainly potential for this decision to look very good very quickly.
Atlanta Falcons: Dan Quinn
DC, Seattle Seahawks
There are certainly things to like about Quinn’s head coaching potential. He is a fantastic play caller, and has a plethora of signature games to point to if one questions his defensive strategies, including Super Bowl XLVIII. This has the potential to be a great coaching hire, since the Falcons have some defensive talent in players like cornerback Desmond Trufant, just not enough to build a functional NFL defense. The Falcons will improve vastly if Dan Quinn is merely a bad coach, as former head coach Mike Smith had to be the worst tactician in the NFL, constantly blowing every single opportunity he had to change the game from the sidelines. The problem here is that Quinn succeeded with a very specific team building style in Seattle. Atlanta does not have close to a similar roster. Quinn will presumably continue to be excellent from the sidelines, but it’s possible that his schemes may be an awkward fit for a year or two.
New York Jets: Todd Bowles
DC, Arizona Cardinals
Todd Bowles just turned in a season for the ages with Arizona. Defensive talent dropped like flies, as the Cardinals were probably at less than 50 percent strength for most of the season. However, for the first ten weeks of the year, Bowles ran one of the three best defenses in the league. This shows schematic flexibility and a keen eye for reaction. While the Jets have not had a functional offense since quarterback Brett Favre spent a year in green, the defense was actually a bigger problem last year. There is absolutely no talent on the roster defensively outside of defensive linemen Sheldon Richardson and Mohammed Wilkerson. Bowles’s success with unfamiliar faces could help rebuild the defense, making it much easier to create an offense.
Oakland Raiders: Jack Del Rio
DC, Denver Broncos; 68–71
The future in Oakland is… bright? Jack Del Rio does not get enough credit for how great of a job he did in Jacksonville. If it weren’t for an unfortunate injury in week 17 to quarterback David Garrard, Del Rio would have reached the playoffs in three consecutive years with the moribund franchise. 
Del Rio managed to build top ten defenses nearly every year there, and the offenses were functional if not great. People forget how great those 2007 Jaguars were, and that at halftime it felt like they might topple the mighty and undefeated Patriots. The 2005 Jaguars were a great team as well, and these squads always seemed as if they were teetering on the precipice of something great while producing tons of productive players including players with very little pedigree before entering the NFL.  This bodes well for Oakland, which has a fairly young core of talent.
Now, Del Rio, who is particularly good at coaching linebackers, will have young linebackers Khalil Mack and Sio Moore under his tutelage. Both are among the NFL’s most productive linebackers despite being very unpolished. There’s no reason to believe Del Rio can’t turn that raw talent into superstardom. Add in his success at turning mediocre talents like Garrard into decent contributors, and there is potential that Del Rio can turn quarterback Derek Carr, who was better than most give him credit for in a bumpy rookie season, into something special.
Del Rio could take this franchise in the right direction for the first time in over a decade.
Buffalo Bills: Rex Ryan
HC, New York Jets; 46–50
Ryan really got the short end of the stick at the Meadowlands. He was scapegoated as a reason for the Jets’ offensive woes, and his boisterousness with the media got him publicly labeled as a distraction. Of course, neither of these things make sense. Ryan was largely frozen out of personnel decisions, and he never even had an average team. The two Jets teams he dragged to the AFC Championship Game were mediocre squads at best, optimized by Ryan’s defensive schemes. 
Ryan catches lots of flak for not being able to develop a Jets’ franchise quarterback, but it is hard to see his options approaching that label. For what it’s worth, quarterback Mark Sanchez was slightly more productive in New York than he was under supposed quarterback guru Chip Kelly in Philadelphia. Don’t let Ryan’s record fool you: an average coach would probably top out at six wins per year rather than eight with the talent Ryan was given, and this year’s Jets team might’ve been one of the least talented in league history. This Bills team in particular, however, is a much better version of the 2010 Jets Rex Ryan coached so successfully. 
A more talented run game and defense will help disguise the lack of a solid quarterback, as will wide receiver Sammy Watkins, who is very talented. Ryan’s hire is exciting for an improving Bills team.

Men’s Basketball
Friday night, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team traveled to Brandeis University as they continued their University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play. Despite coming off of a strong home stand where the men went 2–0, the Tartans fell behind in the opening minute and never fully recovered as they went on to lose 68–57.
After a 3 pointer by sophomore forward Jack Serbin cut the lead back to 2, keeping the Judges from pulling too far away in the opening minutes, Brandeis went on 10–0 run with the next Tartan basket not coming until half way through the period with a layup by sophomore center Chris Shkil. From there Carnegie Mellon was able to fight back and keep the game close, cutting the deficit to 3 before a Judges’ 3 pointer pushed the halftime differential to 6.
In the second half the Tartans kept fighting and the game to single digit. With just over 8 minutes to go in the game, senior guard Seth Cordts had a chance to tie the game with a three pointer but couldn’t connect. After the miss and ensuing 3 points by Brandeis, the Tartans were never able to get it back to a one possession game, and with the Judges making their free throws down the stretch while the Tartans were chucking up desperation 3s, the deficit ballooned back to double digits. Serbin lead the team with 18 points while Cordts and Shkil both had double digit contributions.
The loss dropped Carnegie Mellon to 3–7 in UAA play and 12–9 on the season. 
The Tartans played New York University on Sunday. They will return home for their final home stand starting Friday against Rochester at 8 p.m.
Track & Field
While the rest of campus was enjoying a wintry Valentine’s Day, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams were competing in the Dragon Open hosted by Tiffin University.
On the men’s side, their domination in the distance runs continued with senior Thomas Vandenberg winning the 800 meters with a time of 1:53.70, 6 seconds faster than second place while junior Thomas Mayo-Smith finished third, crossing the line at the 2:02.99 mark.
In the mile run, the Tartans took 2nd–5th with senior George Degen, first-year Ryan Auld, senior Eamon Cullinane, and master’s student Elliot Watson finishing with times of 4:25.38, 4:27.86, 4:30.25, and 4:32.41 respectively. To finish of the distance domination, Carnegie Mellon swept the top three in the 3000 meter run with sophomore Ryan Archer, senior Joseph Pane and junior Brian Bollens crossing the line at the 8:50.40, 8:53.80 and 8:58.04 marks respectively, all of which were over 30 seconds faster than the next finisher. In the 4x400 meter relay the Tartans A team took 2nd with a time of 3:33.44.
On the field side, it was bit tougher going for Carnegie Mellon with the only top finishes coming from a pair of first-years, Shane Conton and Eloy Fernandez, in the Triple Jump, finishing 3rd and 4th with distances of 12.69 meter and 12.14 meter respectively.
For the women, the first win came in the 400 meter with first-year Sarah Cook’s time of 1:00.16. Senior Erin Kiekhaefer followed up with a top place finish in the mile run with a time of 5:17.61 while senior Sara Kelly took 3rd with a time of 5:27.35.
Not to be upstaged by the men, the women took the top four spots in the 3000 meters, with a trio of juniors, Zofia Tillman, Sophie Lohmann and Kira Ragazzo, along with first-year Aparna Alavilli finishing with times of 10:47.13, 10:57.04, 11:06.99 and 11:12.71 respectively.
In the field events, sophomore Rebecca Fortner tied for third in the high jump, clearing the 1.60 meter bar, and senior Sasha Spalding set a school record in the long jump with her winning distance of 5.31 m.
Both teams will next compete Friday at Ohio State University.
Women’s Basketball
Traveling to Brandeis on Friday night, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team hoped to break out of their funk in UAA play, having lost their last 5 conference games. Unfortunately, despite a record setting 10 blocks and near triple double (18 points, 9 rebounds and 10 blocks) by sophomore center Lisa Murphy, the Tartans still fell in defeat to the Judges, 59–44.
Both teams started out cold in the first half with a Brandeis three being the only made shot from the field for the first 5 minutes. Problematically for the Tartans, the Judges heated up well before Carnegie Mellon thawed and quickly jumped out to an 11 point lead before junior forward Liza Otto and Murphy combined for 7 straight points to cut the deficit back down to size. Brandeis countered with another run and only a three by first-year guard Anna Novak with just over a minute to go kept the game at single digits going into half, 27-18.
In the second half, the two teams battled back and forth with the Tartans cutting the margin to as low as 4 and the Judges pushing it to as large as 14, before completely dominating Carnegie Mellon down the stretch and pushing the lead, and final margin of victory to 15.
With the loss, the Tartans are now 2-8 in UAA play and 11-10 on the season. The women played New York University Sunday to finish out the road trip and play their last home games of the season starting this Friday at 6 pm against Rochester. 
Tennis
Carnegie Mellon’s 9th ranked men and 7th ranked women tennis teams faced off against Division I opponent St. Francis. The men won 4-3, while the women won 5-2.
The men started off strong with all three teams winning doubles to take the first point, before battling in singles. Seniors Will Duncan and  Christian Heaney-Secord won their doubles match 8-5, as did sophomore Jack Kasbeer and first year Matt Seifert.  Senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar finished off the doubles match sweep 8-6. 
Heaney-Secord then won his singles match in straight sets 6-1, 6-3 while sophomore Kunal Wadwani won 6-1, 6-4. First year Tommy Cheng took the tie breaking match 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 to guarantee the Tartans the victory after Duncan had to retire from his match due to injury.
For the women’s match, Carnegie Mellon also started with a sweep of the doubles to take the first point but kept the match out of reach of St. Francis by dominating singles. In doubles, senior Bryn Raschke and first year Cori Sidell won the first match 8-4 while sophomore Vanessa Pravia and first year Stacy Chang knocked out their competition 8-3. Senior Angela Pratt and sophomore Nicholle Torres needed a bit more work to win their match but pulled it out 8-7 (7-1).
Torres then dominated her match winning in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0.  Pavia and Raschke also won in straight sets, although each required a tiebreaker in the first, 7-6 (7-0), 6-2 for Pavia and 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 for Raschke.
The men improved to 4-2 on the early spring season and will next compete in the ITA National Team Indoor Championship on Friday. The women moved to 5-1 for the spring and will next face Division II opponent California University of Pennsylvania on Saturday.

Starting Thursday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships hosted by Emory University. The championships were not only about team placement, but provided a top opportunity for many of the individuals to provisionally qualify for NCAA Division III (DIII) national meet based on the top time of the season, which will mostly come when pushed by some of the top competitors in the country.
On Thursday, first-year Emma Shi took third place in the 200 yard IM with a time of 2:06.32, which earned her All-UAA honors and provisional qualification. Sophomore Machika Kaku also finished third in her event, the 3-meter dive, with a score of 385.90. Sophomore Brian Walsh won the B finals heat in the 500-yard freestyle with a provisionally qualifying time of 4:33.89, his new career best. Junior Steven Geier, who finished third in the same B final, also provisionally qualified with a time of 4:33.99, a new career best for him as well.
In the 400 meter medley relay, the Carnegie Mellon women’s A team of junior Kira Singhaus, first-year Kim Hochstedler, sophomore Gillian Crews and sophomore Allison Kirkby finished fourth with a time of 3:50.19 which provisionally qualifies them for nationals. The men’s A team finished 5th in their heat with a time of 3:22.95, also provisionally qualifying behind first-years Michael Dibacco, Matt Chu, and Kevin Steinhouse along with Walsh. The 200-yard freestyle relay team of Shi, Kirkby, Crews and first-year Tiana Marrese broke the school record set last year at UAA championship with a time of 1:36.91 but finished 6th.
Friday started off strong for the Tartans as the 200-yard medley relay team of Singhaus, junior Felicia Wang, Crews and Kirkby finished 4th with a time of 1:45.22 and provisionally qualified for nationals while setting a new school record. The men’s 200-yard medley relay team followed suit with senior Josh Lucheon, Chu, sophomore Sivan Mehta, and Steinhouse placing fifth with a time of 1:31.00 and also provisionally qualified while breaking their own school record set earlier this year.
In the 400-yard IM first-year Mary St. John and Shi both provisionally qualified for nationals with times of 4:32.36 and 4:28.89 respectively, with Shi winning her B finals heat. Junior Matthew Nielson also provisionally qualified on the men’s side in the 400-yard IM with a B finals victory with a time of 4:02.98.
Crews kept adding to her great weekend with a 4th place finish in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 56.10 provisionally qualified in yet another event, along with setting a new school record while Walsh matched Crews in the same event, setting a new school record with a time of 49.34 for a fourth place finish and provisionally qualifying as well.
In the 200-yard freestyle, Geier provisionally qualified for another event with a time of 1:40.72 ad a 4th place finish, while in the 100-yard breaststroke Chu and Hochstedler won their respective B final heats and each provisionally qualified for nationals with times of 56.52 and 1:05.21 respectively. Walsh, Geier, Nielsen and Taekman finished the day strong for the Tartans taking 4th in the 800-yard freestyle relay and provisionally qualifying with a time of 6:48.66.
Saturday was the final day of the championships and the Tartans wanted to go out on a high note.
Kaku added a second place finish to her great diving weekend as she scored 398.20 in the 1-meter and earned All-UAA honors, while DiBacco placed third in the 200-yard backstroke earning him All-UAA honors with his time of 1:50.57, and both he and Geier, who finished fourth with a time of 1:52.77, provisionally qualified for nationals in the event.

Since its founding in 1900, Carnegie Mellon University has become home to seven independent colleges with esteemed programs ranging from the sciences to the fine arts. Yet even with the availability of interdisciplinary programs, many Carnegie Mellon students find it hard to branch out of their college. At the same time, the solutions to many real-world issues — from climate change to educational gaps — require the use of skills that span disciplines.
This issue helped to create the vision behind CMU Idea [Space], a competition that started last Friday and lasted through Sunday. In its first year, the competition brought together many Carnegie Mellon graduate student participants, representing all seven schools, as well as numerous judges and volunteers. The event was designed so that participants had the opportunity to meet new people, particularly students from different colleges.
Prior to the competition, participants were given the chance to submit problem statements for the competition on Reddit, which served as an online voting system. After a reception and lecture at the Posner Center, located in the Tepper School of Business, those participants had the chance to present their problem statements to the entire group. Groups of participants from different colleges were formed based on the ideas that had interested them most. Over the weekend, members of groups collaborated in creating a solution that incorporated multiple disciplines. Students were also allowed to receive help from mentors and other outside sources, provided that they do their own work.
“I want people be creative,” said Alex Brown, a master’s student in business administration, who served as the founder and lead coordinator of the event. “We don’t provide any guidelines on what the deliverable needs to be, which could be anything from an mobile application, to a mock toy, to a powerpoint presentation.”
Kera Bartlett, a fellow MBA student, was asked by Brown to the project manager of the event. “I think it’s very important to be open minded and realize that you have one way of looking at an issue or a problem. Your way may be very different from the views of people on your team,” Bartlett said. “So it’s also important to not get too attached to your perspective.”
In fact, the challenges in facilitating such collaboration between students of different programs was what Alex had in mind for the event.
“One of the things that I’ve worked on while I was a president was trying to figure out ways for Tepper School of Business kids to develop relationships with other schools,” Brown continued. “I realized, during the process, that other schools had similar concerns or similar experiences as Tepper.”
In the past, Brown was awarded two grants from the ProSEED Crosswalk, a Carnegie Mellon program designed to encourage development of ideas in their early stages. “One of the grants was for developing a new competition with the objective to bring graduate students closer together,” said Brown. “So once the grant was approved, I started planning and just last year I developed a team to for the event. We decided what would be the best thing to work on, and we started throwing ideas out of how it would work.”
Collaboration for the event had occurred months before February, including over winter break. Throughout those months, Brown was able to find like-minded students from Tepper’s two-year MBA program to help tackle the project, including Bartlett. 
Despite a tight deadline, the planning team was able to find sponsors that were eager to support their goal. These sponsors helped to fund the monetary prizes for the top three teams. In addition, UpPrize, a collaboration between BNY Mellon and the Forbes Fund, provided a million dollar incentive, which would be awarded sometime after the event, for a team that was serious about taking their projects to the next level.
“If some of the fruitful projects come from our competition, they can turn into something that becomes materialized down the road, because of the partnership we developed with our sponsors,” Brown explained. Some of the judges also came from these sponsors, including Matt Zieger of the Forbes Fund, who served as a guest speaker and judge.
On the last day of the event, participants could continue working on their project until the submission deadline of 11:30 a.m. After lunch and another guest speaker, the teams had the chance to bring their projects to the spotlight. During the presentations, judges scored the team based on how innovative and holistic each solution was.
The event produced a wide range of interesting projects. One of the teams mapped a way for cheap and highly efficient renewable energy to be generated from garbage and landfill waste. Max Kiefer, who was one of the members of the team, had actually submitted the idea on Reddit. Kiefer studies environmental science in the Mellon College of Science.
“Initially I had developed the idea beforehand, for my company. Some of the initial challenges were finding ways to create energy from toxic and pollutant gases. Also, we had to figure out what we were going to do with the gases after they have been used for energy purposes” explained Kiefer.
With the knowledge and problem-solving skills that each problem statement demanded, many participants had found the event to be a meaningful academic and social experience.
A mother as well as student at Tepper, Jin Zhang was able to bring her passion of improving math education to the event. Although her group had only two members, Zhang and Garrett Hemann, also from Tepper, it won third place. They advocated for the improvement and increased availability of apps and toys that would help children start learning math before preschool. 
“The result of this event was fabulous. Everyone probably worked day-and-night. For me, the event helped me to network with people, and shop my idea.” said Jin. “This event was also a great way for me to see the ideas that other people had.”
A Heinz College student, Pavneet Singh Kochhar, and his team worked on creating automated cleaning and maintenance of solar panels, which often accumulate dust that reduce the efficiency of its function. 
“It was a good learning opportunity for all of us.” said Kochhar. “It gives us an opportunity to mingle with different people from all over campus. You could be here for six months, and still not know so many people.”
With the enthusiasm of this year’s participants, it’s no wonder that the organizers of the event intend on continuing CMU Idea [Space] next year, with plans of having having some of the current participants join the planning team of 2016.
“It’s a fun way to spend the weekend,” Bartlett said. “It’s very intellectually challenging and it stretches our comfort zones in terms of working with people from a lot of different backgrounds.”

“Climate change is a serious concern, and we should be doing everything with can to mitigate it. In the case where mitigation is not possible, we must adapt,” said Paulina Jaramillo, assistant professor of Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) at Carnegie Mellon. Jaramillo and her team of researchers were recently awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to identify the risks of climate change on infrastructure. Their hope is to identify ways to mitigate that risk in hope of developing a sustainable energy system. 
In recent years, increased governmental funding and global awareness has lead to strides towards reducing our carbon footprint and decreasing our dependence on non-renewable resources. Despite this, humans continue to release carbon into the atmosphere and due to its long half life, it will remain in the atmosphere for a significant time. As carbon becomes more abundant in the atmosphere, the earth’s climate with respond accordingly, leading to extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts. 
These changes have the potential to negatively impact the current energy infrastructure. 
Jaramillo is the lead investigator on a project that will focus on power systems in the southeastern United States to identify and mitigate this risk. She explained that climatologists predict that drought will increase and water availability will impact precipitation patterns in the area. 
By collaborating with researchers at the hydroclimatology center at the University of Washington, Jaramillo believes that this unique partnership will provide insight into the risks posed by climate change. She proudly expressed how rare it is to see hydroclimatologists working with power systems engineers and credits the interdisciplinary culture at Carnegie Mellon for encouraging her and her colleagues to expand beyond their discipline. 
In addition, the team will be collaborating with experts on water infrastructure management at George Washington University. 
After developing models of the components and constraints of the current power system, the team hopes to use their hydroclimatology expertise to shock the system and understand its effects. 
The availability of water can impact the energy production by hydroelectric dams and also the cooling methods used at thermal and nuclear power plants. Their models will allow them to test a variety of scenarios without having to directly impact a functional system that provides power to hundred of homes and businesses. 
Jaramillo’s previous work involved the affects of renewable resources on infrastructure. She believes that these methods of energy production can serve as a mitigation strategy since wind and solar technologies do not depend on water availablility. 
In addition to mitigating risk, Jamiillo explained that their project “includes a social science component that involves many stakeholders and identifying how they perceive the risk and their plan to manage it moving forward.” 
Stakeholders include, but are not limited to, power plant operators, grid operators, investors, and asset owners, some who Jaramillo stated “may not even be thinking about the risk involved.”
The project recently received its funding and expects to be drawn out over the next three years. Jaramillo and her team of researchers aim to report their findings in peer-review journals as well as attend conferences to share their results directly to many of the stakeholders. Many of her team members are involved with the United States Association for Energy Economics (USAEE), which plans to have its annual North American Conference in Pittsburgh this year. 
Jaramillo believes that with regard to infrastructure, the general public relates to bridges that were built years ago. Identifying how to maintain them si currently a hot topic. Conversely, energy infrastructure has a much smaller lifespan, and with the impact of new legislation, many power plants and similar structures will soon become outdated. Thus, in addition to maintaining the current infrastructure, “the growing demand leads to the opportunity for new assets,” she said.
By analyzing the risk involved, Dr. Jaramillo and her team hope to determine and devise the most strategic plan to mitigate the risk as the energy sector evolves and expands into a future clouded by the risk of climate change.

On Charles Darwin’s 206th birthday, Pugwash attended a Humanist League lecture where science writer Chip Walter discussed human evolution. Evolution was very controversial during Darwin’s era. Like all novel discoveries that contradict pre-existing ideas, the theory of evolution offended many people, particularly those whose religious beliefs led them to believe in creationism: the theory that God created the earth and human existence in seven days. However, the theory persevered through the decades.  
The first question Walter answered was, “Why are we here?” There have been 27 recorded species of human on the planet since its creation. However, the only species to survive was Homo sapiens sapiens, humans as we know them today. Many people believe that today’s humans are the result of a long chain of evolutionary development that spans several species. Aristotle called this the “chain of being” where each species did not have contemporaries, but led to the next, more developed set of humans. There is evidence today to prove this is not true. In fact, different human species competed for much of their existence resulting in Homo sapiens coming out on top. 
What is even more strange is that Homo sapiens were neither the strongest nor the smartest human species during a time in which others existed. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that Neanderthals were larger and had larger brains. However, human nature supported the formation of small groups that were good at communicating, which meant that the group could survive as a whole. Walter proposed that the most important invention of humankind is the symbol. Humans are unique in that we are good at communicating with one another, and symbols — such as art and characters — allow people to express their thoughts in even more ways. 
Walter then stressed the importance of the discovery and study of evolution. Not only does it allow us to learn about our past, but it can help us make advances in the future. Knowing how humans developed communication, creativity, and emotions is vital to understanding how to improve our future. Humans are capable of complex thoughts, and Walter emphasized that we should use this ability to learn from our mistakes and see how we can improve humanity as a whole. Walter also pointed out that traces of Neanderthal and other extinct human species remain in our genes, which shows that evolution is still affecting us in the modern world.
Despite hundreds of years of research into evolution, creationism and anti-evolution theories are taught in public schools. Walter stressed that learning about the history of evolution is important in understanding who we are today. Do people who reject the theory of evolution have an enormous gap in their education? Should we cease the teaching of creationism and similar theories, or do we give people the freedom to believe what they want to despite overwhelming scientific proof that their theories are incorrect?

How is money made today? Why does money have that distinctive “dollar smell”? Why does a $1 bill feel different from normal paper? Many people have pondered these questions, but few actually know the answers. Currency circulation is a critical part of a country’s economy. The U.S. dollar (USD), an internationally recognized currency, plays an especially important role in people’s daily lives. Yet the question remains: Who prints money, and how?
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (DOT), is one of the largest currency printing operations in the world. It was founded in 1862, when currency was printed and separated by hand-cranked machines, but modern technology has enabled a far more efficient and secure way to do this. The notes have been redesigned over the past decades so that they not only retain the traditional American look and feel, but also contain an increasingly sophisticated portrait watermark and a 3-D security ribbon to prevent counterfeit notes in circulation.
The ordinary paper that we use for printers or newspapers is made of wood pulp. Pulping breaks down the bulk structure of the fiber source into constituent fibers, a desired attribute for papermaking.  The thick fiber board can then be shipped to a paper mill for further processing. 
However, the paper and ink used in the production of USD bills is as distinct as its design. Currency paper is specifically made for the BEP by Crane Paper Company (Crane & Co.), and is composed of 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. This three-to-one ratio is one of the most important reasons for the unique look and feel of the dollar bill. Currency paper also sports its own unique ink. All bills utilize green ink on their backs and black ink on the faces. All the inks appearing on U.S. currency are specially prepared, formulated and blended by the BEP itself. To ensure security and quality, the BEP implements continuous testing on the ink and paper.
The design of currency is less mysterious than it seems. The designers at the BEP usually develop many versions of the overall look of the paper currency before one of them gets approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Many factors go into the design of paper currency, one of which is whether the design incorporates a dignified image to properly reflects the strength of the American economy.
The most complicated part of printing currency is the offset printing operation, which allows for indistinct background colors to improve the security of the bills. First, the photo engraver must duplicate the images from the designers over a plate layout. A high-resolution film recorder separates colors onto different sheets of film in negative form. A thin sheet of steel with a light-sensitive polymer surface is then covered with the film and exposed to UV light. This process must be absolutely accurate; the intrusion of even a single dust particle can affect the overall printing quality, in which case a new plate will be manufactured. Each background image has a seperate plate. In the next stage of offset printing, the background colors are printed by the huge 50-feet long, 70-ton Simultan presses. The sheets of paper, after printing, are stored to dry for 72 hours.
After offset printing comes the engraving process. This is an important part of printing currency because this is where the designer’s sketches will be transformed into 3-D engravings. All elements of a note, like portraits and vignettes, must be engraved on separate steel dies, a type of manufacturing mold. Individually engraved elements on steel dies will subsequently go through siderography, where multiple elements are transferred to a single printing plate, which is then given to plate makers to create hundreds of identical duplicates by electroplating. The plastic master is sprayed with silver nitrate so that it becomes a conductor. The chemical process produces a nickel plate, called “alto,” after one day. It is then inspected carefully by engravers to make sure it is an exact replica of the engraved die they produced earlier.
Finally, it is time for the bills to be printed. Currently, the BEP uses Super Orlof Intaglio (SOI) presses. These high-speed presses are employed to print the green engraving on the back of U.S. currency with a speed 10,000 sheets per hour. The sheets are then allowed to dry for 72 hours, after which they are separated for further processing (like face printing, which is followed by another 72-hour drying period).
After the printing is complete, the rest of the process involves examination and inspection. The Upgraded Offline Currency Inspection System (UOCIS) will use computers, cameras and sophisticated software to analyze the untrimmed printed sheet and monitor its color and ink density.
Upon the completion of the above, the dollar bills are in perfect shape. They are now ready for distribution, the final stage of production. They are transported for packaging and shipped to the Federal Reserve Bank. The completed loads are securely stored in the Federal Reserve Vault so that they can be distributed by the Federal Reserve Bank in the future.

Earliest fossils of ancestral mammals discovered
Two newly discovered fossils of ancestral mammals help demonstrate the possibility of a wide range of ecological diversity in early mammals. The two fossils, Agilodocodon scansorius and Docofossor brachydactylus, were discovered in northeastern China and belong to creatures called docodonts, an evolutionary group that diverged from the mammalian branch and became extinct. 
Agilodocodon, which lived around 165 million years ago, had curved claws on its hands and feet to climb trees, and its limb proportions are similar to those of modern-day animals that live in trees. Paleontologists have found that its teeth are most suited for a diet of tree gum and sap. 
Docofossor, which lived around 160 million years ago, had shovel-like fingers for digging and teeth that suggested it foraged underground. Its proportions are strikingly similar to the modern African golden mole. 
The dating on the fossils suggests they coexisted with the dinosaurs.
Papers regarding the fossils were published independently in Science on Feb. 13 by international teams of scientists from the University of Chicago and Beijing Museum of Natural History.

Alan Turing’s code-breaking papers released
The notes of Alan Turing, a mathematician who played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II, were found in Bletchley Park, Britain’s code-breaking center. The papers were found stuffed inside holes in the ceiling of Hut 6, Turing’s workplace; Turing and his team appeared to be using them as draught excluders.
The notes were discovered in 2013 during a multimillion-dollar restoration project of Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and they were recently released to the public. 
Amongst the notes were “Banbury sheets,” long sheets of paper with holes punched in them to compare different ciphers. Turing used these Banbury sheets to speed up the decryption of Nazi messages.
“Discovering these pieces of code-breaking ephemera is incredibly exciting and provides yet more insight into how codebreakers worked,” Bletchley Park Trust chief executive, Iain Stander, said in a statement. 
The notes, along with other artifacts found at Bletchley Park, will be displayed in a new exhibition called “The Restoration of Historic Bletchley Park” in Hut 12.

Late-night screen time alters body’s natural clock
A new study from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts shows that individuals who read off of a screen such as an iPad before sleeping have a more difficult time going to sleep and wake up feeling groggier than individuals who don’t.
The study consisted of six male and six female volunteers in their mid 20s who, for a two-week period, alternated between reading off of iPads and printed books four hours before a bedtime of 10 p.m. each night. The researchers found that subjects took nearly ten minutes more to fall asleep, and spent less time in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, after reading on iPads than they did when they were reading printed books. They also took longer to become alert in the morning, which could result in negative effects in the real world.
Exposure to light at night disrupts the body’s internal clock by suppressing melatonin, a hormone used as a sleep aid, so the study’s results are consistent with what experts would expect. Some experts did note that using a bright light while reading a paper book could have the same effect.  The researchers reported their findings January 27th in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Eight million tons of plastic dumped in ocean yearly
A groundbreaking study published in Science this week quantifies how much garbage flows into the world’s oceans every year. Previously, scientists estimated how much garbage was in the ocean by taking sample counts of plastic on the surfaces of large garbage patches in each of the world’s oceans. A study last year estimated the amount of floating trash to be 245,000 tons at most.
This study, lead by Jenna Jambeck, an Environmental Engineer from the University of Georgia, combines population and economic data from 192 coastal countries bordering the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans in addition to the Black and Mediterranean Seas to show that, of the 245 million tons of garbage accumulated by these countries annually, 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastic flows into the oceans. 
The study also names the top twenty countries generating the most ocean-bound trash; China is first, and the United States is twentieth.
Since the gap between plastic floating on the ocean’s surface and plastic flowing into the ocean is so wide, scientists now have to figure out where else it is collecting and in what amounts in order to close the gap.

First stars in the universe born later than thought
New maps from the European Space Agency’s satellite, Planck, revealed “polarized” light from the early Universe.
Previously, scientists determined how old the Universe was by examining the Cosmic Microwave Backgroud (CMB) fossil light remaining from a time when the Universe was hot and dense after the Big Bang. Planck studied this light in great detail between the years 2009 and 2013.
“After the CMB was released, the Universe was still very different from the one we live in today, and it took a long time until the first stars were able to form,” explains Marco Bersanelli of Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy. “Planck’s observations of the CMB polarisation now tell us that these ‘Dark Ages’ ended some 550 million years after the Big Bang – more than 100 million years later than previously thought.” While 100 million years seems negligible compared to the Universe’s age of almost 14 billion years, it makes a significant difference when it comes to the formation of the first stars.
This new data has many effects besides an understanding of when the first stars were formed. It could lead to discoveries regarding dark matter, neutrinos and the stucture of the Galactic magnetic field.

Protein treatment fights Alzheimer’s symptoms
A recent paper published in the Journal of Neuroscienceby lead author Dena Dubal discusses how manipulating the protein levels associated with memory can delay Alzheimer’s symptoms. Dubal, Assistant Professor of Neurology from the University of California, San Fransisco, and her team work with klotho, a transmembrane protein associated with longevity.
Previous research indicated that increasing klotho levels in the brains of healthy mice also increased cognitive function. Dubal’s team then increased klotho levels in the brains of mice who also expressed large amounts of amyloid-beta and tau, proteins associated with the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Her team found that, even with these toxic proteins, the mice with elevated klotho levels were able to retain cognitive function.
The team says that they would need to further investigate the mechanism behind this cognitive preservation before it is possible to treat humans in the future.
The next stages of this research involves identifying and testing drugs that affect klotho levels or are able to simulate klothos effects.

Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch’n’Soda recently put up their take on Stephen Adly Guirgis’s production The Motherfucker With The Hat. Loud and brash in parts, extraordinarily subtle in others, and chock full of gratuitous swearing throughout, the play works as a heady cocktail of guffaw-inducing one liners on one side and gut-wrenchingly painful moments on the other. As such, Motherfucker’s greatest strength lay in its ability to walk the fine line between hysterical humor and soul-scorching reflection.
Jackie, played by senior communication design major Sam Ahmed, is fresh out of jail and trying to stay clean. Having finally gotten a job, he wants to stay away from drugs and booze and do his part as a well-adjusted member of society. His girlfriend Veronica, on the other hand, played by junior civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy double major Erin Persson, loves her booze, cigarettes, and cocaine. In the hilarious opening scene, Veronica smokes a cigarette and snorts a line while telling her mother to look after herself and dump her current boyfriend. Jackie, ever the doting boyfriend, walks in, full of excitement because he found a job. The premise of the play is set when Jackie discovers a man’s hat in the living room that doesn’t belong to him. From that point on, everything goes south for him and Veronica.
Looking for advice, Jackie turns to his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor Ralph, played by senior professional writing and global studies double major Razghiem Golden. Ralph, himself an ex-addict, now a health beverage obsessive, tells Jackie to dump Veronica because of her philandering and constant drug habits. In the meantime, Ralph isn’t doing too well with his own wife Victoria either, played by senior psychology major Nkem Chikwendu. From this point on, Motherfucker follows the explosions and repercussions that spill over from this simmering brew of raging emotions.
The casting is spot on. Sam Ahmed, as Jackie, is innocently oblivious to the machinations of those around him. He wears Jackie’s struggles on his sleeve, from his problems with Veronica to his problems with substances. Easy to manipulate and constantly at war with himself, he elicits sympathy from the audience in spite of his questionable judgement.
Erin Persson as Veronica is equally likable. Effectively playing the part of a woman dealing with the consequences of mistakes she made when her boyfriend was away in prison for two years, she lurches from crisis to crisis. Constantly tortured, she lashes out at everyone who stands in her way. At the end of the day, one feels bad for her being trapped in a horrible situation she clearly can’t escape.
Razghiem Golden as Ralph is a smooth talker that seems to be a model of comically good behavior. It takes a while for one to realize that there is more to him than meets the eye. In a hilariously horrifying scene, Jackie confronts Ralph after a betrayal, only to have Ralph turn the tables on him for not having gotten his life together.
We also have Jackie’s cousin Julio, played by senior vocal performance major Taylor Rawley. Julio is played as a sensitive, effeminate individual who repeatedly helps Jackie even though he overtly despises him. Whether he is discussing hair care and waxing or emulating Jean Claude Van Damme, Julio makes for a good comic foil to the comparatively somber Ralph.
The standout character, however, is Chikwendu as Ralph’s wife Victoria. Subtle and understated, she slowly evolves from the stereotypical disgruntled wife into the most layered character of the lot. In what is arguably the best scene in Motherfucker, after smoking some weed with Jackie, Victoria tries to convince him to sleep with her out of pity. When he refuses, she tells him information that goes on to dominate the proceedings from that point onwards.
In spite of the depressing subject matter, watching Motherfucker was a riot. The actors all have impeccable comic timing. Brutal scenes are made all the more horrifying by how funny they are. The play deals with several themes, including unrequited lust and its consequences. Several characters have very different motivations for coupling with several others; this sets an interesting canvas for the confrontations that inevitably occur.
More than anything else though, Motherfucker shines for being stuffed with irrational, overwrought and pulpy emotion. Characters act on impulse. They rarely, if ever, make rationally sound decisions. But whether lust or love or addiction or pain or betrayal, the characters feel so strongly as to captivate the audience into empathetic submission.

When author Jesmyn Ward finished her speech on Mon., Feb. 5, she received a standing ovation that seemed to last for hours. Members of the audience were clapping, cheering, and some had tears in their eyes — a reaction that is rarely, if ever, seen at the Literary Evenings lecture series hosted by the Carnegie Music Hall.
Ward, a young, powerful writer who has been taking the literary world by storm with her intense storytelling, spoke primarily about her newest book, a memoir titled Men We Reaped, but also addressed her other works Where the Line Bleeds and Savage the Bones through her speech and the audience’s engaging questions. She spun a beautiful portrait of her life for the audience, beginning on a hot summer day, sitting on a porch with her grandmother as she listened to stories about how racism and slavery had held their family and people back. Ward said that the experiences she had in her life were absolutely instrumental in her writing, informing nearly every piece she has ever written.
With profound diction, Ward painted a powerful picture of a life filled with tremendous struggle and inspiring optimism. She and her family have been consistently plagued by tragedies of all sorts, from fighting through Hurricane Katrina only to be turned away from shelter by a white family, to losing her brother to a drunk driver who was acquitted for manslaughter. Ward’s memoir is based upon her struggle to understand the deaths of three young men who were close to her that she lost within a very short time one another.
It was hard not to be moved by Ward’s intensely compelling stories and reflections. Though very young, she has a disarming manner of speaking that conveys a wisdom beyond her years. The experiences that she shared, many the same that she drew from to write about, were painful and incredibly poignant, especially in the current political atmosphere. It seemed that her talk would have to quietly dance around the controversy surrounding Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, and Michael Brown, but Ward is not one to quietly dance around anything, boldly introducing these people by name with many others that she felt still deserve justice.
Her talk, poetic and pointed, was one that audiences all over the country need to hear. In such a polarized political climate regarding race and gender issues, Ward and her writings contribute interesting and thought-provoking material that is worthwhile and timely. Taking the life experiences that she has had and turning them into such beautiful works of wordsmanship is truly a gift: not only for herself, as a therapeutic and cathartic experience, but for her readers, so they might be taken into a different world. As Ms. Ward pointed out, racism and sexism aren’t just problems for people of color and women — they’re problems for all of us.

Dear Evan,
I’ve been trying to get a girl to notice me for some time now. I finally got up the courage to ask her to switch with me for April Fool’s, and she said yes, and it was great, but she hasn’t spoken to me since. I thought it would be a first step, something to get our future relationship going, but I haven’t been courageous enough to ask her out since then...
She’s just so much more put together than me. All of her things are always together; her clothes are so colorful while mine are just bland. Is there anything I can do to put myself to her level? I suppose I could speak up a bit more — girls like that, right?
What can I do to get my senpai to notice me?
Begging for company this Valentine’s,
Derelict Weeaboo Efforts at Everlasting Betrothal
Dear DWEEB,
A little-known fact, to my readers: Despite leaving my email at the bottom of this column, no one actually writes in — so I make up questions, then respond to them. This week, however, we have a bona fide personal question from a real student! His name is Howie.
So, from the rather unintelligible inquiry you’ve sent me, Howie — “switch with me for April Fool’s?” What does that even mean? — I’ve gathered that you get most of your dating advice from shoujo manga. Heck, you even talk like the heroine from Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-kun — which is a fantastic show, readers, please take note.
I’m going to hazard a guess and say that “senpai” probably wants to stay away from anyone who calls her “senpai,” but if you’d rather she believe you’re someone that you’re not, you could go the classic overly-confident-a**hole route, and when she rejects you, show her that sensitive side that no one else is privileged enough to see. She’ll fall for you then and there! Or that might be another shoujo manga stereotype. Who knows?
Even if this does work — which it won’t — you still won’t have revealed your true weeaboo nature. If the girl you like is prone to wearing colored, cat-eye contact lenses and consistently quotes The Irregular at Magic High School or Fruits Basket, then maybe you have a chance.
Or just write a love letter to your favorite disproportionately breasted anime character,

If you’ve been following the progression of the cupcakes I’ve written about so far this semester, you’ll probably notice that I’ve now done two different recipes that are appropriate for Valentine’s Day romance. That’s beautiful and food is romantic, but bottom line is I’m single. I’m not going to be sharing yummy cupcakes with anyone, and I know there are plenty of other singles out there in the same place as me. This recipe is for you guys.
The theme of this week’s dessert installment is “eat your feelings.” Some haters may try to tell you that this method isn’t a healthy coping mechanism (those are the same kind of people who tell you not to eat raw cookie dough or cake batter. They don’t know what’s best for you). But Valentine’s Day is not far gone, and I’m here to be an enabler. So my gift to you is a frozen chocolate peanut butter pie — sinfully creamy with the perfect balance of sweetness and richness. As soon as you take a bite, you’ll instantly become so happy that you’ll forget how much it sucks to be single, or your money back, guaranteed!
This pie is also so easy that it’s actually impossible to screw it up. As long as you can stir, you’ll be able to pull it all together in ten minutes and it will be perfect no matter what. This is the perfect recipe for Valentine’s Day. With no possibility of it turning out wrong, you won’t need to feel any worse than you already do about yourself!
Frozen Peanut Butter Pie
2 9-inch Oreo pie crusts
1 8-ounce package of cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup of powdered sugar
1 16-ounce container of cool whip, thawed
Steps
1) First, mix up the cream cheese, peanut butter and powdered sugar until they take on this playdough like consistency. I recommend licking the beaters because yum. 
2) Before you do this next part, make absolutely sure that the cool whip is thawed the whole way through or else the texture will be a little lumpy. Now, ideally with a wide rubber spatula, start to fold in the cool whip a little bit at a time. Be a little extra careful with this process. If you rush it then you’ll flop all of the air out of the cool whip and it won’t be as dreamy and fluffy, which would literally be a tragedy. 
3) When that’s done, divide the peanut butter dream cloud straight from heaven between the two pie crusts. If you’re feeling especially impatient you can try eating it right away, but you owe it to yourself to let it sit in the freezer for at least an hour, if not more. 
4) When it’s frozen, cut out a slice, drizzle it with some chocolate syrup, and maybe a dollop of whipped cream if you’re feeling especially indulgent. 
5) Take a bite, taste how perfect it is, and remember that you made that! By the transitive property of dessert, you’re perfect too.
Want to eat your feelings, too, but you’re not into PB pie?
Try these fun ideas:
1) You know those cute little conversation hearts? Chew them up and spit them into the toilet to symbolize the nausea that love causes you to feel.
2) Sit down with some microwave popcorn and a Nicholas Sparks movie. “Treat yo’ self” to some target practice with the protagonists!
3) Doritos are always pretty good, too.

Interstellar is an epically beautiful film that stretches the imagination and the mind to its fullest. But… who would name their child after Murphy’s Law? What can go wrong will go wrong. Was that their sly way of saying she was a mistake? Do they know the price of therapy in a post-apocalyptic America? Me neither, but it sounds expensive. That aside, Interstellar revolves around the relationship between Murphy (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain) and her father (Matthew McConaughey) when he is sent to find an alternate living solution on another planet. And if you are familiar with Christopher Nolan, known for the Dark Knight series and Inception, you will already know how intricate and involved his plot lines get. The starting point and the ending point are so different that the already two hour and 50 minute epic can feel like eight hours and two lifetimes. And with the music rendering some of the dialogue completely inaudible, it feels as if you are chained to a New York City nightclub speaker with the bass turned up all the way up. So bring earplugs and your cushiest neck pillow because you will be in for one long and loud ride, folks.

The title of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s newest exhibit is maybe half accurate. Certainly distant, not very much of a feel.
Distant Feel, an exhibit by New York-based French artist Antoine Catala, opened in the unexpectedly tight Forum Gallery space on Valentine’s Day. Spanning one small room, the exhibit featured just three complete pieces, offering a limited and strange glimpse into Catala’s vision of sentiment in the modern day.
The exhibit’s opening was preceded by the Gulf Tower Project, Wednesday through Friday of last week, an event which harnessed the emotional content of social media to produce fluctuating visual displays. Using an Instagram feed of posts from local users, Catala’s project coded each post as emotionally positive or negative and generated green or red light atop Pittsburgh’s Gulf Tower beacon according to the general mood of the city. The artist also gave a lecture at Carnegie Mellon’s Miller Gallery on Wednesday to discuss the exhibition.
The dominant series on display features four fabric-printed photographs — “Feel Images,” as they’re titled. The photographs themselves are intentionally bland and unremarkable — the kind of sterile, posed, Thinkstock-imitation images we’re primed to see on billboards and in larger-than-life ads in airports: In “Feel Images (Hug),” a woman and boy gently embrace; in “Feel Images (Feel),” a sad and anxious-looking man gazes straight at the camera. In “Feel Images (Distant),” a man checks his iPhone, his body slouching away from the camera, the cell phone creating a sort of barrier between cameraman and subject. And finally, most puzzlingly, “Feel Images (Forest)” is an Instagram-worthy unfiltered photo of fern-filled forest greenery.
But aside from the fact that they’re printed on fabric rather than canvas, there’s something unusual that binds each of these pieces: Fabric bubble letters protrude from each of the images like oddly shaped couch cushions. The word “feel” distorts the nameless subject’s chest in “Feel.” The word “distant” crowds the image of the iPhone-bound man. And most curious of all, a pair of uppercase E’s (the second reversed to face the other in eerie symmetry), make the image look fake, distorted, even comical.
The double E symbol is a recurring image throughout the exhibit: At the center of the room stands a lone aquarium, the size of a fish tank in a dentist’s office. The double E, blown up to larger-than-life proportions, stands studded with shells and coral in the tank, circled by small, bright, tropical-looking fish. The setting makes the letters look worn and ancient, and it’s strange to see such an artificial object overgrown with life — reminiscent of images of the Titanic’s wreckage.
Aside from the aquarium, the most prominent display is a video titled “Empathetic Paul” — in which, according to the piece description, “the young alter ego of the artist appears in a series of ‘screen tests.’ ” Responding to a number of invisible and inaudible cues, an adolescent boy imitates a range of emotions: agitation, sadness, happiness, fear.
Between these iterations, he collects himself to recite emotionally potent lines in a deadpan voice: “I can’t wait,” he says dully. “I’m terrified.” It seems more a commentary on performance — the ability to parrot emotion on command rather than seeking it someplace heartfelt and genuine — than an account of the current state of empathy in our society, but it’s an interesting execution nonetheless. As Paul speaks, the familiar double E symbol rotates in sharp, 2000s-reminiscent transparent block letters, evocative of educational grade-school math videos in imitation of Bill Nye.
It’s the challenge of an effective art exhibit to reveal the right amount of the artist’s intentions behind the work — enough to prime viewers but not so much as to rob them of their independent thought — and Distant Feel’s weakness is in its sparse and cryptic guidance through the material, leaving its viewers grasping for a frame of reference. 
“Distant Feel is a rebrand of empathy,” the pamphlet — a large, folded-up, map-like document — explains. “Distant Feel is a cool, detached, focused form of empathy. It acknowledges that it’s paradoxically OK to be distant and encourages us to express our empathy in an effective way.”
Even then, however, the information we get is a sketchy and disjointed series of what have become modern platitudes about the way we live and feel today: “Empathy is fundamental to our shared human experiences; core to our biology, our evolution, our culture, our society.” Some of these cryptic, context-devoid sayings seem to contradict each other, leaving readers wondering, Is this “distant feel” idea a good thing or bad? Is it an observed phenomenon, or a concept of the artist’s own creation?
In the literature, we also learn the origin of the mysterious double E symbol: Catala contacted ad agency Droga5 to help “craft a message to change the world” — information that gives the exhibit a new, purposeful edge, energized by the quest for progress (although the object of that quest is left ambiguous).
Distant Feel, for all its political purpose, keeps viewers at an arm’s length, perhaps keeping true to its name. But as a sort of hybrid between an art exhibit and an apparent ad campaign, it seems to have the best elements of neither. While interesting and thought provoking, Distant Feel leaves little to resonate with viewers exiting the space. For all its conceptual potential, it seems an under-realized endeavor, and unfortunately will probably be a blip in most Carnegie museum goers’ visits, overshadowed by Duane Michals and dinosaurs.

Fifty Shades of Grey was exactly what you’d expect. I’ll admit before I get into the nitty-gritty of the movie that I didn’t read the book, but I think in this case that may have been to my advantage.
Fifty Shades of Grey has been raising controversy for weeks: The movie and the book glamorize an abusive relationship and misrepresent the bondage, dominance, sadism, and masochism (BDSM) community. The books — Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed — are notorious not only for scandalizing the general public with smutty, fetishized sex, but also for some of the most poorly written prose to ever hit the New York Times Best Sellers list.
Erika Mitchell first published the books under the pen name E.L. James; the novels were born of an overgrown Twilight fan fiction. Fifty Shades of Grey is a lot like Twilight in more ways than one. Both are made up of a string of painful romance novel clichés: both are set in the rainy-but-beautiful Pacific Northwest; and both feature a shy girl who falls in love with a powerful man. Both have also sold more than 100 million copies worldwide.
Just the names of the movie’s protagonists — Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) — tell that you this is going to be at least as painful to watch as anything based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. Anastasia, or Ana, has everything the perfect ingénue needs: She’s bookish, shy, virginal, and drinks tea. Christian Grey, on the other hand, is a powerful 27-year-old billionaire with a mysterious and dark past that left him only able to find pleasure as a “Dominant” (the Dominant, as it sounds, is the dominant partner in a BDSM relationship, which leaves Ana as the “Submissive”).
The central conflict of the movie comes from a contract that Christian wants Ana to sign, a contract that outlines everything from what he can do to her sexually in his “playroom” (which Ana refers to as the “red room of pain”) to how many times a week she has to go to the gym and what she can eat. Ana is, understandably, a little reluctant. Christian pushes her to the limits of her tolerance, admitting near the end of the movie that he’s “fifty shades of f***ed up.”
If you’re seeing Fifty Shades of Grey for the sex, you probably won’t be disappointed — the movie features over 20 minutes of R-rated sex, and both lead actors are beautiful by almost anyone’s standards. The plot, however, is lacking, mostly because it is essentially nonexistent. The movie limps along as sex scenes are linked together with droll dialogue and some admittedly nice, if boring, aerial panoramas of Seattle and Vancouver. Christian’s character is often laughable; it is hard not to giggle when he leans over Ana’s bed, shirtless and sweaty from a workout, and powerfully yet “erotically” takes a bite of her buttered toast.
Ana, too, is a painful caricature of an innocent English literature major. Ana’s roommate remarks that Ana seems different after she loses her virginity to Grey, because E.L. James apparently thinks that losing your virginity changes you fundamentally as a person, a myth that feminists have been fighting for decades.
If you’ve seen the trailer of Fifty Shades of Grey, you’ve already seen all the one-liners that make the movie entertaining at times. (“I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular.”) On some levels, this movie wasn’t any better or worse than your run-of-the-mill bad romance movie, à la The Vow or Twilight. That doesn’t mean it was good, by any means, but it appeals to a certain demographic and has its place on a rainy Sunday afternoon. However it’s hard to ignore all the more deeply rooted ideological problems of the film, the ones that delegitimize the BDSM community and make Christian Grey’s abuse seem like romance. These facets of Fifty Shades of Grey take it from laughable to almost intolerable.

The words “Imma let you finish” are four that the illustrious Kanye West has yet to live down. At this year’s Grammy Awards on Feb. 8, West imitated his famous stage-jumping stunt from the Video Music Awards (VMAs) five years ago, eliciting a widely varying and entertaining response from the celebrity audience. As a reminder, the VMA incident in 2009 occurred when West hopped up on stage next to Taylor Swift, who had won Best Female Video for “You Belong with Me” (remember rocking out to that in high school?), grabbed her microphone, and proceeded to tell the audience “...but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of the year — one of the best videos of all time!” The video he referred to was for the hit “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” (also a jam). Instead of a wide-eyed Taylor Swift, this year’s Kanye-rant-victim was Beck, seasoned rock musician, who won Album of the Year for Morning Phase. Though West didn’t attempt to take away the microphone from Beck, the impulsive stage leap sent essentially the same message, not to mention the backstage comments after the awards show. West, along with much of the American public, believed that Beyoncé deserved the award for Album of the Year for her eponymous album that made such a splash after being released with no promotion last winter.
Though I stand with the American public insofar as I have a very deep and real love for Beyoncé and her music, I am frustrated by the response at this year’s Grammys. The reactions of young people in particular are annoying. Beyoncé brought home awards in multiple categories, including Best R&B Song for “Drunk in Love,” featuring her husband Jay-Z, honors that many overlook. Beck, on the other hand, has been treated by people as an undeserving nobody. Not only is this upsetting because of my everybody-should-just-love-each-other worldview, but it is also wildly untrue. Beck has been churning out critically-acclaimed material since the early 1990s. Regardless of whether or not a person is familiar with Beck’s music, it is disrespectful that so many are slamming his artistry. Do I wish Beyoncé had won Album of the Year? Yes. I’ve been trying to imitate the Queen B’s dance in the “Drunk in Love” music video all year and still can’t get it right. But I wish that the reactions, by Kanye and fans alike, had been a little more controlled. Beyoncé herself, ever-graceful, has not spoken out.
In addition to the Beyoncé and Beck issue, the Grammys contained many exciting moments. Pharrell Williams’ live performance of “Happy” was electrifying. The performance also contained a powerful Ferguson tribute, with dancers and Williams lifting up their hands in a “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture that left chills running up and down my spine. For anyone who didn’t catch the awards on TV, it is worth checking out that performance alone. Williams, replete in a bellhop costume and yellow shoes, further proved himself as a man who constantly develops his artistry and isn’t afraid to be a little whacky.
Sam Smith impressed at this year’s awards, taking home three of the four biggest awards. “Stay with Me,” everyone’s favorite crooning hit, garnered Smith the award for Best Song and Best Record of the Year. During his acceptance speech, Smith thanked the man who his Best Pop Album of the Year In the Lonely Hour was about “for breaking my heart because it got me four Grammys.” His performance of “Stay with Me” with Mary J. Blige left no questions regarding his talent.
There were some artists who unexpectedly did not win any awards during the show. The a cappella hit group Pentatonix won a Grammy for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella for their song “Daft Punk.” However, the five-person group won no awards for their Christmas album That’s Christmas to Me, which was the best-selling Christmas album this year, as well as being certified Platinum and the highest-charting holiday album by a group since 1962.
Another artist who left the Grammys undoubtedly feeling a little gypped is Sia, who despite an awesome Grammy performance did not receive any of the awards. Sia performed facing away from the audience, her somewhat inexplicable but fascinating habit. In addition to her normal dancer Maddie Ziegler (child dancer from the celebrated reality show Dance Moms), comedian and actress Kristen Wiig also demonstrated her dancing chops during “Chandelier.” Though it was enjoyable for audiences, most were perplexed by Wiig’s involvement.
Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran also received no awards this year, but that didn’t stop Swift in all her glamor from dancing her heart out throughout the night. As usual, the Grammys provided audiences with drama, fashionable stars, and live performances in an evening celebrating the most successful and talented musicians of today.

This past week, it was announced that Marvel and Sony had finally reached a new deal over the rights to Spider-Man. Instead of each approaching this deal with the plan of completely buying back the franchise, Marvel and Sony agreed to a mutually beneficial partnership, which basically gives both production studios the ability to use Spider-Man. Sony will produce the solo films and receive the entire profit from those films, but Marvel will be able to include Spider-Man in their Marvel Comic Universe (MCU). Although both studios benefit from the partnership, Marvel is getting the most benefit because it will no longer hold reservations over merchandise sales, or the inclusion of the character in future comic-book storylines.
Spider-Man is already an important character in the Marvel Universe due to his involvement in key crossover storylines such as Civil War, Secret Wars, Infinity War, Avengers v X-Men, and House of M. He has also been a member of most New York based superhero teams including The Avenger, the new Avengers, Fantastic Four, The Secret Avengers, and the Jean Grey School of X-Men. In essence, Spider-Man is one of the most versatile characters for Marvel right now because he has been able to blend in successfully with many different teams. Finally, by bringing in Spider-Man, Marvel is also able to bring in many characters and elements of the franchise that it wouldn’t have been able to: primarily Norman Osborne and the Dark Avengers storyline, as well as Spider-Woman and her link to the Avengers.
The direct implication of the partnership is the drastic change of schedule for the next two phases in the MCU. Comic book nerds and fans of the universe have been clamoring for the inclusion of non-male non-white superheroes, Marvel is pushing the releases of Black Panther and Captain Marvel to 2018 in order to make room for a Spider-Man film in 2017.
That being said, with the addition of Spider-Man to the MCU, Marvel is looking at the possibility of re-casting the role and using one of the later iterations of the superhero. In other words, Marvel is definitely making a Spider-Man movie, but Peter Parker might not be involved at all, instead they might opt for a young Spider-Man that debuted in 2011, Miles Morales. Marvel could still potentially cast whomever they want as their new Spider-Man, but a lot of media attention has been given to the possibility of Donald Glover taking the role of Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
Another interesting implication of this partnership is that Sony has inadvertently given Marvel the power it needs to finally re-acquire all of its characters. Marvel will now be adamant about ensuring that the X-Men and the Fantastic Four return home. Marvel stopped selling merchandise for both in order to hurt promotion of the movies coming from 20th Century Fox. Marvel has not been afraid to diminish certain characters’ roles in the crossovers, and it recently announced that it would cancel the Fantastic Four comic book series in order to place an even larger burden on Fox. 20th Century Fox has lost a few recent battles in the war over rights, namely the loss of Fantastic Four solo storylines, and the loss of exclusivity over certain characters from the X-Men franchise (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver).
Marvel played its cards extremely well in both of these instances. The Fantastic Four comic book franchise was not profitable, so they do not see any real loss from eliminating that series from their shelves since the characters can still interact in the overall Marvel Universe without having their solo series. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver exceptions to the agreement that Fox and Marvel made are key to Marvel, since they found a loophole to the agreement that allows them to have mutant members of the Avengers as long as they never mention the fact that they are mutants.
Theoretically, this could allow them to use many of the X-Men characters that have done double-duty as members of the Avengers, including Rogue, Wolverine, and Havok. More likely, however, is that Marvel continues to exploit new X-Men storylines that depend on other characters Fox doesn’t own in order to stop them from using them as potential movies. This could drive Fox to re-visit the agreement with Marvel and establish another partnership. Of course, this would occur only after the X-Men movie franchise dips back to the quality of X-Men: The Last Stand. Until then, Storm and the Black Panther won’t ever find love.

People interested in fashion generally have a couple of sources of inspiration that they normally check out every now and then, like fashion magazines, blogs, and even everyday outfits worn by others. Now even fashion apps are developed for those who really can’t get away from fashion. However, a more traditional choice, like reading a book about fashion, may also be nice and several recommendations below are available for this choice.
Some fashion books seem to be written as though they are meant for people interested in professions in the fashion industry, which is most likely not the case for those of you reading this article. Nevertheless, I believe that these books can be interesting just for the knowledge they provide. For example, one of the books mentioned in StyleCaster’s “16 Books to Read Immediately” is The Teen Vogue Handbook by Teen Vogue. I’m sure most people have heard of Teen Vogue before, the magazine that, in my opinion, puts over-the-top — yet still cool — outfits together to help people find new clothing. According to StyleCaster, The Teen Vogue Handbook provides information about the roles of different members of the fashion industry. This book also unfolds “the ultimate behind-the-scenes look” of fashion professional, which I think would make an interesting reading experience.
Another similar book that caught my eye from StyleCaster was the Secrets of Stylists by Sasha Charnin Morrison. As its name gives away, the book is about the tips and tricks that stylists employ to put together outfits. I’m always wondering how celebrity stylists put outfits together; then I’m aware that this book talks about the ways celebrity stylists create outfits by showing their new, cohesive looks designed for their clients.
Some books, on the other hand, offer advice from people who are well known in fashion, like Style by Lauren Conrad. People can recognize her name from the once-popular television show, The Hills. While I’m not too familiar with the show, I remember that she had a career in fashion; such experiences give her credibility to give fashion advice. Even if you don’t feel like you need any advice, I believe that this book would be informative as well. After all, you never know if you would actually learn something new.
Another similar book is It written by Alexa Chung, who is known as a television personality, a model, and a fashion icon in a sense. Her book is different from the ones mentioned above in the way that it actually ventures out of fashion, instead into her musings about music and everyday life. While the other books seem to be more serious readings, possibly with the exception of Lauren Conrad’s, It looks light and easy. People without much understanding about fashion could enjoy the book as well.
The last book I want to recommend is called #GirlBoss, by Sophia Amoruso, which is more autobiographical in nature. #GirlBoss details the author’s rise from a “hitchhiking, committing petty theft, and dumpster diving” teenager to the founder and CEO of a widely successful online clothing store, Nasty Gal. This book is not only about fashion; the inspiring personal achievement of Amoruso is also worth reading.
There are so many books out there for people interested in fashion; the ones above are just a few examples from different categories. Try some of these out to see which type you prefer and then you can search for more in the same category. While our Carnegie Mellon lives keep us all busy, there are relatively easy readings for you to check out.

Students and activists from around Pittsburgh gathered in the tent at Schenley Plaza in sub-freezing weather on Friday as part of a rally urging Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the city of Pittsburgh to divest from fossil fuels. Carnegie Mellon was represented by members of Sustainable Earth, a student organization dedicated to promoting green practices at the university and in the surrounding Pittsburgh community.
Becca Epstein, sophomore art major and co-president of Sustainable Earth, spoke at the rally.
“We are taught again and again in our classroom[s] that our future is to promote innovation that will change society,” she said to the gathered crowd as volunteers handed out hand warmers and hot chocolate. “But by aligning itself with fossil fuel companies, CMU is aligning itself against innovation.”
In an interview, Epstein said that Carnegie Mellon’s student divestment movement is still in its early phases, and is hoping that Friday’s rally will kick-start its campaign.
“We’re trying to get student support first, so we’ll have a lot of signatures and [the administration] will know what we’re asking, and then we’ll start a dialogue,” Epstein said. “It’d be really nice if we could go in and be like ‘This isn’t just a crazy group of kids, it’s really what your student body is asking for.’ ”
Although the petition currently only has around 50 signatures, Epstein hopes that by participating in Friday’s rally and painting at The Fence, Sustainable Earth’s divestment movement can build momentum. The petition asks Carnegie Mellon to divest from the top 200 companies in support of fossil fuel, which include Pittsburgh-based corporations like the Aluminum Company of America, Inc. (ALCOA) and Consol Energy, Inc.
Stanford University, as well as many smaller universities — including College of the Atlantic in Maine and Hampshire College in Massachusetts — Epstein said, have already divested from fossil fuels. “Everyone is trying [to divest]; right now is kind of the center of the movement. Most colleges have a big movement to try to get this done.”
When Sustainable Earth started their petition in November, Carnegie Mellon’s Chief Investment Officer Charles Kennedy told The Tartan that the university’s investments are managed by third-party experts who focus on growing the endowment: “Assets are allocated to investment funds managed by third-party experts who specialize in particular strategies. We believe this approach — with its broad, global diversification — will enable the endowment to continue to strengthen over time, providing greater ongoing support for the university’s operating needs, while preserving purchasing power to support future generations of students, faculty, and programs,” Kennedy said at the time. Kennedy could not be reached for comment.
Among the other speakers at the rally was Gabriel McMorland, new economy campaign organizer for the Thomas Merton Center, an organization dedicated to social justice in Pittsburgh that is petitioning the city of Pittsburgh to divest from fossil fuels.
“This is not the time to be investing in those fossil fuel companies and to be investing in the fossil fuel industry,” McMorland said. “They still think they’re a good investment, but the only reason they’re continuing with their business plan is because they believe we can’t muster up the political power to enforce real regulations that protect people and the environment.”
Pastor Robert Wilson of the First United Methodist Church of Pittsburgh and representatives from organizations such as Pennsylvania Against Fracking and the Earth Quaker Action Team of Pittsburgh also spoke at the rally, covering issues ranging from divestment to fracking and mountain strip mining. Andrew Woomer, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, spoke on behalf of the Fossil Free Pitt Coalition, a group of student organizations petitioning the University of Pittsburgh to divest from companies that support fossil fuels.
Matthew Powell-Palm, a senior mechanical engineering major and member of Sustainable Earth, said that the divestment movement at Carnegie Mellon, once it has heavy student backing, will work with the university’s Green Practices Committee and approach the administration.
“The nice thing about divestment is that it can happen on a ton of different levels that are equally impactful,” Powell-Palm said. “So maybe it starts with, say, the MechE department divesting. While a large part of it is real and economic — and you are leveraging actual power when you move money — a large part of it is also symbolic, saying that by removing our money we’re removing our nominal support of the fossil fuel industry and development of the fossil fuel industry.”

The biggest challenge students at Carnegie Mellon face can be summed up in one sentence: There are a million things to do, but never enough time to do them all. Most students do not even realize just how busy they are. Brittany McCandless (DC ‘08) was one of these students who was too busy to notice that she was too busy.
McCandless, an associative producer for CBS Evening News, graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in professional and creative writing and a minor in international relations and politics. During her time at Carnegie Mellon, she was both an Orientation Counselor and Head Orientation Counselor, news editor for the Tartan, and a member of the Lambda Sigma honors society. She also led a Girl Scout troop in Squirrel Hill and a newspaper adviser for Sterrett Classical Academy. Needless to say, McCandless’ plate was always full.
During a late night discussion with her best friend about campus culture, McCandless realized that being busy had become a competition. In her words, “You couldn’t just do one thing. Your worth as a student and thereby a person was based on how busy you were.” McCandless’ talk, “Does Busy Mean Better?”, hosted by the Carnegie Leadership Consultants(CLC), was born from what’s infamously referred to as the “I got less sleep than you did” game or “competitive complaining.”
Last Friday McCandless gave her talk to an audience of students and faculty alike. She discussed the environment at Carnegie Mellon, delved into the student psyche and narrated personal experiences, including showing everyone her college planner that she’s kept since she graduated from Carnegie Mellon. Following her talk, student leaders facilitated a workshop, in which students were grouped together to share their opinions and experiences.
In her talk McCandless displayed statistics that show a rise in percentage of students being affected by the competitive nature being associated with business, especially among first-year students. Studies conducted by the University of California Los Angeles indicate that over the past five years, the number of freshmen who feel overwhelmed by the need to be busy has risen from 27 percent to 34 percent.
Jivika Mangwani, a first-year Psychology major, can attest to that. “I personally feel like it does affect freshman a lot, especially as an international student. It’s a new vibe and you’re just figuring a college out, and then you see all these people ‘busy’ doing so much.”
These topics were deliberated on at length during the workshop segment of the event and provided students with an array of varying perspectives that elicited a positive response. “I thought that Brittany provided a very important perspective to our campus’ students in a way that was incredibly relatable,” said senior chemical engineering major and group discussion facilitator Evan Starkweather. “She managed to discuss a very serious topic with humor and grace. It was refreshing. I also thought that the discussion afterward was a really nice way to help start a dialogue within our community.”
During an interview, McCandless credited Carnegie Mellon for her success, despite her rigorous college life. “Being in this environment meant being surrounded by brilliant, engaged minds who were very into the things they did. This produced an energy and excitement that inspired me when I was here and that I carry with me today,” McCandless said. “I have a base of knowledge which I can work with on a daily basis because of the people from various disciplines that I interacted with, and this is very valuable. “
McCandless urged students not to make the same mistakes she did to get the most out of their college experience, telling them that “Busy is not a badge of honor. It is not a status. Be efficient with your time and allow yourself the time to relax.”

“It’s hard to have a conversation about the service that you do in an everyday setting.... How would that come up? How would you talk about it?”
Minnar Xie, a senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in art and psychology with an additional major in human-computer interaction, is staying at Carnegie Mellon for one more year as a fifth-year scholar to answer these questions posed by herself and make volunteer organizations on campus more sustainable.
Xie, along with other members of the Partners Allied in Civic Engagement (PACE), took to the Jared L. Cohon University Center on Thursday for the organization’s first ever volunteer appreciation day.
There, members handed out cookies and hot chocolate while visitors wrote why they volunteer on Post-it notes and had their pictures taken dressed in clothing representing their respective organizations. PACE describes itself as a collaboration between students and staff to increase civic engagement on campus.
Elizabeth Vaughan, director of student activities and staff representative for PACE, said that the event was intended to both celebrate the service contributions that campus members make and increase the visibility of volunteering on campus.
Campus members from various organizations, such as Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth and Empowerment (FORGE), Juntos, Alternative Spring Break, Habitat for Humanity, and 1000plus, are now part of a photo campaign on PACE’s Facebook page, which Xie said is also intended to raise awareness.
“Service is for some reason a weird vacuum where you can’t talk about it, because it’s not an everyday conversation piece,” Xie said.
PACE was created to bring together the campus’s various service organizations through updates, resources, and PACE’s own events, including one-time service and philanthropy events, the university’s Volunteer Fair, discussions with nonprofit leaders, films, and blood drives.
PACE is composed of six steering committee members, including an intern, campus relations chair, educational programming chair, a currently vacant marketing chair, and two first-year representatives, as well as staff representatives. 
Xie is the committee’s campus relations chair, while Vaughan and Kristine Kengor, coordinator of student life and housefellow for the Residence on Fifth, are the organization’s staff representatives.
There are currently 36 recognized activist groups on campus, and PACE had a subscriber list of 1,604 emails prior to its appreciation day.
During the 2012–13 academic year, over 5,000 students contributed 297,438 hours to service activities, according to information provided by Judy Hallinen from the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach, a PACE partner that works to improve educational opportunities.
Vaughan said that these statistics do not represent the full breadth of volunteering on campus, as they represent the hours of groups that are easiest to capture, but not individual volunteer hours.
In previous years, Xie travelled to Guatemala with Alternative Break and to Nicaragua with Juntos, an organization whose members travel to the same community, Rosa Grande, year after year with aims to improve the community’s situation through targeted initiatives. She was also president of FORGE last year, through which she has created ties with a Bhutanese refugee family, the Khanals, in Pittsburgh since her first year at Carnegie Mellon.
Next year, she will focus her fifth-year scholar project on ways that PACE can further provide for volunteer organizations. Xie said that, through multiple conversations, she found that many organizations have problems that mirror the problems of nonprofits, including disorganization and a lack of funds and time.
She aims to create resources housed within PACE that student leaders can use. Although her research and conversations with leaders will determine her focus, she believes she will provide resources for organizational improvement, event planning, or financial needs so that they can become even more sustainable, as well as visible, in the future.

When it comes to housing at Carnegie Mellon University, after students’ first year, two of the most luxurious options for those looking to live on campus are Webster Hall Apartments and Fairfax Apartments. While both are owned and operated by NDC Real Estate Management, Inc., Carnegie Mellon leases numerous apartments in both buildings.
Around half of all apartments in Webster Hall are leased to Carnegie Mellon, according to Director of Housing Services Thomas Cooley. Each room is equipped with air conditioning, a full bathroom, and complete kitchen with a garbage disposal and dishwasher. Residents don’t have many official communal spaces outside of the laundry facilities and elevator, but each apartment has a decent amount of space. The school provides cable and Internet hookups, but students need to bring routers, request a cable box, and their own televisions to take full advantage of them.
Similar amenities are available in Fairfax Apartments. Up to three quarters of the apartments in the building are leased to Carnegie Mellon, meaning that a larger portion of the people a resident might meet in the lobby or elevator are also students. Not all of the students in these buildings, however, rent through Carnegie Mellon.
Some apartments in both buildings are available to the general population, including students not in the housing pool, such as those who have already moved off campus. Senior creative writing and professional writing double major Elana Goldberg is one of those students. She and her roommate lived in separate sorority houses their junior year, but moved into Fairfax to live together again near campus.
There are certain advantages to renting directly from NDC Real Estate. NDC currently charges $1,245–1,295 per month for one bedroom apartments. Goldberg says that she splits this rent with her roommate, as well as another $140–150 for utilities, including an Internet package. That comes to a total of about $7,225 to rent their one-bedroom apartment for ten months at a cost of $1,295. If she and her roommate rented through Carnegie Mellon’s housing services, Goldberg would pay $9,450 for the 2014–15 academic year, according to rates provided on Housing Services’s website. Next year, housing through the university in a one-bedroom Fairfax apartment will cost $9,770 for students with another academic year ahead of them.
There are, of course, advantages to living in one of the apartments leased by Carnegie Mellon. Utilities and cleaning services are included in that price, and every room has a full compliment of furnishings, including armchairs, coffee tables, kitchen tables, and lamps, all beyond the standard residence hall compliment of desks and beds.
“There’s new furniture in a lot of spaces,” Cooley said of the rooms in Fairfax. The school pays for the replacement and repair of all that furniture, and there is a regular turnover. “Every mattress [in Fairfax] was swapped out over the summer.... We spent a good month moving furniture.”
Regular repairs and upgrades to the apartments, especially larger and more costly ones, are part of the reason for the higher university costs, said Cooley. 
In Fairfax alone, 20 kitchens are going to be upgraded, and the plumbing in an entire vertical “stack” of rooms will also undergo refurbishment. The bathrooms in the building mostly date back to Fairfax’s original construction in the 1930s.
“Profit margins on those spaces are very low,” Cooley said of the higher rent on the Carnegie Mellon leased rooms. “We don’t lose money, and we don’t break even,” he continued. “But the majority goes to covering the leasing. We pay the utility overhead cost, and facilities staff.” The money is almost entirely spent on running and improving student housing, Cooley said.
He also mentioned the benefits of cleaning services for students living through university arrangements.
Eric Pederson, a senior biological sciences major, lives in Webster Hall Apartments, located across the street from the Mellon Institute where he does most of his work. He, for one, really appreciates these services. 
“CMU’s Housing policies are usually pretty easy to live with, based on my own experiences. They’re fairly easy to work with when it comes to quick day-to-day issues like lost keys or maintenance requests.”
Pederson will pay $9,450 ($9,770 in 2015-16 ) for this academic year spent in a one-bedroom Webster Hall Apartment. According to the NDC Real Estate’s website for Webster Hall Apartments, the most expensive one-bedroom units go for $1,350 per month. If Pederson and his roommate split the NDC rent two ways for ten months, Pederson would pay close to $7,500 if his utilities and Internet bills cost roughly what Goldberg’s do.
Pederson said that he wouldn’t mind paying less for his room, but he appreciates the simplicity of only having one bill to pay.
“It makes it easy to do less paperwork,” he said, and added he wouldn’t want to try going it alone. “I think it’s a very attractive option for some people, especially if you’re on a tight budget, but it’s not for me.”
Cooley said that in addition to furnishings and a sizable full time support staff including Resident Assistants, security provided by Carnegie Mellon’s police department, and a maintenance staff considered to be very responsive by students, there was one thing in particular that draws students to their units. “The big advantage is I provide student life. You don’t get that on your own.”
However, Goldberg doesn’t feel like she is missing out on that advantage. “Maybe [it’s] because I’m a senior and over it, but I don’t miss that. As a sophomore or a junior, you might want that ... but as a senior it’s kind of like you want to be out of that loop of floor meetings and [mandatory] activities.”
Through savvy shopping and knowing students who graduated previously looking to get rid of their own furniture, Goldberg says that her and her roommate were able to furnish their apartment for no more than $1,000. According to myfirstapartment.com, a complete set of Ikea furnishings for a small apartment can be had for $1,800.
Even using $1,800 as the cost of furnishings in combination with an estimated rent and utilities fee in line with Goldberg’s, the rate for a one bedroom apartment in Fairfax with two people sharing the rent, comes to a cost of $9,025 this year using the $7,225 price point for Fairfax if only one person pays for all furnishings. Carnegie Mellon charged $9,450 for 2014-15.
When it comes down purely to price, renting through NDC instead of Carnegie Mellon offers a pricing advantage to students. 
Still, for underclassmen, losing the sense of community and the support staff provided by living in Carnegie Mellon leased apartments may have a larger impact than it did for Goldberg, and many students could deprive themselves of an important part of the college experience.
Editor’s Note: The ten-month rent period for students not renting through the university was chosen as an equivalent time during which students in on-campus housing live in their apartments. Total costs for the entire year would be greater than for the proposed 10-month period for students living in the apartments not through the university if they do not sublet during the summer months.

UNC/NC State professor gets CMU award
Carnegie Mellon awarded the annual Dickson Award of Science to Joseph M. DeSimone, a professor at both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. 
The award, which has been given annually since 1969, is awarded by the university to one person in the United States who has made a strong advancement in science that year. 
DeSimone has been credited with two landmark contributions to the “Maker Movement,” a culture that encourages do-it-yourself (DIY) advancements. 
DeSimone created two new tools that will aid in furthering drug delivery technology. 
As part of his award ceremony, DeSimone will be giving a speech entitled “Breakthroughs in Imprint Lithography and 3D Additive Fabrication.” 
The speech will take place today at 4:30 p.m. in McConomy Auditorium in the Jared L. Cohon University Center, and is free and open to the public.
Tepper associate dean new IFORS president
Senior Associate Tepper Dean for Faculty and Research Michael Trick has been elected the new president of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies, an organization that encourages the recognition of operations research as a profession and academic discipline. 
The organization holds conferences, establishes and maintains societies that further operations research and the standards of that research, and provides a forum for the exchange of operations research. 
Trick will serve a three-year term beginning in 2016, joining Vice President Luciana Buriol, an advanced fellow at the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq).
Student gets Gates Cambridge Scholarship
Senior mathematical sciences major Tomer Reiter is the second Carnegie Mellon student to ever receive the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, now in its fifth year.
There are forty winners across the world, all of whom will be studying at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom next year. During Reiter’s time there, he will be studying Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, which is a study of the most ancient and well-known mathematics in the known world, and earn a one-year master’s degree. Upon his return to the United States, Reiter plans to earn a doctorate and then become a professor.
The awards will be presented April 24–25 at the Edison Awards Annual Gala in Chicago.

Finance Committee update
Finance Committee gave a presentation to Senate on fiscal policies and the funding of student activities. It was noted that currently almost half of student organizations are officially unrecognized by the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), and that the current approval rating of special allocations is currently 54 percent of the target 61 percent. The initiative to create the webpage funding.cmu.edu was also presented, where all funding sources on campus can be displayed and searched. Additionally, the committee discussed the goals of creating a book of precedents and best practices, as well as increasing transparency between the administration and the student body. 
Last year the Finance Committee spent all but $4,000 of its special allocation money, with the goal of spending all of the money available for these allocations. 
Financial allocation: CMU in Haiti
The CMU in Haiti service group sought funding to send 14 students and one faculty member to Haiti for a service project. This new group received $1,000 in allocations from the JFC, as is practice for new organizations, but due to a travel advisory is unable to collect more funds. When asked about the risk to students, the organization’s leader presented that one out of 150 people had been medically evacuated in the past four years, so while risk is present, it is minimal. Senate voted to allocate funding to this organization.
Financial allocation: Senior Events Committee 
Student Activities’ Senior Events Committee sought additional funding from Senate to hold events for members of the senior class. Because this money carries the possibility of reducing ticket prices for their events and the ability to create a feeling of community for seniors during their final weeks at Carnegie Mellon, this funding was approved.
Committee update: Academic affairs
After one year of work, the Academic Relationship Code, which aims to formalize the way professors and students communicate with each other, has been completed. The Academic Affairs Committee is talking with the study abroad office in an attempt to make it easier to schedule semesters abroad for students. There is also work being done with respect to reducing stress culture across campus.

A month ago, I couldn’t wait for Valentine’s Day. I had an amazing boyfriend, it was our first V-day together, and I was going to buy him a nice new wallet — since I had accidentally put his old one through the laundry. It would be so romantic because we were so in love. 
Then, out of nowhere, he broke up with me. I was completely devastated. My heart was crushed, and I thought that my Valentine’s Day was ruined. I went through alternating phases of moping, ignoring that anything was wrong, and harassing his friends. That lasted for almost two weeks.
Then I had an epiphany, an important part of any good story. It came on a Thursday night when I was driving my Big home from Greek Sing rehearsal. Ed Sheeran’s disgustingly cute love song “Thinking Out Loud” came on the radio, and my first instinct was “DEAR GOD TURN IT OFF,” as I had been avoiding anything remotely romantic at absolutely all costs. 
Then, some foreign instinct awoke in me, one that I had never really known before. It whispered to me: “Gutie, don’t be so bitter.” I whispered back: “Ew, no thank you.” But this weird little cupid on my shoulder insisted, and I yielded. I thought to myself, “Ed Sheeran is truly a god.” Instead of changing the station, I kept listening to the song, and even though I didn’t have anyone to sing it to me, it didn’t make the song any less beautiful.
Think about how many people out there have the kind of love that Ed Sheeran loves to sing about. You can see it everyday, all around you: a couple holding hands on their way to class, your parents or grandparents or aunts and uncles, strangers sharing dinner in a restaurant.
When you’re single, it’s so easy to look at all of that mushy gushy love and let it get to you. It’s easy to be jaded and to give up. What’s hard is to see love and recognize how amazing it is. 
But when you let yourself take on that perspective, it’s actually hard to be bitter. I’m only twenty. I have my whole life ahead of me to find love (or conversely, to be bitter about it). Seeing so much love in the world gives me hope that I won’t be watching from the sidelines forever. One day, when all the stars align, I’ll find the love that’s meant for me.
But just because I’m choosing not to be bitter does not mean that I won’t be sad. I’m not entirely through with sorting out all of my hurt feelings, and to deny myself that time I really do need would be just as big of an injustice to myself as having a bad attitude would be. I’ve decided that it’s okay for me to be sad, but it’s not okay for me to let it take over my life.
So, for the time being, I’m going to keep surrounding myself with all of my friends who love me, and making sure that I keep seeing the value in the special kind of love that only friends can give. It’s not the same as romantic love, but it’s just as amazing. To my friends, who know who they are, I wouldn’t have made it to this place if it weren’t for any of you. I’ll always love you for helping me see my own worth.
My parents mailed me a Valentine’s Day card this week. The inside says: “Today is all about matters of the heart ... and you totally matter to mine.” 
In addition to being adorable and making me feel appreciated, it made me realize that this holiday is for everyone, not just couples. I don’t need to have a boyfriend to be allowed to celebrate! This year, I’m going to make sure all the people in my life know how much they’re loved, and it will be just as special.
I have so many more Valentine’s Days left in my life to spend with a boyfriend or a husband. I’ve made the choice for myself and my own happiness not to waste this precious time dwelling on the possibilities that will only make me miserable. I’m going to embrace the love that I have and be happy for all the people in the world who have been lucky enough to find love, too.

Lawmakers are preparing for the Supreme Court’s ruling on King v. Burwell, the latest court challenge to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that could severely change the way the ACA functions. I wrote about this challenge at length a few months ago, but in sum, the case may disallow the IRS from issuing subsidies in about two-thirds of states that didn’t set up exchanges. If the court rules against the administration, the ruling would cripple the ACA and necessitate changes to the way the law functions.
Republicans recently met to come up with a plan to replace the ACA, and announced a plan that was largely a watered-down version of the ACA that would never get past Obama’s veto pen. I’d like to challenge lawmakers to come up with a practical solution that actually solves the problems facing the healthcare system and has the potential to get past Obama’s veto.
Healthcare is a unique problem because it creates market anomalies. Pricing people out of the care that they need is not an option in any developed society, but creating a blank check for all of the healthcare people could possibly want will increase demand, and therefore prices, to an unsustainable point that leads to rationing. This is happening in the overwhelming majority of Great Britain’s hospitals, with a lot of money being wasted on unnecessary procedures and checkups that consume what is becoming a very scarce supply of medical resources.
A good healthcare system creates an efficient allocation of resources, where everyone is getting the care they need, and money isn’t being wasted on unnecessary care. The key to this kind of efficient system is to use market incentives that discourage people from consuming unnecessary resources, like going to the emergency room for a stomach ache. Additionally, it is important to have a non-market catch-all in the instances when market incentives wouldn’t work, like when someone’s arm gets broken and they can’t shop around for care.
There are a few ways to do this, all of which have positive and negative aspects. A simple solution would be for the government to reimburse doctors for procedures and their time at a fixed rate for a specific procedure and then to have a cost-sharing mechanism in place where consumers would pay a flat fee of say $50 or $100 so that people lack the incentive to overuse subsidized care.
Another option would be for the government to completely cover catastrophic care and leave things like routine checkups to the market. This system runs into issues of determining what is catastrophic care and what isn’t, which is very tricky, but which pales in comparison to the pitfalls of both the ACA and the pre-ACA healthcare system.
Health savings accounts are a great way for the government to cost-share. One potential system would allow people to save their money tax-free, specifically for healthcare. They could save up to $5,000 or so in this account, and if they spent more than that in a year, the government would cover the difference. This is the same premise of a high deductible health insurance plan, which works pretty well in most cases.
What all of these solutions have in common is that they are both more efficient than the ACA and more liberal, giving the government more responsibility over people’s care. 
Unfortunately, the political situation is so broken that this type of solution is the only practical alternative to replacing the ACA in the event the Supreme Court rules against the bill. I’d love to see Republicans and Democrats alike cast aside partisanship, throw around ideas bigger than Washington’s echo chamber, and create a bipartisan healthcare solution that expands coverage and reduces costs.

The United States has every reason to be proud of its medical advances. Over the course of five decades, the government-funded system has managed to decrease instances of various deadly diseases such as Hepatitis A and B, tuberculosis, and mumps to a mere 0.5 percent from a mighty average of 14 percent.
These statistics are one of the many reasons why the United States has retained its place as one of the world’s superpowers. Its medical infrastructure forms an impressive model, one which many developing countries are either eager to emulate, or are in the process of emulating.
You may ask how exactly a nation with such divided religious views and beliefs managed to curb the spread of these diseases a good two to three decades ago, while several other nations are still struggling to cope with ever-increasing instances of life-threatening diseases.
Well, it’s all credited to the healthcare system, which initially mandated the vaccination and immunization of kids and adults alike against various life-threatening diseases. However, there existed certain sections of society that weren’t very happy with this turn of events. They were, and with excusable reasons, still are unhappy to let go of their option not to get vaccinated.
The above-mentioned section of society forms an extremely insignificant portion of the population, but nevertheless an important one. While some understandably objected to vaccination for religious reasons, newer anti-vaccination groups claim that they don’t want their kids to develop autism as a side-effect, they believe, of vaccination.
This fear was born in the early ’90s, when a study claimed that a certain chemical used in vaccines to preserve the immunization triggered internal underlying conditions within a developing child, inducing autism. While it scared a lot of parents away from medicine, nearly two decades of exhaustive research has since invalidated the claim and the paper from which it originated, declaring there to be no connection at all between vaccination and autism.
However, the word of several well-renowned scientists, researchers, and doctors — not to mention the World Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine — doesn’t hold much weight at all when it comes to the likes of Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie.
Late this January, in a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, Obama urged American parents to get their children fully vaccinated, in an attempt to be cautious amid growing concerns over the recent Disneyland outbreak of measles, a highly contagious disease.
On the other hand, Christie is of the opinion that parents should have “some measure of choice” in vaccinating their children. Christie claims that he supports vaccinations and believes they’re extremely important to maintain public health. 
However, he believes it’s his responsibility to “stand with” families affected by autism, “in their fight for greater parental involvement in vaccination decisions that affect their children,” according to The Huffington Post.
While some may believe the governor’s stance to be oh-so-noble, what a lot of people and the governor himself fail to envision is the number of people he’d have to “stand with” if even a few, seemingly insignificant, citizens refuse to get vaccinated. 
But how can an educated politician such as Christie support “choice” on vaccination, based only on the incorrect assumption that vaccines are indeed a plausible cause for autism? The only clear motif that emerges is that Christie was attempting to depict vaccination as a partisan issue, establishing a Republican stance on an issue clearly founded on people’s fears and not on hard medical evidence.
If this is the case, Christie should be ashamed. Not only is he elevating peoples’ fears and doubts regarding vaccines, where none should exist, but he is also endangering American society at large. 
As Obama mentioned in his NBC interview: “If you have a certain group of kids who don’t get vaccinated, and if it grows large enough that a percentage of the population doesn’t get vaccinated and they’re the folks who can’t get vaccinated, small infants, for example ... they suddenly become much more vulnerable.”
Our only hope now is that governors and politicians such as Christie realize the sensitivity of topics such as vaccination before distorting them with partisanship. 
Next time, the governor should make use of his power and position to tell the people what they really need to know, instead of using the opportunities to further his own political agendas.

The week has seen the emergence of several narratives in the media characterizing the relationship between Apple and Tesla. These are the two most glamorous companies in Silicon Valley, and arguably the world; thus, people tend to sit up and take notice when a flood of stories headlined “Apple” and “Tesla” are unleashed in a matter of days.
Furthermore, several of these stories seem to be at odds with one another. On the one side, Forbes  says that Tesla has poached 150 people from Apple, in order to further expand into consumer electronics. Business Insider, on the other side, says that Apple has poached people from Tesla in order to build an electric car of its own.
Apple and Tesla have always traditionally avoided each other, holding a grudging respect for the other’s dominance in their respective fields. It seems as if the two companies are finally getting into each other’s crosshairs. Why is this happening now? And what does this mean for the industry as a whole? 
The San Francisco Chronicle*reported that last Spring, Apple’s chief of mergers & acquisitions Adrian Perica met Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Such a high-level meeting suggests Apple was interested in buying, or at least getting involved in a major partnership, with Tesla. Elon Musk, in a later interview with *Bloomberg, did not deny having spoken to Apple about an acquisition. Needless to say, nothing was announced, indicating that whatever was being planned fell through.
Automobiles are a massive market, arguably the only consumer market larger than cellphones. Furthermore, even a minority market share at the high end can lead to an enormously profitable business. For evidence, consider BMW, Mercedes, or Jaguar-Land Rover — all highly profitable players that thrive on good design and a small number of extremely loyal customers.
Right now, everyone in that segment is worried about Tesla, the young scrappy American upstart that is only poised to grow as electric car charging facilities become more widespread. If reports are to be believed, soon they may also have to worry about Apple, which is one of the largest companies in the world and the only one with the design chops to outclass even Tesla.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple has hundreds of employees working on an electric car project meant to compete directly with Tesla. And when did this project start? Approximately a year ago, around the time Apple’s Perica met Musk, to no avail. For this project, Apple has poached experts from a variety of automakers, including Tesla.
On the other side of the fence, Tesla is trying to ramp up production. With the imminent arrival of its budget option, the Model 3, Tesla needs to scale its supply chain very quickly. Apple is famous for a supply chain that is as massive as it is efficient. It would only be logical for Tesla to want to poach some of Apple’s talent in the field.
Apple and Tesla are both examples of vertically-integrated, design-centric, high-margin success stories born in the Silicon Valley. All said and done, the entrance of both in the auto industry should hopefully shake things up for the better.

Last Tuesday, Kayla Mueller, the last known American hostage of ISIS, was killed. ISIS claimed that she was killed by a collapsing building after a Jordanian air strike. Coincidentally, ISIS also claims that no militants within its ranks were killed.
ISIS has little interest in fighting America. It is more focused on physical battles with Bashar al Assad and other figures in the Middle East who ISIS considers apostates for not adhering to its particular set of views.
However, ISIS does need support in the hearts and minds of people in its region. It is extremely difficult to change the religious structure of a region while burdened by the unpopularity that comes with conquering land, displacing thousands of people, and miscellaneous atrocities. The easiest way for a group to regain popularity is to define itself in opposition to an even less popular group. In this case, ISIS has identified the United States government as its target.
This is where the story of Mueller becomes troubling. ISIS’s account of her death is hard to believe. They claimed she was the sole occupant of a three-story weapons warehouse. ISIS is not stupid; they almost certainly would not allow a hostage into a weapons warehouse unsupervised. 
However, much of the discourse surrounding this story seems to implicate Jordan, not ISIS, in the death of Mueller. ISIS has crafted a media image for itself so powerful that it controls its own narrative. This should not be possible for one of the world’s most hated political entities. 
Much of this stems from ISIS posting unedited video of their brutal exploits, including vicious executions. These gave ISIS’s internet persona an air of honesty. This extends into ISIS’s interactions with Mueller, as the publicly-released parts of its correspondence with her family were disarmingly cordial. ISIS claimed its members treated Mueller as a guest rather than a hostage.
Still, it is dangerous to give much weight to a single organization’s claims. ISIS needs to withstand a much more critical lens than they are currently being subjected to by American and international media.

Last week Urban Outfitters received a request from the Anti-Defamation League to remove a tapestry from its stores which resembles the garb of gay prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.
The design — white and gray stripes with pink triangles — is not the first of Urban Outfitters’ to invoke imagery of the Holocaust. In 2012, a yellow shirt with the Star of David on the breast pocket was reminiscent of the yellow patches Jewish citizens were forced to wear in Nazi Germany. 
This most recent offensive design joins a long list of controversial products which have been released and subsequently pulled from Urban Outfitters stores. Urban Outfitters has produced several questionable products in the past, including a vintage-style Kent State University sweatshirt with red, blood-like spots and racist knockoff Navajo-labelled products that violate trademarks held by the Navajo nation. 
Other examples of bad taste  include shot glasses shaped like pill bottles, shirts that encourage anorexia, and a “Ghettopoly” board game. There have also been accusations against Urban Outfitters for stealing designs from individual artists.
Given the organizations’ history of distasteful choices, it seems to purposefully create products that lead to headlines and publicity without actually selling. The vintage Kent State sweatshirt, for example, only sold a single unit. These stunts have created a successful business model — free advertising and notoriety have promoted the brand, not harmed it.
Customers are either unaware or do not care about the ethics of the business they support. The teens who buy from Urban Outfitters are more concerned with cheaply-made, fashionable items than ethical ones.
Customers, however, need to show discretion. The Tartan does not support the business practices of Urban Outfitters, but the chain has no incentive to change their ways without a clear message from consumers. Some of this responsibility must fall to the individuals who shop there — or those who no longer will.

The Tartan tried to film a remake of Frosty the Snowman this week, but we froze into snowmen ourselves. So we asked,
What did we do to deserve such subzero temperatures?

It seems that everyone and their mother took a trip this weekend to see the hotly-anticipated movie adaptation of E.L. James’ erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. As of Sunday, the movie had made over $81.7 million at the box office.
However, contrary to its blockbuster status, the movie’s reception has been less than positive. IMDB gives it a 3.9 out of 10 stars, while its Rotten Tomatoes average falls in at 26 percent. 
While plenty of people doubtless saw Fifty Shades “ironically,” and hardly expected it to have cinematic merit, the intensely problematic nature of the book and now the movie cannot be ignored, especially considering the massive popularity of both.
Fifty Shades broke taboo and brought erotica to the mainstream in a huge way. Had Fifty Shades empowered women’s sexuality more than it romanticizes domestic abuse, The Tartan would stand behind it in support. 
Unfortunately, Christian Grey is a textbook abuser dressed up like “The Dream Guy,” and his egregious behavior toward Anastasia is excused by virtue of them being in a contractual, ostensibly consensual bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism (BDSM) relationship.
However, real-life BDSM communities have continually spoken out against James’ novel, calling it grossly misrepresentative. The central motto of BDSM is “safe, sane, and consensual,” and Christian and Ana’s relationship is none of those things. Christian stalks Ana, abandons her after potentially-traumatizing sexual experiences, and takes control of her life to the point of alienating her from family and friends. Fifty Shades paints Christian Grey as an ideal, when in reality, women should take one look at him and speed-walk in the other direction.
Many Fifty Shades fans have defended it from criticism with the phrase “it’s just a book/movie.” However, no fiction exists in isolation; movies like Fifty Shades spread erroneous, harmful ideas to very real people. Someone intrigued by this falsified version of BDSM could get themselves hurt. Someone could also be trapped in an abusive relationship, thinking their abuser is someone they should want. 
In the words of Jamie Dornan, who plays Christian Grey: “Mass appreciation doesn’t always equate to something good. Think of Hitler!” Fifty Shades has much more baggage than its erotic facade implies.
