There’s a lot of hype right now over foldable phones with companies like Samsung, Microsoft, and Google each coming up with their own take on the concept. A departure from classic smartphone designs, foldable phones with fully interactive screens are attractive both for their novelty and their efficiency, allowing users to take more screen space with them without having to manage a bulkier device.
The key to making a flexible phone or similar device is designing a display that is capable of bending while delivering rendered images to the viewer. So how have screens made this leap? The key is the advancement of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.
Most devices use liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which depend on a glass backing that supports millions of tiny pixels that can emit red, green, or blue light. This results in displays that are inflexible because glass cannot bend without breaking. By contrast, OLED displays use a mesh of organic compounds imprinted on a thin layer of plastic. Images are generated by pulsing electricity through this mesh and because OLED displays do not need any backlighting, they can generate a wider, more dynamic range of colors with greater contrast. OLED displays are a win-win as they produce a better quality image on a thinner screen, so many companies use it as an advertising point when their products use OLED displays.
Understanding their role in modern electronics is one thing, but how are OLED displays constructed? Simply put, OLED displays are made by sandwiching a carbon-based semiconductor layer (hence the “organic” in OLED) between two electrodes. When electricity is applied to the electrodes, the semiconductor layer emits light. Similar to LCD displays, the primary colors are still red, green, and blue, but rather than having discreet pixels emitting these colors, OLED displays have meshes of different organic compounds that emit light in these three colors. By layering these compounds in certain ways, OLED displays achieve more consistent and continuous regions of illumination. Finding the right chemical composition and physical arrangement for the organic layer are the main challenges in creating better, more cost-effective OLED displays.
OLED technology has come a long way given that we are starting to see them worked into consumer-grade smartphones and gadgets. However, for truly widespread use, the other components of electrical devices have to evolve with the display. Batteries, circuitry, and chassis are not easily made flexible, and when proper care is not taken, it can have disastrous consequences.   
Despite the roadblocks ahead, the existence of foldable phones and other devices that effectively integrate flexible OLED displays into them is an exciting indication of what the future holds. With continued research and development, OLED displays will soon become the industry standard. In a world where we interact with screens so frequently, that just means we are headed towards a bolder, more crisply rendered future.

The Politics of Synonyms
Word choice is critical in politics and punditry, but can we identify a political voice solely based on their word choice? This was the question examined in a study titled "Can we detect conditioned variation in political speech? Two kinds of discussion and types of conversation" conducted by Professors Daniel Oppenheimer and Simon DeDeo, along with Ph.D. student Sabina Sloman, all from the Department of Social and Decision Sciences. The study identified words commonly used in Republican and Democratic congressional records and presidential debate documents. Participants were then presented with these words out of context and asked to associate them with a political party. They found that participants were "more likely to associate 'Republican language' with Republicans."

AI May Mistake Chess Discussions as Racist Talk
After a chess YouTube account was taken down after being flagged as "harmful and dangerous," researchers Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh and Rupak Sarkar from Carnegie Mellon's Language Technologies Institute wondered if YouTube's hate speech classifiers may have flagged discussions that mention chess piece colors, which come in black and white, as hate speech. To test their hypothesis, they collected 680,000 comments from chess YouTube channels and ran two speech classifiers on them. They then randomly selected 1,000 comments flagged as having hate speech, finding that 82 percent of the sample did not have hate speech. The researchers speculated that the data used to train the hate speech algorithms most likely did not contain chess-related discussions.

Developing a Lander Vision System for Mars Rover
When NASA's Perseverance rover landed on Mars this past Thursday, it was in part due to Andrew Johnson, an alumnus who earned his Ph.D. in Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. As part of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson worked on Perseverance's lander vision system, a crucial system that ensured a safe landing for Perseverance. The system he helped develop takes pictures of the Mars terrain and processes them to determine whether Perseverance will encounter any landing hazards; that information can then be used to steer the rover out of harm's way.

Searching for a new show to pass your quarantine time? Are you into science fiction? 
How about post-apocalyptic storylines? Do futuristic shows interest you? If you answered yes to any of these questions, The 100 might be the perfect show for you! 
Written by Jason Rothenberg and closely following Kass Morgan's eponymous book series, this action-packed thrilling adventure hit the big screens in 2014, but that doesn’t mean it has gone out of style just yet! The creators just released the last season fairly recently, and it is scheduled to return to screens post-COVID with a prequel. 
The show takes place 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse supposedly wiped out all life on Earth. The human species took refuge in a space station named The Ark. A group of criminal teens is sent down to Earth in order to test whether it can be inhabited again. 
The adventure shadows Clarke Griffin and her relationships with characters including Raven Reyes, Monty Green, Jasper Jordan, Octavia Blake, Bellamy Blake, and John Murphy through a tumultuous series of events: encountering a sizable group of humans referred to as “Grounders” who understand Earth to be theirs; extremely technologically advanced equipment and those who have mastered it; and climate circumstances unknown to the protagonists, who step on Earth for the first time of their lives in the first episode! 
Through the twists and turns of the seasons, this epic expedition is not one you want to miss. All seven of the seasons are available through the CW, Netflix, and Amazon. Join Clarke on her adventures, and maybe soon you’ll be able to translate phrases such as “Mebi oso na hit choda op nodotaim” from the show’s most incredible language Trigedasleng, or “forest language,” spoken by the Grounders and accepted by Clarke and her friends. Considered a dialect of modern American English, Trigedasleng is a fascinating language developed in order to contribute to the uniqueness of the post-apocalyptic world and immerse the audience in the new Earth. 
Watch The 100 today!

When asked about her house in Empire, Nevada, Fern answered that her backyard looked out into open space: “It was just desert.” That was what she loved about her home, that “there was nothing in our way.”  Classic westerns speak to loneliness through wide-angled shots that dwarf actors in their surroundings. The wide-angled shots of Nomadland turn the classic western on its head. The vast expanses of the 21st century are no longer lonely; instead, they are necessary to give actors room to grow. Nomadland reclaims this vastness as freedom.  
Directed by Chloé Zhao, Nomadland is based on the nonfiction book by the same name. The book's subtitle, Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century, provides rational context to explain Fern’s journey through the American West. The movie begins with the closure of the Gypsum Mine in Empire, Nevada, a company town that collapsed after the 2008 recession. Like many retirement-aged citizens, Fern resorts to living in her van to make ends meet. She works at an Amazon fulfillment center during the holidays and takes odd jobs during the summer. This sense of impermanence is a common story in the modern American workforce. With the rise of the gig economy, well-paying blue-collar jobs are hard to come by.  
Nomadland speaks to this impermanence through genre exploration. Neither a documentary nor a western, Nomadland ties the rational to the emotional, giving the viewer a psychological understanding of the modern American workforce.  
This constant state of flux is characterized by the group Fern joins, the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous (RTR). This nomadic commune is led by Bob Wells, a self-described "vandweller" in Quartzsite, Arizona. Despite the diverse backgrounds of its members, the RTR is united under the label of “nomad.” There is a sense of empowerment in this word — the members are travelers, no longer defined by the negative connotation of homelessness. Although most members of the RTR live in vans because they lost their homes during the recession, the term “nomad” gives them a choice. They, not the banks, chose this lifestyle.
While economic conditions pushed Fern to adopt a nomadic lifestyle, her true quest for survival lies in the mourning of her late husband. Initially, Fern tried to stay in Empire amidst the open space of the Nevada high desert. However, a harsh winter, symbolic of her grief, pushed her to migrate south.  
This migration is hidden as Fern is rarely seen driving her van, making her van a home, not just a mode of transportation. This also drives the plot as she seemingly reaches her new destinations through emotional will and not physical movement. The lack of movement creates a sense of constant presence, the eternal “now” that the landscape provides. Fern seems to relish in this presence, shown through her explorations of the Badlands and the Pacific Northwest. She is pictured bathing naked and smiling amidst the harsh waves. 
Emblematic of her grieving process, she speaks little, and her supporting characters speak even less. This lack of communication can be explained through the breakdown of nuclear housing in America. Nuclear housing, influenced by the enlightenment ideals of self-determination, meant that community only involved a person's immediate family. Because nuclear housing is no longer a sustainable living option for many Americans, new communities characterized by collective action are necessary for survival. The lack of communication between characters explains this cultural transition, as the community in Nomadland is formed through the collective trauma of home loss. With not much to say, the members are left with only the ability to nod in understanding. This nod is the symbolic end of the American Dream. 
Fern is able to find this understanding towards the end of the movie through speaking to Bob for the last time. He is the first person she truly opens up to about the death of her husband. For Fern, losing Empire was not just about losing her home. As she said to Bob, “If I left, it would have been like he never existed.” Not surprisingly, Bob’s own traumatic event, the death of his son, brought him on a journey as well. However, seemingly wiser from his travels, Bob explained to Fern that mourning is unnecessary. The nomadic lifestyle taught him that “There is no final goodbye,” only, “I'll see you down the road.” 
There is no final goodbye for America in the 21st century. The spirit of survival that drives Fern is what drives us. Zhao does not provide a solution to America’s economic crisis, only the solace of understanding that nomads are not alone. This is why the West of Nomadland does not evoke nostalgia nor loneliness. The cinematography proves that the vastness of the West is not isolating. Rather, vastness is freedom, the freedom of knowing that even in economic hardship, home can be found in nature and community can be found on the road.

The past year was strange for entertainment. I normally do a “best and worst movies of the year” list. But this year, I won’t be able to do that because there weren’t that many movies I was able to see. Instead, I’m just going to talk about some good entertainment in the last year that I haven’t reviewed yet. These include movies, video games, and TV shows.
Judas and the Black Messiah
Biopics are hard to make interesting. It’s difficult to make an engaging story around events you can find in a Wikipedia article. To make it engaging, you have to make the story about a universal feeling that the audience can relate to. Judas and the Black Messiah is an excellent story of betrayal and manipulation within the context of the FBI assassination of Fred Hampton, a revolutionary activist and leader of the Chicago chapter of the the Black Panthers.
Every element of this movie is nearly flawless. Lakeith Stanfield, who plays William O’Neal, and Daniel Kaluuya, who plays Fred Hampton, command the screen and you end up being really invested in their dynamic. The manipulation of the FBI becomes so infuriating (in a good way) and the film builds excellent tension and dread as the pieces of the story fall into place. The atmosphere and tone of the film in particular is really vibrant and slick, and while the story ends up becoming very depressing, it’s consistently entertaining through its conclusion.
The Boys
I didn’t expect a dark, satirical parody of superhero content to have some of the best commentary on topics such as corporatism, the media, hero-worship, and right-wing extremism. But The Boys did it. This is an excellent show that rarely misses and one that builds a fascinating and compelling character-driven story where every decision made feels purposeful and has consequences.
The show’s sense of humor is hysterical and its timing is always really appropriate. It never undercuts the brutality of the show, which is quite extreme and over-the-top, but not to the point of it being silly. The humor is perfectly balanced with the really dark and unsettling sequences that pull you back to reality. It’s a reflection of our world and answers one age-old question: would superheroes actually be forces of good in real life? The show’s answer is no and goes very in-depth to tell us why the answer is no. Season three can’t come fast enough.
Doom Eternal
I like shooting games. I like blood and gore. I like demons. I like metal. This game has all of it, so naturally, I love it. For what seems like a dumb shooting game, it’s surprisingly difficult and actually forces the player to think. You have to figure out enemy weaknesses, be constantly on the move, and adjust your tactics as the levels go along. It’s a really well-made shooter that’s endlessly replayable.
Nomadland
Frances McDormand turns in her greatest performance as a nomad on a journey across the country after losing her entire livelihood after the recession. This took me two tries to really get into, but it’s important to know what this film is from the get go.
The movie is less about the recession and more about a woman struggling to recollect herself and survive. It is also not a revolutionary commentary on anything. Rather, it’s a slice-of-life piece about Americans and their struggles. It has no clear resolution or a clear answer as to what to do about it or even much of a story. This can be seen as a criticism for some people, and at times, the film does meander too much. But for me, I’m drawn in by the people. It just allows us to meditate and observe the characters. By the end of my second watch, I found myself wanting to watch it again just to be able to spend more time with the characters. It is not a perfect movie, but it is one that is worth every second of your time.
Minari
There is a limited online screening of this on A24’s site for $20 but it is worth every penny. This film, which centers on a Korean immigrant family in the 1980s, is a really warm and wholesome movie. It’s got a beautiful, dream-like quality to it that mirrors the experience of what it is like to be an immigrant.
Every performance is incredible. The relationship between all the family members was really cute and the emotional payoff by the end was cathartic. It’s never cloying at any point despite its overall warm tone because the film doesn’t sugarcoat that being an immigrant in America is pretty tough. I am tempted to buy another ticket for another virtual screening, but the tickets are selling out fast and I want others to have the opportunity to see this as soon as possible.
Ghost of Tsushima
This game should not be as good as it is. This is an epic, open-world samurai game that is so much fun to play and pays so much homage to Akira Kurosawa, who is my favorite director, and his samurai movies. The story is pretty good, but for me the fun of this game is running around as a samurai and fighting people. The combat system is so fluid and masterfully done. This is one of those rare games where it really makes you feel like you’re the character. The world itself is beautiful, with the wind constantly blowing through the landscape and your clothes as you ride your horse into a beautiful sunset. I can’t wait to replay this in the black-and-white Kurosawa mode.
Saint Maud
Good lord. What a horrifying movie. This is a psychological, body-horror film about a fanatic religious caretaker trying to save the soul of the woman she is taking care of. I can’t say much about this movie without spoiling it, but rest assured that this is as disturbing as you’d expect that premise to be. I found myself squirming in my seat for a lot of it, and Morfydd Clark’s performance was haunting and left my jaw dropped. This isn’t Hereditary, which is still the most terrifying movie I’ve seen in recent memory, but it is another winning horror film for A24.
Soul
I know that this movie has a few issues with its plot construction, but I frankly couldn’t care less about that because the movie isn’t about that. Soul is a magnificently animated and breathtaking movie that really stuck with me. Joe, who is a middle school jazz teacher and a struggling musician, dies after he gets into an accident on the day he finally has his big break, and the rest of the movie is his soul trying to get back into his body. Except the movie is much more than that.
Really, it’s a story about living in the moment. We get so wrapped up in our existential concerns of success that we fail to consider what’s in the present, even if there is nothing going on in the present. Sure, you’ll struggle a lot, and that can make your life really tough and miserable. But even if you’re on the other side and you’ve made it, you still have to live after. So if you don’t know how to live in the moment, your success won’t make you any less miserable. But it takes something as simple as watching a sunset on the beach and feeling the sand in your toes to remind you why it is you’re alive. You’re not alive because you have some purpose. You don’t need a purpose. Living is enough on its own and that’s good. It’s a wonderful message for both kids and adults alike to hear, especially given the past year. Combined with some of the best animation I’ve ever seen, this is just a knockout movie that everyone should watch. This is the Pixar that we’ve been missing for the last decade.
Some other good stuff: I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Last of Us: Part II, Hades, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Last and First Men, Mank, Promising Young Woman, Time, The Expanse, Attack on Titan, The Queen’s Gambit, Unorthodox

Deputy Director for Science and Society for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Dr. Alondra Nelson spoke as part of a speaker series hosted by the Center for Africanamerican Urban Studies and the Economy (CAUSE) and Heinz College last Friday. The speaker series has focused on racial disparities in American policing and healthcare systems, and Nelson spoke about the overlooked healthcare activism of the Black Panther Party (BPP).
Nelson began her lecture by drawing the audience’s attention to a fundamental question: why and how do communities that have been the objects of scientific scrutiny, technological surveillance, and medical apartheid become subjects and agents in science and medicine? She then transitioned to countering popular stereotypes about the Black Panthers, who are often portrayed as a militaristic and antagonistic organization, by showing documented examples of their healthcare initiatives and outreach projects. These included free breakfast programs for children and community survival conferences, during which the organizers would distribute free food and sickle cell anemia tests. Nelson added that the testing run by the BPP for sickle cell anemia was one of the first examples of a large-scale genetics counseling and screening program in the United States. 
After this general overview, Nelson dived into the bulk of her talk by discussing what motivated the BPP to develop their health activism frameworks. She focused on three different motivations: personal experiences, historical antecedents, and political and ideological influences.
Nelson walked the audience through the many challenges that Black people faced in trying to obtain healthcare during the latter half of the 20th century. As a result of Jim Crow segregation, she said, access to clinics and hospitals was restricted, and so was access to relevant medical and scientific knowledge. Compounded with the brutalities that Black people suffered during civil rights protests, such as those at Birmingham and Selma, there was a need for a self-reliant healthcare system. To underscore this point, Nelson recounted the story of Huey P. Newton, a co-founder of the BPP, who was denied healthcare due to his lack of insurance information, which he did not have with him at the time. Instead of giving medical attention to an injured Black person, a nurse called a police officer over, turning the visit into a carceral encounter. Nelson stressed that experiences like these were instructive in that they showed the BPP (and the Black population in general) that if they wanted to get quality healthcare for themselves and those that they cared about, they would have to build their own system rather than depending on existing infrastructures.
Nelson also introduced the concept of the “long medical civil rights movement,” and how the civil rights movement has always contained a component of health activism as a necessity. Some examples of this include the Black Cross nurses, which was a cadre of Black female nurses who were barred from joining the Red Cross, and the activism of Fannie Lou Hamer, who had a hysterectomy performed on her without her consent by a white doctor. Nelson also talked about how doctors would assist the Black community during events like Freedom Summer. Nelson emphasized that even though we often think of the civil rights movement as a struggle for equality, it also contained clear and indisputable undertones of health activism that played a role in the BPP’s development of its activism initiatives
In discussing political and ideological influences, Nelson talked about the book The Wretched of the Earth, by Frantz Fanon, which was required reading for members of the BPP. The book provided a deep psychiatric and psychological analysis into the conditions of those suffering from the dehumanizing effects of colonization, and it served as a template not only for the BPP but also for the Black community as a whole. Through the writings of authors like Fanon, the BPP inherited a core commitment to health activism.
Concluding these three sections of her talk, Nelson then brought the audience back to the BPP, discussing in greater detail the nature of the BPP’s health activism. She explained that the BPP’s initiatives came from being both an underserved and an overexposed population. In terms of being an underserved community, Nelson talked about how Black individuals had to rely on health aid from their communities and each other rather than the systems that were in place. As an example of this, Nelson showed that BPP chapters were each required to have an established clinic to serve those of the Black community and that these clinics were only to be staffed by qualified individuals. Nelson emphasized that these initiatives are relatively unknown today as a result of federal counterintelligence.
In terms of being an overexposed population, Nelson discussed how the BPP was always trying to anticipate advancements in medical technology that could be harmful to the Black community. One example of this was when the BPP, in collaboration with the NAACP, California’s Prisoner’s Union, and others, filed a legal complaint to stop the establishment of a center for the reduction of violence at UCLA, which would have used psychotherapy as a method of control over minorities who were deemed dangerous.
Nelson concluded her lecture by answering her initial question. Having shown throughout the lecture how members of targeted communities become subjects and agents in medicine and science, she finished by talking about some of the reasons why this was the case. Of the many reasons that exist, she focused on three: that the BPP had strict standards and only accepted help from experts who were well-equipped to work with disadvantaged groups; that the BPP was open-minded and adopted new scientific advancements; and that the BPP were conscientious about their self-representation to the world, and dictated the terms surrounding controversial topics of discussion.
After Nelson finished, the audience asked numerous questions, both on the contents of the talk and on her perspectives on society in general. One audience member asked about the legacy left behind by the BPP’s health activism, and what remained today. Nelson responded by pointing to community clinics founded by the BPP that are still open today, such as the Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center, as well as the widespread health activism that happened after Hurricane Katrina. She remained optimistic that the spirit of health activism was still alive.
Another viewer asked about what lessons universities can take from the BPP’s health activism. Nelson responded that universities should be cognizant of the role that they play in the communities in which they are situated, especially those that are situated in underprivileged areas. More importantly, universities should have a dialogic relationship with those around them rather than a predatory one.
The last question was from Dr. Joe Trotter, one of the moderators, and he asked Nelson to talk more about the free breakfast program and activism through the context of food and food security. In response, Nelson admitted that food was certainly a component of health activism, and many protested for the right to have access to fresh and non-spoiled produce. She added, however, that there was certainly a lot more to learn about the food initiatives of the time and that there was definitely a story about the BPP through that lens.

The coronavirus pandemic has upended higher education, aggravating one of its worst crimes: cheating.
The pandemic has compounded the pressure on college students across the U.S. In the age of online instruction, some students have resorted to cheating in search of a higher grade. Accusations have emerged around the country. The Military Academy at West Point, for example, accused more than 70 cadets of cheating on a calculus exam that was administered remotely.
Many college students have turned to the internet to ask strangers to solve their homework. A study found that the number of questions posted on Chegg, a homework help site, increased by 74.92 percent between September 2019 and August 2020 compared to the year before. The same study found that the number of questions asked from March 2020 to August 2020 increased 196.25 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Some of these posts have translated to real-world consequences. Texas A&M accused hundreds of students of cheating using Chegg.
Finding an online testing scheme that ensures academic integrity has also proved challenging. Assistant Teaching Professor Michael Taylor, who teaches 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, often referred to as 112, said in an interview that the course initially stopped having quizzes when online instruction began. "We knew we had to figure out a process that balanced security with also making sure that this process isn't going to stress students out like crazy," he said.
Taylor said the 112 staff has tried to build "online testing environments" so students can run code during their quizzes. However, one online testing environment eventually led to them nullifying a quiz after it had bugs. Most recently, Taylor said that students took quizzes on their computers. In this setup, students would join a Zoom call on their phones, put their phones behind them, and point the camera at their computers.
Taylor assured that students with internet or equipment problems could receive accommodations. However, students at other colleges have expressed concern about some testing schemes, especially those that use proctoring software. Some software like Honorlock raise privacy concerns because they require sweeping permissions from a test taker's computer. Others, like ProctorU, hire proctors to watch test takers.
Problems with proctoring software have led some universities to stop using them or advise against them. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is discontinuing its use of Proctorio due to accessibility concerns. In addition, Taylor said lockdown browsers were not considered for 112 at the suggestion of the Office of Disability Resources.
Intrusive testing regimens can add to the stress of college in what is already a difficult time for college students. A college pulse survey in collaboration with the Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education found that 70 percent of respondents identified staying engaged with online work as a "primary challenge," and 51 percent said they were at least somewhat anxious about COVID-19. Additionally, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center found that there were over 560,200 fewer undergraduates enrolled in fall 2020 compared to fall 2019. That represents twice the decline recorded between fall 2018 and fall 2019.
For a small number of the students who did enroll, the unique pressures of college during COVID-19 seem to have pushed them to cheat. Taylor confessed that, since remote classes started, he had seen several cases of students receiving illegal help from a family member. 
"Now you've got even more intense family pressure with the family you're living with," Taylor said. He added, "I will not miss that when we get in person."

I recently had an interesting discussion with a friend of mine who graduated last spring. He and I used to run the Independent Musicians Organization on campus, and we had aspirations for creating an active music scene at Carnegie Mellon. However, we were not able to do it, and it’s not hard to figure out why. As he laid out his very astute observations, I realized a lot of it involved discourse about our university work culture that is hard for many current students to articulate.
Part of the problem we faced as an organization was that most students just did not have the energy or time to commit to the organization. It makes sense. Most of us spend at least 50 - 60 hours per week, often more, on academics. So naturally, it is hard to make legitimate efforts to pursue our passions because it is hard to balance self-fulfillment and academic fulfillment simultaneously. Ultimately, academic fulfillment is the one that provides more noticeably practical benefits, such as employment prospects, so we sacrifice our self-fulfillment for it.
Unfortunately, without self-fulfillment, our academic fulfillment and relative success in life are less meaningful. For all the talk about putting your heart in the work at Carnegie Mellon, the ability to actually do that here is incredibly difficult. I know I signed up for a tough and rigorous place for my degree. But we are also told very often that college will be the “best four years of our lives.” If that is the case, then I am dreading the rest of my life.
With our current internet age, any one of us can learn anything on the internet. Notes for any class or any topic you can think of are available online to be viewed at any time. You can find problem sets, case studies, and papers for free or at a low cost. Realistically speaking, we don’t come to college to learn. We come here for the degree and the people, which brings us connections, clout, and a higher starting salary. The more known a university is for its name, the higher your starting salary.
There are certainly some universities that have the brand recognition that are known to not be as rigorous. But then there are places like Carnegie Mellon where it is the complete opposite. The workload is diabolical, and it makes it hard to have an actual life here. There are definitely a lot of professors who do not realize this, as evidenced by the number of them who set homework due dates on university-sanctioned break days or assign an unrealistic amount of work for one person to do in a week. I have luckily never had to deal with this because the majority of my professors are quite accommodating, but many of my friends are not as lucky.
There is also this competition between departments about who is the most rigorous, and it is something perpetuated by everyone from the students to the faculty to the administration. The effect is insidious. Imposter syndrome is a major problem amongst students, and there are constant contests about who sleeps less, which only fuels that imposter syndrome crisis. It is also often hard to maintain friendships with people outside of your own major or department. Students form their own little bubbles on campus to the point where it does not end up feeling like a real campus except for whenever Carnival happens.
The main ways for students across majors to interact is through extracurricular activities, both in classes or through student organizations. Unfortunately, students not only lack time to properly commit as I said earlier, but many students tend to be really bad at communicating if they are unable to commit. It causes unnecessary stress for everyone involved, and it is also just really rude. There is nothing wrong with dropping an activity because you need to take care of yourself. In fact, you should absolutely do that. However, students need to have some accountability because there is no excuse for letting your stress cause someone else to be stressed. It just makes being part of an organization less fun.
In addition, the university is really disconnected from Pittsburgh. Students live in their own bubbles already, and those bubbles are within a larger bubble that is Carnegie Mellon. Its lack of integration in Pittsburgh makes it very difficult to actually explore the city, which makes students’ lack of social lives feel even worse. Many students disparage Pittsburgh for having nothing to do, of which I get some of the criticisms. But many of these students haven’t gotten a chance to actually find things to do.
It all ends up worsening everyone’s mental health at the end of the day. The weekly 60-hour workload starts turning into 80 hours as students’ mental health declines and they are not able to be as productive. It is sad and soul-crushing. Though we can communicate with professors or advisors, we are ultimately at the mercy of wildly variant generosity. As I said earlier, I am lucky that my professors are really accommodating, but there are many others who are not as fortunate. That variance also prevents students from wanting to communicate because they feel intimidated or overwhelmed. The onus is on the students to be able to do that, but it requires faculty and staff to be cognizant that students are still learning to be confident in themselves. One of the points of college is to be able to develop that.
A lot of these reasons are why my friend and I could not achieve our aspirations of establishing a music scene. Music majors are already busy enough with their own music or, in some cases, do not want to do music with non-music majors. Non-music majors are busy enough with their own work. My friend and I had a lot of work, and as a result, we also did not have time to reach out to musicians in Pittsburgh. My own mental health was in shambles so I could not commit much time to run the organization efficiently. What makes this more frustrating is when we consider that there are famous artists who are from Carnegie Mellon, such as Yaeji. We have a strong base of musicians and yet no scene, and it is pretty much because it is impossible to do that here.
Ultimately, I think the administration is pretty self-aware of our campus culture’s shortcomings, which is a good start for them. They established the Tartan Community Day during my junior fall because it is bad that the only real campus-wide social tradition we have is Carnival and then nothing else. But throwing money and activities at the problem does not solve it. The work culture issue can only be solved by giving us a more reasonable and flexible amount of work. We have lives. We want to fulfill ourselves. We actually want our college years to be great and memorable. This is my fourth year here and my time is nearly up. So, I plead to the administration on behalf of those who still have a lot of time left: let the students live a life.

As we approach one year since the beginning of quarantine and our online education model, it’s important to reflect on what has been the most helpful for students through this very stressful period of time. 
Since March, it has been a consistent struggle for students to maintain their mental health through the pandemic. In one National Institutes of Health survey from last September, 71 percent of students surveyed indicated an increase in their anxiety and stress levels. While the vaccine is already here, it’s still months before most students will receive it, and a return to normalcy this fall is still not guaranteed. 
But one of the most important dimensions of the pandemic’s effect on students has been the online education model. It is difficult to maintain motivation for Zoom classes, and it is even more difficult to maintain motivation given all that is going on in the world. Educators have done the best they can to accommodate their students. However, there are some elements of our education system that have not translated well into the online model and have exacerbated student stress. In this case, we refer to online exams. 
Prior to the pandemic, the exam format was already a major stressor. A time-sensitive set of questions that requires students to know concepts off the top of their head is a lot of pressure for students. However, in the pandemic, not only is this pressure significantly worse, but the methods for actually enforcing the conditions conducive to an exam requirement are much harder to implement. For example, some educators rely on students keeping their cameras on or even having students maintain eye contact with their computer cameras as much as possible. This is a very silly solution, and it is also incredibly distracting for students. In addition, if students have a second monitor, they can use that to bypass the instructor’s camera requirements. This creates another disparity between students, where those who can afford a good dual monitor setup have the advantage. 
In our experience, we have found that classes that removed the pressure element from exams tend to be the most helpful. The ways they did this were by giving a longer frame of time for students to complete the exam and making the exams open-note. While those exams were also more conceptually challenging, they were also much fairer, and removing the pressure element was more helpful for learning the concepts. For many of us, we felt that we had actually learned and understood the concept even more after taking the exam. 
For an online education model, this exam format is more sustainable. First, it removes the pressure element that has made online learning stressful for a lot of students. Second, and more importantly, it helps students learn better. Time-sensitive exams often cause a lot of stress and don’t really test a student’s conceptual understanding of material very well. There’s a reason many students often find it hard to remember the information they learned, and it’s because they learn solely for the test but forget the information after. To add to this, one challenge in this pandemic for many students has been trying to stay motivated for their courses. If students actually feel like they’re learning with this format, it will give them a reason to care about their courses. 
Admittedly, there are a lot of trade-offs to this. There are students who find that the challenge and pressure of a course are actually more helpful for maintaining motivation in the class. Many people who have come to a university like Carnegie Mellon often come with that mindset. In addition, there will have to be some accountability for students to make sure they don’t slack off just because exams are open notes and have a longer time bound. But having said that, there is only so much students can actually manage with a pressure-based system until it becomes overwhelming. Under the current extenuating circumstances, this problem is exponentially worse. 
Educators should not be blamed for this problem either. Though there are many professors who are assigning more work than normal or are unaccommodating, the problems with our education system extend far beyond any one group of professors or students, and this pandemic has exposed that. It’s a collective issue related to our mindset. We are so caught up in academic integrity and rigor that we have forgotten the ultimate goal of education: our love of learning. One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of having learned something new. That sense of wonder is missing in our approach to education. Everything is so focused on what requirements to fulfill, and then many of those requirements are considered to be “weed out” classes so that only the “best of the best” stay in a major or department. Sure, this helps the school’s ranking, but it's a disservice to the ultimate goal of education and it undermines the passion that many educators put into their work. 
The discussion of what should happen with our education system is a longer and broader topic that deserves its own book. But it is also a nebulous concept and it’s hard to define what solutions will best solve this problem. For now, there are some stopgap measures that can at least alleviate some of the issues that we are seeing with our education model, especially during the pandemic. Changing the format of exams is one of them. It’s not a permanent solution, and perhaps after this pandemic, it may not even be the right one. But after nearly a year of this pandemic and with months more to go, something has to be done to alleviate student stress, and this is perhaps one of the easiest solutions we can implement.
