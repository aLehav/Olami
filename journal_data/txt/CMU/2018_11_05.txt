Both the Carnegie Mellon University men’s and women’s soccer teams won their season finale at home on Saturday versus the Spartans of Case Western Reserve University. With their 3–1 win over the Spartans (ranked eighth), the men’s soccer team (ranked 23rd) finished 11–4–2 on the season and 3-4 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. On the women’s side, the Tartans defeated the Spartans 2-1 to finish the season with an 8–8–1 record and 1–6 in UAA play.
In the first match of the day against the Spartans, the Tartan men’s squad kicked off the scoring early. In the ninth minute, a corner kick by senior Anthony Gulli from the right side of the pitch was headed back by junior Jacob Moskovitz. Then, junior Jack Painter chested the ball off the header into the back of the net while the Spartans keeper was on the opposite side of the goal.
But the Tartans didn’t stop there. Three minutes later in the 12th minute, after a Spartans header went off the mark, junior Elliot Cohen intercepted the ball at the penalty arc and slotted the ball into the goal. It was his eighth goal on the season, increasing the score to 2–0.
In the 35th minute, Cohen shot a free kick into the box, and junior Alex Dziadosz put the ball into the net off a Spartan header. The Tartans’ 3–0 lead in the first half proved to be insurmountable. The Spartans ended the shutout and got on the scoreboard with a goal in the 43rd minute, but a scoreless second half sealed the win for the Tartans.
The Tartan women’s  soccer team took the pitch after the first match, and just like the men’s squad, began the scoring early in the first half. In the 10th minute, the Tartans went up 1–0 after senior Kaily Bruch scored off a pass from sophomore Taylor Cammarata.
The Spartans evened the score to 1–1 in the 63rd minute, but the Tartans responded five minutes later with the go-ahead goal and eventual game-winning goal. Junior Tara Durstewitz received the ball from downfield and passed it to sophomore Kristen Chong, who sent the ball right back to Durstewitz. She took two dribbles and easily finished the sequence past the Spartans’ goalkeeper in the back of the net. The match finished with the Tartans winning 2–1.
With Saturday’s wins, both the men’s and women’s teams completed their 2018 seasons on high notes. This season, the men’s side improved on their 2017 record, winning one more match. On the women’s side, this 2018 season was a decline from their 2017 record, which was 15–3–4. With this season finale win, the women’s soccer  team moved to finish with a .500 record. This is the first season since 2010 they haven’t finished with  a winning season. But in 2019, both teams will look to improve and ultimately earn spots in the postseason.

Welcome back to another week of imaginary football! It is I, Nora Mattson, News Editor, here to recap what has happened this past week. Why, you may ask? Because I lost, okay?!?! It’s rude to ask things like that. I also would like to add that five of my players were on a Bye Week, which I got explained to me and I now want to take one for myself. I did pretty well in these matches during the beginning of the season, which meant that I got weirdly invested in my team full of autodrafted players I had never heard of. I’m going to funnel my sadness at losing into a biting recap that will make all of my colleagues (who I adore immensely) regret stepping near me on the football pitch. I hope that in coming weeks, my boys will bring it all to the fake court, and I will not have to learn any more about football than I know now.
The league is nice and stable, with no teams changing position this week. Last Manning Standing, lead by our Publisher and CEO Caleb Miller himself, is still at the top, which I think is sexist. Gin and Bear It, the team managed by our Sports Editor Marika Yang, is at the bottom for like the millionth consecutive week, which I think means that she is now demoted to Assistant Sports Editor. Not to pass judgment or anything, but if we did a fantasy news league I would probably win every week.
michelle123 over newz, 101.86 to 70.90
Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team, mmichelle123, resoundingly trounced my team, newz. This feat was doubly impressive, as I was projected to win at the beginning of the week and held a slight lead until Sunday night, when she came back with a vengeance. She ended up beating me by more than 30 points, but we both kept our positions in the league, Madlansacay’s team at seventh place and me and fourth.
Madlansacay’s top scorer was Kirk Cousins, quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, who passed for 359 yards, scoring two touchdowns and earning her more than 20 points. Antonio Brown, the Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver, earned her more than 19 points as he also scored two touchdowns. While I am bummed this had to contribute to my downfall, I am always vaguely glad when a Pittsburgh team does well!
I really messed up this week, starting players who contributed no points which I guess shows a flaw in my hands-off managerial approach. Atlanta Falcons running back Tevin Coleman was on a Bye Week, and Denver Broncos quarterback Royce Freeman hurt his ankle. And Rob Gronkowski, the only player on my team whose name I recognized, only caught three out of eight targets.
GOAT but Ironically over futbol 121.22 to 91.76
After beating me handily last week, Visual Editor Tracy Le’s team lost to Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team GOAT but Ironically this week. My own margin of loss beats out Le’s this week by a hair to win the title of worst loss this week. This week’s loss, however, was not enough to unseat Le from her ranking at second place, or move up Sio from third, though Sio scored the most points in the league this week and continues to trend upwards after a slow start to the season.
Sio had a week with a lot of high scorers. Three players led her team: Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Carson, who collectively scored 71.92 of Sio’s winning 121.22 points. Gurley scored almost 30 of those points, as he recorded 114 rushing yards, 81 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown.
Quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, Andrew Luck, lived up to his name and luckily scored 23.36 points for Le. Jacksonville Jaguars running back TJ Yeldon, though scoring Le only nine points this week, played efficiently, as he was rarely passed to but got a lot of yards in. Sio will go on next week to play the top-ranked Last Manning Standing, while Le will play the fifth-ranked Slugs.
Last Manning Standing over Slugs 106.64 to 94.74
This week threw some salt on Operations Manager Adam Tunnard’s team, Slugs, as he had to face top-ranked team Last Manning Standing, run by Publisher Caleb Miller. Slugs actually was projected to win towards the middle of the week, but a late round of heavy scoring from Miller’s team meant that he won comfortably.
Miller’s scoring was led by quarterback Carson Wentz of the Eagles, who has proved to be a good pick, leading Miller’s team in scoring week after week.
Slugs, Tunnard’s team had a rough week, starting running back Melvin Gordon of the Jaguars who earned him zero points. This loss for was not enough to change Tunnard’s fifth seated ranking, and there was nowhere else for Miller to climb in the rankings, as he is still in a comfortable first place. Next week, Slugs is scheduled to go head to head with Le’s futbol, and Last Manning Standing will take on Sio’s GOAT but Ironically.
Gin and Bear It over TARTAN FANTASY 83.00 to 79.46
Finally, our Sports Editor, Marika Yang, catches a break when her team, Gin and Bear It beat out Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY. Qian bested Yang in the first week tournament, but Yang was able to pay her back in kind with this win. Yang stayed at eighth place and Qian at sixth.
In the closest match of the week, Yang pulled ahead by a nose on Sunday night when Gurley caught a two point conversion from Rams quaterback Jared Goff. Goff continues to be valuable for Yang, winning her an impressive 26.50 points.
Qian, however, had the second highest scorer in the league with Deshaun Watson, quarterback of the Houston Texans winning her almost a third of her total, with five touchdowns and 30.96 points. However, she had two team members, Ezekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys and Matt Bryant of the Atlanta Hawks, earning her no points. Next week, Qian will face off against me next week, and Yang will take on my opponent from this week, Madlansacay’s mmichelle123.

The 2018 World Series was an unusual one. Normally, you would see an underdog against a more established power in the baseball world, but this year, nothing shocking happened in the playoffs. The best teams with the best hitters and the best pitchers made it to the Fall Classic. The Los Angeles Dodgers, just a year removed from losing the World Series to the Houston Astros, faced the Boston Red Sox, the best team in the MLB regular season who beat the Astros in five games to get to the first World Series since winning in 2013.
Unfortunately for the Dodgers, the Red Sox came into 2018 with one of the strongest rosters in the history of the game. The Red Sox won 108 games. The Baltimore Orioles, by comparison, the worst team in the league, won 47 games all season. Boston has a good team. The Dodgers won the NL West, winning 92 games, which is incredibly impressive, but Boston was a commanding force the entire season. They looked unbeatable. In the playoffs, they lost a total of one game in each series. Three losses in the playoffs. That’s almost Golden State Warriors levels of dominance.
And against the Dodgers, they didn’t slow down. The Sox sent out Chris Sale to pitch against Clayton Kershaw in Game 1, which allowed Kershaw to become the first pitcher to pitch in two consecutive first games of the World Series. The Red Sox scored early off an Andrew Benintendi hit. Mookie Betts scored off the hit, after he stole second base. Right after, JD Martinez hit Benintendi home. The Dodgers responded with a Matt Kemp home run and a Manny Machado RBI single. Kershaw was pulled in the fifth inning, adding fuel to the whole “Kershaw falters in the postseason” narrative. The Red Sox stacked two runs on him to add to their lead in that fifth inning, then continued to score in the seventh. Final score: 8–4 Red Sox.
In Game 2, we saw a couple pitchers who weren’t as well-known as Sale and Kershaw. David Price looked to shut down Los Angeles while the Dodgers sent out Hyun-jin Ryu. The Red Sox scored first on a single by Ian Kinsler in the second inning. The Dodgers took the game back in the fourth, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Matt Kemp, then took the lead thanks to a Yasiel Puig single. Ryu would load the bases in the fifth, then was replaced on the mound by reliever Ryan Madson, who walked in the tying run, then gave up a two-run single to JD Martinez. Price, who like Kershaw also has had some postseason struggles, put those demons to bed, allowing only 2 runs and 3 hits in six innings. This game was also the 100th postseason victory in Red Sox history.
Game 3 is one of the most interesting games of baseball that was played all year. The starting pitchers were Walker Buehler for the Dodgers and Rick Porcello for the Red Sox. The Series shifted to Los Angeles, and the Dodgers made good use of their home field advantage, scoring first in the third inning off a Joc Pederson home run. Porcello pitched 4.2 innings, while his opponent, Buehler, pitched seven scoreless, allowing just two hits and striking out seven. In the 8th inning, though, Jackie Bradley Jr. came through for Boston with a solo home run off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen. No one scored in the ninth, and the game went to extra innings. In the thirteenth inning, Brock Holt scored the go ahead run for the Sox on an infield single by Eduardo Nunez and a throwing error by pitcher Scott Alexander. In the bottom of the inning, Max Muncy walked against Nathan Eovaldi, advanced to second on a pop out, then scored on an infield single by Puig and a throwing error by Kinsler. Eovaldi, Red Sox starter-turned-reliever, pitched six innings in relief, and in his seventh, Max Muncy hit a walk-off home run, giving the Dodgers their first win of the series. This game went seven hours and 20 minutes, and, at 18 innings, the longest World Series game in history, by both innings and time.
Game 4 saw starters Rich Hill of the Dodgers and Eduardo Rodriguez of the Red Sox face off in Los Angeles. The game was scoreless through the first five innings, but in the bottom of the sixth, the bases were loaded and the Dodgers scored four runs, the first on a throwing error by catcher Christian Vazquez, then the next three off a three run home run by Puig. In the top of the seventh, Boston made it a one-run game off Mitch Moreland three run home run, then Steve Pearce tied it up with a home run off Jansen in the eighth inning. After that, the Red Sox piled on. In the top of the ninth, Boston scored five runs, taking a 9-4 lead into the bottom of the ninth. The Dodgers didn’t go quietly, as Kike Hernandez hit a two-run homer off of Craig Kimbrel. Kimbrel, however, recovered and got the last three outs to win the game and make the series 3–1 in Boston’s favor.
Game 5 stayed in Los Angeles. Price and Kershaw got the starts. Both teams scored in the first inning. Boston scored, thanks to a two-run home run by Pearce. David Freese got one back for the Dodgers with a solo shot in the bottom of the inning. Nobody else scored until the sixth inning, when Betts hit a home run, followed up by a Martinez home run in the seventh to make it 4–1. Kershaw went seven innings, giving up all four runs. In the eighth, Pearce hit his second home run of the night, off Pedro Baez. Price pitched well, allowing only one run over seven plus innings of relief. Joe Kelly and Sale came in to finish the game, Kelly taking the 8th and Sale taking the ninth, each striking out the side to finish the game.
Journeyman Pearce ended up with the Most Valuable Player award for the World Series, and the Dodgers went home empty handed for the second straight year. This wasn’t going to be anyone else’s year but the Red Sox. They were a powerhouse all season long. They earned it.

Hate and hate speech are on the rise in America. As last week’s shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue sadly proved, the U.S. has a darker side.
Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have again come under public scrutiny for their role in perpetuating hate speech by allowing fascist, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist organizations to publish and share content. This has long been a problem with social media and online forums, as unrestricted access combined with lax enforcement of regulatory guidelines often leads to a concentration of toxic individuals, who negatively impact the user experience for everyone else. Just think: how often do you scroll through Facebook comments on a controversial post without coming across something racist or hateful?
Twitter and Facebook are used to this critical attention, and while it’s true that they act as vectors for the spread of hate, there is one entity that hasn’t been shouldering its fair share of the blame: Google. Or more specifically, Google’s video sharing platform, YouTube.
Much like Twitter and Facebook, YouTube’s focus on user-created content inevitably helps the spread of hate speech and bigotry, as members of the alt-right create videos espousing their views. These include such infamous and controversial figures as Alex Jones, founder of Infowars, and Sargon of Akkad, who makes videos countering progressive stances on issues such as LGBTQ rights and feminism.
An analysis of fascist activist chat servers published by Bellingcat found that the majority of respondents credited YouTube with having “red-pilled” them, a term originating from The Matrix and now used to refer to the “awakening” of fascist and anti-Semitic beliefs. These include the beliefs that the Jewish population is at the center of some global conspiracy (commonly called the Jewish Question, or JQ), or that the Holocaust isn’t real.
If YouTube is one of the biggest contributors to the problem, why don’t we hear about it more often?
It could be because YouTube’s algorithms act as a double-edged sword, only suggesting relevant videos to its users: those who don’t affiliate with the alt-right don’t see their videos, while those who do see proportionally more of them. While this shields the majority from controversial content, it also creates an echo-chamber for the minority, concentrating the evil that’s already there. This is different from Twitter and Facebook, where there’s a sense of immediacy in that the comments and tweets are much more in-your-face and harder to avoid.
YouTube has also taken steps towards cracking down on extremist content, albeit through a very heavy-handed approach that involves allowing algorithms to demonetize any video that touches on sensitive social issues or tragedy and conflict, as reported by The Intelligencer. While this helped curb some of the hate, it also affected many prominent YouTube stars and even motivated a shooting at YouTube's headquarters on April 3, 2018, as reported by The New York Times.
The situation raises an uncomfortable question: what should tech companies do?
After any attempt to crack down on hate speech, those who feel they are being silenced lash out and claim that these platforms are infringing upon their First Amendment right to free speech. This has long been a contentious topic, even if the argument isn’t entirely correct: The First Amendment ensures that the government cannot deprive you of your right to free speech, but it doesn’t say anything about private entities like Facebook and Google. Businesses reserve the right to do business with whomever they choose,a point that’s often overlooked.
However, with the great power of censorship and control comes the equally great responsibility to exercise that power judiciously and impartially. After all, there can be a thin line between crass internet humor and actively discriminatory content, and although we as humans have a vague idea about which is which, there’s no objective way to differentiate between the two. As such, it’s very hard to create an algorithm that susses out the good from the bad, especially when computers can’t understand abstract ideas like hate and bigotry.
There has been some backlash against YouTube’s blunt implementation of censorship, with organizations like Prager University claiming that YouTube has restricted some of their more controversial videos, especially ones discussing things like gender equality and racism, as reported by Ars Technica. Twitter and Facebook, on the other hand, are hesitant about taking an editorial approach towards their content, focused more on building their product than managing  its consequences. As Ev Williams, cofounder of Twitter and CEO of Medium, sums it up in an interview with CNN, “...you get into an area where most tech companies would be like, ‘it’s not something that really fits in our model or that we would even be good at.’” But while these companies have tried to avoid taking a proactive role, as the demand for stricter regulations rises, so too does the pressure to change.
No matter how you parse it, tech giants are becoming tied to our divisive politics, since they power the digital forums in which we discuss them. These companies are faced with the dual task of moderating speech while steering away from excessive censorship. Striking that balance is where the real challenge lies: the code that software engineers write might not have inherent ethical values, but the people who create and consume the product sure do, and how these companies choose to uphold their values will have untold consequences for generations to come.

In light of screenshots recovered from Pittsburgh shooter Robert Bowers, Gab.com has been under fire as a platform for radical ideologies. Its strong stance on being the hub for free speech appealed to those whose voices felt silenced under more mainstream social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter.
After the Tree of Life shooting, website registrar GoDaddy pulled out support for Gab, and Gab's website shut down. When trying to enter the website after Oct. 28, a two-paragraph statement popped up. In the first paragraph, Gab stated that it is "under attack," "systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several processors," and "streamed by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people." Despite this backlash, the statement noted that "Gab will continue to fight for the fundamental human right to speak freely."
Despite the 11 deaths and multiple injuries resulting from the shooting, Gab is focusing on how the shooting hurt their relationship with various companies rather than the lives of those affected by the shooting. As of Oct. 29, Gab's website displays a lengthier statement from CEO Andrew Torba.
"No-platform us all you want. Ban us all you want. Smear us all you want...You can't stop an idea [of free speech and liberty.]"
It is unsure when, if ever, Gab will be back. In the meantime, the rest of us are left to grapple with the dilemma of how to move forward with the First Amendment in the digital age.

Bitcoin is the leader in the world of cryptocurrencies, which have exploded onto the digital scene in the last few years for their anonymity and ease of access. Advocates have pointed towards their potential to solve the global financial crises, aid in issues such as homelessness and human trafficking, and prevent fraud and security risks. But a new study from the University of Hawaii at Manoa published in Nature Climate Change has found that if Bitcoin catches on at the rate of other technologies, it could raise global temperatures by as much as 2°C by 2033.
The research team analyzed the power efficiency and geographic location of the computers mining Bitcoins, determining that Bitcoin mining accounted for 69 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2017 alone — approximately the same as the entire state of Arkansas. According to the study, even if Bitcoin is incorporated at the slowest rate past technologies have caught on, it will warm Earth by 2°C in 22 years. 
Findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that this rise in temperature could endanger species such as the polar bear and caribou, place 10 million people at risk of coastal flooding, and reduce water availability in some regions by 30 percent.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rely on a computationally-intensive encryption algorithms. Each transaction requires complex calculations on groups of computers around the world in order to keep a digital record of sales or purchases in what is called a blockchain. So far, Bitcoin mining computers have relied primarily on coal as a cheap source of electricity, with little regard for the environmental consequences.
Randi Rollins, a master’s student at the University of Hawaii and coauthor of the study, said, “Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency with heavy hardware requirements, and this obviously translates into large electricity demands.” Indeed, a study last year found that a single Bitcoin transaction uses enough electricity to power a home for nearly a month.
One way to curb the environmental effects of Bitcoin might be to increase the size of each block on the blockchain record, thereby reducing the amount of computation required for each transaction. However, this would negatively affect speed and efficiency, two main advantages of the cryptocurrency.
“We cannot predict the future of Bitcoin, but if implemented at a rate even close to the slowest pace at which other technologies have been incorporated, it will spell very bad news for climate change and the people and species impacted by it,” said Camilo Mora, associate professor at the University of Hawaii and lead author of the study. He continued, “Right now, there is no reason to be concerned. [But if Bitcoin] continues to grow, it could get out of control pretty fast.”

Men and women tend to use cannabis differently, according to a recent review article published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, which explains that men have been found to use larger amounts of cannabis more frequently than women. Female users, however, are more likely to form unhealthy habits; studies found that women progress faster to problematic cannabis use, show more severe withdrawal symptoms, and are more likely to relapse. Researchers are still unsure about the relative contribution of biological (sex) and socio-cultural (gender) factors on these differences, but emerging evidence from animal studies suggests that hormones play an important role in cannabinoid sensitivity. 
As more and more countries and U.S. states legalize medical and recreational marijuana, the drug's use is increasing. While many see weed as completely benign, scientists believe that about 10 percent of cannabis users will develop an addiction, called cannabis use disorder (CUD). CUD is characterized by high consumption levels and continued use, problems controlling use, cravings, withdrawal, and negative effects on personal, social, and work-related life.
What are cannabinoids?
The term cannabinoid describes a class of molecules that are found in cannabis, including the one non-biologists might be quite familiar with: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A group of similar molecules responsible for intercellular signaling in our bodies, as well as their receptors and several enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation, are named after the plant in which the class was originally identified; they are collectively known as the endogenous (something that originates from within an organism), cannabinoid system or just the endocannabinoid system. The exogenous (from outside an organism) cannabinoids found in marijuana interact with our bodies’ naturally occurring signals by mimicking our endogenous ones. 
Biological sex differences
Studies suggest that there is a high genetic contribution to cannabis use and addiction. Variation in certain genes which tell our bodies how to make the cannabinoid receptors affect how sensitive we are to the drug’s effects. However, scientists have not yet found the genetic variants that are most highly associated with cannabis use. Brain imaging studies have shown that the endocannabinoid system is sexually dimorphic: its makeup depends on biological sex, particularly sex hormones. This difference in cannabinoid sensitivity between men and women provides a biological basis for the differences in cannabis use and addiction between males and females.  
Animal studies
As it turns out, rats are not particularly likely to light a joint or hit a bong without human intervention. Researchers have only recently been able to perform animal studies on the effects of sex hormones on cannabinoid self-administration. This research was limited, as the paper’s authors point out, by the challenges of modeling human cannabis use on lab animals. Reliable protocols of animal cannabinoid self-administration were only development in the late 90’s and early 2000’s. 
Animal studies have since helped to support the theory of hormonal influence. In one study on self-administration of cannabinoids in rats, scientists removed some females’ ovaries. They found that the female rats whose ovaries had been removed were significantly less likely to seek out cannabinoids, indicating that ovarian hormones are important factors in cannabinoid self-administration. One issue with this kind of study is that researchers cannot identify which specific sex hormone is most important in modulating cannabinoid intake, highlighting the need for studies that combine the removal of hormone-producing gonads with specific hormone replacement. 
While some of the differences between the endocannabinoid system in men and women’s brains’ might be permanent, cannabinoid sensitivity overall is not fixed. The density of a certain type of cannabinoid receptor in the brain (CB1R) is dependent on hormonal fluctuations. Levels of sex hormones such as estradiol will change throughout the menstrual cycle and are age-dependent. The level of enzymes which break down cannabinoids fluctuate throughout the cycle, and brain levels of cannabinoid receptors increase with aging in females. 
While scientists are increasingly studying the differences in cannabinoid action between the sexes in animals, the authors note that controlled human studies are still limited.

Despite the message of his smash 2013 hit, singer and rapper Pharrell Williams was not too happy to hear that his song, "Happy," was played at a Trump rally for Future Farmers of America (FFA) merely hours after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. The following Monday, Pharrell's attorney, Howard E. King, wrote a cease and desist letter to President Trump, stating "On the day of the mass murder of eleven human beings at the hands of a deranged ‘nationalist,’ you played his song ‘Happy’ to a crowd at a political event in Indiana. There was nothing ‘happy’ about the tragedy inflicted upon our country on Saturday and no permission was granted for your use of this song for this purpose.”
Disappointing musicians by playing their music at his events is nothing new in Trump's political career. Even just by looking at Trump's political career alone, several musicians were not happy to find that their music was played at events like rallies and announcements. Williams, unfortunately, is the latest addition to the list.
Trump is far from the first politician upset artists by playing their music in an unwanted political context. Perhaps one of the most historically notable examples is Ronald Reagan's use of Bruce Springsteen's song "Born in the U.S.A." Just going by the name of the song and the lively '80s beat, it's easy to understand why Reagan would think this song was a good anthem to base his presidential campaign. However, scratch below the surface and Springsteen's message shines through. The lyrics paint portraits of different Americans "born in the U.S.A." who were thrown into facing the effects of the Vietnam War regardless of their thoughts on the war; all that mattered was the fact they were born in the U.S.A. and thus subordinate to the government and the nation as a whole.
Not quite a patriotic bop as Reagan might've thought it to be.
In 2016, comedian John Oliver aired an episode of his show Last Week Tonight titled "Campaign Songs". There, he raised the issue of unauthorized use of music in political campaigns. The episode closed with a music video featuring various musicians including top artists such as Usher, Cyndi Lauper, and Carnegie Mellon alumnus Josh Groban. Through the playful tune and comedic lyrics, the artists all effectively convey the message of asking politicians to stop using their songs to "make your campaign stop seem cool."
This contemporary instance would have been considered as any other case where a musician did not want to be attached to a politician he or she did not agree with. However, the fact that Williams' hit "Happy" was played after mere hours of what was described as the "deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States" by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) screams tone-deafness. Trump actually had no say in choosing the music; the organizers of the convention did. A spokesperson for FFA claimed that "our organist performed it earlier in the session as part of the music line up that we played during all of our general sessions. Please know, it was not a request by the White House; it was part of a line-up of music that we played throughout the event." Although Trump's response to the shooting has been insensitive, especially in light of his claims on Twitter that the Pittsburgh protests were "staged" and "fake news," the usage of Williams' song was nothing more than another usual horrible coincidence and copyright infringement.
Trump is far from being the last politician to be under fire for the unauthorized usage of music. With the preparation for the 2020 presidential election that will follow right after the 2018 midterm election, we are bound to see more artists dismayed that their music was affiliated with a campaign that contradicts their personal morals. Hopefully, despite the inevitable infringements, we will find more candidates who are more courteous of intellectual property this time around.

At this moment in time, it is especially important that we surround ourselves with friends and do things that we truly enjoy doing. We should prioritize being happy and learning as much as we can about life and the world around us. When things get rough, we have to focus on the positive, because only that will help us move forward. This past weekend, I saw the Snakehips concert in Wiegand gym as a great opportunity to dance and have fun with a couple of my friends.
Every semester, the Activities Board (AB) hosts a concert on campus. I’ve been to several of their concerts, and for the past few years they’ve brought in Electronic Dance Music (EDM) artists. The EDM genre has definitely grown on me, and the AB concerts that I’d been to always felt like dance parties. So when I heard that Snakehips would be performing on campus, I got really excited. To be honest, I hadn’t actually heard of Snakehips before AB advertised the concert. It was only when I decided to click on the Spotify link attached to the Facebook event that I became an immediate fan. Snakehips is a British duo, who became well known for their upbeat remixes of songs by The Weeknd and Banks, and eventually for their singles “All My Friends” with Tinashe and Chance the Rapper, and “Cruel” with ZAYN.
Before the concert started, there was already a long line of people waiting outside the Cohon Center. Everyone seemed really excited and ready to have a good time. Once my friends and I were inside Wiegand, as expected, we found everything completely transformed. The huge stage took up most of the space, making it feel really crowded once more people started arriving. On the side, there was a station where people could put glitter on their faces. The whole atmosphere was filled with free spirits and good vibes, and this made me and my friends even more hyped up for the concert.
Fortunately, we got to the concert pretty early so we could stand in the front row. We were so close to the stage that when the opening act, Social House, started performing, the duo looked straight at us and it felt like they were directly singing to us. Social House are a rhythmic-pop duo originally from Pittsburgh, best known for their 2018 single “Magic in the Hamptons” featuring Lil Yachty. They’ve also co-written songs for artists like Meghan Trainor, DJ Khaled, and Ariana Grande. Something that I found really cool during their performance was that they sampled some of their newest tracks, which they planned on sending to other famous artists. Overall, the crowd loved Social House, and it was a great choice to have them open for Snakehips.
Snakehips came on stage shortly after Social House finished with their act. In contrast to Social House, who spent most of their performance walking around the stage and interacting with the audience, Snakehips stayed behind their turntable, mixing and playing amazing 
beat-dropping music. Immediately, the floor began to shake with people dancing and jumping to the rhythm. It really was like no one in the 
audience had a care in the world; everyone was having fun, feeling young, and letting the music take control. Snakehips played EDM remixes of Sam Smith’s “Too Good at Goodbyes,” Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” Soulja Boy’s “Crank That,” and much more. One of my 
favorite moments was when Snakehips unexpectedly transitioned from playing one song to their single, “Cruel,” which was a song most people in the audience knew and enjoyed.
Snakehips perfectly finished their concert by playing their hit “All My Friends.” There was no better feel-good song they could’ve ended the night with, and they left the audience singing along to every word in the chorus. This really was an amazing time for a lot of people, especially me and my friends. It was a good reminder to prioritize having fun, as much as I prioritize my work and other responsibilities. I’ll be sure to seek out more events like this in Pittsburgh, and I’m definitely interested in the next concert AB hosts. Thanks for the experience, AB!

This weekend, Movies in McConomy will present two of this year’s most crowd-pleasing films.
Crazy Rich Asians
While I have many issues with this film that I have detailed in an article before, there is no denying that the film is a good time to have with friends or a date. It has all the emotion, romantic intrigue, comedy, and heart that a general audience would expect from the romantic comedy genre. If you haven’t checked this one out, I would recommend seeing it once, and definitely go with others to enhance your experience.
Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again!
I will make a confession to you all: Mamma Mia is one of my non-ironic guilty pleasures. I pretend to be edgy and not like these movies, but Mamma Mia and its sequel are the rare films where I am able put down the cynical film snob persona and just revel in the sugar and delight that these two films present. If you are a fan of the original Mamma Mia, you will absolutely love this one (but let’s be honest, if you’re a fan, I know you’ve already seen it). In many ways, I think this sequel actually improved upon the original. The score is outstanding with several memorable tracks, and the cast is having a blast. That’s all you need out of these. Don’t go in looking for an absolute classic like Singin’ in the Rain or a technical marvel like La La Land. This is just pure and simple entertainment. If these movies aren’t your thing, then don’t check them out. For the rest of you, if you want one of the most saccharine musicals in existence, go watch this movie. Sing along to all the words of the songs while you’re at it (this is one of the few acceptable cases of audience participation in theaters).

Music has always brought people together in times of joy, sadness, and anger, and this was the notion that inspired If Not Now, When?, the open mic night on Friday, Nov. 2 at the College of Fine Arts Building. 
The Tree of Life synagogue shooting will leave a lasting impact on the community of Pittsburgh. However, over the past week, the rawness of this tragedy has slowly decreased as the shock wears off. The hate and the anger that the event inspired has been replaced to a certain degree by a profound sadness, but also a hope for a better future in which this community will regain its strength once more and these acts of violence will eventually stop. It's what each song conveyed at the benefit open-mic night that took place. All forms of art were showcased, including instrumentalists, vocal pieces, spoken word, and poetry, but their messages were the same. This act of violence has only made this diverse community stronger and more unified and that we will not let hate divide us.
The event ran from 8:30 to 11 p.m. It was heartwarming to hear from not just students coming forth, but also professors, faculty, and anyone and everyone who had something to say and wished to express it. The event also collected donations for the Tree of Life synagogue. There was a steady stream of people in and out the doors, with people staying for at least one or two performances to show their support.
The Leonard Bernstein quote, "this will be our reply to violence, to make music more intensely, more beautifully, and more devotedly than ever," was used to describe the night. The quote was probably the most apt description. It's almost strange to think of how something so beautiful came out of something so tragic and violent, but it conveys the ultimate message that hate cannot be fought with hate. This concert wasn't just an expression of sorrow for those that lost their lives, but it was about how the anger that the tragedy raised amongst so many people never turned to bitter hate. Hate breeds hate, which breeds violence. The open-mic night didn't just leave people, didn't just leave me, feeling a deep ache for the acts of violence that continue to take place around the world, but also left us touched. Despite the fact that the number of violent acts that occur in this world only seem to increase in brutality, senselessness, and number day by day, people still, and will always, have hope that these acts of violence can be stopped by spreading a message of love and hope.
Each and every one of the artists seemed to bare their heart and soul in their performances in a way that was more moving than words can describe. The music was incredibly vulnerable; it takes an extremely gifted and brave group of artists to express such vulnerability in front of a huge crowd of people. Maybe it was because every performer played not to showcase their talent, but instead to convey emotion, but it made all the difference in the way each piece sounded. I was only planning to stay for a couple of performances, but I ended up staying for well over an hour. There was a sense of community in that hall that made it hard to leave once you entered, and the whole event radiated a sense of purity, despite the violence it was responding to. It leaves a powerful message that the whole community needed to hear: we will get through this together.

Dear Alexandra,
Sometimes it’s hard being at this school. I know Carnegie Mellon is diverse and offers a wide variety of majors, but there is a lot of pressure when it is known for excelling in some areas more than others. Specifically, so much attention seems to go toward those who have more technical majors, such as engineering or computer science, and my major doesn’t fall into either of those categories. Most of the career fairs tend to attract employers seeking students in only those fields, and sometimes my friends seem to belittle my experiences because I am not in one of the sought-after majors like they are. I don’t want to start any fights, but I hate when they make comments that seem to judge my academic choices. It can be really frustrating, and I am having trouble figuring out the right way to approach these problems. Please help.
Not Ordinarily Technical, Crying Sadly 
Dear NOT CS,
I understand that it can be really hard when it seems like everyone else has an advantage, or looks down on what you do. I know it may be easier said than done, but make sure that what you are studying, whatever it may be, makes you happy. If not that, make sure that it will at least help you with where you want to go in the future. School is obviously not all sunshine and rainbows, but if what you’re studying interests you, or provides you with more benefits than costs, the struggle will be worth it in the end.
While it is definitely difficult to face others, especially friends, you may want to consider discussing your point of view with them. You deserve to be here just as much as they do, and if they’re truly your friends, they will be open to hearing your perspective and hopefully will change their behavior to be less judgmental and more respectful of what you do. 
I’m not exactly sure of the scope of the situation, but know that they may not mean it in as negative a way as it may appear. While they might seem arrogant, it might actually be because they lack the skills that you have to excel in your field of choice. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, so it might strike a nerve in them that you’re succeeding in something they’re not as good at.
With regard to the career fairs, I don’t think there’s much we can do on an individual level since we’re not in control of which employers are interested in Carnegie Mellon students and whatnot, but if you’re unsure how to approach getting jobs or internships using your major’s skill set, there are definitely resources available through the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) and Handshake. I probably sound like a broken record when I say this, but there are definitely opportunities if you’re willing to put in the effort. While I haven’t had a lot of experience yet professionally, it’s definitely worth looking into. I know I’ll be doing the same.
Best of luck,
Alexandra

Crêpes Parisiennes is a place I really should go to more often, but I can never find the time to do so. People often say it’s one of the best crepe places they’ve been to, and I know they’re right! It was only when I ran into a couple of friends one afternoon who also had not eaten lunch that I made my first visit to Crêpes Parisiennes in a long time.
The location: The place is right on Craig Street, which makes it easily accessible and convenient. It is pretty small and looks it from the outside, especially with the lone table placed for outdoor seating. Crêpes Parisiennes is also a little distant from the group of restaurants that are situated together, so you’ll have to walk a little further down Craig to get to it.
The vibe:Classy. Crêpes Parisiennes is definitely classy. When you’re sitting in there, it really feels as if you’re sitting in a cafe in Paris. Of course, I’m no expert on Parisian cafes, but the vibes the eatery gives off are very comforting and cozy. The small space definitely creates a nice intimate setting where you can easily bring your laptop to do work or relax with a good book.
The food:The crepes are pretty good. If you’re looking for quality crepes, I would definitely recommend coming here. They do serve a good variety of both savory and sweet crepes, and there are also non-crepe options. What’s great is that whatever you decide to order will be decently priced and filling. In regards to the crepes, the sweet ones are stuffed with just the right amount of filling, while the savory ones always come with a side salad. During my visit, I ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella and berries, deliciously topped with whipped cream and walnuts. It really was a wonderfully satisfying treat to have (and yes, that was all I had for lunch that day).
Lit or Nah: I’m not sure if I would classify Crêpes Parisiennes as “lit,” but I definitely see it as one of the best places to have brunch. The whole atmosphere is so relaxing, the crowd and workers are really nice, and the food is good too! You’ll surely leave this place feeling very satisfied. If you ever feel the need to go to a cute classy cafe, know that there’s one right by campus!

Trayvon Martin. Eric Gardner. Freddie Gray. These are just three of the names of black men who were killed by the police. The Hate U Give adds another name, although fictional, to the list: Khalil Harris. But in this movie, he isn’t just a name, he isn’t just a victim in a grainy video we see on the nightly news. He is a person, a human being, who had a family and loved ones.
One of those loved ones is Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg). This movie is her story, one of finding her voice. The movie’s opening scene is simple but clear, with her father (Russell Hornsby) explaining to her and her siblings how to act around the police. This “talk” is heartbreaking because of the fact that it needs to be said at all. In five minutes, The Hate U Give separates itself from every other young adult novel adaptation and lays down the foundation for the rest of the movie.
Starr is caught between two worlds: her home in the dominantly black Garden Heights with her family, and her preppy white high school with her white boyfriend and basketball teammates. But when she witnesses Khalil’s unjust murder by a white police officer, her life is forever changed.
The Hate U Give puts Black Lives Matter at the forefront through Starr’s transformation into a young, proud, black woman who is ready to fight. As the movie progresses, her shock and sadness turns to frustration and anger, which builds and builds until it bubbles at the surface. Stenberg is a revelation. She carries the movie, and without her authentic, soul-baring performance, it would not work. In a look, Stenberg conveys Starr’s anger, fear, dread, and defeat. But she also shows her hope. Starr’s emotions are palpable and feel real—they are real for the families and friends of the real-life victims of police brutality—and can’t be denied.
The rest of the cast is also stellar. As Starr’s proud father, Hornsby stands strong in his morals and beliefs, guiding Starr while allowing her to make her own decisions. As Starr’s mother, Regina Hall couldn’t be more relatable in her love and worry for her daughter. Issa Rae portrays an activist who is pivotal in Starr’s decision to speak up for Khalil.
The Hate U Give makes a meticulous effort to paint a rounded and layered portrait of the world that Starr lives in. Garden Heights feels deeply rooted, a tight-knit community that stays together, even among gang activity. While the walls of her high school are white and slick and shaded with blue tones, her home is tan and yellow and red like the earth, like a place that you can always go back to.
But Starr is also challenged from multiple perspectives. As a cop, her uncle (Common) must explain the protocol that runs through officers’ heads, reluctantly admitting the systematic racism that is ingrained in the police department. Her friend from school, Haley (Sabrina Carpenter), represents the voice of people who say All Lives Matter (or Blue Lives Matter), who may claim to be inclusive and accepting, but either just don’t understand the meaning of Black Lives Matter, or don’t want to. And Starr’s boyfriend, Chris (KJ Apa), in his kind and lighthearted empathy, in his well-meaning but ignorant “I don’t see color” schtick, shows how white people (and anyone outside the black community) can listen and learn.
This movie forces the audience to watch—it dares us to look away, but we can’t. We can’t turn our eyes away from reality. We can’t turn away from the fact that the injustice onscreen isn’t a fabricated Hollywood creation—it is the reality of African Americans everywhere. This isn’t just entertainment, it’s life, and the gut punch of that realization makes the movie all the more impactful.
Before walking into the movie theater, I didn’t know that the title is taken from a famous 2Pac line: “The Hate U Give Little Infants F— Everyone,” or THUG LIFE. The Hate U Give drives this home. It is a story about black youth and the vicious cycle of all the hate and violence and death in the world only leading to more hate and violence and death. The movie doesn’t sugarcoat things or show a textbook Hollywood happy ending, but I left the theater with a feeling of hope. Hope that more and more people like Starr grow and learn to use their voice and the power they yield in our society. 
The young generation that Starr is a part of is the generation that is leading the fight for justice and equality. Every young person must see The Hate U Give, but every person, period, should see it if they can — it’s real, simple as that.

Joyce Fienberg, one of the 11 victims of the Tree of Life shooting, was an active and invaluable member of the Carnegie Mellon community for almost four decades. Stephen Fienberg, her husband of almost 50 years, was a celebrated professor of Statistics and Social Science at Carnegie Mellon who passed away in December of 2016. Students and faculty alike were shocked and shaken that the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the history of America happened just one mile from campus, but the Carnegie Mellon community was directly impacted by the loss of Joyce Fienberg. In the wake of this heinous act of hate, we must remember the life that she led.
Joyce knew everyone in the Statistics department. She and Stephen treated his graduate students like their own children. The Fienbergs stayed in touch with his students after they graduated and moved on, routinely flying all over the country for weddings and sending gifts at the births of former students’ children. Larry Wasserman, who still teaches statistics at Carnegie Mellon, recalls that when he was hired, Joyce and Stephen took him out for dinner and gave him a tour of Pittsburgh on one of his first nights in the city. The Fienbergs also often welcomed guest lecturers and visiting professors into their home as guests.
Joyce Fienberg, 75, was a retired researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s Learning Research and Development Center. Her friends and family say she always had a smile on her face. She attended morning services at the Tree of Life Synagogue every day since her husband’s death, and on Saturday, Oct. 27, arrived early for Shabbat services. Joyce Fieinberg was among the 11 lives lost when a gunman entered the building and opened fire.
Her funeral was held on Wednesday, Oct. 31, at Congregation Beth Shalom, a conservative synagogue located just a couple blocks up Shady Avenue from Tree of Life. She was buried in the Tree of Life Memorial Park, which is located in the North Hills.
She is survived by her two sons, Howard and Anthony, as well as six grandchildren and a large community of extended family, for whom she was an emotional and logistical center.
Joyce is remembered as a nurturer. In her son Howard’s eulogy, he praised her commitment to others. “Mom spent an inordinate amount of time worrying about other people’s needs, not hers,” he said.
Speaking emotionally and fighting tears at the funeral, Fienberg’s niece Devorah Kurin said, “What made Auntie Joyce special was she cared, and she acted on it.”
Joyce’s nurturing qualities came through in her extensive volunteer work. She actively volunteered at the Tree of Life Synagogue. She was always ready to pick up and drive any elderly person who was unable to travel to synagogue on their own, and often opened the synagogue in the morning to prepare food for congregants.
She also volunteered a couple times a week at the District Courthouse Children’s Room in downtown Pittsburgh. The National Council for Jewish Women, which Joyce was an active member of, established the Children’s Room to take care of children while their parents were in front of the judge or involved in a trial. Joyce took great pride in not just passing time with them, but helping the younger children to learn numbers and letters by reading to them.
Joyce also regularly volunteered with the Family House, a nonprofit that housed the families of patients in extended care at UPMC and Highmark, who had to stay in Pittsburgh for spans of time too long for a hotel stay. She helped keep families together through hard times by providing meals and transportation.
“She was just such a good person,” said Dodie Roskies, one of Joyce’s best friends for 40 years. “She was always there when you needed her.” Wasserman voiced that “If there was one word to describe her, it would be ‘warm.’” Her neighbor, Suzanne Paul, commented that “it seemed impossible that she could ever get mad.”
Joyce and Stephen were married for nearly 50 years. They met as undergraduate students at the University of Toronto, and moved to Pittsburgh in 1980 when he was hired by Carnegie Mellon. Stephen believed in the use of statistics for the greater good and was renowned for his use of statistics in public policy and science. He testified before congress “10-20 times,” according to his friend Wasserman, most notably decrying the unreliability of polygraph tests.
In the two years since Stephen passed away from liver cancer in Dec. 2016, Joyce attended every Carnegie Mellon event that Stephen would have wanted to go to. On Friday Oct. 26, the day before she died, Mrs. Fienberg was on campus for President Farnam Jahanian’s inauguration. Jahanian spoke during the Carnegie Mellon vigil of how they reminisced that day about dinners they had with her late husband.
Joyce adored her family. Every summer, her grandchildren would come to Pittsburgh from Paris, where her son Anthony lives, and stay with her while they attended the Jewish Community Center’s day camps. When they were old enough for sleep away camp at the JCC’s Emma Kaufmann Camp, Joyce worked to prepare them and get them all packed for the week long adventure.
She flew back to Toronto every three weeks to visit her mother, who lived to be 98, and her mother in law, who lived to be 90. When she wasn’t in Toronto, Joyce made sure to call them every day, just to see how they were doing.
“When you think about...how long her mother and her mother-in-law survived, you can only imagine how much time that was,” says Roskies. “It's very difficult to fathom all the things that aren't going to happen because Joyce is not here.”
“How she was able to do all of this is a credit to the enormity of her character,” voiced Joyce’s brother, Robert Libman, in his eulogy. “Our tradition tells us that when a righteous person dies, it is somehow a message for all of us who have been left behind. Perhaps to examine our own lives and our own deeds, and try to urge us to try and do better.” He continued, building in emotion, “She just did and said what was good and right, and modeled that behavior for the rest of us. So in her death we owe it to her, and to ourselves, to try to measure up as best we can to that high level of decency and goodness.”
Suzanne Paul is Jacob Paul’s grandmother.

Jacob Meyers woke up on what he thought would be a typical Saturday morning. But instead, Meyers, a sophomore in Dietrich College, spent the next three hours on his phone, replying to an outpouring of messages from family and friends asking if he was safe as the news of the tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue spread. Meyers was in his room, grappling with this hateful and deadly attack on his community.
Jane Bernstein, professor of English, was running late to an event on campus when she passed the police barrier on Wilkins Avenue, thinking it was some city issue. When she arrived on campus and received a text from her husband, who was in Brazil at the time, she knew something was wrong. It wasn’t until later that she saw the news.
The first thing Jessica Wang heard when she woke up was sirens. A sophomore civil engineering major, Wang heard the wails rushing past her window but she wasn’t able to put two and two together until she checked her Facebook notifications and read the frantic messages of her friends. Her first reaction was panic and fear, then the pressing need to stay where she was: in her room.
The tragedy on Saturday, Oct. 27 in Squirrel Hill has left the families of the 11 innocent victims, the Jewish community in Squirrel Hill, and the city of Pittsburgh grieving in its wake. The members of the Carnegie Mellon University community feel the shock, sorrow, and anger over the events, and the same pressing question of what we do now.
As the president of Chabad of Carnegie Mellon University, a Jewish organization for students, Meyers attended an emergency meeting with the two other Jewish organizations on campus, the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity and the Hillel Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh. The group organized the university gathering last Monday, and decided to paint the fence in remembrance and acknowledgment.
The fence is painted with a simple design. Both sides are black, with two subtle Jewish stars on the front and white handprints on the back. For Meyers, the design represents the duality of the horror and fear of the incident and the beauty and love of the community.
“The front and back of the fence reflect for me the experience that I’ve had this past week, where I’ve been scared and I’ve been anxious, but I’ve also been overwhelmed with love,” Meyers said in an interview. “I think you can see that in the fence. It’s really beautiful.”
The tragedy didn’t process in Bernstein’s mind until Sunday morning. She took a detour to Wilkins Avenue and drove past the synagogue, and that’s when it registered for her. She has been a member of Carnegie Mellon University since 1991 and has personal connections with the Tree of Life synagogue. Her daughter took lessons there, and she was acquainted with two of the victims. Though she is not religious, her Jewish background is an important part of her identity.
“I’m not religious, but I’m very, very culturally Jewish,” she said. “I identify with the culture and all the secular values of Judaism. I am to the world unaffiliated, but in my heart, I’m not. I feel this need to be part of this community in some way.”
Wang is not directly connected to the Tree of Life synagogue or the Jewish community, but as a member of the Carnegie Mellon University and general Pittsburgh communities, she feels forever impacted by the tragedy. She feels the sadness that we all feel after something so terrible, but she also feels the shock and fear of the reality that there are people in the world who feel hate for others because of their ethnicity or their faith.
She has also observed that, although the community is grieving, there is also a sense that at some point, they have to move on.
“When the [school] week started, it was like forget about it and move on,” Wang said in an interview. “I feel kind of removed from it—I think I’m removing myself. But I feel like we need to do more than just reference it.”
Bernstein has also seen this need to detach oneself in the face of tragedy. It is human nature, and turning away may not be necessarily a wrong action, but if one doesn’t hold onto it, then there is a problem.
“After the outpouring of emotion, there’s this tremendous silence,” she said. “In turning away, if there’s any connection with anyone who’s survived in anything, [it’s] being mindful of how lonely it is a month later, and two months later, and three months later. We’ve turned away, as we should, but it’s just that’s the really hard part, what comes much later.”
Since last Saturday, one of the biggest questions people are asking is, “What do I do now?” or “How can I do something?”
Meyers has been active in fundraising events benefiting the Tree of Life synagogue and its congregants, but in the aftermath of this tragedy, he is looking inward at himself and taking this time to reaffirm and rededicate himself to his faith. He made the decision to wear a yarmulke for the week after and has focused on bringing light into the darkness of this experience.
“For me, the call to action is a religious thing, and it’s a spiritual thing,” Meyers said. “Now, more than ever, I’m proud to be Jewish and I want people to know that I’m Jewish, and in the face of anti-Semitism and in the face of tragedy, [I’m] more proud than ever to be Jewish.”
Wang sees this as an opportunity for Pittsburgh to do something while the world’s eyes are directed on the city. She doesn’t know what, but she does know one thing: “I don’t want to move on from this moment.”
One potential response that some in the community have encouraged is voting this coming Tuesday, Nov. 6. In the past week, posters popped up along the Cut reminding everyone to vote, and speakers at most of the remembrance events hosted this week asked onlookers to find an outlet for their grief at the polls.
“I do believe strongly that the rhetoric we hear from the President is just flaming all these isolated angry people and giving permission for all this hate to be expressed and manifested,” Bernstein said. “Sometimes the ‘take action’ piece doesn’t happen immediately, it happens in a change—getting out of being complacent…That every voice counts, every vote counts, every effort counts, and it’s time to be heard.”
The Jewish idea of tikkun olam encapsulates this feeling. It can be translated to “heal the world,” and is something Bernstein deeply believes in.
“You can’t change everything, and you can’t be overwhelmed and think it’s too much…You choose to really look at something closely and do your part and tikkun olam.”

Since its opening in the fall of 2017, the MakerWing on Hamerschlag C-level (newly dubbed Tech Spark) has been the backbone of hands-on learning at Carnegie Mellon. With ample hand tooling space, laser cutters, 3D-printers, mills, CNC machines, and a computer lab, it provides a space where students from the College of Engineering can come and learn — under supervision — the basics of rapid prototyping and product development. It even has a metal fabrication shop with saws, welding equipment, and grinders. A number of departments have taken advantage of the MakerWing’s resources for project classes, and starting this fall students can sign up for the new Maker Series classes, taught in the shop. However, the space has not seemed as attractive to some student groups who undertake engineering projects every year.
Tech Spark is the second project of the university’s 3-part maker ecosystem, as outlined in the strategic plan 2025. First came Scott Hall’s Nanofab lab in 2015, in which students can manufacture nano-scale materials, and next comes the 36,000 square-foot ANSYS Hall, set to open in the summer of 2020. The ANSYS building will house facilities fit for large-scale assemblies, as well as physical modelling software centers sponsored by the building’s namesake. When the Ecosystem is complete, one corner of campus will hold all the resources students need to make a product - from material fabrication, to component prototyping, to computer modelling and final assembly.
While the many benefits of this centralization effort are broadcast on university webpages and news features, there are those who worry about its consequences for some of Carnegie Mellon’s most celebrated traditions.
A half mile across campus, away from administrative offices and buried under the concrete and asphalt of the East Campus Garage, lies a labyrinth of rooms and storage cages that is home to over twenty-five student organizations. It is within these paint-splattered walls that booths, buggies, and electric race cars are born. The shops here are run by students, under certain safety protocols dictated by university Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S). Because EH&S can’t staff the student shops the way Tech Spark can, there is no formal safety policy from the university, and the shop relies on student shop managers to ensure that the heavy machinery housed in the basement rooms is safe to use. This leads to situations where jurisdiction over the safety of the machines is unclear, such as the sequence of events that resulted in the decommissioning of the CNC Mill
Heavy machinery such as the $10,000 computer numerical control (CNC) machine is housed in the Carnegie Mellon Racing shop. The doors to this massive metal box were malfunctioning over the summer, along with other issues, and repairs by a third-party technician were not enough to salvage the machine. A TechSpark staff member deemed the CNC mill to be in an unsatisfactory condition, and a lock was placed on its power switch, effectively decommissioning it
Pieter De Buck, the vice president of competitive analysis for CMR, explained the changes in the club’s operations now that their CNC machine is down. While the Tech Spark machines are newer and higher quality, they are public resources. That means sharing tools with other users and recalibrating the machine multiple times for one part. With complex components, it’s hard to finish in a reasonable amount of time. “This part could take over 30 hours in the CNC,” said De Buck, holding a football-sized piece of aluminum, “and we have to make four of them.”
The decommission is standard procedure, says Melanie Lucht, Associate Vice President and Chief Risk Officer for the university. “If something is found to be unsafe for operation, we work with student groups to figure out if we can get it working or if it just needs to be decommissioned,” she explained. Student groups agree to this policy when they use shop spaces.
What makes this instance different is that, with the new Maker Ecosystem, the machine may never get fixed: last month, there was a proposal to move student shop large power tool access to Tech Spark. The proposal, says Lucht, arose from a strategic plan to increase the “opportunity for additional resources, and to provide students with safer spaces with newer equipment, that have regular access to faculty and staff support.”
To some members of Carnegie Mellon’s oldest making community, however, this shift feels paternalistic. Along with CMR, buggy teams would be affected, and eventually booth as well. This prompted the sweepstakes community to organize and enter close conversations with EH&S, SLICE, and the College of Engineering about how to make student shops safer without switching to the Maker Ecosystem.
Diya Nuxoll, head mechanic of Fringe buggy, expressed concern that the operating hours of the MakerWing don’t fit with student groups’ schedules, but saw the reasoning behind closing certain machinery down during the current 11 p.m.-8 a.m. moratorium on student shop activity. “It's not realistic to limit all work during that window because teams go down to the shop to get their buggies for rolls around 4 a.m.,” she said, citing last-minute fixes that don’t require heavy power tools, “but it is totally reasonable to limit work with mills, lathes, drill presses, and bandsaws.”
Students have identified other problems, such as overcrowding. The MakerWing is busy, especially in the weeks leading up to carnival when class projects are due, which is the most crucial build period for buggy teams. Along with that come concerns over a lack of storage space and machines: most teams have upwards of three buggies in the shop at any given time, and there is already limited storage in the Maker Ecosystem.
In a brainstorming document, some students pointed out that a lack of equipment could create unfair advantages for certain teams: “To remove the capabilities to have our own machines would inhibit our competitive ability and enhance the competitive advantage of teams who outsource parts and have donated money for such parts.”
Some changes are less technical. Since its inception, buggy has been an activity that allows students from all educational paths to take part in a unique engineering project. To gain access to the Tech Spark machine shops, students would have to take the CIT-preference Maker Series classes. Andre Gutierrez, a mechanic for Apex buggy, explained the issue: “For certain students in the humanities, fine arts, and even drama departments, it’s difficult to accommodate the Maker Series classes. Students on my team take great pride on manufacturing parts in our shop that end up on the buggy.”
Though vague with details, Ms. Lucht made it clear that EH&S is working with student groups. “We’re looking at space, equipment, and staffing, and making sure to engage student groups as we do that,” she said, giving a nod to the tough spot her role places her in. From a safety standpoint, it’s hard to know what’s going on day-to-day in the student shops, and the 2011 death of a Yale student using a lathe in a university shop after hours has put greater pressure on preemptive measures.
To some students, however, this whole process feels more political than anything else. “The College of Engineering wants to please its donors for the ANSYS building,” said one buggy mechanic, “and wants to be able to say that we have one beautiful machine shop that everyone on campus uses.”
There is currently no deadline for the switch, or a guarantee that it will occur at all. Conversations are ongoing between students the various university stakeholders, leaving the future in limbo. In the CMR shop, a space that has become home to many who participate, life goes on as normal. Beneath trophies dating back to 1993 and framed T-shirts hung haphazardly on the walls, student mechanics tend quietly to their parts, stepping around the locked CNC machine whose fate will be decided once the talks are done.

The midterm elections are quickly approaching, and political races across the country are heating up. This year’s midterm elections are especially important; President Donald Trump is reportedly concerned with the potential outcome of the elections. Allegedly, he and his administration are both worried that Democrats have a strong chance at taking control of the House of Representatives. With the midterms coming halfway through Trump’s term as President, the results of the elections could have a serious effect on the direction of his policy and his ability to enact certain bills, especially if, as he fears, Democrats are able to take control of the House. Of the 435 seats, many are for up for grabs, while 35 out of the 100 Senate seats are up for reelection. A 23-seat net gain in the House would give the Democrats control, while they only require a two-seat net gain to have a majority in the Senate. These slim margins appear even more crucial in light of recent events, such as Trump’s decision to send thousands of United States military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to stem an imagined influx of asylum seekers. Additionally, right-wing extremists have committed two recent acts of domestic terrorism: the attempted mail bombings of Democratic leaders by Cesar Sayoc and the hate-fueled shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh by Robert Bowers. These incidents have only fanned the flames and intensified the Democrats' calls to get out and vote. With the stage set for a critical midterm election, here are The Tartan’s endorsements for the 2018 elections.
Tom Wolf (D)
Tom Wolf has been serving as Governor of Pennsylvania since 2015, and in these ever-uncertain times, The Tartan believes he is the right leader for Pennsylvania. Part of Wolf’s appeal comes from his reliability to fulfill promises he made on the campaign trail. Wolf is a strong proponent of increasing education funding and in his term upped state support for public education by over $2 billion. He is seeking to increase the state’s share of the cost of public education from the current figure of 35-37 percent to closer to 50 percent. Wolf has also worked to make the state government more accountable and ethical by implementing a gift ban. While he does not have the authority to raise the minimum wage throughout Pennsylvania, Wolf’s tenure has seen an increased minimum wage for state government employees and state contractors’ employees—this year he signed an executive order to up the hourly wage from $10.20 to $12 an hour. His order also includes a plan to tie the minimum wage to cost-of-living figures, and he hopes that his efforts can lead to a rise in the minimum wage for all workers in Pennsylvania. Wolf is also a strong believer in increasing access to health care and has expanded Medicaid to cover 720,000 additional Pennsylvanians. Many of these newly covered patients suffer from substance abuse disorders, and this expansion is especially crucial given the persisting opioid crisis. Wolf has also fought to defend women’s and civil rights, by vetoing bills that threatened abortion rights and prevent discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. Wolf is running against Republican Scott Wagner, whose meager list of achievements in the state Senate and Trumpian bullying make him pale in comparison to the incumbent Tom Wolf.
Bob Casey Jr. (D)
For the Senate, The Tartan endorses another incumbent Democrat, Senator Bob Casey Jr. Having served since 2012, Casey fights for many of the same causes as Wolf, including access to healthcare and worker wage improvements. Casey has called for increased funding for public schools and has opposed programs sending taxpayer money to support private schools. Casey is also a strong supporter of environmentalists' efforts to stop the spread of climate change and has voted for bills that would expand background checks for firearms and ban high-capacity gun magazines. Casey has voted against attempts to repeal Obamacare and has sought to offer a public option for health insurance. One of Casey’s most important factors is his emphasis on working with, rather than against, Republicans to combat an increasingly polarized political sphere. Like Wolf, Casey is facing off against a Trump-like Republican candidate, Lou Barletta, who has questioned the scientific truth of climate change and adamantly opposes Obamacare.
Dan Frankel (D)
On the state level, there are also pivotal races in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The winners of these elections will go on to work with the Pennsylvania State Senate and the governor of Pennsylvania to pass laws and craft a state budget, along with other a areas of public policy like taxes. Representing Allegheny County and District 23 is Democrat Dan Frankel, who is running for reelection. Frankel has a lot of experience, having served as a member of the Pennsylvania House since 1999, and holds the role of the Democratic caucus chair. Additionally, Frankel has been an avid champion of the Pennsylvania Fairness Act, which would bring the state’s non-discrimination laws up to date by adding explicit protections for LGBTQ+ people in housing, workplace environments, and other public places.
Election Day is this Tuesday, November 6th. If you are registered to vote in Pennsylvania, you can find your polling station at https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx. If you are registered to vote in your home state, don’t forget to submit your absentee ballot.

The first major shooting that really impacted me was the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on Feb. 14, 2018. As a jaded senior excited about graduation and going to college at Carnegie Mellon, the shooting shocked me out of my final semester reverie.
When news of the shooting first came out, the details were horrifying. As reported by CNN, Nikolas Cruz, the lone gunman responsible for this heinous crime, walked into Stoneman Douglas with an AR-15 rifle and opened fire, killing 17 people during his rampage through the building. This made for the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook, nearly six years prior.
It was a sobering reminder that evil existed outside the confines of history and wars and international terrorism; it was very much alive and far closer than any of us ever suspected. All my friends and I talked about for the next three weeks was the shooting, and even after countless discussions, the sadness, anger, and fear never really dissipated. I hoped that that would be the nearest I ever came to such a tragedy, both geographically and emotionally.
And then this past Saturday happened, less than a mile away from campus.
A different gunman, a different group of people, a different location, but it was the same sickening narrative, an act of evil and spite that caused lasting physical and emotional damage, and one that tore at the very fabric of a loving community.
After every crime and incident, two things follow: the facts and the opinions. The facts are straightforward, and despite what those who decry the mainstream media as “fake news” might think, are undisputable: on Oct. 27, Robert Bowers entered the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill and opened fire on a congregation engaged in worship, killing 11 innocent people. He was apprehended by the police after sustaining gunshot wounds himself and is now being held in custody.
The opinions, on the other hand, are not as clear-cut. Every time something bad happens, there’s a human tendency to want to blame an individual or a group and to hold some entity accountable. Following the shooting, Facebook comments and online forums held true to this pattern, where alongside the thoughts and prayers, many pointed fingers at Trump and the Republicans, citing Trump’s rhetoric for inflaming and normalizing anti-Semitic ideals and emboldening hate groups while blaming Republicans for their refusal to enact stricter gun control laws. Unsurprisingly, supporters of the present administration retaliated with equal parts vigor and vitriol.
It’s not hard to see why people might think this way: Trump belched some pretty awful things during his campaign and has only continued to get worse and worse as we venture further into his quagmire of a presidency, while the Republicans have always been opposed to any perceived infringements of the Second Amendment.
Even though the current government has been a nexus of frustration for Americans, it’s important to realize that as soon as you take a situation in a political direction, you’ve crossed the Rubicon. People will argue their politics ad infinitum, and with how polarized everything is, debates are far more destructive than constructive, focusing on who won rather than what was achieved.
When you capitalize on a tragedy politically, you are wantonly sparking a heated battle, where both the anonymity and disconnection of the internet enables people to say things they otherwise would not say in real life. This leads to an endless conflict which obscures the real issues, refocusing all the attention on the political rather than social arena. When people begin hurling insults at the opposing side, they do so not in the name or in the service of the victims, but to defend their own values.
I’m not saying that we should not have political discussions about these tragedies; a lot of the problems that we face are rooted in the political system, and those must be addressed. However, we should approach them in an appropriate and measured manner when both sides are ready for civil discourse instead of calling each other out in the comments section of a Facebook post. By doing this, we lose sight of our common humanity, contributing to a divide that conceals just how similar we are to one another.
I’m not going to pretend that we live in an ideal world, where everyone can agree on everything. By nature, we each have very different views, and the political machinery of our nation helps to codify those views into opposing sides, pitting one group against another in the process. Coming wholly together is not likely to happen, nor should it: diversity, if employed properly, can be a major asset.
However, unlike what pundits such as Ben Shapiro believe, I don’t think the answer is to leave each other alone either. America was founded upon the ideals of liberty and fraternity, and if our history has taught us anything, it’s that people from wildly different backgrounds can come together and work for the greater good of the nation, even if they clash on fundamental issues.
As citizens of the U.S., that is what we are tasked with in these dark times. We may not be able to agree on petty politics, but the majority of us (fascists and white supremacists excluded) can agree on more noble values, such as the sanctity of life and the freedom of worship. If we choose to focus on the fact that those unalienable rights — to which every American regardless of gender, color, or creed is entitled to — were violated this past Saturday rather than shifting blame, then we have already taken a bold step forward in conquering the divisiveness that’s sown by those who would rather see us at each other’s throats than having each other’s backs.
The 11 lives that were wrongfully taken will join the hundreds who have already fallen to the scourge of domestic terrorism, and it’s unlikely that they will be the last. People are fond of saying that if we don’t learn from our past, we are doomed to repeat it. Instead of submitting to this vicious cycle, we must have the courage to break it, to swallow our tribalism and to reach out to each other as humans beyond all pretense. After all, I think everyone can agree that the deaths of innocent people should not be a daily occurrence.

It’s a typical work-filled Saturday morning. There’s a notification waiting for me on my phone from CMUAlert. It said there was a police operation happening at Shady and Wilkins, and told the community to avoid the area.
Another one. Active shooter at Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill. By then, national reporters typically posting the latest on the president and Congress were already retweeting reports on Pittsburgh, making me simultaneously confused about what exactly was happening and hoping against hope that it was nothing.
Of course, as we all now know too well, it wasn’t nothing. A gunman, driven by pure hatred to terrorize and kill innocents in a place of worship, a place where they were supposed to have been the safest, cold-bloodedly shot and killed 11 and wounded several more. Those killed were sweet and compassionate in their smiles in those pictures broadcast on the evening news. They could have been your grandparents or mine. They were our neighbors, sharing the city we call home or adopted home. So many knew them professionally, as friends, or as family members.
Yet, despite the tears and the shattered hearts, the absence of words to convey how this could happen in this closely-knit Squirrel Hill community, the sinking feeling that we were now dealing with the aftermath of another mass shooting, Pittsburghers and people all over the nation came together in solidarity. They came together to light candles, place flowers and honor those killed, but they also came together to send a strong statement in defiance of evil and hatred. They came together online, with people using the hashtag #StrongerThanHate on their profile photos. Before a game, the Pittsburgh Penguins honored the heroes who are the first responders, who ran into mortal danger in order to save lives.   
Read some signs around Pittsburgh:
“No matter where you are from, we're glad you’re our neighbor.”
“Hate cannot weaken a city of steel.”
On my street corner, a man quietly held a sign on Tuesday saying “Pittsburgh // Proud Home of Refugees and Immigrants.”
In a moment when it felt like evil was about to make its triumph once again, these signs reminded us that after a destructive fire comes the green shoots, that after darkness, there is the light. There is hope if you look around. When evil showed its ugly face, the most selfless and courageous parts of humanity were there to stand up to the evil. 
On the CBS Evening News, correspondent David Begnaud reminded the Pittsburgh community and the nation that “Mr. Fred Rogers, who lived in the neighborhood, used to tell children that in times of trouble, look for the helpers. Mr. Rogers, we found them.” The helpers were, indeed, the light that shined where our hearts despaired; they were the kindness that is the only antidote to hatred. 
Through compassion, the Pittsburgh I know as my adopted hometown and the Carnegie Mellon I know as my school emerged strong in unity and love. A vigil on campus honoring the deceased had over 1,500 attendees, with many more turned away due to lack of space. Many students walking by the fence took a moment to place a small stone on the top of the fence in a gesture to honor the victims. In each stone: a blessing sent to the deceased, a sadness that this happened, a show of support for the families and for the Jewish community. In one collective voice, we said: we stand for something so much better and stronger and everlasting than the small-minded, violent thoughts and deeds of one person. 
We may not be able to completely eradicate hateful views, but the goodness of most people is also unfailingly strong. The flame of kindness may flutter in the wind, but it refuses to be blown out. The tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue hit close to home. Yet, just as close to home was the Pittsburgh spirit, a star shining bright in a moment marred by tragedy.

Time and time again, we see the bolded headlines and aerial shots of groups walking, each story starting with “BREAKING!” and ending with another update about the current Central American migrant caravan. Yes, it is considered one of the largest caravans to assemble and travel northward toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Yes, they are all seeking asylum. And yes, they are walking thousands of miles for a reason. Unfortunately, it seems that American news sites continuously overlook the reasons why a family would decide to leave the place they call home.
Before we can recognize the factors that would push people to leave their native country, we should realize a few things about migrant caravans in general. One, they are more common than you think; what makes this one different is its size. The United Nations currently estimates that there are about 7,000 people traveling in the caravan. Yet again, after considering the “what” and “how many” aspects of the caravan, we must look at the “why.” In basic terms, there is safety in numbers. After all, the migrants are traveling on the same roads used by kidnapping gangs and other criminals. Additionally, given the large crowd, the police is bound to keep an eye on them. Second, migrants are desperate; they have waited for the chance to leave, and now they can for cheaper than usual. The other option for many families would have been to hire an expert smuggler who knows the way north; however, these guides can cost up to $10,000, and in impoverished countries, this amount is simply not feasible. 
Now, we must consider: what situation forces a family to drop everything, join a caravan, and never look back? Most of the families in the caravan are from Honduras, a country located in Central America. When considering the social and political issues surrounding the country at the moment, the 2,300 children estimated to be traveling north seems to make more sense. 
Honduras has a long history of military rule, corruption, poverty, and crime, including a U.S. backed military coup in 2009 that radically destabilized the country. Consequently, in a country where over half the population lives below the poverty line and where gang violence reigns, the murder rate per capita is one of the world’s highest. The threat of murder is faced by journalists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, lawyers, human rights defenders, and environmental activists who try to fight for the rights of the Honduran people. Even regular citizens who are simply trying to feed their families fear for their lives. Lurking behind this threat is the Honduran police, who are extremely corrupt. As of May 2017, through the Special Commission for Police Reform Restructuring committee, an estimated 4,000 of the more than 9,000 police officers in question had been removed. That’s almost half of them. However, despite alleged involvement in criminal activities, these officers are rarely ever convicted. 
Honduras is in a state of crisis. For many of the 9 million citizens, remaining in their homes is equal to accepting death. Deciding to leave everything they are familiar with to migrate north, and risking dehydration, sickness, and countless hardships is not an easy thing to do. Migrant caravans are not herds of criminals, waiting to destroy the United States; they are refugees escaping the suffocating rule of a military government. How can they be criminals if they are running away from crime itself?

Eight years after she was charged with blasphemy, Asia Bibi has been acquitted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan this week on the grounds of insufficient evidence. That decision has thrown the country into turmoil, with several fundamentalist groups calling for her execution and protesting the acquittal. In 2010, Asia Bibi, a poor berry-picker whose family were the only Christians in her village, was charged with blasphemy when her Muslim neighbors accused her of insulting the Prophet after she drank water from the same glass as them. Under Pakistan’s blasphemy law, the accusation on her could result in her death. 
And sentenced to death she was. Her final appeal remained pending in the Supreme court for 8 years, until Oct. 31, 2018, when the Supreme Court acquitted her. Several clerics condemned the acquittal and called for her death. The judges who delivered the verdict have received death threats. Reporters were afraid to cover the case, as they too had received death threats from protesters. Messages were sent to soldiers asking them to rebel against officers. The situation worsened to the point that on Nov. 2, the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan ended up negotiating a deal with the Islamist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party, which was very vocal in demanding Bibi’s execution, that even after her release, Bibi and her family would not be allowed to leave the country and that some arrested protesters will be released.
On Saturday,  fearing for his life, her lawyer Saif Mulook fled the country. He has more than enough reasons to fear. Over the last eight years, this case has brought out the weaknesses in Pakistan’s social, political, and legal systems, all of which are heavily reliant on the dictates of the nation’s official religion, Islam. The infamous blasphemy laws are often used to target religious minorities and are used to persecute them and to settle scores in case of dispute with false allegations. Over 60 people had been murdered extrajudicially since 1990 after they were accused of blasphemy. The only two political leaders who supported Bibi in this arduous journey lasting eight years, Salman Tasseer and Shahbaz Bhatti, were both assassinated by hardliners for advocating against the blasphemy laws. 
Perhaps Bibi would have met the same fate had it not been for the immense international pressure on the government (The European Union had informed the Pakistani government that the future of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) status of Pakistan is directly linked to the outcome of the case, and the Pope had called Asia Bibi a “martyr”), and also the fact that witnesses in the case had often contradicted each other’s statements or retracted their own, leading to her acquittal. The acquittal certainly betters the independent image of the Pakistani judicial system, which didn’t buckle under the intense domestic pressure from hardliners. That doesn’t change the fact that eight years of Bibi’s life have been stolen away, she and her family have faced immense violence, her humanity has been trivialized and the ugly head of intolerance has reared its head, all because Bibi is a religious minority from a lower caste, whose neighbors held a grudge against her because of her faith.
Although many countries had offered asylum to Asia Bibi and her family, the new deal reached by the government and the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party will put her on the country’s no-fly list, preventing her from leaving the country.  The government is blatantly choosing to appease the bloodthirsty fundamentalist political factions over the safety of an individual who has been deemed innocent by the highest court in the land.  Pakistan’s political machinery has always encouraged heightened friction between religions and incites people for the fulfillment of their own agendas as a means to appeal to the sentiments of the religious majority.
Jamaat-e-Islaami (JI) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), both of which were previously accused of terrorism (LeT has masterminded the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai which killed over 200 people), and several other Clerics joined hands with Tehreek-e-Labbaik to pour into the streets of Islamabad, demanding the reversal of the acquittal. After all, as Antonio says in the Merchant of Venice, “the Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.”
The saga of Asia Bibi’s fight for justice will continue until the final review petition is heard by the Supreme Court. Until then, it’s the might of a frenzied mob of fundamentalists versus the unwavering conviction of the berry-picker whose inner strength has led her through eight years of suffering.

Social justice is important. Without the work of social justice advocates, progress in society would not be possible. Women and racial minorities would still be treated as property, and the nation would really be built to solely benefit the cisgender, heterosexual white male. Although it is vital for us to stay abreast of current issues and ensuring our society is as equitable as possible for all regardless of qualities such as age, gender, or sexuality, there comes a point in which being cognizant of different factors that can oppress individuals becomes almost a comparison to see who is more or less privileged than others.
Journalist and black rights activist Shaun King tweeted almost immediately after the shooter, Robert Bowers of the Tree of Life Synagogue tragedy, had been caught and identified, in response to the shooting.
"It's amazing just how capable American police are at peacefully arresting heavily armed white men who just murdered scores of people without shooting, tasering, or even scratching them. I'm not even playing - I commend them. We'd just like that expertise in our communities too."
Although I agree that police brutality and racial profiling are both important issues, this tweet came off as tone-deaf. Yes, anti-Semitism is not the only kind of discrimination that we grapple with in this country, but having a politicizing a tragedy to fit one's political agenda feels insensitive at best.
Before proceeding, I would like to make a correction to the tweet: shooter Robert Bowers was injured; when captured, he was reported to be in "critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds." However, one could argue that the fact that Bowers was able to be captured alive despite being heavily armed, while countless innocent and unarmed black men were not is still worth bringing up.
Of course, trying to keep things in perspective is important. While we tackle issues such as reproductive rights and voter suppression, we can and must remain vigilant of other topics such as freedom of speech and education. However, what King had tweeted came across less so of a "put things in perspective" narrative but more so a "this tragedy happened, but how can I fit it to continue my political narrative?"
This kind of divisive mentality leads to the concept of intersectionality dividing people into categories more than it brings people together. Intersectionality's purpose is to see how different factors can impact the human experience differently. However, it appears as though the attempt at categorizing people based on traits such as gender, sexuality, religion, and race reduces people into various labels.
King's tweet highlights what is sometimes referred to as the "Oppression Olympics." In 2017, a column from the Chicago Tribune titled "No one wins the oppression olympics" notes that trying to measure who has it better or worse is not fruitful in creating a more just and fair society. "Perhaps it's time to stop focusing on how our particular privileges help us and start thinking about how to use whatever privileges we may possess to make others' lives better — regardless of whether we agree with their politics," the author ends her column.
So if I were King, how would I have reminded people to come together to fight discrimination and prejudice? Firstly, I would have focused on the impact of the tweet on the Jewish community. At the end of the day, 11 innocent people lost their lives and several more were injured at the synagogue. That's 11 lives that are lost and countless more affected from that one act of violence alone. With a platform as large as King's, I would have expected him to call for unity to stand against hatred. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), anti-Semitic hate crimes have increased by 57 percent in the past year, the highest it's been since 1979. It's clear that Tree of Life is not an outlier or something that can be dismissed as an isolated incident, just as "yet another" case of racist policing should not be treated as though it is an isolated incident, and not part of a bigger problem.
Caring about one problem does not detract from caring about another. Just because the media attention is focused on one tragedy does not diminish the importance of another. Times like these, where our country is hurting, call for us to stand in solidarity with one another, not division. Although I doubt that King had malicious intention, I hope that he recognizes the importance of his platform and uses it to convey messages with more sensitivity.

As a life-long registered voter, it is my hope that the citizens of the United States will make the effort to vote in what many consider to be perhaps the most important election in the history of this country. Just as with my fellow countrymen, I am not satisfied with the direction our nation is going specifically when it comes to healthcare (pre-existing conditions), the economy (stagnant wages), immigration (bias), education (teacher pensions), and gun regulation (AR-15 and bump stocks). We as a society have also seen a rise in sexual harassment and abuse as well as hate directed at African Americans, Hispanics, and Jews. Frankly, this election is a clear choice between those who have never had it so good and those of us who know we can do better.
Members of the Republican Party, you have had plenty of time to help the American people and have failed them by your own choosing. The one thing that trumps capitalism and political correctness in the United States is the right to have one's voice heard. This is the foundation on which our democracy is built.
Accordingly, let the call go forth among all citizens of this country that, as brothers and sisters of democracy, voting is a start to dealing with every trial and tribulation you may encounter during the crisis facing this nation. To the people of the United States, the trumpet of freedom beckons you to exercise your suffrage and ensure your vote to preserve your sacred freedoms, promote your children's future, and retain the blessings of liberty that we all cherish.
My fellow Americans, the hour of your redemption is at hand. As you, the rightful citizens, move forward to reclaim your country, rise and vote! In the memory of those who died fighting for everyone's rights, rise, and vote! To restrain the excesses of the current occupants in the White House, rise and vote! Let no one continue to fear. Let every person be strong and push on for their freedom. Rise and vote!
Never let it be said that this was the time when the tide ran out on the United States but rather was the time when the tide came in to restore justice and fairness.
