All of Pittsburgh had been waiting for this day for two weeks. Unfortunately for them, the Steelers came up short in the Super Bowl XLV by a score of 31–25, leaving them with “only” six Super Bowl Championships. For a game with so much anticipation and build-up for the city, the Steelers couldn’t have come out flatter, putting together a terrible first quarter to kick off the game.
Pittsburgh started off with the ball in the first quarter, and subsequently went three and out in an ugly series. Fortunately for the Steelers, they were able to stop the prolific Packers offense, who presented a terrible matchup for the Steelers all game. After another Steelers three and out, quarterback Aaron Rodgers went to work, picking apart the weak Steelers secondary in a masterful drive that culminated with a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson. However, the Packers weren’t finished. On the next Steelers possession, QB Ben Roethlisberger got hit as he threw, and was promptly intercepted for a touchdown by safety Nick Collins. Just like that, it was 14–0 Green Bay.
After that awful first quarter, the Steelers picked it up a bit, playing with the Packers throughout a second quarter which was marked with injuries. The Steelers were able to manufacture a field goal to make the score 14–3, but again, the Packers answered with a methodical drive that baffled the Steelers secondary. The drive ended with a twenty-one yard touchdown strike to the dangerous Greg Jennings as Troy Polamalu laid out Jennings in the end zone. With just two minutes left in the half and an 18-point deficit, Roethilisberger engineered a 77-yard drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown pass to the Super Bowl veteran Hines Ward. The second quarter for the Green Bay side was especially littered with injuries, a theme which was the story of the 2010 Packers season. Pro-Bowl CB Charles Woodson, starting CB Sam Shields, and Collins all left the field at some point in the quarter, along with Steelers WR Emmanuel Sanders.
Following a pretty uninspiring halftime performance by the auto-tuned Black Eyed Peas, the Packers got the ball and looked to put the game away, but a drop by WR James Jones on a sure touchdown gave the ball back to the Steelers. After a questionable face mask penalty, the Steelers ran the ball down the throats of the Packers with premiere running back Rashard Mendenhall to get the game within four points, 21–17. With all the momentum on their side, it seemed as if the Steelers would take the lead on their next possession as they drove inside the Packers’ 30. With a fresh set of downs, the Steelers were poised to take the lead but were stopped with a third-down sack of Big Ben. The Steelers’ head coach then made a questionable decision, going for a 52-yard field goal with journeyman kicker Shane Suisham. Of course, Suisham badly missed, and although the Packers didn’t score, the field position was changed and the Steelers had to start their drive from their own 11-yard line. The third quarter ended with a few punts back and forth, leading to the decisive fourth quarter.
With the start of the fourth quarter and the Steelers threatening to score again, the Steeler Nation was ecstatic. That was until a costly fumble by Mendenhall at the Packers’ 35-yard line created a potential 14-point swing, as Rodgers passed to Greg Jennings for an eight yard touchdown and a 28–17 lead. It looked bleak for Pittsburgh, but the Steelers weren’t done yet. Short pass after short pass was completed from Big Ben to receivers like Ward, Wallace, and Brown, and eventually Roethlisberger feathered in a perfect pass to Wallace for a beautiful 25-yard touchdown pass over the injured Sam Shields. Pittsburgh then succeeded on the two-point conversion, putting them within a field goal. Then the weakness of the Steelers showed itself again, as a third down completion to the elusive Greg Jennings brought the Packers within Steeler territory, and another completion to James Jones brought them into the red zone. The Steelers’ defense held the Packers to a field goal and setting up a potential game-winning drive for Pittsburgh in the final two minutes.
Starting at their own 10- yard line, Big Ben lined up under center. A few plays and yards later, he lined up again for a fourth down play that would decide Super Bowl XLV. Dropping back to pass, Big Ben fired to a hooking Mike Wallace, and Steeler Nation had its championship dreams squashed as the ball hit the turf. It looks like the Steelers will have to wait until next year, as the Packers and Aaron Rodgers took home their second Super Bowl Championship.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team had three games this past week, each against University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals.
The first of the three games was on Sunday, Jan. 30 at the University of Chicago. The Tartans got off to a hot start, taking an early 26–12 lead. Senior Shane Rife hit two three-pointers during a 19–2 Tartan run, and first-year Asad Meghani added a three of his own. Junior Joe Kromka capped off the run with a dunk in transition.
The Maroons slowly chipped away at the lead behind Matt Johnson’s 10 points on four straight possessions.
The Tartans went into halftime with only a one-point lead at the break, as a driving bank shot by junior John Duhring put Carnegie Mellon up 39–38.
Chicago caught fire after the break, draining three of four baskets out of the gates to take a 47–41 lead.
The Tartans pulled within six, but clutch free throw shooting and tough defense by the Maroons stifled the Tartans, handing them their 12th loss of the season, 86–76.
The Maroons’ hot three-point shooting won the game for Chicago, as they converted a season-high 13 from that distance. The Tartans only hit seven, along with shooting a low 40.9 percent from the field.
Rife led the Tartans with 20 points, and senior Matthew Pettit added 17 with seven boards.
Carnegie Mellon’s second game of the week was at home against the Washington University in St. Louis Bears on Friday. 
The Tartans started off the month of February on a high note, riding Rife’s career-high 26 points to a much-needed 78–65 win.
Rife started the game by scoring the Tartans’ first 15 points, including three straight three-pointers, opening up a 15–12 lead. However, the Bears also got hot shortly thereafter, opening up a 29–23 lead on the Tartans behind Dylan Richter’s back-to-back threes.
Carnegie Mellon went into the break on a 15–6 run, including seven more points from Rife, to hit halftime with a 38–35 lead. Both the Bears’ Richter and the Tartans’ Rife had 22 points at the break.
Midway through the second half, the Tartans found themselves down 56–51. First-year Rashaun Riley led a ferocious 10–0 Carnegie Mellon run, scoring half of those points himself, allowing the Tartans to take back a lead that they didn’t relinquish for the rest of the game. Overall, Riley had a career-high 13 points in the bout.
Career nights for Rife and Riley shot this team to victory. Pettit and first-year Christian Manoli added 10 points each, and the two had 10 and eight rebounds, respectively.
It was a meaningful win for the struggling Tartans, who ended a four-game losing streak. The victory came on a night when the school was honoring the former conference champion teams from 1977 and 2006.
The Tartans hosted Chicago on Super Bowl Sunday at noon.

Last year, I wrote a “Modest Proposal” parodying Major League Baseball’s “This Time it Counts” initiative for the All-Star Game and, more importantly, the fact that All-Star voting seems to begin earlier and earlier each year. So, a week before pitchers and catchers report to spring training, here are my predictions for this year’s All-Star team. After all, it’s all about who fans like rather than who deserves it, so why wait to see who fits the latter bill?
Players donning new uniforms in 2011 will no doubt get a lot of support from their new fans but for the most part, the big names who’ve changed teams this year are guys who have made it in the past. Pitchers, of course, have been omitted from my predictions, as they are still selected on a deserving basis, unless one of them makes it to the Final Vote (but let’s face it: Cliff Lee is a-goin’).
National League
The NL has had its fair share of marquee players changing teams this winter, but for the most part, those players have been pitchers — see Lee, Zack Greinke, and Matt Garza. Jayson Werth joined the Nationals, an acquisition that would undoubtedly have garnered him a ton of All-Star support if Washington had any fans at all. Carlos Pena left the Rays for the Cubs, but will most likely be blocked from starting at first base at the All-Star Game by some guy named Albert. Dan Uggla was traded from Florida to Atlanta, and if he has a good first half then he could take out Chase Utley at second base. 
Of course, you should expect to see at least one Braves player starting, as last year’s NL hero, Brian McCann, should be a lock to make the lineup. Reds first baseman Joey Votto should also get a strong backing, but like Pena, will most likely get blocked by Pujols.
There are also some up-and-coming players like Pedro Alvarez, Mike Stanton, and Freddie Freeman who may influence the ballot if they prosper, but for the most part, the NL starting lineup at the All-Star Game should be business as usual:
Catcher: Brian McCann, Braves; First base: Albert Pujols, Cardinals; Second base: Chase Utley, Phillies; Third base: David Wright, Mets; Shortstop: Hanley Ramirez, Marlins; Jason Heyward, Braves; Carlos Gonzalez, Rockies; Outfield: Mike Stanton, Marlins.
American League
Many AL teams have made some major upgrades this winter, and many players with new homes will most likely find themselves in Phoenix come the All-Star Break. Boston has already been deemed the “winner” of the off-season by many after acquiring Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez, and the Red Sox Nation should vote both into the American League’s starting lineup regardless of their first-half performance. Adam Dunn would have probably gotten enough support from his new White Sox fan base to be the AL’s starting designated hitter — and likewise Manny Ramirez would from Rays fans.
Unfortunately for Yankees fans, Rafael Soriano can’t get voted in, and the team’s lackluster offseason will leave many bandwagon fans spitefully not voting this year, which may sway both corner infield positions Boston’s way. Barring any surprises, the AL lineup will also include many familiar faces, though not all will be representing the same team  in the past: 
Catcher: Joe Mauer, Twins; First base: Adrian Gonzalez, Red Sox; Second base: Robinson Cano, Yankees; Third base: Kevin Youkilis, Red Sox; Shortstop: Derek Jeter, Yankees; Outfield: Carl Crawford, Red Sox; Josh Hamilton, Rangers; Ichiro Suzuki, Mariners.
Now that I’ve predicted July’s starting lineups, it’s time to look forward to spring training. Let the countdown to Valentine’s Day begin!

The Tartans hosted Washington University in St. Louis at home this past Friday. After a loss to the Bears on the road, the Tartans had the opportunity to use the home-court advantage as an edge. Carnegie Mellon, however, came up short in a 73–37 loss to the Bears.
The Tartans used the home court to their advantage, as they had a strong 4–0 start. This quick lead was soon lost as the Bears turned up the heat. The hot streak continued as the Bears made 15 out of the next 20 shots. The Tartans fought for momentum, starting with first-year Jacqui Shaw, who put eight points on the board. Offensively, the Tartans led in rebounds with 21 to the Bears' 18; however, Carnegie Mellon faced a 17-point deficit at the half.
Starting off the second half, the Tartans continued to fight hard, but it was no match for the Bears' shooting percentage. Wash. U. came out strong and put the Tartans on the defensive instantly. After opening the half with a 17–8 run, the Tartans were on their heels.
At the game's end, there were great performances by junior Jacki Cortese — fresh off her injury and already making her presence known on the court — who lead the team with 11 points. Shaw finished the game with 10 points for Carnegie Mellon. Sophomore Brit Phillips and first-year Gina Tudi had six and five rebounds, respectively.
The Tartans move to 2–17 overall in the season and 0–8 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. The Tartans hit the road this coming weekend as they travel to Waltham, Mass., to face UAA rival Brandeis University on Friday, and then the team travels to New York City to face UAA opponent New York University on Sunday.

This past weekend marked the start of the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis season, and after two days of dusting the rust off their rackets, the Tartans pulled away with two wins over Division I Bucknell University and Division II West Virginia Wesleyan College. The Tartans move to 5–2 overall.
On Friday night, the Tartans hosted the Bucknell Bison and notched a 6–3 win for their first match of the spring season. The Tartans gained momentum after the first round of doubles to go up 2–1. The senior-sophomore duo of Bobby MacTaggart and Duke Miller defeated their first opponents 8–6, followed by the junior-sophomore team of Jeremy King and Jooho Yu, who overcame their opponents 8–5. Four Tartans secured points for the win, and first off the court was senior Alex Nemerov at first singles, who topped Bucknell’s Evan Zimmer 6–3, 7–5. Miller battled out the fourth point in a three-set victory at No. 3 singles, 5–7, 6–1, 7–5, followed by another three-set win from sophomore Harsha Rao at No. 4 singles to secure the overall win.
“It was good to see we can hold our own after two months of no matches,” Nemerov said. “We have new blood and lots of seniors, so hopefully this will be a good year.”
The next day, the Tartans hosted West Virginia at nearby Oxford Athletic Club and took home another season win, 6–3.
This time, the Tartans swept the doubles, with an especially noteworthy win from MacTaggart and Miller over the Bobcats’ Marc Rosner and Alvaro Ochoa, 9–7. Rao and Miller once again took down their respective opponents to secure the final wins.
“It’s good to be back on the court again, and I have a good feeling about this season,” MacTaggart said. “I like how we have outside division matches so we can get back into rhythm and try out new doubles teams.”
The Tartans will gear up next week when they host Robert Morris University next Saturday at 10 a.m. These matches serve as preparation for Indoor Nationals, which will occur Feb. 18th at the University of Mary Washington.

Finally, the men’s distance medley team, composed of first-year Ken Murphy, sophomore Jaime Trujillo, first-year Mike Standish, and senior J.P. Allera won the event by 9 seconds, with a time of 10:47.87.
Like the men’s, the women’s distance lineup rose to the competition. First-year Jacqueline Guevel earned second in the 500-meter dash with a time of 1:21.08. Senior Courtney Baker took home a victory the 800-meter run with a time of 2:19.65, just inching out the competition by half a second. Meanwhile, senior Laura McKee scored fourth in the mile, with a time of 5:17.72.
Next weekend the Tartans will make the four-hour trip to Lewisburg, Pa., to compete against Bucknell University.

First-year Christian Manoli has made an instant impact on the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team. Manoli hails from San Rafael, Calif., and chose to attend Carnegie Mellon because it was the best academic school to which he got accepted. “While on my visit, I felt some really good vibes from the [coaching] staff and the players,” Manoli said.
Manoli has yet to declare a major. However, he is interested in the areas of international relations or global studies. He is looking to explore a career in international law.
Manoli enjoys the “youthful swag” of the men’s basketball team. The heavily first-year-laden team has provided him with many memorable moments. The team has accomplished a lot, despite being such a young team.
Manoli’s favorite moment of the season was when a fellow first-year, Phil Einwag, ran full-steam into head coach Tony Wingen. Following this episode, Wingen taught the team firsthand how to take charge. It is the interaction between the team and coach, and moments like these, that Manoli sees as providing team bonding.
During Carnegie Mellon’s University Athletic Association home games this weekend against Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Chicago, Manoli had some career highs.
In Friday’s game against Wash. U., Manoli had four steals, eight rebounds, and put 10 points on the board for the Tartans.
Sunday, Manoli had a career high of six assists and put up 15 points of his own.
Currently, Manoli leads the men’s basketball team with 237 points and averages 12.5 points per game. As Manoli continues to develop in the Carnegie Mellon basketball program, he will be one to watch.

This Thursday, the annual spring Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) will take place in the University Center. Unlike the more specialized career fairs in the fall, the EOC, hosted by the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) is a campus-wide event targeted at students across all colleges and disciplines. In fact, the CPDC has announced that for 2011, it will be conducting the EOC in the fall as well as the spring. The next fall EOC will take place on Sept. 19, 2011.
This year’s EOC has been expanded to include 167 companies, a 12 percent increase over last year’s 149 companies. The increase is largely due to the CPDC’s change in strategy regarding employer recruitment. According to Farouk Dey, the director of the CPDC, the new employer development strategy features a specialized “employer development team,” whose role is to target new industries and sectors that do not traditionally recruit at Carnegie Mellon. Wesley Thorne, the director of employer relations at the CPDC, stated that the team has “made a concerted effort to reach out to employers in industries that have been under-represented at the EOC — namely arts-related employers and those targeting liberal arts students.” Although this was their primary goal, Thorne highlighted that the team “also reached out to employers in virtually every employment sector to ensure that we have a good representation of employers who are seeking students and alumni from all of our colleges.”
Dey further stressed that this year’s EOC features “more variety, more employers, and more opportunities.” Although the list of employers is still dominated by technical and financial companies, Dey emphasized that students outside of these majors should still pursue these opportunities. “Students should think beyond their major,” he said. “Their major gives them specialized skills, but their entire experience at Carnegie Mellon qualifies them for a variety of industries and sectors.”
The EOC will take place this Thursday from noon to 6 p.m. in Wiegand Gym and Rangos Hall. Students interested in attending the EOC should register at www.cmu.edu/career.

With over 150 employers and 1,500 students expected to be in attendance at this year’s Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC), participating students may wonder what steps they can take to stand out in the crowd of applicants. The difficulty of making an impression among hundreds of other Carnegie Mellon students seems daunting, and with only a few moments to talk to each representative, extra effort before the event may be the key to hitting it off with a dream employer. Luckily, according to Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC), there are a few simple steps that can set a student apart from his or her peers.
Perfect your résumé
Before walking into Wiegand Gymnasium this Thursday, students should set aside a few minutes to be sure that they have properly prepared for potential employers. One simple step for students is to take another look at their résumés before printing off extra copies for the event. Students should make sure that the document is as up-to-date and clear as possible. A readable résumé that allows prospective employees to quickly gain an understanding of a student’s experiences and talents is important. The CPDC recommends that students limit their résumés to one  page long.
Font choice can also be an important concern when considering résumé readability. “You should always use a sans-serif font so that employers can quickly skim your resume,” senior business administration major Yon Zloof said. The CPDC recommends students use Arial or Helvetica as their sans-serif font of choice. For other concerns, students can set up a meeting with a representative from the CPDC to look over a final copy before the big day.
Develop an elevator pitch
An elevator pitch is a key part of the understanding that prospective employers gain about students in attendance. As the CPDC Job Fair Success Guide explains, “Preparing your pitch is useful in introducing yourself at a career fair.” An ideal elevator pitch should provide the listener with a brief overview of an individual’s relevant background. The message a student presents should be clear and concise, delivering useful information within a 30-second time period. Researching the companies a student plans to approach can make the difference between presenting an irrelevant elevator pitch and presenting one that matches the interests and needs of the employer. Students should spend time in advance researching recruiters that they are interested in. For the EOC, this information is readily available — students can review companies that will be in attendance on the CPDC website.
Choose appropriate attire
Dress and personal appearance are key aspects of how students present themselves to a company representative. The CPDC has a variety of recommendations for student attire, whether for interviewing or for attending a job fair such as the EOC. Students should plan outfits that are professional and in line with the expected attire of their industry of choice. While the specific elements of an individual’s attire can vary, clean, pressed, and presentable clothes are a must. However, a professional appearance does not mean that students have to stifle their creativity. The CPDC recommends tasteful jewelry and accessories to add an extra element to a professional outfit. 
Whether students choose a basic suit or spruce their attire up with accessories, the CPDC reminds students that “a ‘dressed for success’ appearance creates a positive impact.”
With a few tips from the CPDC and their peers, students can be sure to make an impact at this semester’s EOC. For more advice, students should visit the CPDC website and check out the available Career Success guides at        www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/career/index.html.

The Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) returns to campus once again this Thursday. The EOC is one of the many job recruitment fairs Carnegie Mellon offers its students, in addition to the Business Opportunities Conference (BOC) and the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC). The EOC, in particular, attracts a range of employers and companies from across the nation. The conference offers unique opportunities for job experiences by bridging the gap between the companies and students. Many students who attend the EOC gain valuable internships and sometimes begin life-long careers. Looking at past statistics reveals how much the EOC has to offer students:
Total student attendance at the EOC in 2010: 2,056
Total student attendance at the EOC in 2009: 2,094
Percentage of 2010 graduates that are employed: 43% 
Mean starting salary for graduates: $66,202
Number of full-time jobs offered to current students in 2010: 2,243

When it comes to making a good first impression, appearance definitely matters. Carnegie Mellon students have a reputation of not caring too much about (supposedly) trivial things like attire. But at an event like the Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC), recruiters are judging students not only by their resumes but also the color of their suits.
With this in mind, it is imperative that students make their best effort to look polished and conservative. Finding the right pair of heels or the perfect tie is just as important as fixing the formatting on your resume.
Women
Since the dress code for the EOC is business formal, women should stick to a conservative pant or skirt suit in black, navy, or gray. Wearing a suit jacket is a must, or you will end up looking too casual for the event. Also, try and avoid wearing lacy or silky camisoles under the jacket. A crisp shirt in a solid color is a much better option — not only is it a safe, conservative bet, but it also looks smart.
When it comes to styling, all attempts should be made to create a clean and polished look. Hair should be tied back neatly in a pony tail or pinned back so that it doesn’t fall on the face. Nude pantyhose are a must if you are wearing a skirt suit, and even if you are wearing a pant suit, wear thin, nude socks. 
When it comes to accessories, the choice of shoes is an important one. Don’t pick the stylish, open-toed heels you would wear to a night out. Instead, go with a sensible pair of black pumps. A quick tip: Make sure you are comfortable in your heels; job fairs involve a lot of standing and waiting in lines, and you don’t want to be doing all of it with sore feet.
Add some simple jewelry to make your look more elegant and attractive. Stay away from large, chunky necklaces and long, dangly earrings. Find simple studs and a small pendant that suit your outfit and you’re good to go. 
Men
A business suit is also a necessity for men. While colors like black, navy, and gray will all work, men can also impress in a pinstriped suit. A white shirt is the safest bet, and it is important to make sure the shirt cuffs are exactly one-half of an inch longer than their jacket sleeves.
A special feature of the men’s look is the tie. Remember: The tie is supposed to serve as an accessory and not an attention-grabber; leave your Homer Simpson tie at home and wear something more suited to the occasion. Additionally, if this is your first time tying a tie, practice a few times before the day of the EOC. YouTube has some good video tutorials that can prove to be useful. Make sure your tie is not too long and hanging below your belt, or too short and stopping above it. 
An important thing to keep in mind is that even though you may have put the perfect outfit together, all of it will amount to nothing if you are not confident about your appearance. While adhering to the dress code and smartening up your attire are essential, remaining cool and confident about yourself is even more important.

The Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) is a great way to start networking with recruiters and land an interview opportunity, but just attending the conference doesn’t guarantee that you will get a job. A lot more time and energy goes into the job hunt. To ease the lengthy and arduous process, here are some helpful tips from successful seniors who have already managed to snag that perfect job.
Get a head start
Don’t wait around while deadlines pass you by. Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center has an extensive online resource for job postings that gets updated nearly every day.
“Set aside an hour a couple of times a week to scour TartanTrak and apply to every single job that seems interesting,” Dina Megretskaia, a senior economics and mathematics major, said.
Network within Carnegie Mellon 
Don’t just rely on individuals you meet at the job fair — the campus can be a great place to make important connections as well. “Try talking with professors and advisers to find what might be out there.... They are well-connected individuals in the work field,” Spoorthi Kumar, a senior information systems major, said. If you’re feeling lost or you’re finding it hard to locate an opening in your field, approach a professor you are familiar with. Professors are an easy resource for good advice, and if they can’t provide it themselves, they will direct you to someone who can.
Polish the cover letter
“Don’t ignore [job] postings that require a cover letter,” Megretskaia said. “Think about it — you’re turned off by that, and other students will be too. If less people apply, your chances of being selected are higher. So write a standard cover letter, and modify it for each company.” Be careful while modifying cover letters for different companies, however. Make sure to proofread them and be certain that you’re mentioning the right company in all instances. “This totally happened to me. I sent a cover letter to Novantas that concluded with ‘This is why I would love a position with IBM.’ I’m totally shocked I got an interview after that,” Megretskaia said.
While a lot of job search advice just seems like common sense, it is important to keep even these simple tips in mind while searching for internships and jobs. Kumar jokingly assured that, if all else fails, the Victoria’s Secret miracle bra will do the trick. “No other kind; [it] has to be the miracle one!” she said.
Megretskaia will be joining Applied Predictive Technologies, an enterprise software company in Washington, D.C. after graduation. Kumar will be joining the Johnson & Johnson Information Technology Leadership Program after graduation.

Many people have built at least one annoying model in their lives that was composed entirely of small pieces that would get lost or broken easily. That frustration may be a thing of the past with the development of the 3-D printing process. 3-D printing is where a printer physically builds an object based on a source file from a 3-D scanner. This process is similar to what a normal printer does; instead of printing a page line by line, with small dots put together, a 3-D printer adds small pieces of a plastic-like material together to form a physical and working object. Although this process has existed for decades, the fast-paced evolution of technology is allowing these printers to be built more quickly and cheaply. What previously would have cost the consumer approximately $20,000 is now available at a much more affordable price.
The basic secret behind 3-D printing is the laying down of successive layers of materials shaped like the cross-section of the desired shape to eventually create the finished product. 3-D printers come in many forms, with most of them differing in the type of materials they use to create their models. Powders and polymers are commonly used to create the finished products.
One form of 3-D printing right now is inkjet printing, which uses powder or resins to lay down successive layers of material to build up the shape. The advantages of this technology are that it allows the user to create full-color models, and it is faster than the other technologies currently available. 3-D microfabrication is also becoming more prevalent. This technology can be used to create extremely small structures of less than 100 nanometers in size, and it can also be used to make structures with moving and interlocking parts. This technology works by using a laser to trace out the desired product in a block of gel. The places where the laser strikes undergo a change in their chemical structure that makes them more susceptible to hardening. The remaining gel can simply be washed away to leave the desired product. Research is being done on more materials, such as clay, that could possibly be used in these printers.
The reach of these devices isn’t just limited to offices, either. 3-D printers can be, and have been, made at home. Those interested can use resources such as the RepRap Project, where people can download open-source specifications of 3-D printers, which they can use to build their own device.
This availability of 3-D printers, when combined with the number of fields that 3-D printers can influence, brings up many questions about how these printers will affect the world we live in. Like most new and innovative technologies, which often inadvertently disrupt business models, 3-D printing could have profound economic consequences. The U.S. government and other organizations are currently trying to update copyright laws to ensure that intellectual property can be protected both today and in future technology upgrades for products such as the 3-D printer.
Stephen Spear, an economics professor in the Tepper School of Business, offered the following as an example of a problem that might arise with the advent of 3-D printers: “Three-dimensional printers have the potential to impact a number of industries engaged in what we might call ‘brick and mortar’ production activities, as well as the design industries that support them.”
These 3-D printers have the potential to eventually replicate objects that currently take many people and special tools to build. The precision of the machinery and the potential that people might use it to create unregulated copies of objects could be points of concern for many in the near future. These printers could cause changes in existing economic balances. “It forces a re-examination of the existing business model,” Spear said. The battles that will have to be fought might resemble the ones currently being fought by the music industry to retain control of its products. The several uses that this technology could have, along with the fact that it could also cause many changes in current copyright laws, makes 3-D printers a technology to watch. They will impact our future in ways we have not thought possible.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Many people claim to be stricken by it and use it as a lightning rod for criticisms of being “a perfectionist.” The truth behind this illness reveals common misconceptions and sheds light on some confusion stemming from this obstructive anxiety disorder. 
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 2.2 million Americans aged 18 and older — or approximately 1 percent of this age cohort ­— have OCD. However, despite the relatively small proportion of the population affected by it, OCD is a highly pervasive and overwhelming illness. It is an anxiety disorder defined by “recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions)” unconnected to real-life circumstances or problems, and “repetitive behaviors (compulsions),” which are ritualistically performed in attempts to eliminate the persistent negative thoughts.
These behaviors may include overactive hand-washing, incessant counting, constantly checking the time, repeating words to oneself silently, and many other actions; what separates typical perfectionism from compulsive behaviors is the interference with life that OCD creates. These actions are performed to provide relief, but are only temporary palliatives. In addition, recognition that the behaviors are “excessive or unreasonable” and an inability to solve problems are  delineating characteristics, of OCD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). When a repeated behavior begins to take over one’s life — whether due to mental distress, by being time-consuming (taking more than one hour per day), or by preventing one from functioning normally in any area of life — the behavior becomes a compulsion, and it is a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Although the age of onset for obsessive-compulsive disorder is typically around 19, precursors to the symptoms can present themselves in childhood. However, OCD is often difficult to diagnose at an early age because children naturally tend to be obsessive, favoring strict order in daily routines, and playing with toys in a patterned, obsessive manner.
One disorder associated with OCD is trichotillomania, the compulsive behavior of pulling one’s hair. Trichotillomania affects 2 to 10 million Americans in adulthood. 
Representative symptoms include the eponymous pulling of hair, increased tension when resisting the behavior, and relief when one pulls his or her hair. The condition can start around age 12 or 13, sometimes triggered by a stressful event. It may increase or decrease in severity as one ages, even disappearing in some individuals. However, there is currently no chemical or biological cure; treatment options for trichotillomania are similar to those for obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
Other associated mental illnesses are depression, repeatedly pulling at one’s skin, and compulsive scratching. Trichotillomania is not, however, a purposefully self-mutilating behavior, in contrast to practices like cutting. Usually, the exigency to pull one’s hair is to suppress negative, obsessive thoughts or mental images. As such, it is usually referred to as an impulse control disorder, though it can also be characterized as a tic disorder if the hair pulling is “automatic and preceded by an uncomfortable sensation,” according to the Trichotillomania Learning Center.
Currently the existence and prevalence of this disorder is still relatively unrecognized because there was little common discourse about it until 1989, when it appeared in U.S. popular media. Because of this information vacuum and lack of open discussion, many people with trichotillomania are left in the dark about their disorder. However, research is being conducted on the causes of trichotillomania, and people can seek help in replacing the harmful hair-pulling behavior, or in receiving medications for their condition.

ICANN announces last IPv4 address blocks distributed
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced last week that it had distributed the last blocks of IP addresses in the current system. Most Internet devices today use the IPv4 standard, which is limited to several billion addresses. Regulatory bodies and technology leaders have been pushing IPv6 for several years, and the exhaustion of the IPv4 pool will accelerate this rollout. The IPv6 system allows for an exponentially greater number of addresses.

Americans keep blood pressure down
A recent study published in The Lancet revealed that worldwide obesity continues to increase, but that people are nevertheless reducing the cases of high blood pressure and high cholesterol that are associated with this condition. Nearly every region of the world has seen rising body mass index levels, and the United States has the highest level among wealthy nations. However, the U.S. was found to have comparatively low blood pressure and cholesterol levels compared to other developed nations.

Facebook adds new account protection feature
Facebook began rolling out a security feature last week that aims to protect users’ accounts. The new feature uses the HTTPS protocol — the same technology that protects many e-commerce sites — to encrypt communications. Users must enable the feature themselves in the Account Security menu under the Account Settings panel. By taking advantage of HTTPS, Facebook users can avoid having their accounts hijacked when using unsecured connections such as those at airports and coffee shops.

Jeopardy champs to face off against IBM computer
Watson, a computer developed by IBM and Carnegie Mellon researchers, will make history as the first nonhuman contestant on Jeopardy on Feb. 14. Like Deep Blue, the IBM computer that defeated Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997, Watson will use a combination of raw processing power and complex algorithms to answer host Alex Trebek’s trivia questions. The computer is designed to understand the subtleties of human speech, and IBM researchers hope that similar technology will one day be available to everyone.

The much-anticipated “Lunar Gala: Mélange” took place this past Saturday, showcasing the talent of the student designers for 23 featured lines. This was an event to please anyone who appreciates fashion and art.
The setup of the lights, screens, and runway transformed Wiegand Gym into an elegant venue for the occasion. The lanterns overhanging the runway emanated a vibrant glow that seemed to welcome in the Chinese Lunar New Year. In the center of all this outstanding glamour, the creations of many talented designers were ceremoniously displayed.
This year, Lunar Gala was produced by students Ian Anthony Coleman and Eddie Wong. The producers worked hard to create something more novel than any preceding gala. “I really wanted to have a show that was completely different than every other show in the past,” Coleman explained. “My goal was to change Lunar Gala from a typical student-run fashion show to an innovative, interactive, and intimate fashion experience.” The show was definitely all of those things, and the models were not limited to the stage as in previous years. Instead, they strutted down the aisles in order to give the audience a closer, more personal view of the clothing. “We’ve had long, straight runways [and] humongous triangular stages, but never a show like this,” Coleman said.
“We tried to pick collections that would flow with one another but still were completely different interpretations of what fashion is,” Coleman said of the design selections. This event gave student designers the chance to exhibit their creativity in Carnegie Mellon’s biggest fashion show.
The first line was “Peaches Meets Abraham,” created by junior design majors Alyssa Brown and Carson Beyl. This line was based on an American backwoods style, featuring fur and long johns. This style seemed to be appropriate apparel for a cozy autumn day.
“Akoma” by junior English major Efi Turkson presented designs that put a modern Western twist on traditional West African prints. These garments boldly featured the cultural aspects of West African clothes and used them to create a sexy, cutting-edge version that reflected contemporary American culture as well.
“Unfold” by Samia Ahmed, a junior design and human-computer interaction major, was made up of flouncy, flowing attire in neutral colors. These clothes provided a graceful, refined look for women’s fashion.
This year a line of American Apparel clothing was also featured. This line showed basic apparel that was practical for everyday wear yet still refined and sophisticated. 
The line “Neue” by junior design major Allison Tran displayed simple clothing of smooth, cleanly cut fabrics that created a classy look for women.
“Cocoa Cloches” was a line by senior design major Colleen Grogan featuring a number of classic bell-shaped hats from the early 20th century. However, instead of being adorned with bows and flowers, these hats were ornamented with a range of colors and geometric shapes made from different materials, which gave the look a resemblance to contemporary architecture.
“The Queue” by designer Ting-Yu Ore Ou Yang was a line that emphasized both elegance and boldness in a woman. The soft colors and graceful fabrics were contrasted by the bold, shiny metal chains that were incorporated into the outfits.
“Copacetic,” created by senior art major Jennifer Hwang, was bursting with bright colors that were reminiscent of ’60s and ’70s beach style. These charmingly cheeky ensembles featured high socks, short shorts, bright colors, polka dots, and stripes.
“Bluebird” by Carolyn Supinka, a sophomore H&SS student, was a very imaginative collection of flowing dresses with boots — a very audacious assortment. The dresses looked luxuriant, almost goddess-like, and the models wore large crowns on their heads to emphasize the fairy tale theme behind this line.
“Dahlem” by Emily Raffensperger, a senior art major, was a line that was designed using many different patterns and shapes to create a look that was subtle but sophisticated.
“Arete” by art and modern languages major Elyse Carr was a feminine line that really accentuated the natural appearance of a woman. The girly forms of the apparel seemed to state boldly, “I am a woman.”
“Versatextile” was created by fourth-year architecture majors Hubert Li and Macy Goh. This line featured looks that were definitely versatile, as the name suggests. The pieces of clothing appeared to be freely arranged on the body so that they could be rearranged to be worn in different ways. The materials looked very soft and smooth, giving this collection a relaxed tone.
“Avantwong” by Eddie Wong, a fifth-year architecture major, was a set of dark, edgy apparel that had a mysterious, futuristic appeal. There were many short dark pieces featured in this collection full of attitude.
“Constrict” by Ibrahim Garcia-Bengochea and Rain Chan-Kalin, both of whom are junior architecture majors, was a very experimental set of clothes. The different shapes of the clothing created different visual effects on the models wearing them. 
The line “Cadmium,” by Sophia Chan, a junior design major, and Chi-Chi Chuang was stylish, delicate, and had a confident sex appeal. This collection was described in the program as “Elegance with an edge,” which is exactly what it was.
“ECT” by Erica Tong, a second-year architecture major, showcased clothes with many strips of clothing extending to the arms and legs of the models. This was another very futuristic line; much of the clothing seemed draped on the upper half of the body, and the materials seemed to unwind as they descended along the body.
“Bernard James,” a line named after its creator, was full of daring street style — a sophisticated, modern street style. There were brightly colored blazers and pants for guys and also colorful, flirtatious outfits for girls. There seemed to be a hint of ’80s retro style behind many of these pieces.
“Body” by Ingrid Kong, a fifth-year architecture major, was designed to change the human perception of the body. These pieces were cubic and made of non-textiles, and many of them were very revealing. The intent was for the outfits to display the human body as it really is, rather than what people try to make it look like.
“Rags to Riches” was designed by Amber Ohiokpehai and Gabe Ratliff, a sophomore mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering major and a junior art major, respectively. The project was created to help orphans in Manila, Philippines. The designers created the designs with the help of donations from friends. They hope to help the children by selling the collection and donating the proceeds to provide an education for them. These patterned pieces had a Southeast Asian style and were inspired by the orphans.
“Shallow,” designed by Alanna Fusaro, a first-year design major, was a line of elaborate swimwear. These pieces were very artistic and eye-catching. This attractive swimwear looked perfectly debonair.
The collection called “5/8” by Luther Young showcased different types of trendy bags. The structures of the bags seemed abstract in a way, and the collection had an androgynous allure. The different colors and shapes of the bags were both stylish and practical.
“N9IN” by Kristen Staab, a senior humanities and arts major, was a collection featuring many artistic, sculpture-like pieces. The clothing seemed to have its own shape apart from the person wearing it. However, the garments extended and constricted in shapes that were still flattering for the body.
Finally, “Wilderness Within,” by Silvia and Andreea Manolache, a junior mathematical sciences and business administration major and a third-year architecture major, respectively, was the last clothing line displayed. These silver-colored garments were majestic yet simple, displaying daring edges and shapes that were very pronounced.
In addition to all of these works of art, there were also performances by Carnegie Mellon-based dance groups SoulStylz and DS Company. SoulStylz did both a high-energy hip-hop dance and a more expressive, interpretive dance to different songs. The DS Company gave a performance that integrated a number of dance styles, including hip-hop and ballet. This attitude-packed act was a crowd-pleaser and the last dance performance of the night.
All in all, this event expressed that creativity really has no bounds. Many of the lines were experiments of the relationship between clothes and the body or other environmental aspects, while many of the modern and non-traditional styles seemed to have hidden meanings and inspirations. This show allowed viewers to enter into the enigmatic world of fashion.

A blues cover of Jay-Z’s “99 Problems” may sound questionable, but British-born music artist Hugo manages to pull it off with great success in his upcoming album Old Tyme Religion. The Tartan had the opportunity to interview him when he came to Club AE last Saturday.
You have two singles coming out: “99 Problems” and “Bread & Butter.” Can you tell us a little bit about your music?
What I am sort of engaged in at the moment has quite a traditional thread that runs through it, in term of American roots music, which I am pretty much a fan of. I’m also [a fan of] British bands in the ’60s and ’70s that were inspired by American roots music, particularly the bands that took the blues form and make it something else, [something] contemporary. So in that way, what I am doing, I feel it is quite traditional — but at the same time it doesn’t mean it’s retro. I am not trying to make a record that sounds like it was made in the ’70s or ’60s.
Each song has its own world and mood that I am trying to get across. The song has to do a job. For me, the song has to make you feel something. It also should be clear on what it is about, for me as a songwriter. [While] there’s a lot in a song that is quite vague and poetic ... ultimately I like the song to be quite clear on what it is about.
You have been working in music for a while. When you were in Thailand, you released four albums with a Thai band. Has your approach in working and making music changed or matured over time?
Yes, definitely, especially in terms of [making music] professionally as work. Although it is music — it’s creative and you must do what you feel — you should also respect and appreciate the people you work with, just like you would in any other professional situation. Also, if you are going to work with other people, you must listen to them. If you are not going use all their expertise, then you should do things by yourself. I think a lot of people want to make music with other people because they can’t do everything they want to do, but they still want to control the situation. If you are not able do all the things you want to do and yet you want to work with people, you have to respect or at least listen to them.
So for me, it’s always been about the art of collaboration, getting the best out of any session. If you are in the studio, instead of just hanging out, you can maybe get a track at the end of the day.... I know you shouldn’t impose time limits on things, but there’s a certain discipline that maybe people think there isn’t in rock and roll. I think you do need it to get your work done, to keep writing songs.
Another thing I notice is that over time, you don’t write a great song straight away ­— I don’t, anyway. You have to write maybe four or five quite average or bad songs in order for the good song to come out. Just to almost flex your muscles, like exercise. Not everything you write is going to be great. In fact, you will be lucky if any of it is. 
Your single “99 Problems” is also in the No Strings Attached soundtrack. That must be big.
Yeah, it was great. We went to the set and we were in the movie for a bit. It was a real experience; we got to be in the Hollywood movie set. It was wild.
Do you have any last word for young readers as they are trying to figure out or trying to make it in the professional world?
It’s never finished; you don’t suddenly figure it out. The moment you figure it out, there’s another set of questions that present themselves. So the work is never done. In fact, the more time passes the harder it is for you to maintain any one thing. 
I don’t know if I have a standard way dealing with people in business. I tend to live the world of what’s possible. Because the imagination and creativity, that’s the work, but once the work is done you have to get the record out. You’ve got to have a label — if you don’t have a label, you have to figure out how to distribute it. There’s a lot of stuff between that and none of it is given that it will go your way. I suppose you should give quite a Buddhist attitude to things and know what’s in your control that you can do — know what you’re good at. I know that makes me sound like Donald Rumsfeld, but you should know what is better. You should know if you are working with a producer that they are an expert; you should trust them. Because they are doing things that you cannot do.
Don’t worry if you don’t know what you want to do. Don’t worry if you haven’t found your niche — you’ve got time. I know, in the modern world, you have to have your job or whatever. But in terms of [not finding] that one thing, it’s not instant. And it changes too. It doesn’t end.

Here’s a concept: Take the versatility of Minecraft or Doodle God’s mix-and-match system and combine it with the high-fantasy top-down style of a franchise like Warcraft. The outcome, Magicka, is one of those games that sounds like a dream come true. But in all honesty, this game is one of those cases where an early release is a terrible business plan — and it shows. Magicka in its current state is suffering more than a beached manatee in August.
Running through the campaign will get players quickly acclimated to the world and interface. The battle system largely consists of one main mechanic, which turns out to be surprisingly versatile: You get five slots, and there are eight different “elements.” Players can slate any elements in any order to fill those five slots, with certain combinations creating powerful spells that are satisfying to watch. Four lightning elements in a row, for example, makes a lightning storm that uses an area-of-effect spell to damage everything in a certain range, while casting a shield combination plus a fire element creates a flaming wall of protection.
Even playing around with the elements outside of combat offers a lot of simple, creative fun. The charming factor of what appears to be Norwegian-Simlish voice-acting works in tandem with the simplistic story line (fight enemies, drive back evil, the usual shindig) to create a pleasantly immersing plot that’s tried and true. The best part is that the game acknowledges its own cliché factor; NPCs make jokes and references to popular nerd culture, and it’s all tongue-in-cheek. If nothing else, Magicka has an aura of humor that self-serious games rarely seem to have these days, a friendly atmosphere more characteristic of Nintendo titles than, say, Dante’s Inferno.
However, the glitches of the game in its current state are sort of a crime against humanity and a serious blow to Arrowhead’s creditability as a developer studio — especially on its first major title. Half the time the multiplayer match-making system drops player connections entirely without warning — even while connected locally, matches often run up some serious lag. In the campaign, it’s possible to walk through walls or floors, and cutscenes sometimes fail to initiate. Directions and written lines often have typos or text formatting errors, which looks sloppy, as if the lead writer couldn’t be bothered to use spell-check. There is no remap option for key commands, so users who are playing on limited hardware (such as a laptop with a touch pad) will be hard-pressed to enjoy the game at all. In what seems to be a strange design choice, friendly fire is turned on in multiplayer mode, so attempting to dry yourself with a fire spell may quickly escalate into accidentally killing off your friends.
Overall, there’s a certain charm about Magicka that merits playing it — and with a free demo available on Steam, consumers would be wise to at least give it a try. However, whether it’s worth buying the full version of the game remains dependent on Arrowhead’s ability to roll out patches.

Steelers fans are always enthusiastic about their team, but as the Super Bowl approached this past week, enthusiasm for the Steelers grew into a black-and-yellow frenzy — even the dinosaur by the Carnegie Music Hall showed its Steelers pride with a black and yellow scarf. While most people expressed their support mainly by donning black and yellow garb and by carrying Terrible Towels, some fans instead expressed their love for the Steelers through more creative outlets.
The Miller Gallery has featured some of the Steelers fans’ creations in its exhibit Whatever It Takes: Steelers Fan Collections, Rituals, and Obsessions. The exhibit, which ran from Aug. 27, 2010 through Super Bowl Sunday, featured artistic expressions of fans’ love for the Steelers, including pictures of Steelers-themed body art and extensive collections of Steelers paraphernalia.
Steelers fans not only expressed their love through artwork and tattoos; they have also expressed it through song. Perhaps the most famous example of musical Steelers pride is Wiz Khalifa’s song “Black and Yellow,” which has been sweeping the airwaves and is currently No. 4 on the Billboard Top 100 chart. Although the lyrics do not directly reference the Steelers, the official music video for the song features crowds of people on the streets of Pittsburgh waving Terrible Towels. As Khalifa said in a statement during his album release, “I’ve always had that Pittsburgh pride. I just wanted to let people know where I’m from and represent any way I can, and what better way than through our colors? I took that hometown pride and put it in a song.”
Khalifa’s song has spawned a litany of remixes, most of which revise the song so it celebrates other teams — Lil’ Wayne’s remix, for example, is “Green and Yellow,” and its lyrics cheer for the Green Bay Packers. Some, however, have made the lyrics even more blatantly in support of the Steelers. A rapper named Calico rewrote the lyrics of the song to describe the Super Bowl; the chorus says, “Y’all know what it is/’bout to win that Super Bowl on February 6/ Uh-huh, that’s sayin’ something/Number seven on the way, Steel Town jumping.”
“Black and Yellow” is not the only popular song that has been rewritten to celebrate the Steelers. A group called In Acchord took the tune to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” and reworked it into a song about the Steelers, calling it “Steel Defense.” The chorus sings, “Here come the playoffs when we get our revenge/You and me, we got the Steel Defense/We’re winnin’ Super Bowls again and again/You and me, we got the Steel Defense.” The song’s music video on YouTube features pictures of Steelers fans in elaborate black and yellow outfits and facepaint. In Acchord released another Steelers-themed cover in 2009 called “Steelers Ladies,” a cover of Beyonce’s “Single Ladies.” “Gonna win it and they’re gonna put a ring on it,” the chorus sings repeatedly.
Pop songs are not the only tunes that have been covered in support of the Steelers. An a cappella group called Evolushun posted a video on YouTube of its members singing “Steelers’ Fans,” a parody of the Spiderman theme song.
Carnegie Mellon has not been immune to Steelers enthusiasm. Recent alumnus Tim Ruff posted a parody of “Walking in Memphis” called “Walking in Pittsburgh.” The song is full of references that only Pittsburgh residents can fully appreciate, including, “There’s a really great team, waiting on that seventh ring/Down in the locker room!” Ruff posted the video on YouTube on Jan. 23, and it has already been viewed over 86,000 times.
Carnegie Mellon uploaded its own tribute to the Steelers last week: On Carnegie Mellon’s YouTube channel, the school posted a video titled “Steelers Opera XLV.” The video features School of Music students, decked out in black and yellow and holding Steelers balloons, singing about the Steelers to the tune of the Toreador song from Carmen. “They’re the best, yinz should know!/They’ll lead us to our goal/to win our seventh Super Bowl!” the students sing with flair. “It was fun for me to be able to use opera in a vaguely threatening way, intimidating the opposing team,” Nina Mohan, a junior music and English major, said.
At the end of the video, associate professor of voice Douglas Ahlstedt says, “The students here at Carnegie Mellon have a very special relationship with the Steelers, and we want to support them in every way that we can, especially with our music and our voices. We’re enthusiastic about the team, and we’re enthusiastic about Pittsburgh.”

Directed by Danny Boyle, 127 Hours is a dynamic, true story portraying the inner struggle of a man facing certain death. When mountaineer Aron Ralston becomes trapped by a boulder for over five days in Blue John Canyon in Moab, Utah, with no hope of rescue, he slowly comes to terms with his own mortality and discovers an untapped strength of will within himself.
The movie is remarkable in the fact that the majority of it takes place in the same bit of canyon watching a man who can’t move, yet it is still entertaining. The creative camera angles and use of imagery put the viewers in Ralston’s shoes and make them feel his traumatic experience as if it were their own. Director Boyle takes us through the mind of Ralston and his different stages of anger and denial, acceptance, and irrepressible will to live.
Although the whole film is portraying one very tense and stressful situation, humor is peppered throughout the story in a very natural way. James Franco does a good job of exploring Ralston’s reactions to his plight, balancing between sanity and insanity. As he teeters one way and then the other, he reaches a critical moment where all of his problems and struggles in life seem to come down to this one boulder crushing his arm. “This rock has been waiting for me my entire life.... I’ve been moving towards it my whole life. The minute I was born, every breath I’ve taken, every action, has been leading me to this crack on the outer surface.”
Picturesque, vast landscapes combined with creative filming and a realistic performance by Franco make this story come alive and will have you on the edge of your seat, dealing with the same feelings and thoughts that Ralston must have had. This movie is a winner because it makes the viewer care deeply about and connect with the protagonist, something that is pushed to the wayside too often in most movies, which instead use special effects and over-dramatized action sequences in place of plot development. 127 Hours is truly a story of survival and triumph.
Ralston is a 1997 engineering graduate of Carnegie Mellon, making this movie a must-see for Carnegie Mellon students.

Serenity
Thursday, Feb. 10
7:30 10 12:30
A space Western movie based on a popular sci-fi series that was cancelled after just one season? And it was created by Joss Whedon? Count me in. Serenity is the story of a space captain and his ship filled with a wild cast of characters. They live out lives of petty crime until it is discovered that there’s a mysterious passenger aboard their ship. The film picks up right where Firefly left off, in case you followed it during its short-lived tenure on FOX. Fun fact: Despite being critically acclaimed and despite having a cult following from the show, Serenity fell just short of making back its budget.
Tucker and Dale vs. Evil
Friday, Feb. 11
8 10 12
When you come across two hillbillies at a cabin in the woods, isn’t your first thought that they are deranged, chainsaw-wielding murderers? Well, that’s what a group of preppy college kids thought in this flick — and it turned out they were actually dead wrong. In Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, we follow two lovable hillbillies (Tucker and Dale) who only want to enjoy a nice quiet time in the woods fishing and drinking beer. That ends when the aforementioned college kids show up and ruin it all in hilarious, and deadly, fashion. Go see this laugh-a-minute spoof on backwoods-slasher flicks and you won’t be disappointed.
New York, I Love You
Saturday, Feb. 12
8 10 12
New York, I Love You is a bit like Love Actually. It’s an anthology film, made up of 10 segments that tell a story about the quirks that come along with finding true love. An ensemble cast stars Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper, and James Caan, with many other recognizable faces making an appearance. Each segment was directed by a different person, making for a distinct vision in each scene. Fun fact: One segment that was cut from the final release was directed by Scarlett Johansson and was apparently very bad, according to a New York Post reviewer.
Catfish
Sunday, Feb. 13
8 10 12
This 2010 documentary follows a young photographer living in New York as he builds a relationship with a woman almost entirely through Facebook. Drama ensues, however, when things turn out to be not quite what they seem in this gripping documentary that almost seems too perfect to be true. Fun fact: Many people who first viewed the film, including comedian Zach Galiafinakis and Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock, called it one of the best fake documentaries they’d ever seen. However, the men who made Catfish stand by their claim that it’s “100 percent true.” You can be the judge of that by going to see this well-made movie.

To explain minimal music to a public that cannot distinguish between techno and house is a bit like trying to force-feed chili peppers to a two-year-old. To be fair, the advent of contemporary hipsters and their slightly more refined taste in media has advanced the public’s understanding of electronic music to a point where anyone with an ugly Christmas sweater and big glasses could probably give you a crude, working definition of house music. Yet to our surprise, their hipster radars have stopped short of what we might call the richest, most compelling form of music.
We are surprised, because hipsters are very visual people, and understanding minimal is akin to understanding the principles of good visual communication: It requires a basic understanding of Gestalt psychology. And like the designers of the Modernist era, minimal does away with all but the most basic elements of a given piece of music to achieve its purpose with the utmost efficiency and restraint. Minimal is to music as Swiss typography is to design: clean and succinct, yet rich and humanistic. In minimal, nothing is accidental, and the best artists meticulously craft the most tedious intricacies in their soundscape, teasing out of a computer what seems possible only through a real instrument.
If you don’t believe us, listen to “Miss You” by Anders Trentemøller, a Danish producer whose 2006 album The Last Resort still dominates our top plays on iTunes. ResidentAdvisor.net, our version of Pitchfork, describes the album as “electronic Romanticism.” If you haven’t heard Trentemøller yet, tune into WRCT on 88.3 FM at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday during WRCT’s Massive Music Weekend to listen to a full half hour of nothing but Trentemøller. 
“But what about Gold Panda?” you might ask. “Aren’t they clean and succinct and meticulously crafted?”
No. Go outside, smoke your cigarette, and think about what you just said.
Best regards,

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I am looking for an archenemy. Someone with whom I can lock wits, engage in fiendish repartee, and do battle on a weekly to monthly basis. Do you have any tips on picking up an archenemy?
—Always Looking for One Normal Enemy
Dear ALONE,
It all comes down to whether you’re the hero or the villain. If you’re the hero, then pretty soon some psycho will track you down and do battle with you. If you’re the villain, then try pulling off a minor crime and get subdued by the hero. Vow vengeance, and bam — new archenemy. If the hero gained powers from some sort of accident, then his archenemy will generally either be disfigured from the same accident and blame the hero, or will attempt to re-create the accident to gain the hero’s powers, until something goes horribly wrong (as it is wont to do).
Really, an archenemy comes down to one thing: pure, unadulterated hate. When you meet that special someone, take a chance and pop the question: Will you be my nemesis? If you can’t find anyone like that, you’re still in luck. Simply join the Guild of Calamitous Intent, and it’ll assign you an archenemy of your very own! If you do go that route, say hi to David Bowie for me.
The next step is to get some henchmen,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
After reading your last question, I decided to take up arch-villainy full time. I have a protagonist I can’t wait to arch, but I’m not sure how to get off the ground. Do you have any tips for a budding supervillain? Where can I get henchmen? How do I fund my enterprises?
—Aching for Really Cool Henchmen
Dear ARCH,
Despite what you may see on television, being a super villain is expensive. Dart guns, robot gliders, and hovering cocoons cost a fortune. But you have a few funding options. First: crime! You can work your way up — bank robberies, armored car-jacking, or holding cities hostage by releasing a fear toxin into the water supply. 
When it comes to henchmen, you have two main options. If you’re associated with a professional villainous organization, like the Guild, you can always hire some through their channels. They come pre-trained, full of the antisocial behaviors and loyalty necessary for henchmen, but they can be lazy and need health insurance. Or, you can just pick a couple guys up off the street. They’ll be cheaper, but they may wind up using actual guns to take over your floating cocoon.
Watch out for Brock,
Brian Hoskins

Dozen Bake Shop may be right down the street, but why pay for cupcakes when you can bake an entire batch on your own? Consider making chocolate Bailey’s Irish Cream cupcakes — they are rich and indulgent, perfect for a study break. These chocolate cupcakes have a light, creamy frosting that’s flavored with Bailey’s Irish Cream, and a surprise center of dark chocolate and Bailey’s ganache. As they do include Bailey’s, they aren’t for people under 21; however, you can make the recipe without the Bailey’s for something that is still rich with chocolate and sinfully delicious.
The miniature chocolate chips in the cupcake recipe will melt into the cupcakes, making them even more rich and chocolate-filled. Although you might be wary about including coffee in a chocolate cupcake recipe, don’t worry — the coffee does nothing more than enhance the flavor of the chocolate. If you don’t have a coffee maker, or don’t want to grab a cup of coffee from Entropy+, feel free to just use water instead.
(Recipe adapted from annies-eats.com and pieceofcakeblog.blogspot.com.)
For the chocolate cupcakes:
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
3/4 cup strong brewed coffee
3/4 cup buttermilk
3 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2/3 miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips (or regular chips, chopped fine)
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line standard muffin tins with paper liners.
Sift together the cocoa powder, flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. If you don’t have a sifter, you can improvise with a strainer. Add the eggs, coffee, buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Beat until smooth with an electric mixer, about three minutes. Fold in the mini chocolate chips with a spoon.
Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling each cup no more than two-thirds full. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when touched, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely.
For the Bailey’s ganache:
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
2/3 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
2 teaspoons Bailey’s Irish cream
To make the ganache filling, place the chopped chocolate in a bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until simmering, then pour it over the chocolate. Let sit for one minute and then whisk until smooth. If the chocolate is not completely melted, put it in the microwave for 15-second increments. Add the butter and Bailey’s and stir until combined.
Set aside to let the ganache cool until it is thick enough to be piped. You can use the refrigerator to speed the cooling process, but be sure to stir every 10 minutes or so to ensure even cooling. Meanwhile, cut out a cone-shaped chunk from the center of each cupcake (feel free to eat these scraps as you work). Once the ganache has a consistency that is slightly thicker than icing, spoon it into the cut-out center of the cupcakes.
For the Bailey’s buttercream frosting:
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
3–4 cups confectioners’ sugar 
4–8 tablespoons Bailey’s Irish cream
Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about two to three minutes. Gradually add the powdered sugar until it is all incorporated. Mix in the Bailey’s until smooth. Add more if necessary until the frosting has reached a good consistency for spreading. Frost the cupcakes as desired.

You have seen many students on campus this winter with novelty winter hats, from panda bears to sharks, but you have the power to one-up them all. This week you must create the greatest hat ever. I expect to see LED lights.
You have seen many students on campus this winter with novelty winter hats, from panda bears to sharks, but you have the power to one-up them all. This week you must create the greatest hat ever. I expect to see LED lights.
It’s a perfectly natural reaction — but out of manners and good taste, you should wait until the person is out of earshot before laughing at them for slipping on the ice.
He or she might be a really interesting and awesome person with a great sense of humor and a kind heart, but remember: It’s nothing more than an academic crush. Once the class is over you won’t see your professor in quite the same light.
You don’t need me to tell you what the future holds. You need sleep!
I’m happy you’re learning a lot in your classes, but if you keep applying what you have learned in psychology or Concepts of Mathematics to things like your friends’ future prospects, you won’t need your textbook to tell you that no one cares.
You are quite confident, and that’s good. However, I advise that when recruiters at the Employment Opportunities Conference ask you what your goals are, don’t tell them that one of them is to be the ruler of the world.
I’m sorry to tell you this, but Pandora is not in tune with your feelings. Yes, it plays song after song that touches your heart, but I have been told it is just a program of some sort.
Movies aren’t often factual. That being said, after seeing the preview for The Roommate, I strongly advise doing some research on that pull-in you’re going to be living with next semester.
When you are printing over 60 pages in the cluster three minutes before class, the person behind you isn’t mad at you or wishing you ill. They in fact pity you and are instead cursing your professor.
Considering that this is the Monday after the Superbowl, I really hope that you’re not reading this from jail. If you are, however, I can predict that the rest of your week will be rather interesting, to say the least.
Do something nice this week: Save a ChemE from the cluster.

Though Sleepwalk with Me and Other Painfully True Stories is Mike Birbiglia’s first novel, he has already attracted a mass of devoted fans thanks to his contributions to The Best of Comedy Central and public radio’s This American Life and The Moth. Birbiglia might also be familiar to readers of his blog “My Secret Public Journal” or to those who have seen his stand-up act, “What I Should Have Said is Nothing.”
At its core, Sleepwalk with Me is about the images that always seem to sneak into dreams: love, family, and — as is expected with Birbiglia’s self-deprecating humor — humiliation. An extension of his one-man show, Birbiglia brings to his memoir all the wit that has set him apart from other comedians of our generation. Those familiar with Birbiglia’s comic work and its dependence on antics, voices, and impressions may wonder exactly how his humor translates to a written page.
The answer? Wonderfully. Birbiglia’s memoir may contain an odd assortment of stories, but all are carefully constructed to either leave you in tears or peals of laughter. Birbiglia’s writing differs from his stand-up routines: The stories included in this book have gained the depth and complexity of a storyteller, rather than a comic. Whether recounting young love, the trials of growing up, or more recent bouts with a sleeping disorder, Birbiglia crafts funny but finely-tuned stories which are sure to entertain.
Critics and readers have given the book high praise. Seth Meyers, head writer and host of “Weekend Update” for Saturday Night Live, offered a review that many readers would likely agree with. “Mike Birbiglia is a good friend of mine, but I’m still really happy when weird, bad things happen to him because I love hearing the stories,” Meyers wrote in a quote for the back of Sleepwalk with Me. And weird, bad things do seem to consistently happen to Birbiglia. These occurrences fill the pages that describe Birbiglia’s start in the comedy business. He recounts his experiences driving across the country to open for unknown comics, eventually working his way up to his current level of success. The stories also stream through his hilarious and fascinating accounts of the effects of a sleeping disorder that has often left him in compromising situations. Even the most mundane stories in the book, about his childhood antics or primary school lessons, are told with such wit and insight that they match up with any of the spectacles described in other sections.
The book is a quick read, with only 200 pages that will fly by due to Birbiglia’s simple style. The final chapter is the book’s peak, the punchline of the unfolding joke. Any details must remain unsaid, as Birbiglia himself has warned that the finale must remain a secret to potential readers. “If you read this before your friends, don’t tell what happens in the final chapter,” he writes in the inside cover. “Hint: It’s not a naked picture of me. It’s even more extreme.”

While just receiving an invitation may be the most significant achievement for the individual attendees at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, the overarching goal of the event is to stage conversations between leaders in their respective fields and glean insights about the state of the world from these conversations.
“Its purpose is not to solve problems.... The incentive is getting interesting and important people from around the world together to talk about problems,” explained Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon, who participated in this year’s forum as a moderator.
According to the WEF website, the forum “provides a rethinking of our systems and exploration of strategies and solutions that have positive transformational implications. 
“For more than four decades, the Annual Meeting has provided leaders from industry, government, academia, civil society and the media with an unrivalled platform to shape the global agenda and catalyse solutions at the start of each year.”
The WEF finds university presidents ideally suited to moderating such discussions.
“Jerry [Cohon] brings us ... a capacity to address topics in a holistic fashion, a skill that we value, for example, in moderating sessions at Davos and that experienced university presidents like him offer,” said Michele Petochi, director and head of university community for the WEF.
This was Cohon’s second visit to Davos.
“I was there once before three years ago.... One of our alumni, who is now a CEO, arranged to have me there,” Cohon explained.
However, this year, Cohon is attending as a part of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF), a community initiated by the WEF in 2006 that currently includes twenty heads of leading universities from across the world. 
As a member of the GULF, Cohon received and will continue to receive invitations to the WEF each year. “We made sure that the World Economic Forum staff knew of Carnegie Mellon ... and we had [Petochi] visit campus for a day to learn more about us,” Cohon recalled about how he joined GULF. “He was very impressed, and on that basis we became a member.”
Petochi emphasized that in terms of the WEF gathering interesting and important people, universities are extremely rich resources. “We involve universities primarily by engaging the best faculty in groups of experts, ... [in] sessions at Davos and other summits, and other advisory roles,” Petochi said. “Having [Cohon] involved represents a unique opportunity of engaging CMU and its amazing faculty in our activities.”
Finally, Cohon stated that expertise in the field of education is always relevant. 
“The problems that the world faces today always have the kind of educational element to varying degrees, and sometimes it’s essential, so you need and want higher education leaders in the discussion,” Cohon said. “Education, especially higher education, is something on the mind of every government leader and every corporate leader around the world.”
In addition to being president of a leading research university, Cohon is the chair of the Executive Committee of the Association of American Universities.
During the WEF, Cohon moderated an interactive group session titled “Getting Things Done: Macro and Micro Strategies,” which addressed how technology use can help increase productivity. 
“This session was one of their dinner sessions,” Cohon said. “Every night they have sessions over dinner, and these sessions are intended to be informal by design. Unlike a formal session where people sit on a stage and make remarks, debate with each other, and respond to questions on the floor, this is much more informal where ... most of the session is just the conversation over dinner at each table.”
It might sound odd to students used to the classroom setting, but Cohon explained how the atmosphere and context at Davos is different: “The reason it works is that interesting people come to Davos. You never know who you’ll be sitting with at dinner, and the discussion I found was always very interesting.”
At Cohon’s table, the discussion leaders included the deputy prime minister of Vietnam, a professor of psychology and behavior economics at Duke University, and the CEO of Infosys Technologies. “It was a very interesting group,” Cohon said.
Cohon recalled that the most interesting part of the World Economic Forum was at another dinner session where the two speakers were Amy Chua, a professor of law at Yale Law School and author of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, and Lawrence Summers, the former president of Harvard University and former director of the National Economic Council.
“Had you told me in advance, ‘Hey, you want to go to dinner to hear Tiger Mom and Larry Summers?’ I would have passed,” Cohon said. “But it was a very interesting dialogue, ... and both were very intelligent.”
Another major part of the WEF is networking. “It’s a very large crowd of very prominent people, and there’s value for each person in connecting with others,” Cohon said. “You’re walking out of the hallway, and there’s Bill Clinton, there’s Bill Gates, there’s George Soros talking with the president of Russia.... Getting access to any one of these people might take months and months if it happens at all, but here at Davos you can just go up to them and say, ‘Hi’ if you have the guts.”
However, Cohon admitted that he was shameless in this regard. 
“My goal was to promote Carnegie Mellon in this very influential and important group of people and to meet people who could help Carnegie Mellon,” he said. “I’d say I did quite a bit of both.”

Numerous sources have cited Western Pennsylvania as the “Saudi Arabia of natural gas.” The Marcellus Shale holds the responsibility for this nickname, containing about 10,000 square kilometers of mostly untapped natural gas reserves. 
Many argue that tapping into these reserves will have detrimental environmental impacts on the surrounding regions, while others argue that these risks are small, and doing so will drastically decrease the United States’ dependence on foreign oil and energy while creating jobs and stimulating the economy. Last Thursday, former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge came to Carnegie Mellon to offer his viewpoints on the Marcellus Shale and what it means to the people of Pennsylvania.
Ridge, a native of Western Pennsylvania, holds a degree from the Dickenson School of Law and an honorary doctorate degree in public policy from Carnegie Mellon. Ridge served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001, where he developed a “growing greener” initiative that earned him a Conservationist of the Year award from the Pennsylvania Wildlife Federation.
He then became the president and CEO of Ridge Global, a company that, according to the Ridge Global website, consults with businesses and governments on issues including the development of the Marcellus Shale. 
His talk about the Marcellus Shale last Thursday brought hundreds of Western Pennsylvanians to Carnegie Mellon.
At the beginning of his talk, Ridge spoke about the structure of the talk itself, stating, “It’s designed to be provocative. We’re taking on some really challenging issues. Probably one of the most challenging, one of the most controversial, and most important in the 21st century — bigger than Marcellus — is how do we as a country, down the road, interact and work with mutual needs and remain environmentally sensitive...?”
Ridge expressed his thoughts on how the core mechanics of America’s economy have changed since the steel-mill days, though its people’s obligation to those who follow in their footsteps has not; the Marcellus Shale would create job opportunities to fulfill such obligations. He claimed that, in the past two years, 75,000 new jobs have been created, resulting in nearly $1 billion in revenue for state and local governments.
“The story of natural gas is one of a new American reliance on itself. We will rely on our own natural resources, we will rely on our own people, our own technology, and our own ability to meet and exceed challenges.... I’d rather drill here than import from a cartel,” Ridge said.
He went on to say that nearly two-thirds of the country’s oil comes from overseas, and that utilizing the energy from the Marcellus Shale would allow the U.S. to become more energy-independent.
Ridge claimed that the risks involved with drilling are inevitable, and thus the key to making this venture successful is “managing the risks.” He explained that numerous questions regarding these risks remain, and the burden will continue to be on the industry to answer these questions.
When his keynote speech ended, the audience was allowed to ask questions. Most of the audience members expressed concern for the environmental impacts and asked for clarification on how these issues were being dealt with.
One audience member in particular, a native of Peters Township in Washington County where some Marcellus Shale drilling is already occurring, urged Ridge to talk to residents who have complained of contaminated water as a result of the Shale drilling and are being silenced by nondisclosure agreements.
Ridge responded that he did not believe the contamination was caused by the drilling.
Numerous audience members were dissatisfied with Ridge’s response to many of the questions regarding the science and engineering of Marcellus Shale drilling, with one member even saying to him, “With all due respect, you should know the answer to that question.”
Ridge responded, “I didn’t graduate with an engineering degree.... You can think the lack of my technical education is somewhat surprising, but I’d be more concerned if the regulators weren’t technically qualified.”
The debate over Marcellus Shale will continue as further research will help uncover many of the uncertainties behind the current methods of extraction.
“It is important that while we develop domestic energy sources like shale gas, we also think about the potential consequences for our critical water resources,” said civil and environmental engineering professor Jeanne VanBriesen in a recent press release.
These potential consequences will be the driving force behind future research. As Ridge stated, “You need to have science drive this, folks. This conversation has just begun.”

The majority of incoming first-years are expected to learn the facts of, as Paula Deen would say, “Good eatin.’” 
With few exceptions, all students are required to have a meal plan their first year, and they eventually learn the difference between a good meal and junk food, for the most part. 
As students progress into their upperclassman years, they learn that living without a meal plan can present added difficulty.
With these considerations in mind, five junior information systems majors met with each other for a class project and began work on creating a nutritional fact tracker for food. 
The Tartan Food Tracker (TFT) came from these five students during a transition period in Carnegie Mellon’s push for healthy initiatives. 
Recently, programs like Fitness Challenge 2011, which is being spearheaded by Pattye Stragar, operations manager for fitness, have garnered enthusiastic feedback from students. 
On a list of student names posted in the University Center, many students have a variety of stickers next to their name, indicating they have exercised for at least 20 minutes for that particular day.
The TFT was created by Ashwin Hegde, Joey Raudabaugh, Arvind Shrihari, Brandon Tyson, and Anthony Zhang. 
Essentially, it is an online tool where each student can log on to access nutritional facts about the food offered by vendors across campus. 
Students can make a personal log of their food intake while formulating food combinations. 
The tool allows students to compare nutritional details such as the number of calories and amounts of fat and protein.
“We’ve worked closely with vendors on campus to get Excel sheets about their meals — something that is a difficult task for small food vendors,” Tyson said. “Though there have been small glitches in creating TFT, we anticipate having every food item in the system.”
Tyson discussed the potential growth of the TFT with confidence, declaring that the team is looking to include off-campus nutritional information. 
“It’s easier for large food vendors like McDonald’s to offer their nutritional facts since they’re required to,” Tyson said.
In 2009, a health assessment conducted by Paula Martin, a nutritionist and part of the Health Promotion Office of Carnegie Mellon, showed that 6.2 percent of students are underweight, 19 percent are overweight, and 3.2 percent are considered Class I obese.
Martin has worked closely with the TFT group to ensure that all proper nutritional guidelines are followed. 
She is teaching a course this semester titled “Personal Nutrition.” According to the syllabus, the class “empowers students to develop and promote healthy eating attitudes and behaviors for themselves.”
The course has gained popularity, with 15 students on the waiting list and several others auditing. When asked about the student food choice, Martin said, “We offer, students choose.”
Martin has worked closely with vendors and claims that healthful options are available on menus but students still choose otherwise. “Students ultimately choose the chicken fingers,” Tyson said, “and vendors will respond to consumer interest.”
Martin believes that issues of weight go beyond healthful food choices and resonate with body image, a concept introduced in her course. 
For example, a slide from her lecture on body image states that “28 percent of women at Carnegie Mellon describe themselves as slightly overweight or very overweight when less than 16 percent are, by body mass index.”
Food choice, exercise, and body image are three closely related concepts. 
The TFT program is a nudge for “students [to] become more aware of what they are putting in their bodies,” according to its website.

For many students, the words “karaoke” and “embarrassment” are synonymous. However, for those who love singing and performing for friends or strangers, CulinArt’s Karaoke Night in the Carnegie Mellon Café can be an opportunity. Every Monday for the past three weeks, CulinArt, the primary food vendor for Housing and Dining Services, has been hosting karaoke from 6–9 p.m. for students to come and display their singing prowess and even win some interesting prizes.
This event consists of an informal just-for-fun section and a more serious, competitive section. The winner of the competition part will receive $100 in cash and be provided with the opportunity to sing the National Anthem at a Washington Wild Things semi-pro baseball game this summer.
The contest is a six-week event that started on Jan. 17 and will continue until Feb. 21. Students who wish to compete will be filmed during the first 30 seconds of their song, and the resulting video will be posted online on CulinArt’s Facebook page. From there, anyone can go on the Facebook page and “like” the singer he or she thinks is the best. The contestants must receive at least 10 “likes” to be in the finale. Those who do qualify will sing a final song, and the voting process will start over again, with the winner receiving the grand prize.
CulinArt’s student activities director, Shelby Cole, commented, “I brought karaoke back because a lot of students were asking for it, but I also wanted to provide CMU students with the opportunity to showcase their amazing vocal skills by offering them the opportunity to sing the National Anthem in front of people.”
To make the contest more exciting and involve the campus as a whole, students can vote for their favorite singers online. “We wanted to make this an interactive competition, and produce a winner that is chosen with confidence by the student body to represent CMU,” Cole said.
There are already four contestants competing with videos online. Dylan McKinney, a first-year creative and performing arts major, entered the contest. When asked why he decided to participate, he responded, “to sing to Maria the lunch lady for her birthday!” McKinney thought the prize could be a great career builder. “I feel like it would be nice for my singing career to have some good publicity. I would post [my win] on my Facebook status right away,” McKinney said.
For students who want to sing without the pressure of being in a contest, there is still an option. 
CulinArt leaves karaoke open to all students, faculty, and staff “enjoy the art of karaoke, and want to enjoy a night out with friends in a fun atmosphere.”
To pre-register for the competition part of the event, contact Shelby Cole at scole@.

Crowdsourcing changes the way articles can be written
Researchers led by Aniket Kittur, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), showed that an article’s readability and consistency produced through crowdsourcing can be reasonably compared with an article written by an individual author.
To perform this study, Carnegie Mellon researchers Kittur; Robert Kraut, professor of human-computer interaction; and Boris Smus, a student in HCII’s joint master’s degree program with the University of Madeira, used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.
Mechanical Turk is an online marketplace where employers can post simple tasks that usually pay a few cents to the worker. The specific method that the researchers developed is CrowdForge, a framework that breaks down a challenging task into independent micro-tasks and then provides a means of combining them.
According to a university press release, “To accomplish these complex tasks, the CMU researchers approached the crowdsourcing market as if it was a distributed computing system, like the large computer systems used for Web searches. 
“In a distributed computing system, computations are divided up in such a way that smaller chunks can be solved simultaneously by large numbers of processors and failures by individual processors won’t undermine the entire process.” 
The School of Drama gives performance at new theater
From Feb. 17–26, the School of Drama will perform The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee at the New Hazlett Theater, Allegheny Square East, in the North Side.
“Master director Joe Deer (MFA ’96), an alumnus of the School of Drama, returns to stage in this vibrant, charm-filled and infectious musical with a dazzling group of singers, actors and dancers,” said Peter Cooke, head of the School of Drama, in a university press release.
This is the first production that the school is presenting in the New Hazlett Theater in order to allow local residents to experience the show, as well as give students real-world experience. The plot of the musical centers on six middle-school children who participate in a traditional spelling bee. The adult characters, seemingly just out of childhood, provide a source of entertainment as well.
“In this hilarious tale, they learn the lesson that winning is not everything, and losing does not necessarily make you a loser,” according to a university press release. 
James Lapine first directed the musical on Broadway in 2005, and it has garnered two Tony awards, two Theatre World awards, and three Drama Desk Awards, among others. The musical is based upon the book by Rachel Sheinkin, and the lyrics were written by William Finn.

Obsession with texting has become a cultural phenomenon. It is one of the main methods of communicating quickly and effectively among the younger generations. Although users consider it more impersonal than calling and faster than e-mail, texting has some major pitfalls. Especially when driving, it can lead to serious vehicular accidents. Looking at the numbers reveals how popular (and dangerous) texting can be:
50%: percentage of teens who send 50 or more text messages per day
76.4%: percentage of U.S. cell phone subscribers who use text messaging
81%: percentage of the United States population which admits to texting while a driving a vehicle
16,000: road fatalities between 2002 and 2007 which were caused by texting while driving

In a recent episode of The Big Bang Theory, socially awkward genius Sheldon Cooper decides never to leave his bedroom, instead opting to interact with the world via a cobbled-together robot that can send and receive video. At the same time audiences were laughing at Sheldon, a real version of his robot was changing Lyndon Baty’s life. Baty, a high-school first year from Knox City Independent School District in Texas, has a weak immune system, which makes it nearly impossible for him to attend school or engage in other social activities. 
With the help of VGO, a mobile robot that also has audiovisual recording and playback capabilities, Baty has, for the first time, been able to attend class with other students. Assistive learning technologies like VGO can fundamentally change students’ lives, and educators everywhere should consider them an essential investment.
While we applaud the administrators at Knox City, where Baty remotely attends classes, we also recognize our own university for its dedication to educating students regardless of their physical location.
The office of Equal Opportunity Services at Carnegie Mellon does a good job of giving students access to lecture and class materials in spite of any disabilities they might have. While it is true that many of these actions are required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the university gives students and faculty a wealth of options beyond those required. Many professors post their lecture notes online to begin with, and students who are unable to attend class due to illness or disability can view video recordings of lectures. The Open Learning Initiative reflects a dedication to education as it provides free instructional materials for students. The Helix in the Gates Center was designed in part to allow wheelchairs to go from the Cut all the way to the Collaborative Innovation Center without needing to use an elevator.
As students, we often take for granted the option to choose to attend lectures or read notes online. Whether it is through online recordings of lectures or robots with live communication, we hope that Carnegie Mellon and other universities continue to make education a top priority, regardless of the physical disabilities of their students.

After reading “With Little Output, Adams And Smith Squander First Semester In Office,” it troubles me that the Tartan Board has characterized Kate and my time in office as inactive, unimpressive, and, wholly, without merit. Although we may not have communicated as much as we would have liked last semester, we would like to assure the Tartan Board, the student body, and all of our partners across the university that we are continuing to work for them, and that many of our efforts to improve the campus now and in the future will be seen in our final months in office.
Last April, students gave Kate and me the responsibility of leading student government for the 2010–11 school year. We campaigned on a number of issues, coupled with initiatives that would target the campus community and bring about “A College To Believe In.” Last fall, we decided to focus on issues we felt were most relevant to the student body in the long term, which brought changes to our plan of action. For example, we chose to herald internal reorganization, implement a more robust Tartan Rewards Program, launch the Campaign for Great Ideas, and refocus our “College Connect” idea. With our new focus, we are now more able to foster beneficial programming to engage the community and keep our promise to the student body: to continue to make Carnegie Mellon a home for its diverse students and their diverse interactions.
Kate, I, and our partners in student government have laid important foundations and taken impactful strides for the future of student government at Carnegie Mellon. We have and we will continue to reach out to constituents, especially those traditionally underrepresented by previous student governments, to ensure that they understand student government is an asset to them. We are now working with other student government leaders to create a capital fund that will allow more impactful purchases that benefit the Carnegie Mellon community instead of going forward with our Executive Grant Program. We have partnered with the Academic Affairs Committee in Student Senate and academic departments to bring about a robust, sustainable, and accessible undergraduate-graduate program for Carnegie Mellon students. We are continuing our partnerships with the Athletics department and student organizations to guarantee a sustainable Tartan Rewards program. And we will see to it that elections are heavily promoted this year to help students recognize the impact that student government has for the community.
Our vision has always been to bring together student government leaders to provide the best services for the student body, and in many ways we believe we have succeeded. Even so, we sacrificed adequate communication and transparency with the entire campus, and I am very sorry for that.
As the student body becomes quickly immersed into the activities of the Spring semester, however, I will be sure that we as student government make a concerted effort to help students understand the work we are doing. And I hope that our friends on the Tartan Board will keep us accountable and assist us in conveying to students the work we are doing.
I encourage anyone wishing to monitor our continued progress as we enter February to go to stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/executive.
I also encourage all students to feel free to contact me anytime at sbp@. Any questions, comments, or critiques are welcome.
Best Regards,
Jarrett Dwight Adams
Student Body President

The Daily, an online newspaper application that has been recently released solely for the Apple iPad, evokes mixed feelings at The Tartan. While we fully acknowledge that print news is dying out and that the future of reporting is on the Internet, it seems highly limiting to offer a source of news only to owners of the Apple iPad. 
The Daily publishes news stories, videos, 360-degree photographs, and other interactive media on a real-time schedule. The online publication is produced by a staff of over 100 editors, writers, and designers and is predicted by the Daily Holdings, Inc. to operate on a small budget of $500,000 per week. Similar to a traditional newspaper, The Daily will also charge a subscription fee that comes out to about $0.14 per day for a user to have access to its content. 
Online publication using tools like the iPad is one approach to the problems current newspapers face; while profits from print are dying, newspapers are still expected to distribute most of their articles for free online. In response, newspapers have made efforts to gain revenue from their online readership by putting some content behind subscription walls, but that has largely been met with resistance. The newspaper industry has thus been struggling to stay out of the red due to its steadily declining revenue. If The Daily can accomplish what few newspapers have done so far — to create a profit in digital reporting — then we can do nothing but salute its progress.
We have some doubts, however, as to whether The Daily can overcome such a monumental challenge. The primary issue we see is that the publication is limiting its audience to consumers who own an iPad. While it’s true that a growing number of people own one of these devices, we see no reason that The Daily could not expand its model to also offer content online. We can see a little of the rationale behind the publication’s choice — the designers might have to produce two separate designs and more effort would have to be put into creating interactive media for a range of devices — but to us that effort seems highly profitable and would work with The Daily’s model to create a digital media source that would be able to sustain itself. 
In the end, though, we can do nothing but wish The Daily as much success as possible, in the hopes that it will pave the way for a new age of profitable and successful journalism.

There are more news sources and a greater volume of investigation and analysis than ever before. The Internet, and blogging in particular, has made it easy for independent journalists and pundits to let their voices cry out across the digital expanse. Yet news is dying.
The BBC recently announced it was cutting several of its foreign language broadcasts to save money. Along with wire services like the Associated Press and Reuters, the BBC is the gold standard for getting news untainted by opinion. That is not to say that the journalists writing for these services have no editorial opinion, but that they consciously avoid including it.
Bloggers, for the most part, have no such compunction. They mix facts and opinions without differentiating between the two. They lack training in journalistic ethics, and they rarely have editors to ensure their articles are factual. In this new journalistic paradigm, quantity takes precedence over quality. Ten thousand tweets might not have the same journalistic value as a single well-researched, professionally edited feature story. It might take reading a hundred blog posts to form the same knowledge base that a handful of professional journalistic outlets provide.
The world of new media is one where reputation means both more and less than it used to. The reputation of Perez Hilton, while considerable, is different in kind than that of The New York Times or The Guardian. When one of these newspapers prints something, readers can usually assume it has been duly edited. This also holds true for magazines with respected editorial practices such as Vanity Fair and Time. With the advent of Twitter, celebrities have been able to “die” on the Internet — Fidel Castro, Amy Winehouse, and Bill Cosby have all been mourned by the Twitterverse, only to later prove that they are, in fact, still quite alive. Such are the dangers of unmoderated, unedited, democratic media.
Blogs, Twitter, and Facebook have their place. But that place is not where institutions like the BBC have stood for decades. The unadulterated voice of the masses is too raucous to comprehend. Without fact-checking, without enforced journalistic integrity, the future of the news is bleak. It may be that news will be reborn as something new, something that is objective only in the aggregate. That is the future of news that Twitter and Facebook promise. There will be ever more information, ever more opinion, but ever less quality.

Following its attack on the health care law last month, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives has chosen its next target: Planned Parenthood.
Okay, I get it; the majority of Republicans are pro-life. Planned Parenthood is commonly recognized as an organization that performs abortions. However, the naiveté of the situation exists in the fact that Planned Parenthood is by no means an organization whose sole purpose is the funding of abortions.
Planned Parenthood provides millions of women all over the United States with family-planning services such as birth control, body-image counseling services, general health care, women’s and men’s sexual health care, sexual orientation and gender advising, STD testing, relationship counseling, prenatal health care, screenings for breast and cervical cancer, Pap smears, and diabetes testing, as well as family counseling in the face of tragedy.
Personally, Planned Parenthood is an organization that is very close to my heart. I remember learning about the organization for the first time when I was 10. My sister’s best friend had just lost her older sister in a tragic horseback riding accident; the family had been receiving group grief counseling at the local Planned Parenthood. I remember how highly they valued that service and the time spent there.
The Republicans in the House of Representatives have made it their goal to redirect any government money going to organizations that provide abortion services, but here’s the kicker: Planned Parenthood does not use government money to fund its abortion services. Congress has already prohibited this except in cases of rape, incest, or complicated births where the mother’s life is in danger.
While I was against the Republican majority’s vote to repeal the health care law last month, I was confident that the repeal would be shut down in Senate. That being said, that fact that the House is even considering an attack on Planned Parenthood scares me senseless. The destruction of Planned Parenthood is something that would directly affect me and my generation. In my opinion, a woman’s choice regarding pregnancy shouldn’t be left up to a group of middle-aged conservative men. If Congress decides to eliminate abortion as an option, then it must prepare itself for the repercussions of unprepared motherhood: higher dropout rates, poverty, and ill-cared-for children. Eliminate Planned Parenthood as a resource for women and you eliminate free reproductive health care, family planning, and sex education for millions.

Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, has been competing fiercely with Google since its release in June 2009. Last summer, Google’s Head of Search Ranking Amit Singhal began to suspect that Bing was using information from the Bing toolbar’s Customer Experience Improvement Program and Suggested Sites on Internet Explorer to “cheat” off of Google’s search results. Google set up a sting operation last December with nonsense queries linked to “honeypot” pages to test if Bing was copying its results. The sting operation seemed to be aimed at discrediting Bing’s search technology directly. While less than 10 percent of the tests came up positive, Google engineers saw this as legitimate proof that Bing was cheating off its search queries.
These rather insignificant statistics show Google’s tendency to make an issue out of nothing. We believe that much of the hype and competition surrounding Google and Bing is generated in an effort to gain more publicity for themselves.
Indeed, this method of garnering publicity has worked well, popping up on shows like the Colbert Report, prompting the creation of websites like bing-vs-google.com, and fueling the fire of the ongoing Twitter war between the two companies. Upon being questioned about Google’s “Bing sting” results, the Director of Search at Microsoft Stefan Weitz and others at Bing were quick to offer up a counter-argument. He admitted to using clickstream data (anonymous recording of Web clicks) as part of Bing’s search algorithm. However, Bing claimed that users willingly opted in to sharing their data and that Google had rigged its “Bing sting” operation to make it seem as if Bing was copying more results than it actually was.
Microsoft has the capacity to utilize all of the resources it has on hand to improve Bing’s search results, but the company isn’t quite living up to its potential. Google has had many years to perfect its search results, so it stands to reason that the younger Bing needs more time to fine tune its own search algorithms, instead of trying to replicate the same results as Google in order to keep up. Microsoft has access to a large amount of user data that it can tap into, and Bing should aim at incorporating this information in order to improve. Both companies need to focus on improving their products and appealing to customers instead of bickering among themselves.

Hardcore gamers are ruining the game industry. While game sales are breaking many records, they are dependent on a large number of sequels. Instead of searching for innovation, the industry is being driven by a desire for the latest installments in flagship series ranging from games like Call of Duty to Guitar Hero. 
More creative games such as Okami and Singularity attempt to break from this new trend, but they never sell as well as the blockbuster titles. Hardcore gamers want their hard-earned skills to transfer over from game to game so that when they pick up the newest sequel, they know what to expect as soon as they sit down to play.
Hardcore gamers tend to be distrusting of new products, and wait until their prices are radically slashed before even attempting them. This leads to poor sales for more unique games, with the quality of the game being completely ignored. 
This isn’t to say that all innovative games are worth buying, but on the rare occasion that games are both creative and well made, they should receive the recognition that they deserve.
As a whole, the Nintendo Wii has been targeted at more casual gamers. From Wii Sports to Donkey Kong Country Returns, Nintendo has been shelling out games that appeal to a wider audience. Their marketing strategy is aimed at gamers of all ages, and has been widely successful with younger gamers in particular. Microsoft and Sony are trying to appeal to that same audience with the introduction of the Xbox Kinect and Playstation’s Move. This new focus on casual gamers has also taken away many of the preconceptions of gaming as an exclusively skill-intensive activity, and many Wii games are catered more toward nonchalant gamers. 
Just Dance, Wii Fit, and Carnival Games have seen huge success because casual gamers bought them simply on the grounds that they looked fun to play. Portable gaming systems are more popular than ever before, with the Nintendo DS as the second best-selling video game console of all time.
The Nintendo Wii does have a small number of games that are geared towards more hardcore gamers, such as MadWorld and Bully, but they don’t have the same market appeal as their Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 relatives do. Neither one is a sequel to a well known franchise (although Bully is a direct spin off of Grand Theft Auto), and therefore have difficulties achieving widespread sales. 
Now that these three systems have been around for over five years, the industry is overdue for a major overhaul. 
With the massive increase in casual gamers, companies should aim at creating games that can bring together the two subsets of gamers instead of expanding the gap. 
While the Nintendo DS is making great strides toward reaching both audiences with its games, the three main consoles need to make more games that aren’t just aimed at the hardcore gamer or the casual gamer. Bridging the gap between these two types of gamers will bring in a new era of gaming.
Daniel Lipson (dlipson@) is acting Forum co-editor for The Tartan. He is a hardcore gamer and hopes that his fellow gamers don’t end up ruining the industry.
