Students, alumni, and parents crowded the sides of Tech and Frew Streets last Friday and Saturday to watch the 94th annual Sweepstakes competition — or Buggy, as it is better known within the Carnegie Mellon community. The Student Dormitory Council (SDC) came out on top once again in both the men’s and women’s races, with its A teams winning both races by about a four-second margin. This is the third year in a row that SDC won the women’s race, and the second year in a row that it has won the men’s race.
Eleven organizations competed in the race around the 0.9-mile course this year. In addition to long-established buggy organizations like Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), which has participated in Buggy off and on since the 1920s, there were two newer additions to the competition: Apex, which raced for the first time in 2012, and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). Although the Air Force ROTC  competed in Buggy from 1987–90, this is the first year that Carnegie Mellon’s Naval ROTC has competed.
Friday’s preliminary races were cut short because of rain, but not before the 19 women’s teams held their preliminaries. SDC A gave a hint of what was to come in the next day’s races, finishing the women’s preliminary a full 10 seconds faster than the next closest team, CIA A. Fringe A would have come in second place behind SDC A, had they not been disqualified for safety violations. There were only four heats on the men’s side before rain forced the preliminaries to end, but SPIRIT A took the lead in races that were completed, with a time of 2:13.408. Of the races that did occur, there was one mishap — in a heat against ROTC A and Fringe B (who failed to show), SDC D was in the lead until the buggy spun out while going around a curve. SDC C and Fringe B were given a second chance, though, as all 28 men’s teams were rescheduled to race on Saturday because of the rain.
Although Saturday morning was windy and cold, there was no rain, allowing the races to proceed. This was the first time in several years that Buggy held a full second day of races, as the final races were cut short due to rain in both 2011 and 2012.
As one of the WRCT commentators noted, the buggies tend to go slower in cold weather since it makes the roads colder. This did not seem to affect the teams’ performances too much, though, as there were still several excellent times put in. The SDC men’s A team won with a time of 2:04.987, only about 1.5 seconds behind the all-time record of 2:03.30 that SDC set in 2009. Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp) A and Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) A — who placed second and third, respectively, in the men’s race — also did well, both performing incredibly close to last year’s times.
As in the preliminaries, there was only one crash: Sigma Nu A’s buggy, nicknamed Bungarus Krait, spun out of control around a curve in the chute and crashed into the hay bales lining the course’s edge.
Since all 28 of the men’s teams had to compete on Saturday, it took far more time than originally scheduled to complete the men’s finals. Sweepstakes committee thus announced around 11 a.m. that the women’s finals would be canceled, making the scores from the preliminary race the final scores.
However, soon after, the commitee rescinded its decision and announced it would be holding the final races after all, causing the buggy teams to frantically reorganize for the races. Buggy participants down by the trucks had mixed emotions; some sprung into action, while others protested the change. “I just ate,” one pusher bemoaned when she heard the news.
“We were ready to pack things and be done, so no one’s prepared to unload the buggies and get the wheels heated, and we don’t know where all our pushers are,” said senior Ben Pattison-Gordon, a pusher for the CIA B team. 
“They all dispersed because they thought they were done,” said Jessica Phoa, a sophomore pusher for CIA women’s B team. However, as Pattison-Gordon noted, it was also understandable that some seniors wanted to get their last pushes in.
Had the scores from the preliminaries stood as the final scores, SDC A still would have come in first place at 2:32.062, with CIA A and SDC B behind them. But the last-minute change did not hurt SDC: In its final heat, SDC A got a time of 2:32.600. In the finals, Fringe B ended up coming in second, at 2:39.004.
Junior Taryn Monteleone, Fringe president and pusher on hill two for the Fringe B team, said she was “satisfied” with Fringe’s overall performance. “We had a brand new team of people in charge,” she said. “Overall, as a team, I think we grew a lot.”

Fifth-year architecture student Becky Peterkin surely knows how to let the good times roll. As a buggy driver for Fringe for all five of her years here at Carnegie Mellon, the King George, Va. native has gotten to both design and drive record-setting buggies.
Peterkin has devoted much of her college career to Fringe’s buggy team, both driving and building their buggies. Although she hasn’t participated much this past year due to time restraints and developing allergies to a few raw materials, she was a mechanic during her sophomore and junior years. “I didn’t do too much in the way of hard machining, but I like to think I was helpful as an extra person who could put on and take off the wheels and know how to do somewhat complicated wraps in the build process,” she said.
Peterkin drove and helped build Fringe’s buggy Bonsai, which won second place in the buggy design competition in 2011. For Peterkin, Bonsai was her biggest accomplishment: “I’m very proud of having a large role in building Bonsai and then getting to drive her to a record-setting freeroll.” Bonsai was the first buggy to do a sub-50-second freeroll.
“Becky is most certainly one of our best drivers and really was a force to be reckoned with when she drove Bonsai,” said Fringe president junior Taryn Monteleone.
Peterkin’s ability to be an active member of a buggy team has exceeded all of her pre-college expectations. Although she had heard a bit about the sport and knew that shorter girls usually got to drive the buggies, there were still many unknowns about the tradition. “Coming to CMU, I knew almost nothing about Buggy. I remember being nervous about finding frat guys I could actually talk to about driving. I didn’t even know that there were independent teams until I was recruited onto one,” Peterkin said. “I just knew it was a sport where being short was not only helpful, but let you get the most fun job.”
After she joined the team, Peterkin quickly caught the bug for buggy, and has been heavily involved ever since, adopting the daily schedule of a hardcore buggy driver.
In the first few weeks of the fall, before rolls actually start, Peterkin goes to recruitment events, particularly when the Fringe team is looking for a new driver, which involves “a few weeks of Thursday night half-price visits and other organized things to find new Frinjas,” she said. As for her regular weekly schedule, “The main day-to-day differences are of course actual rolls, but that does have some impact on the rest of the week,” she said. “I usually go to bed Friday night around 10. 5 a.m. always shows up a lot earlier than it seems like it will.”
In the spring there are regular build sessions, as well as push practices every night at 11 p.m. in addition to weekend rolls. Generally the team has enough drivers that each driver only needs to come out two or three times during the week instead of all five days. “I’m not sure my shoulders could handle it otherwise,” Peterkin said.
As one of Carnegie Mellon’s most experienced buggy drivers, she takes “pride in teaching our new drivers and mechanics, so the buggy tradition can carry on,” she said.
“She’s been an incredible resource for the younger drivers,” Monteleone said. “A bunch of drivers have come and gone, but Becky has stayed with us. She teaches them a lot, and really is a mentor.”
Fringe driver first-year Gillian Rosen agreed. “Becky brings the wisdom and experience of five years of driving and an excellent line,” she said. “Plus a laser pointer and a cozy bathrobe for cold mornings.”
“Becky makes all of the drivers feel very comfortable with who they are,” Monteleone said. “She is a good friend to all the drivers.”
Peterkin’s favorite part of the Sweepstakes experience is the team that she is so dedicated to. “Even though it sounds corny, I’m just super grateful for a group of friends that I would have never had otherwise,” she said.
The team often “gets together for food, enjoying each other’s company.” The day before the big buggy race, the Fringe squad holds a big pasta party, watches old race footage, and decorates old uniforms. “It’s a blast,” Peterkin said.
Although Peterkin is unsure of what the future holds in terms of a career, she is looking for jobs and is sure that “if I find something in Pittsburgh, there’s a very good chance I’ll come back [to Fringe] as an alumni.”
Although last weekend was the final Sweepstakes of Peterkin’s career, her legacy is “one of record-breaking speed and victory,” Rosen said. Peterkin drove for both the women’s and men’s Fringe C teams, achieving a final time of 2:25.585 for the men and 3:11.434 in the preliminaries for the women.
Peterkin would love “for buggy in general to continue its recent trend of growing, both in the numbers of teams involved and the amount of people truly committed to making rolls happen each year.” In addition, the die-hard “Frinja” would “like to see the team continue excelling in the design competition, and for Fringe to return to top speeds,” she said. “And of course, I’d like to see ‘Fringe’ written on the driver-sized first-place trophy a few more times.”

The men’s and women’s track and field teams recently had three major meets in preparation for the UAA Championships hosted by New York University on April 27 and 28: the Dave Labor Invitational at Slippery Rock for throwers, jumpers, and sprinters on April 13, the Outdoor Classic at Bucknell University on the April 13, and the Allegheny College Tri-Meet on the April 16.
The men’s team had a mixed day in bad weather at Slippery Rock. The mid-distance side excelled, with sophomore Tommy Vandenberg winning the 400-meter dash with a time of 48.78, first-year Thomas Mayo-Smith placing second in the 800, and the 4x400 relay team of Mayo-Smith, first-year Marc-Daniel Julien, Vandenberg, and sophomore Douglas O’Connell earning second place. Junior Zachary Erra-Hernandez, continuing an extremely strong season, won shot put and placed third in the hammer and discus events.
Injured first-year standout Benjamin Neiman said the team “had a surprising number of strong performances despite really bad weather.”
Senior thrower Liam McGrath had a less optimistic view on the meet, admitting, “It was honestly a mediocre day.… I don’t think anyone had a great day, but I don’t think anyone had a particularly bad day either.” Still, McGrath and Neiman both praised Hernandez’s performance in the shot put.
On the women’s side, junior Jane Kim received a personal record with her sixth-place 35.52-meter performance in the hammer throw. In the 5,000-meter run, sophomore Sara Kelly placed fourth and first-year Sophia Greene finished seventh. Junior Jacqueline Guevel won the 400-meter hurdles, and first-year Alex Lewis won the 400-meter dash, with times of 64:91 and 62:13, respectively. First-year Jenna Asperslag won the 100-meter dash with a personal record of 13.03, and fellow first-year Erin Persson claimed third in the 1,500-meter event.
“The weather was miserable, but we collectively did well,” Asperslag said. “There were a lot of people who had personal records.”
Greene agreed, saying, “despite the cold weather and the winds, we performed admirably.”
At Bucknell, sophomore Josh Newby seized sixth in the five-kilometer event with a personal record of 14:41.43. From the women, senior Emily Wobb captured 12th in the 5,000-meter at 17:52.27, joining sophomores Halley Bayer and Erin Kiekhaefer with personal records.
Men’s team senior captain, Dan Cardenas, said of the Bucknell meet, “The distance team did really well at Bucknell,” adding, “Josh Newby especially had a very good day.”
Both the men’s and women’s squads captured second place out of three teams at Allegheny. In the javelin throw, junior Dave Markowitz placed second. “Dave Markowitz, who throws javelin, has been close to hitting 50 meters in the past three meets, which is a big milestone,” McGrath said.
Erra-Hernandez set a personal record of 51.25 meters in the hammer throw, winning the event. The Tartans swept the hammer toss, as junior Nathan Cheek won second and senior Pat Robinson received third. Erra-Hernandez also won the shot put and earned second in the discus throw.
First-year Brandon Hoane received a career-best 11.90 meters with a fourth-place showing in the triple jump. Julien won second in the 1,500, with a time of 4:09.01.
Mayo-Smith won the 800 with a personal record of 1:57.90 and senior Noel Titus received second places in both the 100-meter and 200-meter events, with a personal record of 10.96 seconds in the 100. Cardenas celebrated Titus’ performance, saying, “Noel Titus finally broke 11 seconds in the 100, which was his college goal.”
The women’s team saw a win in the triple jump and a second place in the long jump from junior Marissa Bynoe. Kim won the shot put, and senior Carissa Iannone placed first in the javelin, throwing 32.81 meters. Fellow senior Leila Bouabdellaoui won the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a personal record of 11:58.85, and Asperslag won the 200-meter dash and got second place in the 100-meter. First-years Taylor Maggiacomo and Elizabeth Snyder finished second and third respectively in the 1500-meter run. Junior Marie Barcic placed second in the 800-meter run, and was joined by Persson at third.
Asperslag said, “Allegheny was a much smaller meet [than other meets this year] ... pretty much everyone did well.”
The team has UAA Championships this coming weekend. Neiman said, “I don’t think we really need to improve,” continuing, “We have the talent  ... now we just need to go out and do well.”
Summarizing the season as a whole, Cardenas said, “we started out pretty slow but we’ve gotten much better.... This is probably the best year in program history, and there have been more records than there have been for over 25 years.”

When Pittsburgh was awakened by heavy downpour Friday morning, many were skeptical about whether the 19th Annual Mobot Races would still take place. But as noon approached, the rain died down to a drizzle and eventually subsided, and a crowd gathered around the course outside Wean Hall.
The course consists of a white path drawn on the sidewalk outside Wean Hall. The line starts above the stairs and quickly transitions into a 28-inch downhill drop. The course then becomes a series of winding turns with several small metal gates through which the mobot must pass. After another 46-inch drop, the mobot must face the last part of the course: decisionpoints. In this part of the course, there are several points at the which the white path branches into two and the mobot must correctly choose the one leading to the next gate or else risk following a diverted path that results in a longer course time.
Greg Armstrong, a senior research technician at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, was the Mobot Race announcer. Dressed in a traditional Scottish kilt and carrying a very realistic-looking sword, Armstrong amused the crowd with fun facts about Pittsburgh as the crowd watched the competitors brave the wet and windy course conditions.
The first competitor was  StringRay, a one-man team consisting of electrical and computer engineering master’s student Kwabena Agyeman. StringRay could only make it through one gate on its first trial; it was soon followed by three other mobot competitors.
Megubot was a father-daughter team consisting of Megan McKelvey, a former C-Mite student, and her father, Terry McKelvey. Revo was a one-man team and consisted of senior electrical and computer engineering major Daniel Jacobs. MoBoss was much larger and consisted of electrical and computer engineering first-years Cosku Acay, Edwin Cho, Kenneth Li, Nishant Pol, and Oguz Ulgen, and first-year mechanical engineering major Sam Zeng.
The results of the 19th Annual Mobot Races are as follows: in the Open Class category, StringRay took first prize, passing through Gate 5 with a time of 1:08.48; in the Exhibition category, Megubot got through Gate 11 with a time of 1:31.25; in the Undergraduate category MoBoss received first prize, moving through Gate 12 with a time of 1:48.37, and Revo received second prize, moving through Gate 9 with a time of 1:12.10.
The Mini-Challenge, which occurred the Wednesday before the Mobot Races, consists solely of the race course between the two drops (before the area with decision points). Revo completed the Mini-Challenge in 33.36 seconds and MoBoss completed it in 24.86 seconds.
On race day, each team had three chances to complete the course. The first and second rounds occurred during a break in the rain, but it started raining again for the third round. For each race,  members of the crowd would crane their necks and walk along the concrete sidewalk as the mobots advanced forward in the course. Each time a mobot passed through a gate, Armstrong would lead the crowd in a cheer: “Hip, hip, hooray!”
One time, after the crowd cheered loudly for a mobot passing through a gate, the mobot jerked toward the side and ran off the track. “Maybe the mobot had sound sensors,” a man in the crowd mused. “Did we scare it?” While this prediction is probably far-fetched, there were many other factors that affected the performance of the mobots. For example, since it rained before the start of the races, there were patches of the concrete that were wet and darker than the rest of the sidewalk. Some of the mobots had trouble finding the white line in such patches.
According to Dan Bothell (SCS ’96), who was once an undergraduate competitor of the Mobot Races and is now on the committee that helps run it, the Mobot Races have evolved substantially over  the past few years. While the early-year mobots used simple light sensors and basic custom-built controllers, more recent mobots use much more advanced technology, such as the built-in cameras found in smartphones. “The interesting thing about that,” said Bothel, “is that even with the extra computing power available, it is still a difficult task.”
We walk past the mobot course on our way to class every day, but what we don’t realize is how difficult it is to build a robot with the reasoning capabilities to navigate along the white path through the metal gates. This year’s Mobot Races showed us just how challenging a task it is.

You have probably used Wi-Fi at least once — on campus, at airports and coffee shops, or at home. Have you ever paused to think of how this super-convenient means of Internet connectivity actually works?
The Internet basically works through an exchange of data between devices, typically a client (the device that you are using) and a server, which processes your request for web pages and sends them to your device. Traditionally, these devices are connected through physical wiring. Modern Wi-Fi does away with the need for these wires by allowing the exchange of data wirelessly through radio waves.
Wi-Fi-enabled devices have an embedded chip called the wireless network adapter. This chip is responsible for generating radio waves corresponding to the requested web resource and transmitting them to the surrounding space. These waves are received by a router, which then forwards the request to the appropriate server through a wired connection. When the requested web page is received at the router, it transmits corresponding radio waves back to the device.
According to the website howstuffworks.com, the radio waves used in Wi-Fi transmissions are typically of high frequency — in the range of 2.4 to five gigahertz. The high frequency allows these waves to transmit much more data than ordinary radio waves, such as those used in cellphones, walkie-talkies, and televisions.
The routers that help establish Wi-Fi are the key components of wireless access points, popularly known as hotspots. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, these hotspots typically have a range of less than 100 meters (330 feet), but can be limited to a room or house by radio-wave-blocking walls. They can also be extended to cover large areas, such as college campuses, through multiple overlapping access points, which reinforce the network. Incidentally, Carnegie Mellon was the first college campus to set up a campus-wide Wi-Fi network. This network, dubbed “Wireless Andrew,” was set up in 1993, long before Wi-Fi gained its current popularity.
Nowadays, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other devices are manufactured with the embedded wireless network adapter chip. This enables the device to detect and connect to hotspots within range. Since this chip is universal, it allows the device to access a Wi-Fi hotspot anywhere in the world.
Setting up a Wi-Fi hotspot is easy. To set it up in a home or private space, all you need is a router that contains a wireless access point and either a digital subscriber line modem or a cable modem. These are widely available and can be easily installed at a convenient spot. Several compatible devices can simultaneously use a single router. In public spaces, cellular companies typically provide Wi-Fi, allowing their subscribers to access their respective hotspots.
Wi-Fi is very convenient, since hotspots are unobtrusive and relatively easy to set up compared to wired networks. However, wireless connection is not as secure as its wired counterpart: An intruder can tap into the Wi-Fi and intercept the communication to and from your device. Hence, it is typically advisable not to access sensitive data online while tapping the Wi-Fi in public places like airports or coffee shops.
Wi-Fi connections like the one at Carnegie Mellon and in most homes are password protected and locked to outsiders. Thus, they provide an additional layer of security, but only if a strong password is used. Carnegie Mellon provides the campus community with an even more secure Wi-Fi service called “CMU-SECURE,” which addresses various vulnerabilities typical in Wi-Fi networks. Thus, as frequently as possible, you should try to connect to “CMU-SECURE” while on campus.

Rats receive new engineered organ
Researchers stripped a rat’s kidney of its cells and repopulated it with new ones, showing that a bioengineered kidney can function in a similar manner to a normal one. Dr. Harald Ott of Harvard Medical School took the kidney of a rat cadaver and removed its cells by putting it in detergent. This process left behind only the extracellular matrix and collagen that acted as a scaffold for cells. Ott then repopulated the kidney with neonatal rat cells and human red blood cells. The bioengineered kidney was then reinserted into a live rat.

Mystery surrounds Chinese bird flu
With 82 cases of a new bird flu in China, public health officials are trying to determine how the virus is spread. The virus, H7N9, has been detected in poultry, pigeons, chickens, and ducks. The World Health Organization, however, stresses that some of people infected have not had contact with birds. There is also little evidence that the virus is spread between humans.
The outbreak in China has killed 17 people and hospitalized many more with severe respiratory problems. Most of the human cases have occurred near Shanghai, although two isolated incidents have been found in Beijing.

Mice and humans enjoy being carried
According to a report published in Current Biology, both human and mouse infants calm down simply by being held by their parents. The researchers believe that this calm may be advantageous for the survival of both the parent and infant; it is much easier for parents to escape a predator with a baby in a trance-like state.
The scientists attached a heart monitor to 12 human babies and observed them while their mothers sat them up, placed them in a crib, and carried them. The babies immediately relaxed when picked up by their mothers. Similarly, the mice infants relaxed and had a decreased heart rate when carried by their mothers.

Scientists question cause of drought 
Climate change was probably not the cause of the 2012 droughts in the U.S. midwest, according to a report released by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Some climate scientists have questioned this conclusion.
The NOAA scientists ran computer simulations in order to determine why forecasts failed to predict the droughts. Their simulations inferred that the droughts would have occurred regardless of global warming, and instead blame it on natural variability in the atmosphere. Some climate scientists disagree, saying that the climate models used were insufficient.

Throughout Carnival, as a self-designated, one-person committee, I went through every booth and selected the winners of several categories in what I call the “Boothy Awards.” This year’s booths, following the theme of “Fractured Fairytales,” again demonstrated the passion and dedication of Carnegie Mellon students. Without further ado, here is the first edition of the Boothies.
The Hipster Boothy for Best Design
Kappa Alpha Theta’s “Enchanted Garden” wins best design — a result of its grand and successful ambitions. While the enlarged flowers and dandelion puffs hanging on the evergreen exterior may have seemed over the top, they were consistent with the Thumbelina-inspired theme.
Inside, tour guides explained how the exaggerated sizes were the result of a spell that shrunk one’s body to the size of a thumb. If the outside showed that these women could think big, the interior displayed their ability to go small. A quaint lily pond was just one of many beautiful details in this enchanted forest. Papier-mâché trees and magical stalactites also made this booth feel larger than life.
The Pong Boothy for Best Game
This Boothy goes to KGB’s “Funkelstiltskin”. In this booth’s game, one dropped plastic golf balls into holes that activated different notes of the “Smoke on the Water” theme. The simple goal was to recreate the tune. But this was harder than it sounds. KGB wins this Boothy for a game that was moderately difficult and also displayed technological prowess.
The Andy Warhol Boothy for Best Art
The Asian Students Association (ASA) always manages to impress during Carnival, and this year was no exception.
If Pixar chooses to go old school and hand-draw the animations for the Finding Nemo sequel, it would be wise to draw inspiration from ASA. The incredibly detailed paintings of the Finding Nemo and Little Mermaid characters in the booth seemed to have been taken straight from the big screen, and the papier-mâché creations of seagulls proved that ASA is no one-trick pony.
The Andrew Mellon Boothy for Most Underrated Booth
Making a booth isn’t easy, especially for organizations that lack the financial resources and manpower of big fraternities and sororities. However, bigger is not necessarily better, as was made evident by SPIRIT’s “Pinocchio Story.”
This booth consisted of one room whose main feature was a comic strip that stretched across three walls. But it was a special comic — one that combined the stories of Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, and Toy Story. It was a delightful story that I didn’t have to wait on a line for.
KGB also deserves some recognition here. Half record store and half neon nightclub, its one-story booth combined the tale of Rumpelstiltskin with funk music. Though not all of the references were clear, KGB’s booth was very solid in terms of artwork and design.
The Judah Friedlander Boothy for Funniest Booth
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpy Dumpty had a great fall and was rushed to the ICU.
Alpha Epsilon Pi’s “Humpty Dumpty Hospital” tells the part of the tale not included in the nursery rhyme. Although nobody could put Humpty together again, the men of Alpha Epsilon Pi reminded us that Humpty first had to be saved in a game of Operation.
The Andrew Carnegie Boothy for Best Overall Booth
From the Midway entrance next to The Underground, Theta’s “Enchanted Garden” booth immediately set the standard for the rest of the booths. As tall as it was, the detail of the exterior was even more impressive. However, the best booth, in my opinion, was 20 yards away, where a cluster of colorful balloons floated above Sigma Phi Epsilon’s booth based on Pixar’s Up.
After visitors were greeted by a papIer-mâché caricature of the grumpy main character Carl, the inside of “SigUp” was truly delightful. On the first floor, the wooden floor tiling and simple wallpaper brought the details of the Pixar movie to life.
Although this senior citizen’s home seemed very harmless, his journey was anything but. The interactive game inside the booth, in which the user steers through tumultuous clouds, serves as a reminder of the difficult journey his house went through.
The journey of the booth continues to the second floor, but not before a reconception of the movie’s waterfall scene next to the stairs. The top floor recreates the jungle setting of the film with real plants and dense foliage. This floor even features Kevin, the flamingo-like creature from the movie.
Though Kappa Alpha Theta’s was a close second, Sigma Phi Epsilon wins for its fine details and faithful representation of the beloved Pixar movie.
Conclusion
With that, we bring an end to this year’s Boothies. While it was a great year, not all booths made the cut — although this is not a reflection of their quality.
For people not involved in building booths, it is very easy to walk through a booth and see nothing special. But the fact is that these booths are made by full-time Carnegie Mellon students — students who want nothing more than to display their love for Spring Carnival.

A line of people wound all the way to the parking garage last Friday evening at 7 p.m. for an 8 p.m. concert in Wiegand Gymnasium. If it were any other artist, the anticipation would probably not be nearly as intense, with people literally fighting to get into the gymnasium. The chanting from the crowd ensured that the entire Carnegie Mellon campus was aware that Lupe Fiasco was in Pittsburgh to perform at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival.
The concert was a success in terms of the anticipation before, excitement during, and craze after the event. In terms of organization, however, the event was a bit chaotic. According to AB Concerts co-chair Rebecca Paren, 2,000 tickets were released, but only 1,500 people were allowed in, which meant that some people with reserved tickets were denied admission to the concert. This was especially troubling because there seemed to be extra space in the back of the gym that could have allowed more people with tickets to attend the concert.
Perhaps everything would have run more smoothly had the show been held outdoors as originally planned. The weather ended up staying dry on Friday evening, though AB Concerts had decided to move the concert inside earlier in the week.
Though the concert began at 8 p.m., two DJs opened for Lupe and the audience grew very anxious for the headliner’s appearance. Every five minutes, there would be a literal “Kick Push” as people shoved toward the stage. Many students were also trying to cut the line in order to get to the front, causing even more of a frenzy. The beginning of the concert can only be characterized as out of control.
Surprisingly, Lupe Fiasco’s appearance calmed the crowd rather than sending them into a frenzy. Once his first song began, the audience’s hands went into the air, and Lupe sang and rapped for 10 minutes without a break. The singer’s passion was evident through his every move and his lyrics. Lupe might be a man of relatively few words, but he sang so closely to students, making eye contact and almost touching the audience, that he was definitely fully engaged with his fans. He even splashed water at the audience, further exciting the crowd.
Without any intermission or even a breather, the concert continued until around 10 p.m. Unlike the beginning, when everyone was fighting to be at the front, the second half saw people at the front begin trying to move back to get a breather, allowing audience members at the back of the gym to move up. Although it was unintentional, everyone had a fair chance to be near the performer they had been waiting to see, and “Daydreamin’ ” of, after all.
Finally, an encore of “The Show Goes On” — Lupe’s most popular and best-known song — served as the conclusion to the exciting evening. Everyone slowly left the University Center, singing the songs from the show. Logistical issues aside, the concert was an enjoyable event by a passionate artist, and will serve as one of the highlights of Carnival 2013.

The weather was warm, everyone was happy, and laughs were flowing freely last Thursday during “Comedy Central on Campus,” a show presented by AB Comedy.
The cast of the show was the true definition of triple threat: Judah Friedlander, Nick Vatterott, and Jermaine Fowler. They performed for a crowd under the standing-room-only white tent on Midway.
Fowler is a familiar face to those who frequent the comedy website CollegeHumor. Fowler opened the show with a short, 20-minute bit. His routine was not as impressive or as polished as those of the other two; it seemed to be just vaguely strung together.
While that strategy worked later for Friedlander, who went from one one-liner to the next during the first part of his performance, Fowler couldn’t pull it off. Admittedly, he’s younger and less experienced, but it seemed as if he were trying a style of performance that he wasn’t used to. He left the stage after a five-minute blast of jokes that was energetic but random and handed the show over to Vatterott.
Vatterott’s work up to this point has primarily included writing gigs and making guest appearances on Conan, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and the Comedy Central show Mash Up. Vatterott’s routine was perhaps the most entertaining; it was well timed, quick witted, and right on par with the crowd’s appetite for comedy.
Fowler then returned to the stage to introduce Friedlander. The headliner of the show, Friedlander is perhaps the best known of the three due to his role on the popular NBC comedy show 30 Rock, which just ended in January. His character on the show, Frank Rossitano, is very similar to the one that he portrays during his stand-up comedy routines: a sloppy, hat-obsessed deadpan humorist who exaggerates stories about himself.
Friedlander’s routine centered on the premise that as “World Champion,” he was going to run for President of the United States. He walked the audience through a hilarious rundown of his platform, and then invited the audience to ask questions.
Friedlander’s quick and witty responses to the questions demonstrated his amazing ability to think on his feet and work with the crowd. Even as the audience threw curveballs such as questions about Tina Fey, Iraq, and — perhaps most eloquent moment of the evening — his genitals, Friedlander stayed one step ahead and kept the audience laughing at the outlandishness of his larger-than-life character. His quirky, weird sense of humor was so absurd that there was nothing to do but enjoy the ride.
The comedian took the majority of the time to discuss his simplified plans for taking over the world, which involved moving the Midwest to north of Canada, using karate skills to intimidate America’s enemies, and legalizing heroin to make legalizing marijuana easier. He advertised his nonexistent karate instruction book, which, according to his performance, solves just about any problem and makes anyone physically stronger.
Friedlander not only invited questions and responded to them, but also picked people out of the audience and adapted the routine to the personalities of his listeners. He invited photographers up on stage, questioned boys about the girls that they were sitting next to, and made fun of the majors that people called out.
All three of the performers personalized the show for Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon, citing the campus food, hipster environments, and robotics department. The audience was receptive and excited, which seemed to make the show all the more fun.
When it comes down to it, you know a show is funny when a comedian is laughing at it, and that’s exactly what happened. As Vatterott and Friedlander performed, Fowler stood on the side with a bottle of water and enjoyed the show with everyone else. His signature cackle at his fellow comedians’ best jokes was possibly the highlight of the show. The show was as great as the weather that night and was a great start to Carnival 2013.

Derbies do not usually include nude people, unicorns, and King Kong. But that is because most derbies are not presented by the School of Art.
The fourth annual Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby was held on Thursday on the treacherous incline between Doherty Hall and the University Center. The derby is advertised as an alternative to the buggy races, as well as “the slowest race this side of the Mississippi.”
This description is somewhat misleading: The derby is not a race as much as it is a fashion show and parade slapped together in less than a week for the fun of it. In fact, many of the “buggies” did not end up working as expected, and some outright broke down.
Still, there were a number of funny and original carts that travelled down the Doherty incline, including Napoleon with a cannon that fired smoke, a pair of Swedish chefs, Aladdin and Jasmine rolling in a carpet, Wall Street investors on skateboards throwing money around, Miracle Whip fighting mayonnaise, a boy scout and his model airplane, a royal lion, and one person in a worm costume trying to slowly crawl down the incline.
Some of the carts were particularly impressive — in particular, one of a man in a King Kong costume raging on top of the Empire State Building, which had another man in a pilot costume riding a moving airplane at the front. 
There were also a number of carts that were sea themed, including people dressed up as mermaids spitting water, a fish tank, a shark/penguin man, and Venus in a seashell in a representation of Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus. Plenty of food-themed carts, such as Oreo-cookies-and-milk and pop-tart themes, also made appearances. In one cart, four women sprayed a man with mustard and ketchup, and the words “make me a sandwich” were written on the cart.
There were also carts that seemed completely random, featuring eccentric details such as unicorns, a dancing lampshade, the tooth fairy, peanut allergies, and a baby stroller with streamers.
One cannot mention the Downhill Derby without mentioning the nudity. There were a number of carts that were downright provocative with nudity or explicit themes, including a human hamster wheel powered by clothing-phobic men, a gondola featuring the Pope caught with her pants down, and a man dressed as male genitalia in a hand. This might have led to some awkward moments for students who went to the derby with their families.
Although the derby may have been uncomfortable for some people, the main flaw of the show was not its subject matter but its pacing. While it was expected that some of the carts would break down, it was nonetheless irritating to stand around for five minutes or so waiting for a cart to work again. Some carts went by relatively quickly, but others took a great deal of time coming down the hill, mainly due to technical issues. There could have been some interesting commentary or something else to look at while the carts were being fixed.
Overall, the derby was entertaining, but not without flaws in its execution. It was a fun, wild start to Carnival that will definitely keep the campus talking for a few days.

Do you sometimes feel low? Unsatisfied? Lost? Like you’re just another nobody, stranded, alone in the universe? Then just pick up a gun and shoot the President! That’s the advice given by both failed and successful presidential killers that make up the cast of characters in Scotch’n’Soda’s 75th anniversary production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s Assassins, which was presented throughout last week’s Spring Carnival in Rangos Hall.
The musical follows a rogue’s gallery of American assassins, including John Wilkes Booth (who killed Abraham Lincoln), Leon Czolgosz (William McKinley’s killer), and Charles Guiteau (who killed James Garfield), as they debate, hatch, and execute their plans to kill the President of the United States — sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much.
Assassins is comprised of numerous and somewhat independent stories, each involving one of the assassins trying to solve his or her problems by killing the most important man in America. These characters hang around a carnival-style shooting game run by the encouraging Proprietor, played by sophomore vocal performance major Kevin O’Hora. Each story is accompanied by a song sung directly to the audience by the Balladeer, played by junior mathematics major William Veer. The songs provided the reasons for each assassin’s crime and challenged them at the same time.
The stories range in energy and tone from incredibly funny and active to more somber and downbeat. Watching junior communication design major Larissa Jantonio’s Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme and sophomore vocal performance major Joanna Latini’s Sara Jane Moore bumble through their attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford kept the audience in stitches.
Jantonio perfectly captured the kind of manic intensity one would expect from a member of the infamous murderers of the Manson family. Her frequent explosions of love and admiration for her crazed leader Charles Manson were so over the top, yet sincere, you didn’t know whether to laugh or shift uncomfortably in your seat.
Latini perfectly complemented Jantonio’s focused energy with her portrayal of an average housewife who just can’t get the whole assassination thing down; one scene involving her inability to shoot her gun was particularly memorable. Her performance was fully committed and hilarious, allowing every one of their scenes to play extraordinarily well.
On the flip side, junior vocal performance major James Alexander’s Leon Czolgosz is haunted by the gruesome sights he witnesses at his job in a turn-of-the-century factory. Czolgosz debates whether or not he is capable of killing President McKinley so that he can put an end to the injustice perpetrated against the common worker. Many of Czolgosz’s scenes involved a darkened stage with him in the spotlight, which highlighted the alienation he feels as just another cog in the machine.
While Assassins is a good musical, its lack of focus makes its message feel a little bit muddled. The script attempts to make grand statements about the death of the American dream and identifies the idea as the driving force behind each character’s actions, but it instead comes across as a discontinuous jumble of ideas.
Assassins is at its most engaging, however, when it delves into the more personal reasons for the assassinations. Sophomore vocal performance major Taylor Rawley’s John Hinckley is deeply in love with Jodie Foster and feels that by making a grand statement — attempting to kill President Ronald Reagan — he will win her love. While this dream is obviously crazy, Rawley’s performance almost made you want it to come true, and Hinckley’s failure was near heartbreaking.
This desire to matter to someone — anyone — was shared by many of the other assassins, notably Fromme. Fromme sings a song with Hinckley in which they express feeling unworthy of another’s love (in her case, the love of Charles Manson). When you get to the heart of each character’s story, they’re all pretty much about a desire to be important, and the moments that demonstrate that wish are where Assassins really hits home.
Even though it has been in production and planning for months, given the recent events in Boston, Assassins felt incredibly relevant. The musical makes note that, at the end of the day, the killing of each of these Presidents did nothing to fix the ills the assassins saw in America. While it is a bit cliché to say that violence is never the answer, the sentiment is nonetheless true.
Whether it be the murder of innocent civilians or a dramatic assassination of a global leader, killing any member of a society can’t fix that society’s faults. The images on every television screen of the chaos and violence in Boston must have been in the back of many audience members’ minds while watching Assassins; they definitely were in mine. This timeliness made the musical much more powerful than it would have if it had been performed just a week earlier.

McConomy Auditorium saw an influx of film lovers, friends of filmmakers, and casual observers on Saturday night as part of the SHOT FOR SHOT Student Film Festival. Like the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, which ended two weekends ago, this film festival is yet another effort to draw the campus’ attention to the world of filmmaking.
But this year, the festival organizers decided to try something different. This year was the first time that the Carnegie Mellon Film Club opened the festival to submissions from across Pittsburgh. Films came from six schools in total, and the screened films included work by students at Carnegie Mellon, Point Park University, and the University of Pittsburgh — often in collaboration with students at other schools.
The result was a rich and impressive display of Pittsburgh student filmmaking talent — a sparkling achievement of a film festival. As Carnegie Mellon Film Club co-president and senior directing major Stephen Tonti said in his introduction to the festival, “We really are promoting intercollegiate filmmaking.” And according to Tonti, the quality of the submissions “goes to show how much artistic creativity is actually in this city.”
The films were fantastic and surprisingly high in quality, considering that they were put together by students. Most of the films were 10–13 minutes in length, although there were a few two- or three-minute films that were almost too short to process.
The festival opened with a fabulously amusing piece called The Big Fold by Bailey Donovan of Point Park University, which follows a young boy whose mother charges him with breaking his father’s poker trophy. We watched as the boy assumed the identity of his favorite crime-movie detective on a quest to prove his own innocence. The film simultaneously pokes fun at the drama and serious dialogue of old black-and-white movies and at the childish fantasies we all have about our favorite heroes.
Other highlights included Hotel Romance by Corey Sweazen of Point Park University, which uses a clean aesthetic and surreal special effects to tell the story of a bizarre relationship between a man and a woman, the entirety of which takes place in a hotel. In a very different approach, Dominic Rodriguez’s nonfiction Fursonas explores the unusual lifestyle of “fursuiters” — people who dress up in fur suits — through documentary-style interviews. And in typical coming-of-age fashion, The Perils of Growing Up Flat-Chested by Carnegie Mellon alumna Yulin Kuang (DC ’12) follows a girl with body image issues who is determined to impress her science-project partner and crush.
Another audience favorite was Fade by Josh Lopata of Point Park University, an intricate and beautiful animation film that explored the struggle of a young boy to cope with his father’s death. The rich animation — accomplished through puppetry and miniature set construction — took between one-and-a-half and two years of work, and the result proved to be spectacular. The film represents death metaphorically as a threatening, black, shapeless monster that the boy literally grapples with throughout the movie. The final scene — in which the monster finally takes the boy’s dad — sent a hushed sadness over the crowd that only lifted when the audience clapped wildly during the ending credits.
When the judges took the stage after the screening, each emphasized how genuinely difficult the decision was to pick only two winners among the films. It was easy to see why: The films were vastly diverse in their subject matter, aesthetic, and general approaches, and many of them were equally excellent in very different ways. Ultimately, The Big Fold won the Grand Jury Prize, while The Perils of Growing Up Flat-Chested won the Special Jury Prize. Meanwhile, Fade took the Audience Award, which was determined by audience members who passed up paper ballots marking their favorite film of the evening.
The festival benefited greatly from welcoming submissions from schools all across Pittsburgh, and the result was a truly inspiring display of the excellence of Pittsburgh intercollegiate filmmaking. As Carnegie Mellon Film Club co-president and senior business administration major Nicolas Hurt said in his introduction to the festival, “This year, we wanted to do something much bigger.” They certainly pulled it off.

Among Spring Carnival’s attractions this year was a chance to catch an early glimpse at Sweet Jesus!, a new musical with music and lyrics by senior music composition major Eric Dietz, in the form of a concert reading. The script was written by Carnegie Mellon alumna Shannon Deep (BHA ’10, HNZ ’11) and Dietz’s score was orchestrated by Matt Aument (CFA ’10).
Naming a musical Sweet Jesus! might raise a few eyebrows, but the title is quickly put in context. The play is about a Broadway musical of the same name — following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ Superstar or Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat — that an eccentric writer is trying to get investors interested in by way of a staged reading.
A staged reading has the actors read their lines aloud, with their scripts in front of them and without the choreography they would perform in an actual production. The stage directions are narrated, usually by the director or writer of the work. Because one of these readings forms the backdrop for most of the story’s action, the performance was essentially a staged reading about a staged reading — but with full musical accompaniment. This was either fitting for the nature of a the show or somewhat confusing, depending on whom you ask.
At one point, the actual reader of the stage directions described how the fictional reader of stage directions read the stage directions. Fortunately, junior vocal performance major Nigel Rowe imbued the writer Steffen St. Ray with clear rapture for the sound of his own voice as he described lavishly overwrought scenery and sacrilegious interpretations of events; he describes Roman soliders coming to take Jesus away wearing ’60s business suits and riding Vespas.
In fact, the entire cast gave performances that did not disappoint. Even members of the ensemble managed to display more than a little character, at least to the eyes of this untrained reviewer. When duplicitous lover Tyler (played by junior acting major Michael Campayno), who plays Jesus in the fictitious show, pulls out a ray gun and zaps the rest of the company, one of the ensemble members (played by sophomore vocal performance major Ethan Crystal) threw down his binder and stormed off stage, seemingly going off script on two levels.
However, the main plot, which has little to do with the premise of a terrible Jesus musical, is not quite as compelling the actor’s performances. The plot winds up as a bit of a flimsy excuse for a set of songs that are great for the most part. It’s pretty clear that the musical serves as a sort of love letter to the world of young people struggling to make it on Broadway; the last number, “New York,” couldn’t have made this any clearer if it required the whole cast to don “I Heart NY” shirts. There’s a clear longing for the trials and tribulations experienced by the protagonist John (portrayed by senior musical theatre major Trevor McQueen).
Despite making several references to Disney — and avoiding the endings associated with that name — this love letter can feel a bit like a form letter. The main plot lacks surprises and the characters all develop along expected lines. A lucky (literal) break gives the young country boy a shot at success; his lover turns out to be a cheating jerk; the roommate and his friend from home have the country boy’s back; and he manages to reconcile with his mother, who is unable to accept his homosexuality.
Honestly, the most surprising thing is the how little attention the women get. Gillian Hassert (CFA ’12) sings to McQueen while portraying his mother, but the song is still male-centric: It’s about her devotion to her son. The only other exclusively female song is “When You’re a Hag,” which bemoans the inability of John’s high school friend Annie (played by junior voice major Chloe Holgate) to find a straight man interested in dating her. Beyond the social issues involved in these choices, there’s the structural problem of the female characters having nothing interesting to do but offer moral support for the protagonist despite having a diverse set of personalities.
As a final note, the music was well executed and fun.

Dear Patrick,
Oh God, oh God, I’m so hung over. The light is blinding, and all the noise hurts. I feel like someone is trying unscrew my skull. What have I done to deserve this? WHAT HAS GOD WROUGHT!?!? How can I lessen this pain?
Thanks,
Ow! Hangover, Gosh, Ow, Drinks Torture, Hangover Everlasting, Please Answer, Imbibing Nonetheless
Dear OH GOD THE PAIN,
This is the problem with only going out during Carnival. You don’t build up your tolerance enough all year for last week’s extravaganza. Those of us who go out multiple times a week are used to that feeling. I don’t even notice the pain anymore; it’s just the usual morning feeling. But for those of you who don’t want to feel awful all day, here are some recovery techniques.
First of all, you need to go back in time. When you’re still drunk, drink a lot of water. Then, go to bed for the next 18 hours. If you’ve woken up the next day and still feel awful, your first goal should be to drink some water. Really, water and pain medication are your only options. My father always recommended the three S’s: showering, shaving, and going to the bathroom. If that doesn’t do it for you then I don’t know what will.
Or just have another drink,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m throwing a party this weekend, my friend’s dad is in town, and I hear he’s really cool. Should I invite him? I feel like it could only make things better. What could go wrong with inviting a 50-year-old guy to my party?
Thanks,
Forget This, I Gotta Go To My Last Carnival Party
Dear FTIGGTMLCP,
That’s a great idea! Partying with the previous generation is always a good time. If they want to go out to bars, they have jobs and are always willing to pick up the tab. If it’s a house party, then he’s willing to go to a house party. I’m barely willing to go to house parties! If you can take a shot of bottom-shelf vodka with the man, then he’s the kind of man I want to be when I grow up.
The one problem with inviting him is if he has too much game. Obviously, when he shows up he’s gonna get a lot of attention, ’cause he’s got 30 years on the other guests. After that, he can just play up the charm. He has 30 years’ worth more stories than you, and 30 years’ worth more experience with women. You can’t compete with him. A full head of hair will only get you so far.
Plus, there are a lot of college-age gold diggers,
Patrick Hoskins

Django
7 9
AB Films begins its sojourn into the legacy of Spaghetti Westerns with Django, Sergio Corbucci’s iconic tale. It’s unfortunate that we will only think of this as the predecessor to Quentin Tarantino’s newest joint, because there is a lot to love here and it really should be required viewing for fans of Tarantino’s rehash. This is a film that spawned more sequels than pretty much anything else and refuses to be tamed. If you want to know why Tarantino seems as clever as he does, don’t miss this.
Django Unchained
7 10 1
The newest joint from our favorite wise guy auteur. Quentin Tarantino mashes his two greatest obsessions together — Westerns and exploitation flicks — to create this very complicated Frankenstein of a film. Django is codified as an exploitation flick, but functions as a type of revenge, a theme we have seen Tarantino explore before. Every corpse is filled with two or three times the normal amount of blood, and style is the substance. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz, perhaps the greatest speakers of Tarantenese to ever walk this Earth, perform valiantly in a picture that ultimately fails to become the kind of arresting moral behemoth that Inglourious Basterds was in 2010.
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
7
The ultimate Spaghetti Western and Tarantino’s vote for greatest film of all time. Sergio Leone masterfully pits three men against each other in an epic of radical proportions. There was nothing that could have prepared the world for this eruption in 1966. It’s the role that defined Clint Eastwood. It’s the music that defined a genre. It’s the style that influenced a generation. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is not for the faint of heart, but it rewards any who dare to master it — a totally unique and visionary spin on the Western genre that has yet to be outdone.

50 years ago:  May 8, 1963
The 1963 Carnival theme Phenomenal Phliques included a first-place booth by Beta Theta Pi based on Peter Pan, a faculty egg toss, sorority relays, and plank jousting behind the Morewood parking lot. Captain “Beta” Hook walked the plank into a tub of water when game players threw plastic knives through port holes on the side of the ship, which was surrounded by moving water. The Chemistry A team won the egg toss with a 150-foot toss across the Cut. Kappa Alpha Theta won both the sorority relays and the sorority skit competition. The relays included sorority women participating in a broom-riding relay, role race, and sack relay.

The first snowy Carnival in recent memory resulted in issues with switching from temporary power to permanent power on Wednesday night, buggy race delays, and shivering audience members in the comedian’s tent. Edward Jackman, the headlining comedian, put on a stand-up comedy performance with juggling tricks. Jackman also shared with the audience that he will be hosting a new NBC series featuring normal people who can do funny things. After the comedy show, Jackman and his camera crew went around Midway looking for funny people to interview for the first episode of the show.

The Saturday morning Buggy races were plagued with unexpected mechanical mishaps and human error. The Pi Kappa Alpha women’s team was granted a reroll after their buggy was forced to swerve to avoid colliding with the lead truck in the race. The Beta Theta Pi women were disqualified after rolling the fastest time of the day because their buggy failed the drop test for brakes. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon men hit a pothole and lost a wheel during their roll. Several fans, many of whom were underage, were issued citations for possession of alcohol in the area adjacent to the buggy track.

As the Democratic primary for the 2008 presidential election approached, Chelsea Clinton made an appearance on Midway to support her mother Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.). Clinton’s visit to Carnegie Mellon is the first stop on a tour of college campuses across the nation in which she moderates a Q & A session with college students. Aside from the political buzz, Booth is plagued with numerous injuries because of strong winds on Midway. One sister of Delta Gamma had to get four staples in her head after a wall fell on her while members were finishing up assembly of their booth on Saturday night.

The College of Fine Arts hosts its third annual Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby, which began as a class project in 2010 and has since grown in participation from CFA students. The derby pokes fun at Carnival’s stress on buggy, and features often scantily-clad students dressed as moving art. The weekend also included a performance by Passion Pit and Scotch’n’Soda’s rendition of The Drowsy Chaperone. Both shows excited audiences, especially when Passion Pit’s performers expressed fond feelings for Carnegie Mellon’s campus and students. The entire audience is even invited to the next Passion Pit concert in Pittsburgh.

Project Olympus’s show-and-tell event gave alumni and other Carnegie Mellon affiliates a chance to show off their latest innovations. 
The event, which took place last Thursday in the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium, attracted a large audience of students and alumni alike.
The event opened with a talk from Lenore Blum, founding director of Project Olympus and professor of computer science.
Project Olympus provides help to Carnegie Mellon students and faculty who are trying to commercialize new ideas. According to its website, Project Olympus is “bridging the gap between cutting-edge university research/innovation and economy-promoting commercialization for the benefit of our communities.”
Blum talked about the role of students in many now-prominent startups and the aggressive recruitment of students by already-existing startup companies. 
“Our students are in great demand, and are getting fantastic jobs at the coolest startups on the planet. In fact, we were fueling — and we still are fueling — the high-tech economy across the planet,” Blum said.
The first demonstration of the show-and-tell came from Jay Whitacre, a professor of materials science and engineering and engineering and public policy, who gave a presentation about new ideas for energy storage using innovative materials.
“The more we look to integrate renewable [energy sources] with the grid, the more we have to handle the intermittencies of those renewables,” Whitacre said. “You can imagine putting a very large battery with this kind of source. If you can do that, you can transform something that’s unreliable to something with a base load of a power.”
The next presentation, from professor of computer science Zico Kolter, also focused on energy research. 
As stated in the event’s program, Kolter described “computational approaches of sustainable energy demands: how machine learning can help.” 
Kolter’s talk centered on ideas that would improve the power meters that homes already have by making them “smart meters,” which intelligently monitor energy usage to promote conservation. 
The next portion of the event was “a focus on startups and app developers” featuring several Carnegie Mellon students and alumni, including Matt Stewart (ETC ’12), junior business management major Steve Musche, junior mechanical engineering major Arden Rosenblatt, and Ph.D. candidate in machine learning Prashant Reddy.
Stewart described his startup, Digital Dream Labs, which creates apps for the iPad to foster children’s learning. 
Musche talked about Know Your Style, a startup designed to make shopping easier for men by simplifying clothing options, while Rosenblatt talked about The PieceMaker — a 3-D flash image slider — and the potential of 3-D printing technology. 
Reddy talked about Lumator, a startup designed to help consumers make smarter energy choices using machine learning.
The show-and-tell then featured students from TartanHacks, introduced by the founder and the director of ScottyLabs, senior computer science major Amy Quispe and junior human-computer interaction major Julia Teitelbaum, respectively. 
Teitelbaum described TartanHacks as a hacking competition that differs from other, similar offerings. 
“We wanted TartanHacks to be a different kind of hackathon, in a couple of different ways. We wanted it to address a more diverse crowd of students, and to place more value on innovative ideas and participants’ learning, and not just a technical challenge,” Teitelbaum said.
The “TartanHacks Stars,” as the event’s program calls them, were sophomore information systems major Kevin Schaefer, sophomore computer science major Hayden Demerson, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Shane Smith, junior computer science majors Avesh Singh and Daniel Deutsch, and senior human-computer interaction majors Kristina Lustig and Michael Helmbrecht. The last portion of the event was a short lecture from Shanna Tellerman (CFA ’03, ETC ’05), titled “The Entrepreneurial Mindset.”
The Project Olympus show-and-tell concluded with a reception in the University Center’s Connan Room, where attendees could meet the entrepreneurs who had presented while sampling the new technologies hands-on.

Carnegie Mellon hosted a gala in memoriam of the late Jeffrey Zaslow and unveiled  a plaque in his honor last Friday.
Zaslow (H&SS ’80) was an accomplished journalist for The Wall Street Journal and a best-selling author. He passed away in February 2012, at the age of 53, due to injuries suffered in a car accident.
He is survived by his wife, Sherry Margolis, and three daughters, Jordan, Amber, and Eden, all of whom were in attendance at the memorial in the lobby of the Purnell Center.
Zaslow is probably best known as the co-author of The Last Lecture (2008), about the late Carnegie Mellon professor of computer science Randy Pausch. 
Co-written with Pausch shortly after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given only a few months to live, the inspirational book is given to all incoming first-year classes to read prior to convocation.
In his opening remarks at the gala, President Jared Cohon remarked how the university often asked Zaslow to speak at convocation and how Zaslow’s speeches could bring the first-years to tears. 
“It is hard to believe that future classes won’t be able to hear him speak,” Cohon said.
The main speakers at the memorial included several people who had known Zaslow personally during his undergraduate years at Carnegie Mellon. 
“[Zaslow] was by far my best student,” remarked professor of creative writing and English Gerald Costanzo, a former professor of Zaslow. “His work was legendary, at least in the eyes of his professor … and also in the eyes of his peers.”
“Many people don’t know this story, but Jeff almost didn’t graduate from here [Carnegie Mellon]. Midway through junior year, he actually transferred to Columbia,” said Fred Siegel, Zaslow’s roommate at Carnegie Mellon. 
According to Siegel, however, Zaslow quickly realized “he had made a terrible mistake” and re-enrolled at Carnegie Mellon a mere two weeks later.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Anne Witchner emphasized how Zaslow’s gift for writing in part stemmed from his genuine interest in other people. 
“The university frequently brought Jeff back to speak to the English staff and students…. [When talking to students after his speeches] he wouldn’t leave until he had talked to everyone waiting to talk to him,” Witchner said. 
She explained that she could tell that those students were sharing conversations that they hadn’t shared with anyone else. 
After the speakers, Cohon closed the event by introducing the new plaque commemorating Zaslow and announcing the Endowed Jeffrey L. Zaslow Scholarship for Writing Students. 
Cohon emphasized how Zaslow’s plaque stands facing the plaque commemorating Pausch at the Purnell-side entrance of the Pausch Bridge, emphasizing the relationship between the two men.
While Cohon stressed how unfortunate it is that incoming classes will now never get a chance to meet Zaslow, he suggested that “future generations of students to come will turn to read this plaque when crossing the Pausch Bridge … and know what an incredible man Zaslow was.”

Since spring break, Tazza D’Oro has begun offering table-sharing placards, backed by a Student Senate initiative.
The placards, available at the counter in the center of Tazza D’Oro, indicate that a person is willing to share his or her table with a stranger. The initiative is based on similar table-sharing initiatives in some local cafés.
The Student Senate Business Affairs Committee, headed by second-year architecture student and CFA Senator Travis Rozich, chose Tazza D’Oro as a pilot location for the table-sharing program because of its popularity and manageable size. 
“It’s a little smaller-scale,” said senior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner, who oversaw the program two years ago directly as Student Senate chair, and more remotely as student body president last year. “It’s a little bit easier to control, in terms of traffic, to pilot it.” 
If table sharing goes well at Tazza D’Oro, Senate hopes to expand the program to the second floor of the University Center, where there have been space concerns.
So far, Rozich thinks the initiative is going well. “Every time I’ve been there I’ve seen people utilizing the program,” he said. Rozich said there was positive feedback to the original announcement of the program. “When we posted about table-sharing on the [Student Senate] Facebook with links to the article that we wrote on the Senate website, we had a lot of views — more views than we’ve had on our website,” he said. “We’ve had mostly positive support.” 
According to Rozich, Student Senate will soon be passing out surveys at Tazza D’Oro to get feedback from students on the program.
If there is one obstacle to the table-sharing initiative, it may be lack of awareness.
Senior international relations and politics major Julie Kim, who comes to Tazza D’Oro two to three times a week, said that she would definitely share a table with someone who had put up a placard, and would probably pick up a placard herself — if she were aware of the program. 
“I feel like I would,” Kim said. “I guess I didn’t know about it.” Not everyone is as comfortable with the idea as Kim. Biomedical engineering Ph.D. student Natasha Loghmanpour, who was also unaware of the table-sharing initiative, said that she would probably share a table with somebody who had picked up a placard. But as for picking one up herself? “Probably not,” Loghmanpour said. “It’s not my first choice, to be honest.” 
But Weiner thinks that if these initial hurdles can be overcome, the program shows promise. “If it can get established and people accept that as the norm, it’ll be a good program,” Weiner said. “It will help space be utilized better.”

Carnegie Mellon and Evive Station recently entered into a contract together to find an efficient and cost-effective way of moving away from using disposable plastic water bottles on campus.
Founded in 2011 by Pittsburgh native and West Virginia University (WVU) graduate Thomas Petrini, Evive Station offers users the ability to sanitize and refill their reusable Evive bottles with purified water, through the use of a device roughly the size of a vending machine. 
According to the company’s website, “Evive Stations are placed in high-traffic areas on college or corporate campuses for free.”
Filling a bottle with water takes 30 seconds; sanitizing and filling a bottle takes 60 seconds. Upon hearing about the startup, School of Computer Science Director of Buildilng Facilities Jim Skees says that the university was interested. 
“It’s something we had really thought about. Plastic bottles of Dasani water and bottles out of vending machines are expensive and generate a lot of waste. And many bottles end up in landfills. So when Evive came up to us, it was almost too good to be true.”
The water from Evive is different from normal water fountains, Skees points out. 
“These are machines which filter water and can also wash bottles, sanitize with chlorine, and fill water bottles. And the only cost for a user would be the bottle, which is $10. And we only have to pay the cost for electrical utilities, with the machines being monitored and restocked when needed by the company. In fact, their income comes not so much from bottle sales but from advertisement spots on the machine.”
So far, there has been limited exposure to the Evive machines on campus, with only one machine currently installed.
“It launched several weeks ago on Gates six,” Skees said. “We really only want to have it as SCS space right now, but hopefully Evive will have other spots, including possibly in Tepper.”
“They are rapidly expanding though,” he said. “There are Evive machines in WVU, Slippery Rock, and plans with American Eagle Outfitters and UPMC. They’ve been pleasant to work with, and there doesn’t appear to be a catch or anything in small print.” 
Students seem to be accepting of having Evive machines around campus. 
“It’s better for the environment,” first-year architecture major Carter Nelson said. 
“[It’s also] better to promote ... over ... plastic water bottles [that] would harm the environment.”
“As long as it wouldn’t affect our tuition, yeah, I’m all for it,” said first-year mechanical engineering major Luke Tsai.
People who are interested in having specially compatible Evive bottles can register on their website, evivestation.com, and can create a profile where they can view how many plastic bottles they have saved.

Almost everything about the way we do taxes in this country is wrong. Taking for granted that it’s beneficial for our society to force people to pay money for collective services, the way we pay for those services can, and should, be done much better than it is now. 
I don’t claim to have any answers to this issue, but I aim to point out a few problems in our current system and to encourage others to think outside of the box about ways that we — as a society — can make taxation more efficient.
First off, you shouldn’t need to hire someone to do your taxes. You shouldn’t need a college — or even high school — degree to do your taxes. Taxes should be simple and transparent. There shouldn’t be things like the alternative minimum tax that force more and more people into paying a higher rate as time progresses. There shouldn’t be special-interest loopholes. 
You shouldn’t need to fill out a ton of forms, and there shouldn’t be a massive bureaucracy created to process and read these forms to make sure they’re done correctly. Everyone should be able to understand exactly what they’re paying in taxes and why they’re paying that rate.
Additionally, the government currently collects money in numerous ways, including the corporate tax, income tax, and excise taxes, among others. The government should have only one or two ways to collect revenue in order to be simple and transparent so that everyone knows exactly why and how their money is taken from them.
On that note, taxing a person’s income and effectively taxing production is not beneficial for society, and is therefore not the way in which the government should collect taxes. Every economist will tell you that  when you tax something or make it more expensive, there is less of it produced. We should never discourage production in any way; production is the most important thing that our economy does. The sign of a healthy economy is a growing gross domestic product (GDP) with lots of money in motion. Taxing production stops that from happening.
I’m obviously not the first person who has thought about this, and many people have proposed alternatives. 
My favorite is the FairTax. This system taxes consumption instead of production, collects revenue one way, and is ridiculously simple.
The FairTax eliminates all current taxes and instead levies a 23 percent sales tax, according to fairtax.org. Then, at the beginning of each month, every American household gets a check in the mail for the amount of taxes they would pay up to the poverty line. So if you make the poverty line, you pay no taxes. If you make twice the poverty line, you pay half the 23 percent rate. This keeps the system progressive and fair.
People have proposed optional flat tax rates, taxation of just estates, and all number of revenue-gathering tactics. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) campaigned on the idea of being able to fill out your taxes on an index card. 
Taxation should be reformed, and we as a country deserve better than what we have now in the realm of taxation.

Nicolas Maduro was sworn in as Venezuela’s president last Friday to replace Hugo Chavez. Chavez, the former Venezuelan president who died in March from cancer, handpicked his former vice president and long-time ally as his successor.
Maduro, like Chavez, came from a working-class background. A former bus driver who became a union trade leader and politician in Chavez’s cabinet, Maduro campaigned on the platform of continuing Chavez’s legacy — a commitment to Venezuela’s lower classes and toward crafting Venezuela into a South American socialist state. In fact, much of Maduro’s electoral success is due to Maduro’s affiliation with Chavez, who retains a great deal of popularity among Venezuelans. Maduro’s campaign stressed that a vote for Maduro would be like a vote for the former president.
However, looking ahead, Maduro cannot simply rely on his association with Chavez to succeed. Although Chavez still has ardent supporters, his popularity in the past few years has been declining mainly due to the state of the Venezuelan economy.
Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but during Chavez’s reign, there was a huge surge in government spending, contributing to an increase in Venezuela’s national debt and an increase in inflation. Furthermore, Venezuela currently has a very controlled economy. Chavez nationalized many companies in Venezuela and maintained price and currency controls, which have deeply weakened the private sector, according to Yahoo! News.
However, in his campaign, Maduro did not propose initiatives that would tackle these economic issues, instead focusing on social issues such as crime and corruption. Furthermore, his economic initiatives could contribute to higher inflation, such as raising the monthly minimum wage by up to 45 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Maduro’s mandate is also particularly weak; in an extremely close election, Maduro only won 50.6 percent of the vote while facing opposing candidate Henrique Capriles. The opposition has even questioned the legitimacy of Maduro’s victory, placing further doubts on whether Maduro truly has the popularity needed to carry him through.
Succeeding the divisive, charismatic, and forceful Chavez, Maduro has big shoes to fill, and it is unclear whether he has the foresight, tenacity, or charisma to pull himself through the harder times. Maduro must maintain a difficult balancing act between politics, pragmatism, and popularity if he wants Venezuela, and his presidency, to succeed.

Students look forward to Carnival every year, but not for the reasons that most alumni return to campus. Carnival should not be characterized by the large amounts of alcohol that many students consume during the festival.
Yes, we’re all college students and Carnival may seem like one of the only times when Carnegie Mellon students can relieve their stress, so it may be obvious that they want to go crazy. 
However, there’s a difference between drinking with friends while socializing, and drinking dangerous quantities of alcohol that can have lasting effects on your body.
It’s no secret that students on campus celebrate Carnival by boasting about  alcohol consumption. The Carnegie Mellon-famous Tumblr blog, cometomymellon.tumblr.com, posted a meme for last year’s Carnival reading “Happy F****** Carnival” with accompanying pictures of alcoholic beverages. Meanwhile, doyouhearbagpipes.tumblr.com, another Carnegie Mellon-themed Tumblr blog, dedicated a post to the event this year with pictures of people guzzling alcohol.
Meanwhile, there were no allusions to the attractions that allure people from beyond the student body to Carnival. The website isitcarnivalyet.com answered the website’s question with phrases like, “No, but it’s never too early to pregame.”
While there is no problem with drinking alcohol during Carnival (if you’re of age, of course), drinking to the point of bodily harm — which many students look forward to most — should not be the festival’s focus, especially when there are so many events and opportunities to take advantage of during Carnival. 
It would be a shame not to remember or to miss these events due to the negative effects of alcohol. Of course, there’s Booth and Buggy, Carnival’s two main attractions. There are also less-hyped events like Mobot, Downhill Derby, Scotch’n’Soda’s annual Carnival production, and opportunities to network with alumni.
What is the point of going to Booth drunk? Students work countless hours for these impressive structures. Having the experience of Booth distorted by alcohol does not allow students to truly appreciate the work that their peers put into it — same goes for the robots, art, and shows that students produce for Mobot, Downhill Derby, and Scotch’n’Soda, respectively.
This festival happens once a year. Taking the time to soberly and respectfully view the attractions at Carnival may even make this annual event more enjoyable each spring.
There are also several alumni events during Carnival, which give students the opportunity to meet former students. Choosing to consume alcohol during the day may cause students to miss these prime opportunities for networking.
I don’t have a problem with drinking casually in the evenings with friends during Carnival. What bothers me is the mentality that students will drink excessively simply because they can, making them unable to appreciate the attractions during the day or the morning after a heavy night of alcohol consumption — not to mention the physical danger of this mentality.

Carnival is the only time of year that Carnegie Mellon students have to really have some fun. The annual festival happens in the spring semester, and after 99 years, Carnival is pretty well ingrained in Carnegie Mellon culture. Students look forward to it every year, and alumni come back to visit with their families over the course of the weekend. Carnival also has a bit of a reputation around campus as the time when students temporarily forget that they don’t actually go to a party school.
This momentary change in mentality is not a bad thing — students need this time to de-stress. Carnegie Mellon students work hard during their academic year, but spring semester can be especially stressful at times. Carnival is a way to kick back and relax in a variety of ways, by going on all of the Carnival rides, watching buggy races, or sleeping until well after 3 p.m. Drinking is also part of that culture, whether or not the students involved are of age to drink.
However, the blow-out mentality of Carnival is complex; Carnival culture stems from a variety of factors. Firstly, we’re college students. As a demographic, we like to do potentially stupid things, and more importantly, we like to try to outdo each other in how crazy we can get. Carnival is one of the few times in the school year when students can relax and blow off all the steam that’s been building since the beginning of the school year. With a school that’s as stressful as Carnegie Mellon, that’s a lot of steam.
If we want to reduce the amount of craziness that goes on during Carnival, events like Carnival need to happen more often. This theory may seem counterintuitive, but it’s not. In any pressurized situation, the single escape valve — Carnival, in this case — is going to see a lot of traffic. The solution is not to let off less steam, but to create more holes for steam to escape through.
Carnival is not too unruly, especially given that events on the scale of Carnival only happen once a year. Yes, Carnegie Mellon students go a little crazy, but our antics could get much, much worse. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon undergraduates tend to be between the ages of 18 and 22 — the time in life to create the completely insane weekend stories that we’ll be telling when we’re 40. If you’re going to have weekends when you forget all your responsibilities and do whatever you want, now is the time.
While alumni and faculty are present with their families, little kids and all, they know what Carnival is like. Some parts — like the Wiggle Wurm and Granny Bugs rides, or some of the games in the booths — are very family friendly. However, while Carnegie Mellon is a giant nerd herd some days, it’s still a college campus, and Carnival is the last extended weekend before finals. Things are guaranteed to get a little crazy, and I think that’s a good thing.
With that mentality in mind, personal health and safety are still important. Carnival can be a blast, but remember you only have one liver.

Gun control legislation always faced an uphill climb — even with great public support. According to a recent poll by The Washington Post and ABC News and ABC News, 86 percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases. A CBS News poll has it as high as 90 percent. So why can’t the Senate agree with the public?
Last Wednesday, gun control amendments to expand background checks and ban assault weapons failed to reach the necessary 60 votes in the Senate. President Obama called it “a pretty shameful day for Washington.” Although the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin amendment to expand background checks raised hopes for a Republican compromise, that was not the case. Only four out of 45 Republican Senators joined 48 out of 53 Democrats to vote in support of the bill, according to The New York Times.  
In hindsight, it’s easy to point fingers, but placing blame on others should not be a focus. Some could say that President Obama abused his bully pulpit, parading the parents of Newtown, Conn. to shame congressmen. Others could say that Republicans are too conservative, stuck in the last century, and still can’t accept their embarrassing defeat in the last election. One can easily find different people to point fingers at. But that accomplishes nothing and does little to help the country progress.
As suggested by a recent report from The Hill, the fate of gun control lies in the public’s hands. However, the public cannot vote on amendments. That power lies in the hands of what Nate Silver of The New York Times calls an ideologically divided House and a Senate that allows small conservative states to have just as much power as bigger blue states. Yet it is a Congress comprised of members who are voted into office by the citizens, and hereon lies a very fundamental problem.
Many Congressmen don’t feel the pressure from 90 percent of Americans because the only people they are worried about are those who have votes from their districts. With so many voting districts moving to extremes, there is little motivation for compromise — especially when considering the fact that Congressional re-elections are two to four years down the road. So unless we all pack up and move to North Dakota, it seems as if we’re in the same state as before: stuck.
But it isn’t hopeless. The climate for compromise seems to be slowly taking shape. Obama’s new proposed budget features concessions on his part to cut Medicare and Social Security. Bipartisan immigration reform seems to be gaining momentum. Last week, 95 Senators also voted to improve mental health treatment, according to The Huffington Post. 
So let’s start here and work our way up. Let’s encourage our leaders to find a middle ground. Our political system might make reform difficult to achieve, but pointing fingers won’t get us anywhere, even if there is plenty of blame to go around.

The Joint Funding Committee (JFC)’s appeals process for 2014 organization budgets concluded last week, leaving many student leaders and organization members unhappy with the treatment they received from the JFC. Comments and exceptions made on BudgetTracker during the approval process are incongruous with the professionalism the JFC is supposed to uphold.
WRCT’s budget feedback largely consisted of the JFC asking why the radio station’s equipment keeps breaking; Amnesty International’s campus chapter, which requested funding for documentary film screenings, was left with the remark, “Find cheaper movies”; and the JFC made a comment at the end of Sustainable Earth’s budget that “Your FY12 audit showed you really don’t understand the concept of budgeting. Your current year spending is not really in line with your budget either. The JFC would like to meet with you prior to giving you any money. Please appeal.; appeal granted. Don’t screw it up, Matt.” 
Other organizations received similar rude comments. On the Scotch’n’Soda budget, many unprofessional comments were made. One comment pointed out that the theater group had misnamed a type of tape they were requesting money for: “It’s actually called fabric tape…..#VPFdoestheatre.”
With respect to budget increases, the AB Concerts budget increased to $232,825 after the appeals process, an increase from the pre-appeals figure of $196,785. AB Concerts did not ask for this increase, according to AB Concerts co-chair Rebecca Paren. Both of these figures are substantially larger than the $130,790 the organization operated with last year. Giving an organization more money than what it requested is unprecedented, at least since 2010, according to BudgetTracker. 
While next year will be the 100th Spring Carnival — and it’s understandable that students would want to celebrate accordingly — this $102,035 increase for one event comes at the expense of numerous other organizations that now have to operate on limited budgets.
Additionally, the only organization to receive an exception from the strictly implemented JFC funding guidelines for food was AB Tech. The JFC’s guidelines do not allow funding for “personal food”; however, AB Tech’s BudgetTracker comment said, “Exception made for you guys cause you work so darn hard.”
These inappropriate comments, coupled with what appears to be favorable treatment of certain organizations, demonstrate unacceptable behavior by the JFC. Budgets for student groups dramatically affect student life. They determine what an organization can afford and contribute to the quality of these groups. By their nature, budget cuts are upsetting for those who are affected by them.
The JFC must be aware of the impact that their funding allocations have and professionally address allocations with respect to the organization members that work hard to fulfill the interests of the student body.

First-year undeclared CFA student Jordan Wu created a petition last week through change.org to challenge the university’s proposed new Smart ID card designs.
The petition was shared among students on Facebook and received 227 signatures before closing. In the petition’s description, Wu told students, “I would be embarrassed showing any of these designs to anyone as a representation of our school.”
While it is justifiable for students to petition an unsatisfactory change on campus, The Tartan wants to see much of the fervor that was shown over the ID designs channeled toward more pressing matters. ID designs affect most people on campus, as students use them on a daily basis, but the image on the IDs will not directly impact a student’s well-being. Admittedly, the designs are part of campus culture, but they do not define it and will not change the image of Carnegie Mellon to outside parties.
Meanwhile, more important Carnegie Mellon issues have not caused nearly the same amount of student concern. For example, both Carnegie Mellon’s 10-year expansion plan and student elections are vastly more relevant to student life, but have not received nearly as much attention. The 10-year plan proposes changes to Carnegie Mellon’s physical campus that will directly and significantly alter students’ daily lives, while student elections affect everything from what happens on campus to our school’s image to the rest of the world. 
These issues are more important than the designs of our new IDs, and should generate just as much or more controversy among the student body than the designs did.
Regardless of one’s stances on these controversies, issues much larger than the new proposed ID designs exist on campus. If students gave as much attention to these issues as they have to the new ID designs, they would be a true catalyst for change.
