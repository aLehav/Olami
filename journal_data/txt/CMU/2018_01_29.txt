Women's Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon University women’s basketball team visited New York University (NYU) on Friday, Jan. 26 for a University Athletic Association (UAA) contest, falling to the Violets, 78–58, at the Hunter College Sportsplex. The Tartans are now 9–8 and 1–5 in the UAA, while the Violets improve to 9–8 and 2–4.
Sophomore Makayla Filiere led the Tartans with 19 points and three steals, as fellow sophomore Laurel Pereira dropped 13 points and picked up three steals. Sophomore Laura Ochsner led the team with nine rebounds and blocked two shots.
Filiere scored the first bucket of the game on a fast break layup and later gave the Tartans their last lead of the game, 11–10, on a three-pointer with 4:08 to go in the first quarter. The Violets then took over with a 13–4 run to end the quarter and led 23–15 after the first 10 minutes.
The Violets extended their lead to 20 by halftime and led by as many as 36 points before sophomore Megan Jaeb hit a three-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer.
Filiere scored eight of the team’s 26 fourth-quarter points, as the Tartans shot 7-of-10 from the field, 3-of-4 from the three-point arc, and 9-of-10 from the free throw line to cut the final deficit to 20 points.
On Sunday, Jan. 28 at Brandies University, the Carnegie Mellon University women’s basketball team lost a heartbreaker when the Judges held on for a 55–52 win. The Tartans are now 9–9 and 1–6 in the UAA while the Judges move to 11–6 and 3–4.
Filiere led the Tartans with 24 points and four assists while Pereira scored 16 points off the bench.
Pereira made a layup and free throw to tie the score at 8-8 after nearly six minutes of action in the first quarter, but Brandeis answered with a three-pointer and held on to a 15–14 first-quarter lead.
The lead changed hands three times in the second quarter with the last lead favoring the Tartans after a layup by Ochsner and a triple by Filiere made the score 24–23, with 4:19 to go. Filiere hit her third three-pointer of the game just more than two minutes later and the Tartans held a 29–25 halftime lead after shooting 42.9 percent from the floor and holding Brandeis to 25.8 percent shooting for the half.
Brandeis improved its shooting by 11 percent in the third quarter and took a two-point lead into the final period where they wouldn’t relinquish the lead. The Tartans pulled within two late but a free throw by the Judges with four seconds left forced the Tartans into a desperation three-pointer for the tie that fell short.
The Tartans finished the game shooting 38 percent from the floor as both teams turned the ball over 23 times. Twenty-one offensive rebounds for the Judges led to 12 second chance points which made up for their 27.4 percent shooting effort for the game.
The Tartans will return home to face New York University on Friday, Feb. 2, before hosting the Judges on Sunday at 2:00 p.m.
Men's Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon University men’s basketball team visited NYU on Friday, Jan. 26 for a UAA contest, falling 83-65 to the Violets at the Hunter College Sportsplex. The Tartans are now 4–13 overall and 0–6 in the UAA, while the Violets move to 9–7 and 2–4.
The Tartans were led by sophomore Zach Howarth’s 19 points and seven rebounds. Sophomore Trent Suddeth scored 13 points with sophomore Colin McNeil putting in 11 points and dishing out four assists.
NYU pushed its first-half lead to 11 points, bringing the score to 23–12. The Tartans would climb back to trail by two at 2:27 to go in the first half on a driving layup by senior Thomas Cook. First-year Zach Watson also cut the deficit at two with a reverse layup with 22 seconds to go but a shot close to the buzzer by NYU made the score 41–37 at the break.
Suddeth scored the first two baskets of the second half to fuel a 10–3 run that put the Tartans up 47–44 after McNeil put in a layup and Howarth sank four straight free throws.
The Violets would quickly take back the lead during an 11:29 stretch of play that included seven three-pointers and put the Violets up 19.
The Violets would finish with eight three-pointers for the second half and shot 54.8 percent from the field for the game, while the Tartans converted 41.9 percent from the field and hit just 4-of-20 from behind the arc.
On Sunday, Jan. 28, career-scoring afternoons for three Tartans weren’t enough as the Carnegie Mellon University men’s basketball team fell, 87–79, to Brandeis University. The Tartans are now 4–14 overall and 0–7 in the UAA while the Judges move to 4–13 and 1–6.
Sophomore Zach Howarth led the Tartans with a career-high 26 points while Watson finished with a career-best 19 points. Suddeth recorded his first career double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds while sophomore Cooper Williams also recorded a career-high with 14 points.
Brandeis opened with a 14–2 run through the first three minutes and 52 seconds of the game. Over the next seven minutes, the Tartans used a 16-3 run to take their first lead of the game when Howarth hit a three-pointer from the corner, making the score 18–17.
After the Tartans took their first lead with nine minutes to go, the advantage changed hands four times before Williams hit a trey fueling a 10–4 run to end the period with the Tartans up 36–30.
The dribble-drive for a score and the drive-and-kick for a three-pointer worked for the Tartans in the later portion of the first half as Watson finished the half with 10 points on four driving layups and Howarth scored 15 on 3-of-3 shooting from the arc and three driving buckets.
The Tartans shot 55.6 percent from long range and 45.2 percent from the floor in the first half while the Judges converted 41.4 percent from the floor and hit just 2-of-9 three-point attempts.
Carnegie Mellon extended its lead to 10 before Brandeis rattled off a 14–4 run to tie the game at 44-all with 13:53 to go. First-year Daniel Weiss drained a three-pointer on the next possession and the Tartans kept the lead until Brandeis had an 8–0 run to lead 54–49 with 11:12 to play.
A string of free throws and a jumper by Howarth briefly gave back the lead to the Tartans, 57–56, but the Judges hit nine of their final 18 shots and led by as many as 10 points before withstanding a Tartan rally to earn the 87–79 victory.
Carnegie Mellon will return home to face New York University on Friday, Feb. 2, at 8:00 p.m.

Super Bowl LII pits the old against the new — the veritable dynasty that is Tom Brady and the New England Patriots versus Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles. It has been thirteen years since the Eagles were last in the Super Bowl, after losing to none other than the Patriots in 2005. Offensively, the teams were neck and neck throughout the regular season, each averaging exactly 28.6 points a game. Both teams went 13-3 for the season, and both finished at the top of their respective conferences. Since the season began, these two teams have been on a collision course for the Super Bowl.
It is unfair to call the Eagles the underdogs. Although the odds are heavily in the Patriots’ favor, the Eagles have shown surprising resilience after the loss of starting quarterback Carson Wentz before the postseason began. Foles has thrown for 598 yards in two playoff games, and the Eagles boasted the third-best rushing offense during the season, proving themselves to be a double threat. In order to get the edge on the offensive juggernaut that is New England, Philadelphia must emphasize high scoring drives.
Foles has established himself as a competent back-up quarterback in the postseason thus far, including a dominant performance against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship, but there is little evidence from past regular season performances to back this up. He must be willing to shoulder the responsibility of leading the Eagles with renewed vigor, and must outperform one of the best quarterbacks in recent memory.
The Patriots, far and away a more passing-focused team, lead the league with the most productive offense, averaging 394.2 yards per game. The Eagles’ defense, ranked fourth in the NFL, will need to focus on shutting down Tom Brady and the Patriot’s offense early and often, especially tight end Rob Gronkowski, who averaged 15.7 yards per reception and led the Patriots with 69 receptions, and is coming off a head injury sustained in the AFC Championship.
The Patriots have become notorious for their late-game comebacks, and this perseverance will give them their best shot in defeating the Eagles. Championship experience is likely to come into play, as very few of the Eagles’ starters have played in a Super Bowl, and none as a member of the Eagles. The Patriots, however, have won five titles under head coach Bill Belichick, each secured by the performance of Brady. With two teams that have performed similarly throughout the year, this might be the edge the Patriots need to win a back-to-back championship, and what would be their third championship in four years.
The teams will go head-to-head at 6:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, Feb. 4.

When I saw that the Pittsburgh Pirates had traded Andrew McCutchen, face of the franchise and former National League MVP, to the San Francisco Giants for a young, untested relief pitcher and a minor league outfielder, I wasn’t as shocked as I think many Pirates fans were. The general consensus was, especially after the Gerrit Cole trade to the Houston Astros, that McCutchen would be gone for sure this offseason. Fans would have needed a miracle to get the club to extend McCutchen’s contract.
I was still hurt, mostly because of the terrible return the Pirates got for him. We really couldn’t have snagged anyone that brings a bit more of a veteran presence to the team? But the damage was done, so the only thing left to do is look forward to this season, if you even want to support the Bucs anymore.
So, Pirates fans, what is there left to love about this team? What could be the ray of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy offseason?
Their names are Josh Bell and Jameson Taillon, of course. Even during the 2017 season, reporters were looking at Bell, a well-spoken, power-hitting first baseman, and seeing his potential to lead the Pirates as their new franchise player. After a record-breaking rookie year, the only thing I can possibly hope for from Bell is more consistency as he tries to fill the shoes left by McCutchen.
In Taillon’s case, it’s a little less obvious. After the Bucs flipped Cole for a couple of seemingly lackluster players (more on that later), the rationale in my mind was that the Pirates already have Taillon in their pocket as a young, developing ace. He’s a stud on the mound, and although he had a bit of a rough patch after returning from his cancer surgery, everything seems to be set up for Jamo to take his place as the Pirates’ new ace pitcher.
Another thing to celebrate is the extension of flame-throwing closer Felipe Rivero’s contract, so if we can make it to the 9th inning, we have a good chance that he’ll hold it down for us. The two young main pieces we got in exchange for Cole from Houston — pitcher Joe Musgrove and third baseman Colin Moran — seem like they have the potential to blossom in Pittsburgh.
The two of them were sitting deep in the depth chart on an extremely talented Astros roster. Musgrove was thrown into a relief role because the Astros had too many incredible starting pitchers already, and Colin Moran would never see significant playing time behind Alex Bregman. There was no way for either of the two players to make an impact on the star-studded reigning World Series champions.
However, on in a smaller team with a lot less talent on the roster, we could see both of them become reliable — perhaps even great — players. Musgrove could become a great starter and  justify the Bucs’ dumping of Cole. Moran may fill out our hole at third base and become a real power threat. Plus, he’s got a killer beard.
Trading McCutchen closes the curtain on an era of Pittsburgh baseball that had many lows, but also many highs. I choose to look forward to this new team of young blood, and be excited about the future.

Welcome to the final Tartan fantasy football recap of the season! After soundly beating my team, Third String Team, defending champion and former Editor-in-Chief India Price’s Yes We Cam faced off against former Sports Editor Ian Tanaya’s Easy Breesy, who just edged out contributing editor Lula Beresford’s Justin Tucker Must (not) Die to make it to the Tartan league’s version of the Super Bowl.
In the end, Easy Breesy defeated Yes We Cam 243.9–210.9 to take the championship crown. It’s a fitting conclusion to Tanaya’s tenure as Sports Editor and his time at Carnegie Mellon.
Easy Breesy over Yes We Cam 243.9-210.9
Just like how the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl this season, this matchup was a familiar one for both Tanaya and Price, who competed in the 2016-17 Tartan championship. Last year, Price beat Tanaya by only two points. This year, Tanaya made sure that didn’t happen again.
With strong Week 16 performances from Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy, Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones, and Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, Tanaya built a 20-point lead over Price, who suffered from sub-10 weeks from four of her playmakers. Easy Breesy was leading 124.11–104.5 going into Week 17.
The final week of the NFL regular season saw Yes We Cam perform marginally better, including 24.4 points from Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry, 17.7 points from Minnesota Viking wide receiver Stefon Diggs, and a robust 15 points from the Pittsburgh Steelers defense. Easy Breesy suffered from a sub-par performance from McCoy, and from the fact that Gronkowski did not play. However, with New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara’s 128 total yards from scrimmage and 106-yard kickoff return touchdown that led to a whopping 30.8 points, Easy Breesy easily maintained a comfortable lead, taking home the title.
Justin Tucker Must (not) Die over Third-String Team 183–111.2
In the competition for third place, Beresford’s team completely clobbered mine, which lived up to its name. If I’m being completely honest, I believe I could’ve had a chance to make it close if I remembered to adjust my lineup. But alas, I didn’t.
After Week 16, the teams were relatively close, with Justin Tucker Must (not) Die leading 80–68.1. The team ensured the lead with 15.6 points from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and 20.7 points from Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell. Despite 17.5 points from Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith, a collective 14.8 points from five of my nine starters was too much to overcome.
In Week 17, my incompetence really showed. For a third-year fantasy player, I made a fool of myself by forgetting to bench four of my nine starters who didn’t even play. A measly 43.1 points from the entire lineup was no match for the 103 points from Justin Tucker Must (not) Die. All but two of Beresford’s starters scored over 10 points. Congrats to Beresford for obliterating my team and taking the bronze as a fantasy football rookie!
Team Andah over Drop it like it’s Crock 220.3–196.5
There were no surprises in the race for fifth place (or what ESPN’s website aptly calls the “consolation” matchup). The only consolation I can give former Publisher Jade Crockem is that staffwriter Josh Andah has continuously beat teams throughout the season while never changing his lineup (I don’t think he’s ever even signed into his account since he created it). Earlier in the season some of us in the league wondered if Andah’s strategy (or lack thereof) might get him into the playoffs, but thankfully, that didn’t happen.
While the Week 16 box score for Drop it like it’s Crock lacks any glaring zeros, underwhelming performances from many of Crockem’s starters set the team back. Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald’s 27.7 points (from nine catches, 119 yards, and a touchdown) was the team’s only bright spot. For Team Andah, on the other hand, there were several bright spots to go with a zero due to Steelers  star wide receiver Antonio Brown’s injury.  Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon gained 81 yards from 19 carries and a touchdown for 21.8 points and Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz hauled in nine catches for 81 yards for 17.1 points.
Building on a 116.1–104.5 lead, Team Andah again saw great weeks despite Brown’s absence. Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin’s 25 points were his most since his season-high 26.5 points in Week 3, and the Chiefs defense also posted its second-best week of the season with 17 points. For Drop it like it’s Crock, Fitzgerald’s 13.5 points couldn’t carry the team. In the end, it seems like Crockem’s team name was well-chosen, as she dropped from third place last year to dead-last in the league this year.
And that’s it for the Tartan fantasy football league for the 2017-18 season. Just like the unpredictable NFL season, our fantasy season has had some surprising results. Next year the field will be quite different. All of our players this season, except for Andah and me, are seniors. I don’t expect Andah to participate again, so check back in the fall for a new crop of Tartan staff members that I’ve coerced into joining the league.

Last week, the Public Library of Science (PLOS ONE) journal published a controversial study in which University of Alberta virologist David Evans and his associate Ryan Noyce synthesized a horsepox virus from bits of mail-ordered genetic material. Noyce and Evans obtained the horsepox DNA, synthesized the genes in a modern vaccinia virus (VACV) to create the horsepox virus (HPXV). Then, they showed that the virus was able to infect cells and reproduce. They describe all their processes in thorough detail in their paper, which was published on Jan. 19, 2018. 
This study was funded by Tonix, a pharmaceutical company based in New York, whose president and chief executive officer Seth Lederman is listed as one of the authors on the study.
Horsepox is non-lethal to humans, but it is a relative of smallpox, which was declared to be officially eradicated in 1980 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO also bans the synthesis of the full genome of smallpox. The last strains of variola are kept under high security in Russia and the United States. In 2017, Science magazine reported that motivation for the research, according to its sponsor Seth Lederman, president of the pharmaceutical company Tonix, was to develop a safer, reliable smallpox vaccine with fewer side effects. But critics say that not only do safer vaccines already exist, but also the paper’s publication in an open-source journal could potentially further the threat of a smallpox outbreak via a bioterrorist attack. Gregory Koblentz, a biodefense expert at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, explains that while getting hands on the smallpox virus is not an immediate threat, over time as more and more people gain access to this technology, it could become a threat. 
The study by Lederman, Evans, and Noyce has been criticized for claiming that it could further the development of a “safe” smallpox vaccine, without mentioning that such vaccines have already been developed and that the market for a smallpox vaccine using horsepox is seemingly nonexistent. In response, Lederman claims that he is not convinced by the clinical trials, or the historical success of other smallpox vaccines like the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) or the LC16m8 from Japan. 
A weakened form of this vaccinia virus, known as MVA, was developed in the 1970s by the German-Danish company Bavarian Nordic, and was administered to about 150,000 German children at the time. It doesn’t replicate in humans and has been proven to be safe on HIV-positive and stem-cell transplant patients. However, Lederman argues that because MVA was developed and distributed as smallpox was becoming more and more rare, its effectiveness in a real smallpox outbreak remains untested and could be a huge gamble. 
Before you panic, you should know that according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is a large enough supply of the smallpox vaccine for the American public in case of such an attack. Since 9/11, the U.S. government has stockpiled on millions of doses of vaccinia, the mild poxvirus used in the smallpox vaccine. Today, the U.S. government plans to acquire 13 million more doses of MVA, and already has 28 million, according to Science magazine. This vaccine is less risky than the vaccinia vaccines which were frequently used pre-eradication.
As of now, Tonix is developing vaccines using horsepox that have been tested on microbes, which would have been infected had they not been vaccinated. The company is currently working on a more controlled version of the vaccine that they could test on humans. 
The debate around this issue is related to others about whether the remaining strains of the smallpox virus, secured in government labs in the United States and Russia, should be destroyed. In 2014, the WHO had recommended that these labs get rid of the virus--but as CDC scientist Inger Damon stated in Smithsonian that same year, if another outbreak occurred, keeping the strains would be necessary in order to research safer vaccines and treatments. To that end, Lederman, Evans, and Noyce have proven that the reintroduction of smallpox is no longer a theoretical possibility while simultaneously aiding preparedness for such a situation by bringing the topic back into discussion. However, by publishing their paper, many believe that they have also increased the risk of that happening.

Computing on Network Infrastructure for Pervasive Perception, Cognition, and Action (CONIX) is a $27.5 million initiative by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) that aims to increase the levels of autonomy and intelligence into the internet of things (IoT) networks. 
This initiative is comprised of researchers from six partner universities — University of California, Berkeley, University of Washington, University of Southern California, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Los Angeles — led by and headquartered at Carnegie Mellon University. CONIX is co-directed by Anthony Rowe — an Associate Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University and Prabal Dutta — an Associate Professor at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department of University of California, Berkeley. The initiative had its kick-off meeting on Jan. 26, 2018. 
From Wi-Fi controlled string lights for dorm rooms to app controlled car locks to health-monitoring clothes, inter-device communication along with human-device communication has become a virtue of what it means to be a human in the modern age. This space of devices collecting and interacting with each other forms the space that we call the IoT.  As such devices - sensing, collecting data, and interacting with humans - become more pervasive and more integrated into our lives, it becomes increasingly important to be able to build networks that are better equipped to handle these interactions between the cloud and the edge devices. In a Carnegie Mellon press release, Dean James H. Garrett Jr. of the College of Engineering stated, “The extent to which IoT will disrupt our future will depend on how well we build scalable and secure networks that connect us to a very large number of systems that can orchestrate our lives and communities. CONIX will develop novel architectures for large-scale, distributed computing systems that have immense implications for social interaction, smart buildings and infrastructure, and highly connected communities, commerce and defense.” 
CONIX has divided its research agenda into four broad themes — Physically-Coupled Cognitive Perceptual Systems; Platforms, Programming and Synthesis; Security, Robustness and Privacy; and Interacting Services. Then, CONIX aims to focus on three applications of Physically-Coupled Cognitive Perceptual Systems — Smart and Connected Communities, Interactive Mixed Reality Systems and Enhanced Situational Awareness. 
The Interactive Mixed Reality Systems application aims to better integrate the physical and virtual focusing primarily on “short distances, tight latency, and large bandwidths.” The Smart and Connected Communities application looks at “network size, long distances, and human time-scales” which means that it would require creating systems that are better equipped to obtain and handle large amounts of data from the communities. The Enhanced Situational Awareness application will combine the other two applications to “support real-time collaboration among humans, algorithms, and machines in a safe, robust, and secure manner in an information-rich, rapidly-evolving tactical environment,” which means that it will create distributed systems that are equipped to process large amounts of data efficiently and securely. Rowe said, “there isn’t a seamless way to merge cloud functionality with edge devices without a smarter interconnect, so we want to push more intelligence into the network...If networks were smarter, decision-making could occur independent of the cloud at much lower latencies.”
With the possibilities represented by the IoT and the responsibility that comes with handling so much data, this initiative - interdisciplinary and broad — seems to represent a new era of technological change.

A dusty, blackened thigh bone that may represent a "missing link" in human evolution was rejected from a major anthropologist conference this month, prompting frustration among the anthropology community and adding to the confusion surrounding a now-infamous specimen.
Scientists still don't know exactly when humans diverged from other apes on the evolutionary tree. Most anthropologists agree that the most recent species from which both hominids and other apes descended — the "chimpanzee-human last common ancestor," or CHLCA — which lived between four and ten million years ago. 
Sahelanthropus tchadensis, an early hominid species that lived around seven million years ago, is a strong candidate for the CHLCA, because it has a mix of chimp-like and human traits. Like chimpanzees, Sahelanthropus had a small brain, a strongly ridged brow, and an elongated skull, according to the Smithsonian. Like humans, Sahelanthropus had small teeth and a short facial structure.
Most significantly, Sahelanthropus's skull would have connected to its spinal cord at the bottom, not the back. Sahelanthropus shares this trait with a more recent human relative, Orrorin tugenensis, and may be Orrorin's ancestor. In Orrorin, the skull opening at the bottom allowed it to stand up straight and walk on two legs; Orrorin was confirmed bipedal in 2002 by scientists who examined Orrorin leg bones. Was Sahelanthropus also bipedal? Or does it just have the skull structure that made bipedalism possible, later on down the line?
Knowing whether Sahelanthropus walked upright would help scientists fit the species and its probable descendants into the phylogenetic tree of human evolution. If Sahelanthropus is the CHLCA, it's a direct ancestor of modern humans, which means Orrorin may be also. It's unclear right now how Orrorin is related to us, but a few scientists believe that modern humans descended from a species of Orrorin - as opposed to a species of Australopithecus, which has been the dominant view for a century. If Sahelanthropus and Orrorin are our ancestors, and not Australopithecus, much of modern anthropology will be overturned.
However, it's impossible for anthropologists to be certain whether Sahelanthropus walked upright, because no Sahelanthropus leg bones have ever been discovered.
Or have they?
In 2001, French scientist Michel Brunet's expedition discovered a Sahelanthropus skull, along with some jaw fragments, in the African country of Chad. The specimen was named Toumaï and used to establish Sahelanthropus as a species. When Brunet's paper describing Sahelanthropus was published, Brunet argued that the positioning of the hole in Toumaï's skull alone established that Sahelanthropus was bipedal. He has maintained this position ever since.
The leader of the field team that uncovered the bones, retired geographer Alain Beauvilain, disagrees. He claims that a femur was found nearby, and that its characteristics suggest a species that was not bipedal.
This femur is surrounded by mystery and contradictions. First, in 2004, a series of papers were published on a controversy involving some of Toumaï's teeth that called into question the methods of Brunet's original research team. In 2008, Beauvilain argued in a paper that through ancient human interference, the bones had been moved from their original spot, calling into question Brunet's estimation of their age and place of origin. But most importantly, the field photographs of the bones published in Brunet's original paper are not photographs of the bones as they were found — the photographs are recreations, staged with casts of the bones. Not necessarily a sign of dishonesty, but an unusual choice.
But the most important mystery is this: despite Sahelanthropus's significance as a potential biped, none of the scientists who discovered or described Sahelanthropus has ever acknowledged the femur's existence in print. 
France's National Center for Scientific Research even explicitly stated that no leg bones were found at the site. Most anthropologists, until recently, had no idea it existed. Even some of Toumaï's discoverers have barely seen the femur. David Pilbeam, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard University, who was a co-author on Brunet's original Toumaï paper, never got a chance to analyze it and only saw it briefly. “All I can recall is that it lacked ends and was very black,” he said.
Is this a scientific cover-up? The withholding of anthropological evidence?
Brunet has declined to comment. “Our studies are still in progress,” he wrote in a brief e-mail to Nature. “Nothing to say before publishing.” According to Nature, "the discovery of [Toumaï] made Brunet famous in France, and especially in Poitiers, where a street is named after him."
After Brunet's original expedition, the femur was quietly shipped to France with the rest of the bones and ended up in the collection of the University of Poitiers. Aude Bergeret, now director of the Museum of Natural History Victor-Brun in Montauban, France, came across the femur in storage in 2004, when she was a graduate student at the university. “I discovered the femur by chance,” she says. “I remember joking with another student, who told me, ‘You found Toumaï's femur!’,” Bergeret says. “I realized when I saw Roberto Macchiarelli that this joke was probably based on reality.”
Bergeret asked Machiarelli, then head of the department of geosciences at the University of Poitiers, to help her study the bone. They compared it to other known hominin bones and reached a preliminary impression: the owner of this femur was not bipedal.
This year, Bergeret and Machiarelli submitted a report to the Anthropological Society of Paris that discussed their brief impressions of the femur, and argued that a formal in-depth, peer-reviewed analysis was needed. It would have been the first scientific publication to describe the femur, finally giving evidence-starved anthropologists real information — but their report was rejected without explanation.
Anthropologists are used to scientific understanding being impeded by incomplete evidence or unknown factors. But it's less usual for the bureaucracy and politics of scientific publication to prevent unanimously coveted extant evidence from coming to light — at least with something as significant as the origins of humanity.
“We don’t know why it’s been kept secret," says paleoanthropologist Bill Jungers, at Stony Brook University in New York. "Maybe it’s not even a hominid. Who... knows until someone can expose it.”

Scientists discover “defense islands” used by bacteria
CRISPR/Cas9 — widely known for its applications in gene-editing — is also a part of the prokaryotic immune system. This means that it helps certain forms of bacteria protect themselves from viruses called phages that take over the genetic machinery of the cell and force them to replicate viral DNA. However, this mechanism isn’t the only one protecting bacteria from foreign substances. 
A study published recently in Science magazine explains that bacteria have more defense systems than previously thought. These systems were found in different “defense islands” — genes that tend to cluster together in the genome. 
According to Science News, the researchers found nine groups of anti-phage defenses and one anti-plasmid defense. This research was conducted by researchers of the Department of Molecular Genetics at Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

Chinese scientists clone longtailed macaque babies
For the first time since Dolly the Sheep was created in 1996, scientists report the successful cloning of long-tailed macaques using the method used to produce Dolly. 
The two female baby macaques — six and eight weeks old — are named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, drawn from the word zhonghua. The animals are reportedly healthy and are currently living in an incubator. One of the authors of this study, Qiang Sun, a researcher at the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai, said, "The two monkeys are very active and healthy, they progress very rapidly like human babies… Every other day, they seem more active and their motor system is much more developed and [there are] no signs of abnormality."
With the release of this news, the scientists of the study assure the public that experimenting is not a stepping stone to human cloning and is too risky to not pose ethical concerns.

Plastic in oceans threatens coral reefs worldwide
Climate change and bleaching have already incorrigibly affected the coral reef population. Now, researchers at Cornell University have discovered that the presence of plastic makes corals more susceptible to disease and intensifies this affect.
Scientists say that these plastics — part of the oceans' trash such as bottle caps, plastic bags, etc. — act as carriers of pathogenic bacteria that lead to coral reef death due to a disease called white syndrome. The presence of plastic increases the corals disease susceptibility rates from four to 89 percent.  Cornell University researcher Drew Harvell explains, “They basically tear open the skin of the coral and that can allow an infection from anywhere to start.”
As scientists predict that the plastic going into the coral reefs in oceans will rise to 15.7 billion plastic items, they warn that conservation efforts become necessary to curb the effects of human activity on nature.

This past Saturday, Jan. 27, Toronto-based, Asian-Canadian YouTube group CantoMando came to Carnegie Mellon University. Hosted by the Carnegie Mellon student organizations Big Straw Magazine, Asian Students Association, and Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture, roughly a hundred students from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh showed up for the trio’s first ever event held on a college campus.
Started in 2016 by Sheldon Ho, and later joined by his friends Edward Leung and Mike Wu, CantoMando is a YouTube channel that harnesses comedy not only for the sake of laughs, but also to bring focus to important issues facing Asians in a more light-hearted way.
Growing up, all three had their own set of difficulties as American-born Chinese (ABCs), which they each highlighted throughout the event. Sheldon grappled with his identity, trying to determine who he wanted to be and who he wanted to be associated with; Mike had trouble accepting his Chinese name, especially around his classmates (most of whom misheard his name as Moose Chin); Edward struggled with coming to terms with the racism he faced both by people of other races, and even Asians, who were swayed by the opinions of others.
Utilizing stock images, personal photos, memes, and the occasional badly-timed slideshow transition to their advantage throughout the event, CantoMando never ceased to capture the audience’s attention with both intentional and unintentional humor. While laughter was consistently abundant, much like their videos, CantoMando’s talk at Carnegie Mellon masterfully incorporated humor with seriousness as members shared their stories as ABCs.
In the end, however, despite these difficult situations, they learned — and continue to learn — to accept who they were. They were inspired to bring awareness based on the struggles they had growing up and discuss important issues such as stereotypes, identity, and racial tension. They are seeking to help other ABCs and Asians feel more comfortable with embracing their cultures and identities.
Although I wasn’t super familiar with CantoMando going into the event, each member of the CantoMando team’s story was engaging, inspiring, and relatable. It was eye-opening to hear about their experiences and truly recognize how everyone has gone through similar identity crises.
I’ve always had trouble, like Ho, figuring out who I am and where I belong. Especially as someone who is neither a first-generation ABC nor fully Asian, I’ve never felt fully comfortable expressing my views. I didn’t feel like my experiences were valid or qualified enough, and yet as I listened to CantoMando talk, I found that I still shared a lot of similar worries and experiences. 
Growing up, I didn’t really embrace any of my roots, kind of floating in a limbo. Since coming to Carnegie Mellon, though, I’ve been able to grow and have had the chance to start discovering who I am and where I belong.
As cliché as it may sound, CantoMando made me realize how important it is for everyone to embrace their identities and find communities that accept them for who they are. They crucially emphasized, however, that embracing our own cultures does not mean we should shut out those who are different and have differing views.
As Leung discussed, when he was faced with a situation of racism, he was initially angry and wanted to hate others. However, with time to reflect, he realized it was not the way to go or resolve conflict. He wanted to bring awareness to the issues and not be divided over them. He asserted how important it was to not stereotype or try to fit people into boxes based on their race, no matter who they are.
CantoMando continuously discussed how problematic it was to be seen only for the color of their skin and not for the content of their character, yet Edward took it a step farther. At one point, he was faced with a dilemma. On social media, he saw a post that depicted three "white" guys mocking Chinese culture. Another account commented on the post, essentially saying that those three guys were racist and they represented all "white" people’s attitudes toward other cultures. However, Edward decided to respond and expressed his disbelief, correcting the commenter’s blanket statement saying that only “some white people” were like that. However, many of his followers and viewers voiced that they felt betrayed by the stance he took. To be seen as betraying his race merely for not agreeing that all white people are bad was disheartening, especially as someone who strongly advocates for people like him and brings awareness to Asian-Canadian and Asian-American struggles.
Divisiveness will never solve any problems or reverse any negative views. While it may be easier to cut yourself off from people who hurt you and lose all respect for them, making assumptions and associating all people as bad or good based on the color of their skin causes more harm than it heals.
Ultimately, CantoMando’s university debut was a success. Achieving the perfect balance between being meaningful and funny, the initially nervous group had nothing to worry about, evoking laughter and inspiring many Asian students with their stories and experiences.

“Never underestimate the power of music.” These words, spoken by the main character’s idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), are the heart and soul of Disney Pixar’s latest film, Coco. Lively, heartwarming, and genuine, Coco shows us the importance of family and appreciation for cultural traditions. Directed by Pixar veterans Lee UnKrich — director of Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo — and Adrian Molina, who directed Monsters University and The Good Dinosaur, the film featured the voices of Anthony Gonzalez, Gael García Berna, and Benjamin Bratt. The film broke box office records in Mexico, passing The Avengers to become the highest grossing movie in the country’s history, and for good reason.
The animated film follows Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), a young boy with a lifelong dream of becoming an accomplished musician. After his great-great grandfather had left the family to pursue his own dream of music, the Rivera household, hurt and angry, established a generations-long ban on music. As his family prepares for the holiday Día de los Muertos, Miguel learns of a music contest: an opportunity to do what he loves most. He takes the advice of his deceased idol, Ernesto de la Cruz, and seizes his moment by literally seizing de la Cruz’s guitar from his altar. This act transports Miguel to the Land of the Dead, where he becomes a part of the spirit world. In order to return home, Miguel learns that he must receive a blessing from a family member, and attempts to find them in the afterlife. Along the way, he meets the endearing trickster Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and together, the two of them travel through the Land of the Dead to reveal the secrets of his family heritage.
Coco presents a classic coming-of-age story, one that seems all too familiar, especially when looking at Pixar’s past films; and yet, it remains fresh and original, presenting a different perspective on familial ties through a new cultural lens. The importance of family, deceased or alive, is an enormous part of Latin culture, and is an enormous part of this movie. Miguel’s secret passion for music is made even more relatable when we consider the authority and influence elder family members can have, and his yearning for acceptance and support strikes a familiar chord. While honoring deceased family members isn’t a common aspect of American culture, the film makes us consider the importance of remembrance. In the film, the spirits in the Land of the Dead can experience something called a “Final Death,” which occurs when the last living person forgets them. As sad as it sounds, the film uses this concept to remind audience members to celebrate the lives of their own ancestors. Rather than coming across as sorrowful in these particular moments, Coco is vivacious and compassionate, urging audience members to celebrate their own life and the lives of others.
Right from the beginning, the film displays utterly beautiful visuals: the history of the Rivera family is told through moving papel picados (tissue paper banners with designs made by paper cutting), and the bustling neighborhood is full of colorful characters and mariachis. The story is intertwined with a swirl of bright saturated oranges, yellows, and blues, making the Land of the Dead even more fantastical and grand. The amount of love and care that went into this movie is evident in the sheer amount of detail put into the visuals, from the individual wrinkles in Grandma Coco’s face, to the millions of glowing orange flower petals that form the bridge to the afterlife.
Pixar films have always included music that pulls at our heart-strings, and Coco is no exception. From big show tunes to soft lullabies, every song features a Spanish guitar, Miguel’s instrument of choice, which adds to the Latin style of the film. The most memorable songs in the film are “Récuerdame” (or “Remember Me”), a tear-inducing lullaby; “La Llorona,” an energetic Latin pop song; and “Un Poco Loco,” a cheerful and humorous love song. While every song has a similar Latin flavor, each character has their own style, from de la Cruz’s grand spectacles to Miguel’s innocent and fun folk songs, adding another layer of personality to the film’s characters. Despite the many songs, the film never drags; in fact, every song serves a purpose and drives the story forward, giving the film life and exuberance.
But by far, the most successful aspect of Coco is its wholehearted embracement of Mexican culture. Not only is it a film about a Mexican family on a traditional holiday, it also features an entirely Latinx cast and a vast number of Latinx creators, animators, and consultants. It takes an opportunity to educate without sounding didactic, allowing audiences to experience for themselves the joy these cultural traditions bring. The film takes every opportunity to be as real and accurate as possible, from the Día de los Muertos -inspired designs of the spirits in the afterlife, to Miguel’s abuela’s weapon of choice — a chancla. It not only emphasizes the importance of diversifying our perspectives, it also emphasizes the need for understanding those perspectives. In a time where anti-immigrant sentiment seems to be rising, much of Latinx culture can be misconstrued or appropriated, and Coco presents us with a unique look into their rich culture and traditions in order to better understand it. The creators of the film and the film itself show us how cultural appreciation should be done and encourages the audience to take a moment to understand their perspective.
While it can be nearly impossible to pick a favorite Pixar film, Coco is easily in the top three. It’s a film that will make you cry, laugh, and cry again, and give you a deep appreciation for your own family. While it may be marketed as a kids movie, it is most definitely enjoyed by audiences of all ages and backgrounds. The film is simultaneously socially conscious and celebratory, providing a fun and appreciative look into Mexico’s rich culture. The combination of the endearing characters, spirited music, and astounding visuals makes Coco an absolute must-see.

Competitive figure skater and Olympic silver medalist Nancy Kerrigan was a symbol of American class and elegance. She was the daughter of a supportive and wholesome American family. She was poised and graceful, the epitome of femininity and beauty. Tonya Harding was quite the opposite. But despite these differences, both Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding joined the ranks as some of the best, if not the best, female figure skaters in the world. 
Known most infamously for becoming embroiled in the assault of competitor Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding was and is much more than the infamous scandal. I, Tonya paints a complex portrait of Tonya, her family, and the fascinating details surrounding "the incident."
Tonya (Margot Robbie) was born and raised in Portland, Oregon and began skating at the age of three. Tonya was, by no means, the expected image of a young figure skater. She enjoyed hunting, mechanics, and drag racing — things she picked up from her father before he left both her and her mother alone in Portland. From then on, LaVona (Allison Janney), her mother, raised Tonya by herself. I, Tonya makes it clear that despite LaVona's dedication to Tonya's figure skating training and career, LaVona both mentally and physically abuses Tonya for much of her life, ultimately driving Tonya into the arms of abusive boyfriend Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), whom she married when she was just 19 years old. 
Despite the abuse, and the need to work several jobs to support her and Jeff, Tonya trained for hours on end to become one of the best figure skaters in the world: she took first place in Skate America and Nations Cup, as well as second in World Championship Skating and the U.S. Olympic Figure Skating Festival. Her top competitor was always Nancy Kerrigan.
Nancy Kerrigan was a crowd favorite. For many Americans, she was their sweetheart. For the judges, she represented everything good in women's figure skating. Though Tonya's athletic ability was unmatched, her presentation — composed largely of inexpensive homemade costumes — would never be as crowd-pleasing as Nancy, who could afford any expense necessary, and Tonya knew that.
Nevertheless, Tonya persisted and became the first American woman (and second woman in the world) to attempt and land the triple axel. Finally, she was getting the recognition and love she had dreamed of and always deserved. I, Tonya shows a hard truth behind the success — it doesn't always translate to happiness. The success drove a wedge between Tonya and Jeff, whose relationship only grew more violent. 
The movie uses a pseudo-documentary portrayal of the character's lives, and it proved to be a strong and effective way of letting the audience inside Tonya's struggles. She wanted to leave Jeff and continue on in the pursuit of a life without abuse. But, in her struggle to be seen in the public and by the figure skating association as part of a "wholesome American family," she decides against splitting up their relationship.
Tonya makes the 1992 Winter Olympics team and, despite a series of mishaps with her skates and laces, places fourth overall. She is filled with mixed emotions, and Margot Robbie is excellent in showcasing Tonya's clashing moods. Tonya is still the victim of spousal abuse, and she's losing the love and respect of the figure skating world.
For a few months, figure skating takes a back seat in Tonya's life. But, in 1992, it was decided that the Olympics would be moved to 1994, and Tonya now has a chance at making the team. She is more determined than ever to prove her worth to a world filled with opposition. The cards are stacked against her, but she's driven and takes every chance she can to get better. There's one thing — or person — however, holding her back and she fails to realize it. Jeff Gillooly ultimately leads to the fall of Tonya's career.
Leading up to the Olympics, Tonya began receiving death threats that left her too nervous to take the ice, leaving her with limited practice time. Jeff, along with his up-to-no-good friend Shawn, gets the idea to send Nancy Kerrigan similar letters in the hopes that it will rattle her nerves and level the playing field. Shawn, in a selfish attempt at living out some sort of infamous attack, takes it upon himself to go beyond death threats. He hires two men to attack Nancy Kerrigan. The movie showcases the overwhelming confusion that both Jeff and Tonya experience in response to this. Tonya immediately suspects Jeff's involvement.
Some argue that her hesitation to come forward with suspicion was ultimately her own fault. While this line of thinking isn't completely off the mark, I, Tonya highlights how hard it was for Tonya to ever cross her husband — doing so would inevitably lead to further physical, emotional, and mental abuse at her expense. Though she eventually comes forward, she does so a little too late. To make matters worse, Jeff, overcome with anger at Tonya's decision to finally divorce him, tells the court that Tonya was integral in planning an attack on Nancy Kerrigan. However, it seems fairly clear that Tonya's involvement starts and ends with the decision to send death threats to Nancy's practice arena. After all, Tonya wanted to prove she was the best, and she wanted to prove that she was a superior skater to Nancy. I, Tonya makes sure the audience fully realizes how important it was for Tonya to get the opportunity to not just compete in the Olympics, but to compete against Nancy Kerrigan. It wasn't in Tonya's interest to jeopardize Nancy's chances at getting to compete.
Though the media and public opinion jumped immediately to the conclusion that Tonya was a vicious competitor who wanted nothing more than to win that gold Olympic medal, I, Tonya does a fantastic job of presenting the details of the incident with all of the grey areas and blurred lines that something so complex deserves. In the movie, Tonya describes the media's coverage as abusive. "You're all my abusers, too," remarks Tonya. The movie doesn't erase Tonya's involvement in lying to save her husband. But it allows the audience to sympathize with a woman who faced nothing but hatred and abuse, a woman who wanted nothing more than a fair shot at life. Tonya had been taken advantage of and manipulated, and she made irrevocable mistakes that will forever haunt her. 
One of the most heart-wrenching scenes in I, Tonya comes toward the end of the movie where, following her 8th place finish in the Olympics (with Nancy Kerrigan taking second), a trial for the assault resulted in Tonya's lifelong ban from any figure skating association. Margot Robbie's emotional expression is phenomenal, and the audience's heart breaks along with Tonya's as you realize that she had lost everything she had ever known. 
I, Tonya sheds new light on an infamously dark spot of American figure skating. The movie forces the audience to leave preconceived notions of Tonya Harding behind and be open to the idea that not everything is as it seems. It allows you to question the "facts" you've previously been told and gives a new voice to someone whose heartbreaking story of abuse and perseverance had been tossed aside and replaced with a media-built portrayal of a fame-hungry villain.

The 2018 Vanity Fair Hollywood issue was filled with quite a few photoshop fails. From adding extra limbs to removing actors, this issue was about as exciting as the year’s entire awards season. The name of the game this season is accountability, and while for some it seems a bit hypocritical that they’re speaking out on this long brewing issue now after knowing about it for years, it’s still nice that strides are being made to bring awareness to sexual assault. Some actors proclaiming “me too” and “time’s up” have still refused to denounce movie moguls, such as Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein. However, if they can use some of their popularity to bring attention to the activists doing the real work, then not all hope is lost.
The cover features Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey embracing each other. Fans were quick to notice the addition of an extra leg on Witherspoon in the photo, but it appears that this was just a result of the way that her nude colored dress fell. Winfrey however was actually given a third hand in what can only be described as a classic photoshop fail. Both stars were very lighthearted about it and jokingly tweeted about their third limbs. Vanity Fair also issued a statement and made an adjustment to the images restoring Winfrey back to having two hands.
The cover also features Tom Hanks (one of the few scandal-free men left in Hollywood), Nicole Kidman, Jessica Chastain, Zendaya, and more. Many of the actors adorned nude and black attire with the exception of Chastain, who seemed to be the focal point of the image in a red ball gown. I’m not exactly sure what the significance of this is, but it certainly made for a pretty nice picture.
In tune with the rest of Hollywood, Vanity Fair digitally removed James Franco from the cover shot a few weeks ago before news of his allegations were brought to light. A statement from the magazine was released saying “We made a decision not to include James Franco on the Hollywood cover once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him.” Franco has also been shut out of Oscar nominations for The Disaster Artist despite winning the Golden Globe for best actor just a few short weeks ago. The actor was even bold enough to wear a Time’s Up pin to the awards, which quickly led his accusers to come forward and call him out for it.
Franco reportedly knew he would be cut as soon as news of his sexual assaults surfaced. After appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers, he stated that “he wants to fix it” if he’s done something wrong, but did not apologize to his accusers. He doesn’t seem remorseful for his actions but more so just sorry that he got caught with a very “tail between his legs” mentality. Being removed from the Vanity Fair cover was a small price to pay in comparison to what his accusers felt.
Despite shutting out The Disaster Artist, the Oscars made room for the racially insensitive Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri, showing they can only really focus on one issue at a time. Last year it was #OscarsSoWhite, and they calmed us down by giving Moonlight the Oscar. With all the focus on sexual assault, the Academy seemed to think we would forget about the other issues and look the other way as Three Billboards slid its way into the best picture category, despite the movie sympathizing with a racist cop. Hollywood isn’t perfect, this we know, but it would be nice if they continued forward with progression instead of taking one step forward and two steps back.

As technological growth in the 21st century continues its exponential climb, data and the internet weave themselves into the fabric of society in seemingly irreversible ways. Data privacy, or how data is distributed and collected in relation to the public, has been a growing concern of most internet users due to unprecedented technological progress. Each year since 2014, this particular issue is brought to light here at Carnegie Mellon University in observance of International Data Privacy Day.
Dr. Lorrie Faith Cranor, an organizer of the event, said in an email to The Tartan that “privacy loss tends to sneak up on people,” and she hopes that the event helps “educate people about these issues and show them some tools they can use to protect themselves.”
This event, which also sought to publicize Carnegie Mellon’s innovative Privacy Engineering Master’s program, was an open, public showcase of the great research being done at Carnegie Mellon and how it can apply to our lives. Graduate and doctoral students presented their research in and around the Connan Room of the Cohon Center, on topics from cybersecurity information sharing, to health app privacy concerns.
There was much emphasis on general privacy in the “internet of things,” or the network of all manifestations of the internet: including smartphones, computers, software, sensors, and everything’s network connectivity. One of the presenters was Daniel Smullen, a PhD student in Software Engineering, who noted that “we don’t have implicit rights to privacy in the internet of things.” Because of this lack of implicit privacy, he and other researchers have spent the last few years developing a personal “privacy assistant” website and app that alerts users of the various data collection techniques we are subjected to daily, from wifi routers, to facial recognition cameras, to location tracking.
Such presentations on research findings were prevalent, but in addition, booths were set up to educate the Carnegie Mellon community on how to protect their own privacy. One booth allowed people to type in a password they frequently use and test how strong it actually is. Another handed out flyers about how to avoid privacy intrusions on Facebook or Snapchat. One taught how to opt out of targeted advertising that operates by tracking your actions on the internet and selling your data.
Dr. Cranor believes that “most people care about their privacy and want to protect it, but a lot of people don’t know what they can actually do to protect their privacy.” The educational exercises in the Connan Room were aimed at allowing those who want to protect their data to gain the knowledge to do so.
The research and presentations suggested that the movement for data privacy, comprised of top academics and researchers as well as ordinary internet users, is only going to continue to grow in the wake of the general public’s realization that the internet isn’t as private as they might expect. 
The issue of privacy in the ‘internet of things’ is an issue that is relevant to almost all of the three billion people that currently have access to the internet. Events like International Data Privacy Day bring together academic institutions, companies, governments, and the general public to create a fruitful conversation on an impactful and topical issue.
At Carnegie Mellon, it was no different. That being said, if you were not able to attend, or happened to miss the many bubbling graduate students donning “Privacy Matters” shirts in the Cohon Center, there is access to many of the resources presented at the event at the Carnegie Mellon University Privacy Day website, located at http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/privacy-day/2018/. Many of the presentations and educational resources are archived and available.
As a school that exports so much innovation and educates many future creators of technology, Carnegie Mellon University also has a responsibility to also educate people on the ethical implications of certain privacy-infringing technologies.
With important events like Data Privacy Day happening on campus, new research being conducted and presented to understand the breadth of the issue, and more programs like the Master’s in Privacy Engineering that is being  offered at the School of Computer Science, it is hard not to feel more hopeful about the future of data privacy research and awareness.

Last Monday afternoon, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that Pennsylvania’s congressional district map, which was approved in 2011, violates Pennsylvania’s state constitution. In this case, a group of Pennsylvanians, including the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania, has sued the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania claiming that the map was created by Republicans to stifle the voice of Pennsylvania Democrats in an attempt that “strikes at the foundation of representative democracy.”
The petitioners argued that the congressional map employs the gerrymandering methods of “packing” and “cracking,” meaning that the map was seemingly drawn to pack Democratic voters into just a few districts while cracking the rest of the Democratic electorate into pieces throughout the remaining districts. Critics claim that this map deprives Democratic voters of their voting power. In the last seven years since the passage of this map, Republicans have consistently held 13 of the 18 congressional districts of Pennsylvania even when Democratic candidates won a majority of votes statewide.
As part of the testimony, petitioners called Carnegie Mellon professor Wesley Pegden to testify that the map had a partisan bias. Pegden has created an algorithm that can test whether a districting map has been created with partisan intent. In order to test a map, the algorithm takes the map in question and makes random small changes to it. Then the algorithm checks whether these changes affected the map’s partisan bias. One can then determine using probabilities whether a map has been rigged along party lines. Pegden showed that when the Pennsylvania congressional district map was plugged into the algorithm, making small changes almost always made the map more competitive. The court used Pegden’s algorithm as evidence that the map had been created to be purposefully uncompetitive.
Although the map has received significant opposition, Republicans still stand by it. Steve Miskin, a spokesman for Republicans in the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives said in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, “Some cynics might question the timing, after three elections of not saying a word about these maps.” In response to this doubt, David Gersch, a lawyer for the petitioners explained that the suit was not filed until now so that there would be enough real evidence of the effects of the map on elections. Drew Crompton, the general counsel to Republicans in the Pennsylvania State Senate, also defended the map, calling the suit “baseless” in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and pointing out that 36 Pennsylvania House Democrats had voted for the map.
On Jan. 23, the day after the Pennsylvania court’s decision, a group of Republicans from the Pennsylvania State House and Senate applied for the court to grant a stay on their order, meaning that the ruling wouldn’t go into effect until after the 2018 congressional elections. The court denied this application two days later.
Historically, courts have hesitated to rule in political cases, claiming that politics exists in the legislative domain. Baker v. Carr in 1962 was the first Supreme Court case to step into the “political thicket” and rule against a redistricting practice. In general, courts have found racial gerrymandering to be unconstitutional but not partisan gerrymandering, largely because it has been difficult to measure partisan affiliation because, unlike race, a voter could potentially change political parties from one election to another out of no fault of a district map. Consequently, in U.S. Supreme Court cases in 1986, 2004, and 2006, justices called partisan gerrymandering “illegitimate, seriously harmful, incompatible with democratic principles and ‘manipulation of the electorate,’” but did not rule against the practice because it was difficult to draw the line between political and unconstitutional.
This Pennsylvania case is one of a number of cases of alleged Republican gerrymandering of state congressional district maps. The Republican strategy in 2010 was to take control of state legislatures so that the party could control the redistricting efforts across the country after the 2010 census. With the 2018 congressional elections looming, many of these maps are being taken to court. Most notable is Gill v. Whitford in Wisconsin, which has made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme court. One dissenting justice in the Pennsylvania case argued in his dissent that Pennsylvania should hold off on changing its congressional map until after a ruling is decided in the national case. However the Supreme Court rules in Gill v. Whitford, the Pennsylvania ruling means that the state will get a new district map. Experts say that if the court rules against gerrymandering in this national case, up to 20 states will be required to join Pennsylvania in throwing out their congressional maps too.

When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last Sept., much of the island’s infrastructure was devastated. This month saw a renewed effort by groups at Carnegie Mellon to provide relief after the tragedy. In mid-Jan., nearly four months after the hurricane, there were pictures posted to Twitter of families with children still living in tents. According to the website status.pr, which chronicles statistics on various aspects of the island’s recovery, power generation is at 83 percent as of Friday, Jan. 26, while 69 percent of the island has electricity. CBS News correspondent David Begnaud pointed out in his near-daily status update on Puerto Rico, via his Twitter, that about 450,000 islanders remain without power.
The infrastructural devastation included damage to the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM), located in Mayaguez, a city on the western coast of the island. As part of the wave of efforts by the Carnegie Mellon community to lend a hand to Puerto Rico, the university shipped 342 arm-table classroom chairs to UPRM, which are expected to arrive this month.
UPRM was chosen in part because Carnegie Mellon’s College of Engineering’s leadership had connections there. A group from the College of Engineering had visited UPRM in the summer of 2016 and met with colleagues there to discuss possible collaborations, according to Dean James Garrett, Jr. of the College of Engineering, in an interview with The Tartan. “Shortly after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, I reached out to [Genock Portela, a professor and executive assistant at UPRM]. . .to ask him how we could be most helpful to them here at [Carnegie Mellon],” recalled Garrett.
Garrett was then given what he termed an “extensive list” of equipment that UPRM needed to get itself back on its feet, which included desks and chairs to replace those damaged by the storm. 
“I contacted my colleagues Ramayya Krishnan in the Heinz College, Heinz Associate Dean Ann English, and Don Coffelt, Associate Vice President for Facilities Management and Campus Services and [Civil and Environmental Engineering] faculty member, about this list to determine what we might be able to send them,” Garrett said, about the process in the interview. “We recognized that they needed desks and tables since they were damaged in the hurricane. We then realized that because we are renovating our classrooms, we have desks and tables we could donate to them.”
Coffelt then enlisted the help of the organization Brother’s Brother to help them transport the school furniture to UPRM.
“[Brother’s Brother Foundation’s] specialty is logistics — getting things from people who have it to people who need it, efficiently and at a low cost,” said Coffelt in a university press release.
On Jan. 10, the chairs were packed and shipped to New Jersey, where they were put on a ship to the island, according to the press release. In an emailed statement to The Tartan, UPRM’s Portela said that he was expecting the shipment of chairs within a few days.
The praise between Brother’s Brother and Carnegie Mellon goes both ways. Luke Hingson, the foundation’s president, told the university that “[i]t was easy for [the foundation] to say yes to this project because of the quality of the partners involved on the giving side and the receiving side.”
This is not the only time Brother’s Brother has assisted in a Carnegie Mellon effort to help Puerto Rico. The foundation was also involved in helping Rosana Guernica, a junior at Carnegie Mellon who crowdfunded charter planes to deliver supplies to Puerto Rico and evacuate islanders who were in need of medical treatments not available post-hurricane, as well as their families. The Tartan reported on this effort last semester.
In a press release, Garrett was heartened by the teamwork involved the chair donation effort. “It was truly a collaborative effort that epitomizes what we do here at [Carnegie Mellon].”

Just over a year ago, Donald Trump officially became the 45th President of the United States. Since then, America has witnessed a president unlike any other. A reality star who “spoke his mind,” who seemed to be unafraid of hitting the “tweet” button, would soon “have a nuclear button” that he proudly admitted “works.” A man without any prior political experience had defied all odds, going against polls and predictions. Regardless of the results from the general election, the free world saw a new chapter in its history thanks to its new leader.
Trump made his objectives of his presidency clear since the campaign, best summarized by his iconic slogan “Make America Great Again:” putting “America first.” To help fulfill the goals of his first term, Trump released his "Contract with the American Voter" in which he set up tasks for his first 100 days in office. He may not have been able to check off every box on his list, but he made significant strides towards establishing “law and order,” protecting American workers, and “draining the swamp” in Washington. As of today, he has signed nearly sixty executive orders, more than any preceding president had this far in his respective presidency.
There have been immediate and positive results from the Trump administration. The stock market continues to go up, and a sample of economists selected by The Wall Street Journal almost unanimously reported that job creation and gross domestic product growth may be due to Trump's small-government approach. However, these results cannot override the tumultuousness of the administration.
Trump may have been praised by some economists for his tax cut plan, but he is still far from being traditionally conservative. Trade, often supported by small-government ideals, was now a topic targeted by conservative criticism. Trump broke the old tradition of conservatism by pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) altogether, just as he promised during his campaign. He is continuing this trend by seeking negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), if not a termination of the United States' involvement altogether. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demonstrated confidence in the deal, aiming to exemplify NAFTA's benefits to the Canadian economy to "show [to] our neighbor to the south." Trump's Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue, shows confidence that Trump will not completely pull out of NAFTA due to the fact that ending a trade agreement with Canada, the U.S.'s largest trade partner, would have significant consequences and wipe out jobs. However, it is uncertain that he will not ultimately decide to end trade deals in an attempt to create more domestic jobs.
The TPP and NAFTA are not the only trade agreements that Trump has been wrestling with. To attack the U.S. trade deficit, Trump turned to Korea and threatened to end the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement  (KORUS FTA) despite the fact that Korea, as of 2017, contributes $21 billion out of the $724 billion total trade deficit, which amounts to not even three percent of the total trade deficit, thus taking away jobs created by Korean plants in the U.S. For instance, Hyundai's contribution in Alabama and Kia's in Georgia would both be negatively impacted by the withdrawal of the KORUS FTA but may not be able to generate the domestic jobs that Trump has promised to compensate for the damage. However, as President Moon Jae-In and Trump are in talks of renegotiating the KORUS FTA, we may successfully avert a possible economic damage.
Perhaps his most memorable campaign promise was building the wall and "have Mexico pay for it." However, construction remains stalled to this day. Although he seems to be hard-set on the wall, which has been suggested to be both economically demanding and possibly ineffective, Trump is willing to compromise by offering citizenship for dreamers so that his wall can be built. This has received criticism from some on the left; Senator Kamala Harris noted that Trump was quick to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) but also quick to provide citizenship for dreamers in exchange for a border wall. However, prominent voices of the right, such as former congressman Joe Walsh, also showed disappointment in Trump's plan for compromise. Like a significant portion of other supporters of the wall, Walsh wanted the wall to be built at the expense of Mexico, not at the expense of providing "a pathway for providing citizenship" for undocumented immigrants. This compromise, he argues, is "not what [Trump] said during the campaign."
Politics has never been a topic in which clean and clear solutions are made; the saying "never discuss politics or religion in polite company" has existed for as long as it has for a reason. However, given Trump's disapproval rating is below 40 percent — low for a president in office for a relatively short amount of time — it is clear that the trend of a more distinct clash between political ideologies burgeoning is continuing.
The day after election night, one sentiment was widely spread: "give Donald Trump a chance." Although there's still a good three-quarter of his first term left, we have now been given a peek at what is to come.

Imagine you are sitting in Spanish class, and the teacher plays “Despacito” over the speakers. The students chatter amongst themselves. They say, “Wow, that’s a great song!” and “I wonder what it all means!”
Following the musical introduction, the teacher launches into a lesson built around the vocabulary, grammar, and cultural references in the hit song. Throughout the class, students are engaged and eager to learn, because they understand why the subject material is important and relevant to the real world. In particular, they are motivated by the desire to better appreciate Luis Fonsi’s hit single featuring Daddy Yankee the next time they listen to it.
Alternatively, imagine you are sitting in a different Spanish class, where the instructor starts by handing out a long list of vocabulary and grammatical concepts. The lesson begins by going through the vocabulary and explaining the grammar, delving into the etymological roots of words and various irregular verb conjugations.
Students are half asleep, unsure why any of this is important or worth paying attention to, longing for the end of the class period. Later in the lesson, the instructor might even play “Despacito,” and while the students are pleasantly surprised to hear the song, the class time was largely wasted because the students were not engaged enough throughout the lesson to understand the song lyrics at the end.
Most would likely agree that the first Spanish class, with concrete examples presented from the start and abstract ideas explained later, is the better way to go. Yet again and again, explanations start with abstract ideas and only at the end progress to the interesting applications of those ideas.
This mistake is made so many times, because, in the mind of the explainer, starting from abstract ideas is the most intuitive approach. In the head of a fluent Spanish speaker, the most fundamental core concepts are vocabulary and grammar, while on the outskirts of the web of knowledge are example applications of the core concepts like songs and stories. So, unfortunately, this is how topics are often taught.
But, consciously making an effort to change this could greatly improve student engagement and learning. Starting with interesting, real-world applications of a topic signals to students that the broader, more boring, abstract explanations are worth suffering through and staying engaged with because of the great opportunities of applying what you learn. Yes, students might not grasp all the inner workings of the application at first, but that is okay so long as they are motivated to continue learning.
Notice that this opinion piece began by launching straight into a concrete example, and only after appreciating the story does the reader get the abstract explanation about pedagogy. Maybe readers would never even reach this point in the article if the reverse were true and the article began with a discussion of abstract-first versus concrete-first explanations, saving the example of listening to “Despacito” in Spanish class for the end.
So next time you are teaching, TA-ing, or even just explaining something to your friend, remember to start with the interesting, concrete example and only after that delve into the fundamental ideas underlying it.
Inspiration for this opinion piece comes from the education podcast Ben, Ben, and Blue.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s recent 4-3 ruling which struck down the egregiously gerrymandered congressional map serves as an important example and precedent for an issue that is already being argued in the U.S. Supreme Court. The map in question skewed so far to favor Republicans that it was ruled unconstitutional in the recent Pennsylvania decision. With multiple gerrymandering cases now reaching the U.S. Supreme Court, this case stands as an important example of potential for major change. That change might just be a national ruling that could be used to dismantle numerous gerrymandered congressional maps across the country, most of which favor Republicans.
In a last ditch effort, top Pennsylvania Republicans are now calling for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their case. It is worth noting that the Court has already heard arguments in one case related to gerrymandering this term, and are waiting to hear arguments on another. With this in mind, hearing the Pennsylvania case might be redundant, but there is an important detail to bear in mind: while the Court heard their first gerrymandering case of this term months ago, they have yet to hold a vote to reach a decision. If the Court is hesitant to reach a national gerrymandering decision—as its impact could be widespread and alter the outcomes of numerous future elections—they might hesitate to give a ruling in the next case they hear. If so, the Pennsylvania case could prove to be very important. Especially given the strong ruling issued by the state Supreme Court, the national court would have to either accept this strong partisan gerrymandering ruling or completely strike it down. Striking the state ruling down would be a more daunting task that the federal justices would no doubt hesitate to undertake. As it currently stands, the national decision will likely come down to Justice Kennedy, as the other justices will likely split 4-4 along partisan lines, a rather disturbing fact for our democracy.
Gerrymandering is an effort almost exclusively undertaken by Republicans for Republicans as they desperately hold on to an electorate that is growing younger and more and more displeased with modern conservative governance. It is impossible to ignore the context given here by our political climate. With many political analysts saying that a blue wave of Democratic congressional victories is coming, Republicans are undoubtedly terrified. They have passed an extremely unpopular piece of legislation in the recent tax bill, whose short term benefits for working and middle class families will disappear in a decade whilst permanently benefiting corporations and the wealthy. The pace at which they have been trying to ram through this legislation is suggestive of the sense of urgency Republicans feel. They know their agenda is unpopular and dated, and could easily be torn apart by this November.
So, with a crucial election on the horizon, it is unsurprising that the party of guns and our racist president will seek any electoral advantage it can obtain. They will seek it by any means necessary. A strong national partisan gerrymandering ruling would permanently alter the electoral reality of the United States. The effect it would have would be good for democracy and bad for Republicans. This fits a pattern of modern American politics: Democracy and the GOP often stand at odds. Whether it be shocking attempts to shield President Trump from the Mueller probe, or disgraceful inaction in response to mass killings by white gunmen, the Republicans know no shame. So, why not soil the U.S. Supreme Court too? The only way Republicans hold onto power is if they keep winning elections, and it will be much easier for them to do that if blatantly partisan congressional maps are allowed to continue to exist and to continue to be gerrymandered in favor of Republicans. America is changing. What it means to be an American is changing. It always has been, and it will continue to do so. Perhaps, then, it is not surprising the party of “Make America Great Again” seeks to perpetuate undemocratic elections to continue defiling democracy.

Much like how voters rarely glance below the top tickets on the ballot, students often don’t take time to glance below the tuition, housing, and meal costs on their Carnegie Mellon bill. If they did, they would notice the largest fee that they have to pay to attend Carnegie Mellon is the activities fee, at a cool $129/semester for undergraduates and $107 for graduates this academic year.
As its name suggests, this is the fee that funds most of the student organizations on campus. However, for such a significant fee, it is determined based on an outdated model, which itself is largely arbitrary.
Since at least the 2014-15 academic year, when the undergraduate activities fee was $123 and the graduate fee $101, the fee has changed by $2 for both groups every single year. There is no science behind this, no rationale, only a self-perpetuating cycle of constant $2 increases.
Next year’s fee of $131 for undergraduates and $108 for graduates seems like it has some science behind it, indexed as it is to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of inflation meant to measure changes in standard of living. However, students’ travel and pizza costs—the primary uses for the activities fee funds—are barely measured by the CPI. As a result, while this inflation measure might work well for economists, it is useless for our purposes.
The lack of thought that has historically gone into determining the fee each year is not only remarkable—over $2 million are on the line annually—it is also detrimental for students’ experiences at Carnegie Mellon.
This is because the university is consistently failing to meet students’ financial demands for their extracurricular activities. Between the 2009-10 and 2014-15 years, the amount of funds requested from the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), the group of students charged with allocating the activities fee to each student organization on campus, increased 36.26 percent. Over these same five years, the amount the JFC recommended increased by a roughly commensurate 36.06 percent.
However, between 2014-15 and 2017-18, the requested amount increased by a further 35.97 percent, but the recommended amount only increased 17.86 percent. While students are requesting 7.98 percent more money each year, the JFC is only recommending 4.19 percent more. This has caused the gap between the requested and recommended amounts to go from less than $600,000 in 2014-15 to over $1 million this year.
Clearly then, demand for the students’ activities funds has been rising, but supply has not. The increase in demand is likely due to the greater number of student organizations on campus (255 organizations applied for JFC funding for this academic year as opposed to the 221 applying for 2014-15) and that each organization is attending or hosting more events and thus spending more money.
The solution to this underfunding problem starts with amending the way the student activities fee is determined. Instead of deciding upon an arbitrary increase, the Student Body Vice President of Finance (SBVPF) should study the changes in the costs Carnegie Mellon organizations incur.
One way to do this would be by looking at line items an organization has had for the past three years and tracking the change in costs for those line items. Taking a random sample of such line items across all organizations would create a measure which the activities fee increase could be indexed to. This would thus more accurately reflect increases in student organizations’ costs than a frivolous $2 increase.
A cruder but easier-to-implement method would first take the average annual percentage increase in the requested amount of funds between the last four years, weighted to emphasize increases in the most recent years. Then, the resulting percentage is the proportional increase we want to see in the JFC’s recommended amount that year. It is straightforward to back-calculate the activities fee from that figure.
These empirical approaches would likely lead to a higher activities fee if implemented without other changes, at least in the short term while Carnegie Mellon continues adding more organizations and existing organizations discover new outlets that require funding. 
Since these causes are likely temporary, they can be resolved by tapping into JFC’s reserves. The reserves exist precisely for this kind of ephemeral rise in demand and should be used to ensure that student organizations get the money they need at low cost to the overall student body. Furthermore, organizations usually tend to spend less than their entire budget each year, which means that even after drawing from the reserves, we will not deplete it significantly for future years.
Second, the university needs to better support student organizations looking for outside sponsorships. While the university has great relationships with corporations, institutions, and alumni that it leverages when it comes to funding new buildings or research, the university should better extend those relationships to help students secure funding for their organizations.
Many students either don’t know that such sponsorships are feasible options or lack the contacts to make them happen. The university can improve this state of affairs by better communicating how organizations can acquire outside funding, provide more extensive training on how to do so at events like the Tartan Leader Conference, and be willing to use their relevant contacts for organizations’ benefit rather than just for the administration’s initiatives.
If more organizations can secure outside funding, it will reduce the pressure on student activities fees to cover all the costs while teaching students practical skills on marketing an idea and making deals in their efforts to get sponsors. Thus, we can progress toward achieving two of the university’s goals: a better experience for students and one that is at the same time financially accessible to all.
While the administration executes this plan, students need to rely on one another to identify ways to cut costs. After reviewing hundreds of organizations’ applications, the JFC will surely find, as I have, that some organizations spend far less on the very same events or similar line items that other organizations end up spending more on.
The JFC and mid-year funding sources, then, should identify organizations that spend an unusually low amount per person on certain costs, ask them how they managed to cut costs and spread that knowledge to other organizations so they, too, can take advantage of the cost-saving methods employed by the first organization. This will allow student organizations to do everything they want to, just at a lower cost, again saving money that can be used for other activities.
Lastly, the ratio between the activities fee charged to undergraduates and graduates is also whimsical. The lower fees the graduate students pay is compounded by the fact that 70 percent of their fees go directly to the Graduate Student Assembly while only 10 percent of the undergraduates’ fees go to the Undergraduate Student Senate. The remainder of both go to the JFC.
Such a distribution makes sense if 76.4 percent of the funds that JFC allocates goes to undergraduates and the remainder to graduate students. If the proportion is more, then graduate students are relatively over-paying while if it is less, undergraduates are funding graduates’ activities.
To resolve this potential discrepancy, the SBVPF could track the ratio of undergraduates to graduates in each organization, then use that to estimate how much money was given to undergraduate students and how much to graduate students. He or she can then prepare a proposal for the activities fee that splits the costs between the two fairly. Note that this will not affect how much funding any organization receives—only the split between how much undergraduate and graduate students pay as part of the activities fee.
Logistically, this can be done by asking each organization how many of its members are undergraduates and how many are graduates and basing the estimates on those numbers. However, it might be difficult to parse out the benefit an organization provides from the composition of its members. For example, even if AB Films mostly has undergraduates, graduate students certainly benefit from the movies it plays. 
An alternative method would then be for the Undergraduate Student Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, and SBVPF to devise a ratio that they think accurately represents the breakdown in spending between undergraduates and graduates. This ratio can then be used to identify what the ratio between the two’s activities fee should be. The Student Government bylaws imply that this ratio should be based on 70 percent of the activities fee being spent on undergraduates and 30 percent on graduates. But this figure can be easily amended if the student government finds it necessary, such as to the current rate of 76.4 percent.
The student activities fee and university support for external funding have not kept pace with the rising demand to use those funds from student organizations. If we are serious about improving everyone’s experience at Carnegie Mellon at an affordable price, we must reform how we determine the activities fee, use the JFC reserve for the next few years, encourage and help student leaders gain outside scholarships and grants for their organizations, and implement a system whereby organizations can share with each other how to cut their costs. 
These changes will make disbursement of the activities fee fairer and more effective for everyone. Students’ involvement in extracurriculars has always been a source of pride for Carnegie Mellon. It’s time we worked to financially support the unprecedented demand for extracurricular involvement we are now seeing.

The national and public conversation about sexual harassment started for many with a New York Times notification on their phone that linked to a story, written by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, that detailed instances of abuse and sexual misconduct at the hand of powerful producer Harvey Weinstein. Much of the public conversation has been built on the backs of powerful reporting done by hardworking journalists and the testimony of brave men and women that fuel these stories. 
But journalistic institutions have not always pursued such reporting as avidly as they perhaps ought to, sometimes in the interest of not wanting to make powerful enemies, or shying away from stories they deem as too controversial. Notably, NBC passed on Trump’s “pussy” tape, which eventually was published by Access Hollywood. Months later, they passed again on Weinstein story though it was brought to them by their own contributor, Ronan Farrow, and, according to Farrow in an interview with MSNBC, there had been “multiple determinations that it was reportable.”
Additionally, focus in coverage has leaned toward celebrities accused of sexual harassment. Many of the actors wearing black and Time’s Up pins at the Golden Globes had either worked with people being accused of sexual harassment or had faced sexual harassment allegations themselves. An abstract commitment by public figures to end a culture that they themselves are perpetrating does little to affect the actual systemic issues at play. The Time’s Up organization itself, and many of the actors involved, were careful to make it clear that the problem did not begin and end with Hollywood, with activists such as Monica Ramirez, who works to defend the rights of migrant workers, Tarana Burke, activist for women of color and founder of the #MeToo movement, and Marai Larasi, who works to combat gender-based violence, brought as dates by actors affiliated with the organization. 
Though much of the public attention has centered around stories that involve the rich and famous, some of the most powerful reporting that this movement has spawned has focused on the pervasive problem of harassment and sexual assault that touches workers on the factory floor at Ford or in the hospitality industry or in public housing. Though these stories may have received less attention, they highlight the potential of good journalism to expose issues that may be harder to cover because they are systemic, or affect people with less of a societal voice. 
Sometimes, there is question about whether stories should be covered at all, markedly, the babe.net story about a questionable sexual encounter involving actor and comedian Aziz Ansari. One of the most outspoken critics was The New York Times staff editor Bari Weiss, who, in an opinion piece, called the article “arguably the worst thing that has happened to the #MeToo movement.”
Arguably the worst thing that could happen to the #MeToo movement would be to stifle the coverage that has prompted so much reevaluation on a societal scale. It is possible to argue that reactions may not always be proportional, or that the movement, like most that happen on such a large scale, may lack some nuance, but recent examples have seemed not to have borne this theory out. Consequences have differed depending on what is alleged, and have ranged from mild public shaming to legal moves. Moreover, refusing the public the chance to even be allowed to dissect and classify these instances does them a disservice. The role of journalism in this movement is to place well reported newsworthy stories in the public forum while keeping a commitment to high-quality reporting. 
At the sentencing this past week of Larry Nassar, doctor and pedophile, Assistant Attorney General Angela Povialitis claimed that without a 2016 story in the Indianapolis Star, and the courage that it took for survivor Rachael Denhollander to contact them, Nassar would still be working as a doctor. Stated Povialitis, "what finally started this reckoning and ended this decades-long cycle of abuse was investigative reporting." Such is the power of diligent reporting at this moment.
