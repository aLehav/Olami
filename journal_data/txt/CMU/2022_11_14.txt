Last week, the college football gods gave us a maelstrom of confusing results, shocking upsets, and left us with a collection of about five teams with good cases for the top three and about seven teams with a good case for the top ten. But of course, there can only be three top-three teams, and there must be ten top-ten teams. Heading into the final stretch of the season, this week provided some clarity.
Our rankings for this week:
With only two weeks to go in the season, conference championships and playoffs are at the top of everyone’s minds. So let’s break things down by conference.
Southeastern Conference
The situation in the SEC East is simple. Georgia is 10-0, with a 7-0 conference record, which will probably improve to 9-0 by the end of the season. Tennessee, despite a very good year, will likely fall short — even if Georgia were to drop a game, Tennessee, who can boast a 6-1 conference record, would still lose the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bulldogs after Georgia roundly beat them last week. This means that the SEC East title is likely settled — unless Georgia loses both of their next two games, they will win the division. Similarly, in the West, Louisiana State has a one game edge — and head-to-head tiebreaker — against Ole Miss and Alabama, virtually guaranteeing them the division crown.
Yet, the playoff picture from the SEC looks murkier. If Georgia and LSU meet in the title game, Georgia would probably punch their ticket with a win. But if LSU, who has two losses (one in-conference and one non-conference), were to win, there could still be a case for 12-1 Georgia’s inclusion in the playoff at the expense of 11-2 LSU. There would be precedent for that: In 2016, the playoff committee left 11-2 Big Ten champions Penn State out of the playoff in favor of Ohio State, whose one loss came at the hands of the Nittany Lions. Such a move would be hard to justify, but we’ll have to wait and see what happens.
Big Ten
The Big Ten picture is much clearer than the SEC. Purdue currently leads the Big Ten West, but just two teams in the division have winning conference records, and the whole division has at least three losses. Whoever wins the division figures to be throttled in the championship game, and if they somehow were to win, no team from the Big Ten West has a chance to make the playoffs anyway.
But in the Big Ten East, Ohio State and Michigan are both 10-0, and the biggest remaining game of the college football regular season will be their annual meeting in Columbus on Nov. 27. The winner of that game is mathematically guaranteed to win the Big Ten East and, with a weak opponent in the West, will probably win the conference. For that reason, Michigan at Ohio State is, much like last year, considered to be a de facto playoff game.
The only remaining question is whether the loser will make it in, too. Last year, Michigan won and Ohio State was left out, but in that case, both teams had already sustained a loss, meaning that there wasn’t much of a chance for a two-loss Ohio State to make it in. This year, the loser will likely only have one loss, making the case for inclusion strong for them, too - depending on what happens in other conferences.
Big 12
The Big 12 is, this year, perhaps the weirdest conference in college football. The first and second place teams in the conference will meet in the championship, and while TCU has sealed the first spot, no less than five of the conference’s nine other teams still have a chance to win the second. If TCU wins, they will likely be undefeated, and there will be little case to leave an undefeated conference champion out of the playoff. But if one of the other teams wins, TCU, who has yet to face a difficult opponent all year, will likely, although not certainly, be left out. And the winner, who would have sustained at least three losses (as all non-TCU Big 12 teams have), would be out too.
ACC
The ACC has the dubious honor of having no teams in the top ten, and it’s unlikely that any team from the conference will make the playoffs. Clemson, undefeated until last week, had a shot, but they were rolled over by Notre Dame, likely ending their hopes. They have sealed the Atlantic division, though, and will play for the ACC title. The Coastal division is not yet decided, but North Carolina looks likely to win it.
Pac-12
The Pac-12 is the last conference which has a chance to send a team to the playoff, and it has three — Oregon, USC, and UCLA— who are all playing strong football. Each of the three has just one conference loss, but Oregon has a disadvantage, as it suffered an additional non-confrence loss (a blowout to Georgia in Week 1). The top two teams will meet in the conference championship, and the winner of that game will have a very good playoff chance. Pay particular attention to USC’s game against UCLA next week. The loser will be down at two losses, while the winner stands a very good chance at a playoff berth if they win the championship.

The Major League Baseball season came to an end on Saturday, Nov. 5th as the Houston Astros defeated the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of 4-1. A great World Series capped off a terrific postseason that was different from any other postseason in history. For the first time, six teams from each league were allowed into the postseason, so we had more games, rounds, and teams than ever before. This October certainly proved how unpredictable playoff baseball can be. 
The World Series went a total of six games. The Phillies came in as a heavy underdog according to Vegas odds and in the minds of most fans outside Philadelphia. Philly came back after being down 5-0 in Game 1 with five runs off future Hall-of-Famer Justin Verlander and a JT Realmuto home run in the 10th inning. Houston dominated Game 2 with five runs off Phillies ace Zach Wheeler and a superb start by Framber Valdez. 
The series moved to Philadelphia with a 1-1 split in the series. Philadelphia had its first World Series game since 2009 and they delivered with five home runs to win 7-0. Philadelphia had the advantage once again in the series with two more games in Philly. Unfortunately, the Astros would win the next three games to win the Fall Classic. Game 4 was dominated by the Astros as the Phillies could not come up with a hit. Game 5 was an extremely close game where every out mattered. Chas McCormick made a spectacular catch in centerfield as he caught a ball that was sure to bounce off the wall and put the tying run on base in the ninth. 
The Series returned back to Houston with the Astros needing just one win at home. Houston only needed one game to do so as they won the final match 4-1. Framber Valdez had another elite start and the bullpen dominated (a bullpen consists of a team’s relievers or the pitching staff that does not start games). Yordan Alvarez hit a monster three-run shot 450 feet to dead center field to give the Astros the lead. That was all the bullpen needed as Pressly came in to shut the door and clinch the championship. 
The dominance of the Houston Astros in this postseason can not be overstated. This team came in with the highest fangraphs odds of winning the championship at 17.5 percent and they absolutely delivered. Their record in the playoffs was a cool 11-2 as they swept both the Mariners and Yankees; eventually taking down the Phillies in six games. Their bullpen was historically good, boasting a 0.83 Earned Run Average (ERA) over 54.1 innings. This was the lowest bullpen ERA ever for a bullpen that threw more than 40 innings. Ryan Pressly was an all-world closer with a number of other elite bullpen arms. They also set records for lowest walks and hits per inning (WHIP), opponents' batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage.
Their offense came up in big moments and they consistently hit off their opponent’s big time pitchers. Yordan Alvarez had three separate home runs that would give his team the lead and eventually the win. One of those was a three-run walk-off homer that was shot into the second deck of Houston to steal Game 1 from the Mariners in Houston. Rookie shortstop Jeremy Peña won both ALCS MVP and World Series MVP, which makes him the first rookie position player to do so. He had an incredible postseason slash line of .345/.367/1.005 after a decent regular season. They also had starting pitchers such as as Framber Valdez, Cristian Javier, and Justin Verlander step up to help the Astros win some huge games. 
It also cannot be forgotten that Cristian Javier threw six no-hit innings in Game 4, which kickstarted the Astros' combined no-hitter in Philadelphia. This was only the third no-hitter in postseason history and it was a huge momentum swing for the Astros. Houston has been shrouded in the cheating scandal of 2017 since it was revealed. It seems some of those demons have now been settled with this new championship cementing them as a dynasty. They have been to six straight American League Championship Series and four World Series in the last six years. It is also hard not to root for Dusty Baker and Trey Mancini. Dusty Baker is a very well-respected person in the baseball world as a long-time manager who finally gets his World Series title. Trey Mancini heroically beat cancer just a few years ago and he is now a World Series champion. The Astros will never be viewed the same until all the players from that 2017 season are gone, but you have to respect their consistent dominance as an organization. In a postseason full of upsets, they stood strong and dominated the competition. 
The team on the other side of the World Series was the Philadelphia Phillies. While the Astros won 106 games and were the number one seed of the American League, the Phillies only won 89 games and were the sixth seed of the National League. Their improbable run started on the road in St. Louis. They were down 2-0 to the Cardinals in the top of the ninth when they sparked a six-run inning to take the lead. From there on, they did not look back as they beat the Cardinals, 101-win Braves, and the Padres in five games. The Phillies went 7-0 at home until Game 4 of the World Series as the raucous Philly crowd roared during the big moments. Philadelphia was especially hungry as they held the longest postseason drought in the National League. 
The Phillies had a different formula to get to the Fall Classic. Their offense went ballistic in the playoffs as they mashed homers left and right. Led by the $330 million man, Bryce Harper, who slugged a number of big-time homers. Kyle Schwarber continued his career postseason success with six home runs and a 488 foot missile deep into the night of San Diego. Zach Wheeler, Aaron Nola, and Ranger Suarez were elite starters while Zach Eflin, Seranthony Dominguez, and Jose Alvarado were key out of the bullpen. Their bullpen had a poor reputation in the past, but was a strong suit in the postseason. 
Philadelphia being in the World Series wasn’t predicted by many, including myself. I included them on my lowest tier of playoff teams, as I said they could only make a splash. I also stated this about the San Diego Padres who then made it to the NLCS. There were three teams in the National League who won more than 100 games, and they all garnered just one win each in the postseason. I had the Dodgers, Braves, and Mets all as championship contenders, but all of them were ousted by “lesser” teams. 
The 89-win Padres upset the 101-win Mets in the Wild Card round and the Dodgers in the Division Series. The Dodgers were expected to make a deep postseason push after 111 wins, but they were straight-up beaten by the Padres. The Padres have always been considered a little brother to the Dodgers, but they exorcised those demons by beating the Dodgers three games to one. The Padres beat the Dodgers 5 out of 19 times in the regular season, but they truly flipped the script in the postseason. The Dodgers had their chances, but the Padres simply stepped up when it mattered. 
Manny Machado continued to lead the charge on offense and the rotation of Yu Darvish, Blake Snell, and Joe Musgrove had big start after big start. The back end of their bullpen was absolutely dominant as Robert Suarez and Josh Hader shut down elite hitters. Players such as Austin Nola, Ha-seong Kim, and Jake Cronenworth were unsung heroes in the lineup. The postseason is all about unexpected players stepping up in big spots. Although they were cut down by the Phillies, they had a great season and the city of San Diego was electric. 
The New York Yankees had a very interesting season, as they were the best team in baseball for the first three months. Then, they had a mediocre second half full of injuries and fan disappointment. The Yanks would hold off the other AL East teams to clinch the division and beat the Guardians in the first round. A third matchup with the almighty Astros in the ALCS meant they could seek revenge. This was not the case. The Astros swept the Yankees in four games. The Yankees offense was effectively stifled, and even after scoring five runs in Game 4, the Astros put up six runs of their own to seal the win and the pennant. 
There were also high expectations for defending champs Atlanta Braves upon entering the playoffs, but they were downed by the Phillies. The Phillies' offense dominated the Braves' pitching by putting up 25 runs in only four games. These upsets of the top two seeds in the National League raised some questions, as some people said that the five-day layoff for the higher seeds was actually a disadvantage. This was also immediately disproved as the Astros and Yankees won their division series. There is some truth to a team getting hot and staying hot, but we will need more data to really see how these higher seeded teams truly fare after a bye. 
Some other playoff teams to note were the Seattle Mariners and Cleveland Guardians. They both won their Wild Card series against the Toronto Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays, respectively. The Mariners swept the Blue Jays in two games, highlighted by an enormous comeback down 8-1 in Game 2. Unfortunately, they were swept by the Astros in the Division Series, but they did have their first playoff game at home in over 20 years. Game 3 in Seattle went 18 innings, which tied the longest playoff game ever, as well as set the record for most scoreless innings to start a playoff game at 17 innings. The Astros somehow outlasted Seattle off a solo shot by Jeremy Peña in the 18th, which again shows how dominant their pitching staff were in the playoffs. The Mariners look to be a competitive squad in the near future. 
The Guardians beat the Rays in two exciting games in Cleveland. Game 1 was one of the shortest playoff games in history, featuring an incredible pitching duel between Shane Bieber and Shane McClanahan. Game 2 was one of the longest playoff games in history, as they went 15 innings of scoreless baseball until a walk-off homer by the young Oscar Gonzalez. They took the Yankees to five games, but came up just short. Oscar Gonzalez had another walk-off hit and their young rotation shined. The Guardians were the youngest team in baseball, so it will be interesting to see if their young core can continue to shine in the future. 
October baseball is always unpredictable and that was certainly proven this year. I imagine barely a few foresaw that three 100-win teams in the National League would all miss out on the Championship Series. On the other side, the Astros finished the job with 106 regular season wins and an eventual World Series title. The baseball season is over and we now wait until April to see Major League Baseball once again. The offseason should be enticing with a great free agent class as each team hopes to revamp their squad to see if they can win that last game of the season in 2023.

Women's Soccer
The #7 Carnegie Mellon women's soccer team defeated #10 Calvin on Saturday, Nov. 12. Junior Cecelia Dieterich put the Tartans on the scoreboard in the 13th minute with a header. Then, in the 53rd minute, senior Alex Adams scored a goal, assisted by senior Helena Spencer. The Tartans kept the Knights off the score sheet, taking a 2-0 victory to go 14-2-2 for the season and advancing to the sectional semifinal round of the 2022 NCAA Division III Women's Soccer Championship.
The Tartans will next play at the sectional semifinal next weekend, exact date still to be determined.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team opened their season this week with two home games. The first was against La Roche on Tuesday, Nov. 8 in Wiegand Gymnasium.
The Tartans took a 13-5 lead halfway through the first half, but the Redhawks made a quick comeback, making eight of their next 12 shots and tying it 23-23 with 2:32 left in the first half. La Roche held the lead at the end of the half, 28-27.
However, the Tartans pulled ahead during the second half and had a 51-40 lead with 10:38 left in the second half. The Redhawks once again staged a comeback, coming up right behind the Tartans, 54-52 with just over five minutes left in play. However, the Tartans would hold onto their lead and went on to win the game, 73-67.
The Tartans’ game on Saturday, Nov. 12 was similarly close. While the Tartans led 31-26 at the end of the first half, their opponent Washington & Jefferson also gave Carnegie Mellon a run for their money. Two minutes into the second half, the Presidents took over the lead 38-36. However, the Tartans quickly took back the lead and didn’t lose it for the rest of the game. The Presidents weren’t able to stage a final comeback and the Tartans took the victory, 81-73.
The team will be heading to Walsh University for an exhibition game on Tuesday, Nov. 16 in North Canton, Ohio.
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team opened their play this past week as well, with a game on Tuesday, Nov. 8. Their first game was against Allegheny College on the road. The Tartans started off strong, taking the first five points. By the end of the first quarter, the Tartans had the lead, 24-14. They proceeded to outscore the Gators in every quarter, giving Carnegie Mellon the victory in their season opener, 83-58.
On Friday, Nov. 11, the team took part in the Penn State Behrend Tournament, where they took on Salisbury University. The Tartans held a narrow lead at the end of the first quarter, 16-10. However, they would break away from their opponents in the next frame, scoring 22 points to the Seagulls’ 11. The Tartans continued their strong play, entering the fourth quarter with a sizable lead, 54-32. The Seagulls’ didn’t give in, though; they outscored the Tartans 21-14 in the last frame. However, this wasn’t enough, and the Tartans recorded their second victory, 68-53.
The Tartans kept up the momentum going into their game on the following day against Penn State Behernd. Despite trailing 15-14 going into the second quarter, the Tartans turned it around and took a 32-29 lead at the end of the second quarter. Carnegie Mellon continued to dominate into the next frame, outsourcing the Lions 22-14. Penn State turned the tables on Carnegie Mellon in the final quarter by almost making a comeback, but the Tartans were able to finish strong and earn their third win of the season, 68-64. 
The women’s team will continue their road campaign this week when they take on Geneva on Tuesday, Nov. 15.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team headed to Cleveland, Ohio this past Saturday, Nov. 12 to take on long-time rival Case Western Reserve University in the 36th Annual Academic Bowl. 
Less than five minutes into the first quarter, junior Logan Young recovered a Spartan fumble on the Spartan one-yard line. After two rushes, first-year Joey McGinnis crossed the goal line, giving the Tartans a 7-0 lead after a successful point after. 
Also less than five minutes into the second quarter, the Tartans put their second set of points on the board. Junior Ben Mills connected with senior Kris Hughes for a 25-yard touchdown and a 14-0 Tartan lead. 
The Spartans recorded their only points of the day on their first possession of the second after a 53-yard drive that lasted 10 plays. With 10:13 left in the third quarter, the scoreboard read 14-7, Tartans. After an unsuccessful drive by the Tartans, Case Western got the ball back and attempted a 37-yard field goal. Young, however, was able to block the ball and give possession back to Carnegie Mellon.
Another Tartan scoring drive helped to secure the team’s victory. After a 92-yard drive, the Tartans missed the point after, but earned a 20-7 victory over the Tartans.
This victory marks the seventh time in program history that the Carnegie Mellon football team has gone undefeated. The Tartan winning streak now totals 17 straight games, the longest active among all collegiate football teams. 
As the Tartans claimed the Presidents’ Athletic Conference title, they automatically secured a postseason bid. They will be taking on the North Coast Athletic Conference champions DePauw University at home on Saturday, Nov. 19 at Gesling Stadium with a noon kickoff.

While SciTech usually sticks with advancements that are very Here and Now, this article is here to remind everyone that some elements of science are very much about how much we discover about the past.
Enter archaeology, the study of human history and prehistory through the excavation of sites and analysis of artifacts and other physical remains. 
This year has been huge in terms of archaeological finds, both because of the dedication of archeologists across the globe, and strange weather conditions due to climate change revealing new dig sites. So, let’s jump in to some of the more interesting finds of 2022:
The first use of milk
Has anyone else sat around and wondered when and why humans decided to start drinking the milk of other animals? It’s a distinctly human thing, and even then a large portion of humans can’t. Regardless, it prompted the development of the entire dairy industry, but the question remains — when did that start?
While the BBC estimates that humans as a species were using milk around 10,000 years ago (which is fairly recent, given our species is around 300,000 years old), new research methods have mapped the first use of milk in Central Europe by ancient humans to around 7,400 years ago. Indeed, HeritageDaily explains that researchers were able to date fat traces from the sides of 4,300 pottery artifacts found throughout 70 locations in central Europe. Such information helps explain changes in human food practices, although data does show that this use wasn’t widely adopted, with only 65 percent of locations showing evidence of milk use. 
Similar analysis has been done in the past in South Europe, with Micheal Marshall of BBC explaining that people were making cheese in Southern Europe around 7,200 years ago, indicating that cheese production came very soon after humans began using milk. This analysis looked at the fatty acid remains on pottery, similar to milk studies in Central Europe. 
However, Marshall notes, the use of milk did not mean that early humans were able to digest it. Europeans (and their descendants) tend to be able to digest milk past infancy because they have developed the ability to produce lactase, the enzyme that breaks down the lactose in milk, well into adulthood. However, Marshall notes, studies that date the first findings of this allele in the human genome date back to around 5,000 years ago for Southern Europe, and 3,000 years ago for Central Europe — meaning the first humans suffered thousands of years consuming milk while lactose intolerant. 
Deciphering the first sentence written with an alphabet
While the first written language in human history is considered to be Sumerian, from around 3100 B.C.E. in ancient Mesopotamia, this language was a pictorial language consisting of symbols (called pictograms) that represented different words. Many other early languages, like Egyptian with their hieroglyphs, were also pictorial languages with thousands of characters that represented “things,” rather than an alphabet representing sounds. 
The first language with an alphabet is considered to be the Canaanite alphabet, which had a small number of letters that correspond to basic spoken sounds. Sarah Cascone of Artnet explains that this language was spoken by the Canaanites, who were a Near Eastern people, and that their developments of the alphabet were first seen around 1800 B.C.E. This is hundreds of years before Phoenicians had their standard alphabet, who are often credited with inventing alphabet-based languages. 
In 2016, an ivory comb was found at the Tel Lachish archeological site, but analysis of the comb under a microscope in 2022 is what led to the discovery of inscribed letters on the comb’s base. These letters formed the oldest decipherable full sentence, dated at 1700 B.C.E. 
The message? Its 17 letters are not something grand or quotable – instead, it’s a warning against lice. It reads, “May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard.”
Good to know that ancient peoples faced such relatable issues.
A lead on Cleopatra’s tomb
Finally, in what could be the find of the century, archeologists have found a strong lead on Cleopatra’s tomb. Sarah Kuta of the Smithsonian Magazine explains a recent find of a 4,300 foot long tunnel located 43 feet underground at Taposiris Magna, a temple dedicated to Osiris, the god of death. But why is this significant? This tunnel is described by its finder, Kathleen Martinez, as "an exact replica of Eupalinos Tunnel in Greece, which is considered as one of the most important engineering achievements of antiquity."
Cleopatra is thought to have been buried with her Roman lover Mark Antony after they both died by suicide in 30 B.C.E. This makes this tunnel, along with other findings like coins featuring Cleopatra VII and Alexander the Great, statues of the goddess Isis, and a cemetery of Greco-Roman-style mummies, strong indicators that this could be Cleopatra’s final resting place. 
Cleopatra strongly associated herself with Isis, and as a temple to Isis’ husband, the location would have significance to her. Combine this with the strong Greco-Roman and Egyptian influences throughout the tunnel, and the location becomes more promising. This is a mindset shared by archaeologists, as Martinez has believed for years that Cleopatra is buried at this site. A well-known archeologist, Martinez has made many notable finds beyond this tunnel, but finding Cleopatra’s resting site would truly elevate her to one of the greats.
As noted by one of my favorite TikTokers covering archeological finds, it’s commonly believed that Cleopatra stated, “No man will ever find my tomb.” Well watch out, because here’s a woman who could!

As I was at the bus stop waiting for a 61D in Squirrel Hill to come to campus on Saturday evening, I witnessed a very interesting event: over a thousand crows flying over my head over the span of five minutes. To me, I think the most interesting part was that no one else was paying attention to what was happening above them. Out of the 20-something people that walked by me on the street, I only saw one person look up at them. So why were there so many crows flying above Squirrel Hill?
The answer is that crows will stay in southern Pennsylvania for the winter in flocks of thousands. The region has mild winters and an abundance of food over the cold months. Crows go out during the day to search for food and return at night to their roosts — places where flocks of crows have sometimes been seen gathering for decades. Many of these birds follow the same flight path every day they go out for food. 
I had witnessed a flock of crows returning to their roost for the night. It was entertaining watching as they flew overhead; they came in short bursts, so I kept expecting the last crow, but they kept coming. Occasionally, one crow would run into another and they would have a little fight.
While crows are found in Pennsylvania year-round, some migrate south for the winter while others stay local and forage. This makes them partial migrants. Younger crows are more likely to migrate while older crows are more likely to stay around their nest year-round. 
These birds usually fly somewhere between 25 and 30 miles per hour. However, if a strong tailwind is blowing, crows can reach up to 60 miles per hour. Crows have good maneuverability when in flight, meaning they can throw off airborne predators. 
During winter, crows have been observed to fly up to 30 miles in a single day in search of food. Their diet consists of grasshoppers, caterpillars, grubs, worms, most insects, grain, fruit, the eggs and young of other birds, and organic garbage. As a general rule of thumb, they will eat anything they are bigger than and can also overpower. They have also been observed eating the carcasses of roadkill. 
While crows are predators of songbirds and waterfowl, they are also prey for some larger birds. Young crows and eggs fall victim to raccoons, opossums, and tree-climbing snakes if left unprotected. Hawks and owls will also attack crows in all life stages; they are especially vulnerable to night attacks from great horned owls. As a result, when crows spot owls and hawks during the day time, they will mob it. Mobbing involves crows swooping, calling out to other crows, and harassing the predator. However, crows will also be mobbed by smaller birds like kingbirds and red-winged blackbirds. 
The next time you’re out and you hear a bird cry, look up. There’s a chance there’s hundreds of birds right above your head.

CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
Capturing CO2 from factories through a different type of columns
The fossil fuel industry has emitted 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2022 alone, and emissions are projected to increase in the coming years. One way of limiting carbon dioxide emissions is to capture them; this process is called post-combustion capture. After combustion, the gases produced rise up through the columns of the power plant. In post-combustion capture, these columns can separate carbon dioxide from the rest of the gases, compressing carbon dioxide into a liquid form and preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon are trying to better optimize the structures inside these columns to ensure the maximum amount of CO2 is transitioned from gas to liquid. They looked at a surface called Schwarz-D, which minimizes the amount of surface while providing strong structural support, and simulated properties of chemical solvents, liquid and gas loads, and contact angle in Schwarz-D packed columns.
Polymers that can self heal: improving sustainability in manufacturing
Polymers are used in everything from plastic bags to clothing to paint to fiberglass. It's relatively durable for its price, but its biggest trade off is that for most products with polymer, every time they are recycled, they diminish in quality.
To mitigate this, manufacturers could instead use polymer materials that last longer. Carnegie Mellon researchers in materials science and engineering and chemistry are investigating a type of material composition that has improved self-healing properties. This material composition is called copolymer brushes, in which polymers with more than two types of monomers are tethered to nanoparticles (also called "hairy particles"). In their paper in "Macromolecules," they describe how these copolymer brushes can also be more easily manipulated to create different properties in the resulting material. 
NATIONAL NEWS
More big tech layoffs: Meta
If you're in the tech industry or near it at all, you've already heard this one: Meta has laid off 11,000 employees, reducing 13 percent of headcount in its biggest company restructuring since Facebook was founded. Meta is also "reducing its office space, moving to desk-sharing for some workers, and extending a hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023." 
This news comes weeks Meta revealed a four percent drop in quarterly revenue, partly due to spending 9.6 billion on achieving CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of a metaverse. Horizon Worlds, the virtual reality app that Meta hopes to host the metaverse, has fewer than 200,000 monthly active users. Meta's stock has fallen more than 70 percent this year.
In earlier weeks, Twitter, Google, SnapChat, Salesforce, and Lyft have begun to layoff workers and institute hiring freezes, with more to follow (Amazon?). Overall, the companies cite inflation, but there are other reasons: Snap's stock fell 80% this year, and Twitter's new CEO Elon Musk spent more money than he could afford buying out the company. Tech companies also cite overstaffing during the pandemic, a period when users spent more time online than ever before. Now that social distancing mandates have largely lifted, in-person events are back and online activity is down, leading to less revenue for tech companies.
Meta's shares rose 5.2 percent after the layoffs were announced.
Want to pirate textbooks? Tough luck
As college students, we all operate on a tight wallet, and spending money on an expensive, heavy textbook that you'll only use for a semester does not seem worth it at all. Unfortunately, pirating course textbooks online has just gotten a bit more difficult: last week, the FBI shut down a series of Z-Library domain names. If you visit their main page, you'll see an FBI notice with a seal of the Department of Justice.
While these pirated textbook websites, or "shadow libraries," have existed for years, they recently gained even more attention over TikTok, prompting authors and publishers of The Authors Guild to submit a complaint. “The hashtag #zlibrary on popular social media platform TikTok has 19 million views, in reference to the countless videos posted by college and high school students and others across the world promoting it as the go-to place for free ebooks," they wrote in their complaint.

PILLBOX editors and reporters worked tirelessly to find these five young upstarts that will revolutionize their fields. They are impatient to change the world and get a 9 p.m. bedtime. Those you babysit today will be your boss tomorrow, so we tracked these five specimen down, each laboring in a wildly different field. We were saddened by all the brilliant young minds we were unable to include, but that just shows how impressive these kiddos are.
Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor (Age 3,  sixth in the line of succession to the British throne)
This little royal in training was on all People's minds when he popped out of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex a little over three years ago. At first a simple goo-goo-gaga man, he has diversified his linguistic portfolio and become a gifted radio star in his own right! Thousands of devotees tune in to his Thursdays at 5 p.m. time slot on 92Moose where he'll talk politics, baby food, and diapers.
The new Teletubbies baby (Age <5, Actor)
A fresh face in the industry, the new Teletubbies baby knows how to cultivate his mystique. A real MF DOOM or Grothendieck, he prefers to let his work speak for himself. No deuxmoi gossip, no appearances on the Jimmies, this guy is all about his craft. Along with that new Gerber baby, this freshly talcumed face shows great signs for the industry's vanguard. He's in talks to be the new Boss Baby now that the original actor's career is shot, and we hear we might even be showing up in Secret Wars (but then again, who isn't?) This baby has a great future ahead of him, and we are confident that he will be able to shed the toddler actor baggage, and be a new Hollywood fixture.
Chicago West (Age 4, Socialite)
Just three years old when her parents divorced, we are sure she'll grow up wondering if she was to blame. At PILLBOX, we don't know that answers to every question, but to this one we can say, probably not. The relationship between Kim Kardashian and Ye was already rocky before he went full mental illness, let alone once he started speaking truth to power (satire). But we can't discount the effect that a toddler's whines can have on exacerbating an already struggling marriage. So who really knows? All we know is that all this trauma will be key to making Chicago the sort of sophist socialite that we love so dearly. I'm sure she'll regale us with tales at countless future parties.
Brillot Azure (Around Age 3 and three quarters, Venture Capitalist)
Operating under a pseudonym and 23 NDAs, this child of unknown gender prefers the shadows when investing in companies. In one of their rare interviews, they claimed that blood transfusions from the elderly are what gives them their childlike vigor and elderly intellect. They have already successfully invested into seven successful startups that lost millions of dollars a year before getting bought out by Alphabet. Their latest investment into BlackRiver, a mercenary group focused on the upcoming profitable field of water wars, is a great example of Brillot's investment motto: "Look far forward, but take life one diaper at a time."
X AE A-XII (Age 2, Code Monkey)
This precocious child of genius entrepreneur Elon Musk has already begun to hit the bigtime. Although his unfortunate name may break countless databases, this little scamp has already developed a well rounded GitHub repo with a very green calendar. The first of what will hopefully be a Young Justice style tech bro baby team-up, we can only hope his tweets will reach the laughing emojis that we get from Musk Senior's hilarious tweets. X AE A-XII to the mooon!

Great Heavens! Another week of PILLBOX is upon us! Hide your families and children; this is the eleventh plague. 
In all seriousness, we've labored oh so hard to bring you this issue, and we hope you read it with the same love and fervor with which we made it. If you have any complaints, don't hesitate to scream them into the void. We'd love to hear what you have to say. Especially if what you have to say takes the form of a roughly two-page article in which you critically analyze a relevant piece of art, film, music, or writing.
In this week's issue you can see that our high quality cast of writers have been doing this kind of work with their habitual reliability. With some not-so-sacred takes on work that some people consider sacred, we start off strong with a review of "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" from our adored Editor-In-Chief Cole Skuse. To paraphrase him, he saw the movie, he liked it, but he has opinions.
Similarly, H. F. Chacon Jr. recently watched Legally Blonde and gave us another analytical deep dive worthy of some sort of "Cahiers du Film" type journal.
In her serial, "Letters from Maggie," Editor Anna Cappella explores more of her sordid tale of love and debauchery and studenthood.
Zachary Gelman writes two articles, including at least one interesting one.
William Curvan once again fills our hearts with glee and brains with knowledge as he retrospects the former Fighting Tartans' skills that they then lacked for so long before recently regaining them.
We get a cool new playlist that I'm sure someone somewhere must be listening to; it's a country music playlist by someone who doesn't really like country music all that much.
And nothing else.
Toodles,
Your PILLBOX editors

Dear Cassandra,
Jesus Christ! I mean, really! I think I might start paying more attention to those Jehovah's Witnesses that have literally set up shop on Morewood because seriously! Life is just constantly throwing these — I don’t even want to say curveballs because that would be an understatement of what I feel like I’m currently experiencing! It’s one of those times when you start to wonder about what everyone else’s lives really look like because you can’t possibly be the only one experiencing the sheer madness that you are. 
Am I just the world’s slowest, most unreliable worker? That must be the reason that I need so much more time to finish exams and assignments, right? That must be the reason that I need to work while everyone else is hanging out. That must be the reason that I keep studying as much as I can and feeling great going into exams and then doing horribly. I want to be surviving here so bad, but I feel like I’m treading in the dark. It’s like a sport, and it's so much more complicated than it used to be. I used to trust. I no longer know who to trust.
How can I trust when I keep experiencing things that I can’t anticipate? I just never would have seen Lou coming. As much as missing someone is an acknowledgement that you expect them to eventually come back and soothe the ache of missing them (because why else would we put ourselves through that pain?), I really was expecting it to go on for a long time. Maybe years. I was even a little excited about the opportunity to work with that kind of emotion. I loved the romance of it. 
But of course, that is not the way things turned out. You were there when he called last Tuesday night, you heard the stuff he said. It was everything I had ever hoped for. I feel a sense of completeness now that he’s back in my life in a genuine way. And it’s just as complicated and chaotic as I anticipated it would be. He still lives across the country. I still live here. I still have this entire life, and he still has his. In fact, it’s starting to become really obvious that it is going to take us a long time to even understand the scope of these new lives we’ve begun to live. There is still Henry, for crying out loud. I am trying so hard to trust.
At the very least, I had the premonition of him in my room to prepare me. I hesitate to tell Henry about Lou calling and us talking again because of our conversation about the ghost thing. We’ve talked about it a couple of times since and I just can’t seem to understand how he is so calm about it. 
On Thursday, I decided to get more serious about figuring out what he thought, and I stumbled on something pretty big. When I asked him if he thought I would see the theoretical “ghosts” again, he said, “They tend to come back.” At first I thought he was being poetic, but then I thought better. I pretended like I didn’t think this was a big deal.
“Have yours come back?” I asked.
“Yeah,” he said, and then his head snapped up from his laptop, where he had been typing something. We were sitting at a table in Hunan, drinking bubble tea and doing homework. “Locked Out of Heaven” was playing through our shared headphone connection.
He knew he had said something wrong, and no matter how much I pressed for him to tell me his story, he wouldn’t say anything more. I am slightly intrigued, Cassandra, and slightly terrified. I am awaiting more curveballs.
Always yours,
Maggie

Women have been historically subjugated. Additionally, the struggles of womanhood are something which half of the population will never experience. Despite this, I have found that there have bloomed a great amount of stories which capture the struggle and perseverance of a woman in an environment where the odds are against her. 
No better example of this tale exists, at least in mainstream Americana, than Robert Luketic’s cult classic romantic comedy “Legally Blonde” (2001). The film follows a blonde who chases a lover to Harvard Law School, and in doing so, discovers herself to be more than just a happy-go-lucky self-indulgent consumerist sorority girl from Southern California, but rather a good-hearted, beautiful, and intelligent woman worthy of as much attention and respect in high-profile environments as anyone else. This film is put on a pedestal by many, not because it is perfect — admittedly it is not — but because it surpasses the expectations that one has going into a film like this.
With a tagline that reads “Boldly going where no blonde has gone before!”, an ironic tagline considering the message of the film, one has the presupposition that it’s going to be another unimportant and morally-questionable film made during the era of early 2000s sex-comedies (not unlike “American Pie” (1999)). I wouldn’t be surprised if it was lumped with that batch of films during its release, but given the chance, “Legally Blonde” tells a story which really puts the struggles of women front and center. 
Upon starting out, this film tells its story through a lens of pink gloss. Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon in perhaps her most famous role), is an affluent sorority president at definitely-not-UCLA, playing into the stereotypical “dumb blonde” soft-voiced Marilyn Monroe trope present in movies like “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” (1953) and “Some Like It Hot” (1959). Her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), comes from a lineage of senators and break up with Elle, believing she is too unintelligent and will hold him back in his pursuit to become a senator by age 30 (ironically, an impossible feat according to Article I, Section III, Clause III, of the Constitution — insight that perhaps Warner is a more of a dullard than he seems).
With the assistance of her entire sorority, who throughout the film display a very wholesome amount of unconditional support for Elle, she manages to get into Harvard Law School with a 179 on the LSAT Exam. There, she plans to win back Warner by any means necessary. This plan soon goes awry when Vivian (Selma Blair), a new girl Warner is seeing, sabotages Elle for seemingly no reason other than to make Elle look like a fool.
This aspect of the film, Vivian’s unconditional dislike towards Elle, is something which often comes up in conversation about female archetypes — the toxicity that spawns from a sort of jealousy or intimidation between women, often stemming from a disagreement about what femininity means. A divide may come from differing ideologies, backgrounds, and cultural opinions on what womanhood should be, which may lead others to reject those they see as not appropriately feminine. This topic is very complex,  and of course there is no single answer to this, but that doesn’t mean that there cannot be an understanding of how these rivalries between women arise. 
As the film continues, we reach a moment where Elle, interning for one of her professors, has to defend a real murder suspect in court as a first-year law student. While this scene is not terribly realistic, the film does not intend to accurately depict a court battle like “To Kill a Mockingbird” (1962) or “Kramer v. Kramer” (1979). This scene is meant to drive home a point. Elle is fighting in an environment where there is little room for mistakes, with the judge and jury possibly already being inclined to rule against her. Within the court case, she uses her unique knowledge of products and fashion to defend her suspect in ways which no one else could. Some of this is fine, but other times it is questionable. 
In one scene, Elle comes to the conclusion that her defendant could not be having an affair with a witness, Enrique, due to the fact that Enrique is gay. She came to that conclusion because Enrique pointed out what branded designer shoes she wore, and is further supported by the fact that he listens to Cher. The scene is clearly of its era, aging poorly as stereotyping heterosexuality is presented as a joke, while today it is considered less funny. 
Halfway through this court sequence, the professor that Elle is interning for is revealed to have only taken her as an intern as a means of getting her into a vulnerable position so that he can take advantage of the power imbalance. In the scene, he implies to her that if she accepts his sexual advances, he would move her up in the world, which Elle is repulsed by. Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon occurrence in workplaces for many people, where employees are harassed by people in power that can control their advancement. As Elle leaves the building she runs into her new lover, Emmett (Luke Wilson), who is arguably the best character in the entire picture. Throughout the film, he is shown to be a rational, honest, and well-mannered man. He doesn’t seem to hold any disdain for anyone, he listens to Elle, he defends her, and keeps her on the right track. Perhaps he’s just the most real character in a film full of many one-dimensional characters, far better than other less explored characters. 
The film ends with Elle using more of her fashion knowledge to reveal mendacity within the testimony of one of the witnesses during cross-examination, which ultimately ends with the witness giving a spoken admission to the murder of her father, ending the court case immediately. The court is adjourned and the witness is arrested on charges of murder, which I’m not sure is the proper protocol for that sort of thing, but it’s an early 2000s romcom, so what’s the point of complaining? 
She walks out into the hallway, surrounded by cameras and the press. Warner comes crawling back to her, calling her again by the very weird pet name “Pooh Bear.” Elle, being a new person independent of his idiocy, rejects him and walks away. The final scene has her graduating valedictorian of her class three years later, soon to be proposed to by Emmett, ending the picture. 
It’s not the smartest film, nor the best directed or written, but it accomplishes its purpose sufficiently and there isn’t anything wrong with enjoying something so easy to consume, especially given its rewatchability for many. While the film is clearly targeted towards young adult female audience, I don’t believe that it is impossible for others to enjoy such a motion picture. It’s innocent and small. It makes one smile and laugh. It’s fine. 
Overall, it’s a 7.25/10 film. 
TL;DR: “Legally Blonde” captures the story of a woman rising against the odds. It is at times funny and shouldn’t require too deep a thought to enjoy. It manages to touch upon a variety of women's struggles, ranging from small nuisances to large societal issues. While it isn’t the best the cinema the screen has to offer, it is a great culturally significant picture to a great many people, and has ultimately more charm than problems.

Nobody can doubt the resilience of our boys in plaid. With their 17th consecutive win after beating Case Western this weekend, the Tartans have not only the longest current win streak in Division III but in all NCAA football. 
The Tartans had humble beginnings. The first academic semester of the Carnegie Technical Schools began in mid-October of 1905, so by the time they scrounged together a football team, all the other nearby colleges had full schedules. Their athletic efforts were further hamstrung by the fact that they had neither athletic field nor gym in these early days. Interestingly enough, the ice hockey team seems to have had a pretty good season that winter. 
Autumn of 1906 rolls around and the Tech Students finally get to compete on the gridiron. Their first game, amidst a "sea of mud and rain," was played against California Normal School. (I'm uncertain if this is the predecessor to PennWest California. It does not appear to have ever been the official name of that school, but it seems unlikely this could be an entirely separate school.) The athletes of Tech held their own, and the game ended with a resounding tie of 0-0. The lads of this team had a variety of wacky nicknames, including "Pone" Urling (whom you may recognize from last week), "Wink" Dowling and "Doodles" Grafton. 
As Carnegie Tech grew, so did the athletics program. They soon got an athletics field, located behind the Margaret Morrison School roughly where the Donner Ditch is today, and 1923 saw the unveiling of the Skibo Gym (the future home of the Highmark athletic center).
The team expanded throughout the '10s and '20s. In the 1922 edition of The Thistle, we're given the stats of all the team members. The largest man on the team was a gentleman named Hubert Owen Sprinkle, a fridge of a right tackle who stood at 6'2" and 195 pounds. Hugh Sprinkle is quite the interesting fellow actually — hailing from Webb City, Missouri, he was a World War I veteran who entered college at age 22. During his senior year, he was in charge of the committee to build the "Senior Fence," the wooden predecessor to our current Fence. After graduating, it seems he stuck around Pittsburgh and gave back to his alma mater by helping coach the football team. He also played professional football for three years — two seasons on the Akron Pros, and one for the Cleveland Bulldogs.
I digress. In their 1922 season they played against some big names, including Yale, Notre Dame, and Penn State, (who all beat the Tartans), in addition to the local schools we still play today, like Grove City, Allegheny, and Thiel (who we beat).
It wasn't until the roaring '20s that Tech athletics hit their stride. The 1924 edition of “The Thistle” tells us, "Forbes Field crowded to capacity, and all Pittsburgh intense with anxiety … on that momentous twenty-seventh of October to decide the Collegiate Championship of Pittsburgh. … The score of that never-to-be-forgotten struggle was 7-2 and after ten years of hard determined effort, the Plaid had triumphed over her arch-rival, the Panther." After a "hectic nightmare" of a first half with "the Panther continually threatening the Skibo goal line", Tech held Pitt to a mere two points. It was only at the very end that Jimmy Anderson — whose name should be written in every history book — recovered a blocked punt with a diving catch, allowing Tech to score a touchdown. "One minute after the smoke had cleared away a raving, dancing, shouting, victory-crazy mob of students had turned Forbes field into the scene of one of the most hilarious celebrations ever…shouting and singing till Machinery Hall rocked in sheer ecstasy." We just don't party like our predecessors. 
So what happened? Make no mistake, the Tartans are still a very good team, considering this is a DIII school with no athletic scholarships. But our school used to regularly go toe-to-toe with some pretty big names. Why isn't CMU on the caliber of schools like Georgia Tech, Boston College, and Duke? Turns out, this was no accident. According to “Carnegie Mellon: A Centennial History” by Edwin Fenton, up until the 30s athletics had been run by an independent "Athletic Council," which was significantly in debt. So president Robert Doherty got rid of this council and created a new "Athletic Board", making athletics part of his administration. He ordered them to eliminate athletic scholarships and to stop spending the money to play big-name teams. People were so outraged by this that they created effigies of President Doherty in protest. Responding to this popular backlash, Doherty argued, "I think that some of you have come to the wrong school."
The Tartans are now back in the playoffs after their sick performance last year. So let’s go and cheer for them. It’s what our predecessors would have wanted.

This article contains spoilers for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”
Okay, before I start this review, I have to say that I was a big fan of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” but I still have plenty of mixed opinions about it, just so you know what kind of review this is going to be.
First of all, I think they did a good job with the movie considering Chadwick Boseman, THE Black Panther, passed away. I liked the intro scene where they have the ceremony for T’Challa, but quick question: Where did they take his body? Am I the only one who is bothered by this? I can’t be. 
But next question: Why did Ramonda take the throne after T’Challa dies? I think the story would have been much better if Shuri immediately took the throne after her brother died. Ramonda seemed too well put together for someone who lost her husband and son. I know, I know, she’s a strong woman, it’s been a year, etc., but I think that Shuri being the ruler would have created a better conflict given the beef between Wakanda and Atlantis.
Speaking of Atlantis, I loved the way they handled the introduction of Namor into the MCU. For the most part, I thought he was a well-written character who has a reasonable goal: He just wants to protect his city and his people. His fight scenes were really good, and I’m excited to see what direction they take his character. (Plus, he said that he’s a mutant, so… X-Men in the MCU when?)
One of my main problems with the film is how weak of a protagonist Shuri is. While it makes sense why they chose her to be the protagonist and Black Panther, there’s absolutely nothing special about her besides the fact that she’s smart — and even then, that’s nothing special in the MCU. 
But Shuri did get one of my favorite scenes in the movie: when she drinks the heart-shaped herb and goes to the Ancestral Plane. While I expected her to see Ramonda (since she had just passed away), seeing Killmonger was a very, very welcome surprise. This scene was very much a “you’ve become the very thing you fought to destroy” and I ate that up so hard. This helps set up one of the final conflicts in the movie, and I think it was done super well.
For the most part, the action in the film was very good. All of Ironheart’s battle scenes were enjoyable, along with Shuri as the Black Panther. But one question I do have is how Namor’s people were so skilled in battle. The impression I got was that they were running or hiding their entire lives. When did they get so good at offensive fighting? The Wakandans got absolutely bodied in the final fight scene, which seemed unexpected to me. I wish they would have explored this a little more.
I am also begging Marvel to please pay some computer science nerd five dollars to look over their script before production. I cringe so hard when there’s a “science nerd” character who says something “smart” that’s just a bunch of nonsense. Riri is an intelligent character, but her lines make her sound like she spends 10 hours a day on Reddit. 
Last and definitely least of all, the end-credit scene. Oh good god I utterly hated the post-credit scene. When Nakia had her son introduce himself as Prince T’Challa, son of King T’Challa, I was not happy. Chadwick is MY T’Challa — I don’t want the MCU to do a 10 year timeskip and have fake T’Challa become Black Panther because Disney likes money and wants to do another Black Panther movie. It just felt like such a copout, and I’m not a fan.
But you know what makes up for the weak points? The score and the costuming. This movie had a KILLER score. I don’t even know what to say beyond that; it was just so, so good. The scene when Namor shows Shuri the city of Talokan was highly elevated by the score, not to mention the gorgeous visuals. 
I was a BIG fan of the costumes throughout the movie (well, for the most part). Ironheart and the Midnight Angels’ suits were really well designed, all of the white ceremonial garments really made the scenes pop, and I just loved the colors that were used. However, whoever designed some of the more casual outfits could have tried a little harder (or I might have bad taste).
Overall, I think “Wakanda Forever” is one of my favorite things to come out of MCU Phase 4 so far. It was a much-needed breath of fresh air after the mess that was “Thor: Love and Thunder.” I would highly recommend it.

Last Tuesday, a team of three grad students in the BME department and the School of Computer Science filed a patent for a new device for a product known as the auto-diamulator. With trial efficiency and data parsing accuracy as their primary goal, they have developed automated parallel cell culture assay, that would not only standardize operating protocols in eastern-Blot fluorescence applications, but also increase the reliability of non-germinal DNA traction microscopy.
The main feature of this product is that instead of having to individually pipette wells with cell cultures — a time-consuming process any lab technician is all-too familiar with — the auto-diamulator is equipped with a highly advanced non-reversible flow perometer, streamlining the process immensely. According to their project abstract, one simply has to deposit their sample into the actuarial slot, and the perometer will use a flux-sensitive pitot tube array to distribute it accordingly. Oxidative fleructance in the wells is of course a concern, but any such residue can be easily cleaned out by removing the aft-end billow stopper. Once done, a simple saline wash should do the trick.
One substantial advancement of the diamulator is its ability to concurrently run both an ICC antibody protocol and a PGH cell-center reductive assay. This feature comes thanks to a recent innovation that allows for the extremely rapid evaluation of a cell line’s interstitial germinal constant. Now, all a researcher must do is add BMA-antiglobules into the cell sample, using the BioSolvent lookup table to determine the appropriate ratio. Moreover, whenever RNA polygonal synthesis is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a Farse-sensitive PTE monitor to reduce acromenial decromition.
Now you may be asking: "What about the data collection protocols?" Don’t worry — the brilliant software engineers from the SCS have that one covered. The auto-diamulator has built-in sensors that can be programmed through the highly intuitive UI to automatically measure cell count, cell flow, mitochondrial drift, and pharmacochemical concentraction in each well. Within the diamulator’s local memory stack, the data are binned in five-minute intervals and categorized by trial number. Every hour, data are transmitted wirelessly to any internet-enable device of your choice, where your trial will be saved to your BioSolvent desktop application suite. Here, the auto-diamulator program will calculate the Z-Score, P-score, and T-Distribution (with one-way Zorkov normalization as the default), and will display these data on a point non-dependent biaxial scattermat.
The auto-diamulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the operation of mitochondrial stress analyses.

With most midterm results in, one thing is clear: the prophesized “red wave” did not come to be. Democrats flipped a Pennsylvania seat and kept their control of the Senate, and they lost far fewer seats in the House of Representatives than anticipated.  
Between soaring inflation and President Biden’s low approval ratings, analysts predicted Democrats would suffer huge losses at every level. In midterm elections, the president’s political party loses an average of 30 House seats. Democrats lost seven as of Sunday. Instead, Democrats managed to hold on to important seats.
According to New York Times news analysis by Lisa Lerer, "Democrats cast the election as a referendum not on Mr. Biden’s record but as a verdict on the state of American democracy, an opportunity to reject the lie that the 2020 election had been stolen."
Senate and House
In the Senate, Democrats currently hold 50 seats and Republicans hold 49. Alaska’s race went into a runoff between two Republican candidates. The final seat belongs to Georgia, which has gone to a runoff between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker. With 99 percent of votes counted as of publishing, Warnock received 49.4 percent of votes and Walker received 48.5 percent. The runoff is scheduled for Dec. 6. 
Democrats were less successful in the House, though they still outperformed predictions. All 435 seats were up for election, except for one of the six non-voting members. So far, Republicans have won 211 seats and the Democrats have won 204. POLITICO predicts that Democrats could win more of the 20 remaining seats than Republicans. Democrats are leading in 12 of the undecided races. 
One of the key Senate races this cycle was in Pennsylvania. The race attracted national attention with its widely-known candidates: Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and TV-personality Dr. Mehmet Oz. Fetterman is a 6-foot 9-inch former football player and lifelong Pennsylvanian, starting his political career in 2006. Oz achieved fame as a television personality, and did not live in Pennsylvania before his senate campaign. Despite his tenuous ties to Pennsylvania and lack of political experience, Oz was considered a legitimate competitor. He knew how to harness far-right Republican support — including former president Donald Trump — against the unpolished, abrasive Fetterman. 
Fetterman beat Oz by almost five points (51 percent to 46.6 percent), flipping a seat that has been almost exclusively Republican since 1969. With Fetterman’s victory, the Democrats are guaranteed at least a 50-50 split in the Senate, which becomes a majority with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. If Warnock wins Georgia, Democrats will have a 51-49 majority. 
Notable “firsts”
There were many notable “firsts” in this election. 25-year-old Maxwell Frost is the first congressperson from Generation Z. Frost, a progressive activist, won Florida’s 10th Congressional District by 19 points against Calvin Wimbish, a 72-year-old conservative and retired Army Green Beret. 
Summer Lee became Pennsylvania's first Black congresswoman, winning the 17th Congressional District which includes part of Allegheny County. Before her congressional run, Lee defeated incumbent Paul Costa in 2018 to reach the Pennsylvania House of Representatives with the support of the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Austin Davis became Pennsylvania's first Black lieutenant governor — and highest-ranking Black official in PA history. 
In Vermont, Becca Balint (D) became the first woman and out member of the LGBTQ community in Vermont to be elected to Congress. Alex Padilla (D) became California’s first elected Latino Senator, and Delia Ramirez (D) became Illinois’ first Latina congressperson.
Down-ballot measures
The 2022 midterms were significant for many down-ballot measures on hot-button issues. 
Kentucky voted against a ballot measure that said abortion was not a constitutional right, although it is still banned in the state, while Michigan, California, and Vermont enshrined reproductive autonomy rights into their state constitutions. The increased push for abortion rights comes after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson earlier this year, which overturned Roe v. Wade. According to AP VoteCast, two-thirds of the nation’s voters believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, compared to only about 10 percent who support a full ban. Abortion is fully banned in 13 states.
In four states, slavery was on the ballot. Three states voted to remove language from their state constitutions allowing slavery as a form of punishment for crime. Louisiana did not. The ballot measure read: “Do you support an amendment to prohibit the use of involuntary servitude except as it applies to the otherwise lawful administration of criminal justice?” A “yes” vote would be in favor of removing slavery as punishment, but many, including a Louisiana State Representative, say the ballot measure’s wording confused voters. Laws allowing slavery as criminal punishment are considered outdated and unenforceable in the present day, but activists say that more must be done to avoid the “modern-day slavery” of exploitative prison labor. 
Several states voted in favor of affordable housing policies. Frost, Florida’s Gen Z Representative, ran on a platform including housing and transit reforms, such as rent stabilization, eviction prevention, and supporting Rep. Ilhan Omar’s Homes For All Act. In Missouri, Kansas City tenants rights organization KC Tenants Power won a measure authorizing $50 million for housing at or below 30 percent of the median income. In Los Angeles, a measure will likely pass that taxes high-value properties. The tax would help build affordable housing and decrease homelessness. Colorado narrowly passed a measure to add $300 million per year to fund affordable housing programs and address homelessness.
Missouri and Maryland voted to legalize recreational marijuana for people over the age of 21. Maryland’s ballot measure passed overwhelmingly, while Missouri’s was much closer with 53 percent support. North Dakota, South Dakota, and Arkansas all rejected recreational marijuana. TIME posits that these failures were due to lower voter turnout for a non-presidential election. 
Illinois appears on track to pass the Workers’ Rights Amendment, adding protections in the state constitution for workers seeking to unionize. It would also prevent state lawmakers from passing “right-to-work” laws, which would prohibit non-union employees from having to contribute to the costs of union representation. The bill was supported by Vote Yes for Workers Rights and would enshrine Illinois workers’ right to collective bargaining. 
Colorado voted to raise state taxes on high-income households to fund universal free school lunches for all students. Under the previous program, only about 30 percent of students qualified for free lunches, while at least seven percent more who could not afford lunches did not qualify. Instead of broadening eligibility standards, the proposition will create an entirely new system for free school lunches, including subsidies for school food service and locally sourced ingredients. The funding will come from reducing tax deductions in households earning $300,000 or more annually.

“We are excited to announce insulin is free now,” declared a tweet by verified user @EliLillyandCo on Nov. 10. The account had the blue verification check mark that, until recently, represented verified users of note, including celebrities and brands. The account appeared to belong to Eli Lilly and Company, whose drug Humalog (insulin injection) is used to treat type 1 and 2 diabetes. The tweet was liked by tens of thousands of users and the company’s stock fell by 4.5 percent. Humalog, currently priced at $275 per dose, has been marked up by 1,200 percent since 1996 and is the primary revenue driver for the company. However, the account whose tweet led to the wiping out of a reported $15 billion in market capitalization of the company is not the company's official account, despite the blue verification checkmark. A clarification soon came from the company’s official account @LillyPad: “We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly account. Our official account is @LillyPad.” The fake Eli Lilly and Company account was a subscriber of the Twitter Blue service, which gave the account the blue verification checkmark that tricked some users into believing it was the official brand account.
Twitter Blue is Elon Musk’s first initiative as the head of Twitter. It began on Nov. 9 and lasted barely 48 hours before pausing. As part of this service, Twitter sold the blue checkmark that had previously indicated a “verified user” — usually celebrities, artists, journalists, activists, brands and other public figures — to its subscribers without any verification process. 
Twitter Blue was the first subscription service in Twitter’s history and initially launched in Australia and Canada in June 2021, priced at about $3.49 CAD and $4.49 AUD per month for additional features like the ability to edit tweets, create folders for bookmarked tweets, and read complete threads seamlessly. It later expanded to the U.S. in November 2021 at $2.99 per month. It included ad-free articles from select participating publications including The Washington Post and The L.A. Times. In July, they announced raising the monthly subscription price to $4.99, adding that existing subscribers of the plan would not see the raise until October. The company said the increase would help Twitter build new features subscribers have been asking for while improving existing features. On Oct. 6, Twitter added the ability to edit tweets any time after they have been posted, for its Blue subscribers. 
When Musk completed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter on Oct. 27, he immediately started searching for new revenue streams, as he borrowed $13 billion and has to pay at least $1 billion a year in interest. Ads, Twitter’s primary source of revenue, fluctuated after his purchase so Musk tried raising revenue with Twitter Blue. Musk is increasing the prices and offering more premium features, hoping to attract more subscriptions and reduce reliance on ad revenue. He announced the increased price of $8 a month with a tweet that said, “Twitter’s current lords and peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit.” He also clarified that the subscription price would be adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity. A few days after the announcement, almost half of Twitter’s workforce was laid off, and he set a one-week deadline for Twitter Blue. Amid concerns that the launch of the new verification feature would lead to the spread of misinformation and concern before the U.S.’s midterm elections, it was pushed to after the elections. Other features to be included in the service, he wrote, would be the ability to post long video/audio, see fewer ads, and get priority in replies, search, and mentions.
Even before the launch, some verified users changed their profile to impersonate Musk, demonstrating the risks of treating the blue checkmark as a symbol rather than as an essential feature that improved user trust and experience. Musk said all accounts impersonating someone else should indicate that they are parody or risk being permanently suspended. Podcaster Ethan Klein of h3h3Productions changed his profile name and photo to that of Musk’s and added a cover photo with “parody” written in it and his profile bio was “parody account.” Some of his tweets alluded to the widely circulated of photo of Musk with convicted child sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell in the background. However, Klein’s account did not indicate “parody” in this profile name and was therefore one of the many accounts that were permanently suspended. Musk had previously opposed permanently suspending users from Twitter. Some other verified users complained of their accounts being “shadowbanned” — users being unable to further like or retweet their tweets — despite indicating they were parody accounts in the profile name. Twitter also briefly paused verified users’ ability to change their profile names.
Immediately after launch on Wednesday, the site saw a number of accounts impersonating various celebrities and brands with blue checkmarks. Twitter briefly added an “Official” label to some accounts to differentiate from Blue subscribers. However, Musk soon announced that “he killed [the label]” and that the blue checkmark will be the “great leveler." Users were only able to differentiate between verified checkmarks and Blue subscriber checkmarks by going to the profile and tapping on the checkmark, which would lead to a pop-up box that reads, “This account is verified because it is notable in government, news, entertainment, or other designated category,” or “This account is verified because it is subscribed to Twitter Blue.” Despite the message reading that the account is verified, Twitter Blue subscribers do not go through any identity verification process, although theoretically users are ‘verified’ because they have to provide credit card information during the subscription process and can therefore be tracked by any law enforcement agency should the need arise. 
Without a label for official accounts, trolls seized the opportunity to impersonate brands, validating advertisers’ safety concerns. Within hours of the launch, @TeslaReal tweeted “our favorite movie is Total Recall because that’s also how car safety regulators refer to our company” and “honestly the 53% drop in stock price doesn’t phase us. if there’s anyone who knows about Crashing it’s us.” @LockheedMartini tweeted, “We will begin halting all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States until further investigation into their record of human rights abuses,” @PEPICO tweeted “Coke is better,” @ChiquitaBrands tweeted, “We have overthrown the government of Brazil,” while @Chiquita, ostensibly imitating the official Eli Lilly and Company account, tweeted, “We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Chiquita account. We have not overthrown a government since 1954.” All of these accounts are misleadingly similar to the official brand accounts, all of them have the blue checkmarks, all of them are fake — including both the Chiquita accounts — and their tweets have thousands of likes. In some cases, like that of Eli Lilly and Company and Lockheed Martin, companies saw their stock drop after the fake tweets. 
George W. Bush and Tony Blair, who led their countries during the Iraq war, were among the many celebrities who were impersonated. Several accounts took advantage of the visual similarity between the lower-case “L” and upper-case “i” to create fake handles. Several right-wing accounts also capitalized their new blue checkmarks to spread misinformation on the platform. 
Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of Trust and Safety who vigorously defended the site’s moderation capabilities after mass layoffs on Nov. 4, resigned on Nov. 10. Twitter paused the ability of new accounts created on or after Nov. 9 to subscribe to the Blue service, and brought back the “Official” label for some accounts. It is unclear when or whether Twitter plans to let new accounts subscribe and get a blue checkmark.
New problems have emerged as features glitched and the engineers with the knowledge to fix them had been laid off. The New York Times reported that three top Twitter executives for security, privacy, and compliance resigned a day before a deadline for Twitter to submit a compliance report to the Federal Trade Commission as part of a 2011 settlement. At the current rapid pace of product development, workers would be forced to self-certify that their work is FTC compliant, which would put the company at a huge risk of lawsuits. Meanwhile, Musk seemed pleased with the user engagement the launch generated despite indicating to his workers that the company might be under the threat of bankruptcy. In an email sent to staff on Nov. 9, he wrote that without significant subscription revenue, it is possible “Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn.” On the same day, he tweeted “Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t.”

The United States Federal Reserve (the Fed) announced its sixth consecutive increase to interest rates last week, the latest effort to control record-level inflation gripping the country. The fourth consecutive increase this year of 0.75 percentage points places the overall interest rate between 3.75 and 4 percent. Inflation has been a major topic for politicians and the media since last year, as the economic impact on Americans harshened in the run up to the midterm elections. 
According to the Consumer Price Index, inflation peaked in June at 9.1 percent, the highest level in 40 years, before dropping down to 8.5 in July. So far, inflation has continued to decline. As of October, the year-over-year rate is 7.7 percent. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, reached a 40-year peak in September, as prices increased 6.6 percent from last year, a 0.6 percent increase over the previous month. But that also appears to have decreased to 6.3 percent in October. Regardless, the October data inspired hope that inflation may be cooling, leading to the market’s single biggest positive response since 2020. 
This is good news for Democrats, who received vindication in the midterm election when Republicans failed to mount a successful campaign against them over inflation. Yet, election-day exit polls show that inflation remains a pressing issue for Americans. President Joe Biden and the Fed previously dismissed signs of inflation as “transitory” but changed tact after inflation proved to be persistent. The Fed has since embarked on the most aggressive tightening campaign since the Volcker Shock of the 1980s. 
A Flawed Approach?
The Federal Reserve, the United State’s central bank system, is the chief monetary institution in the country and regulates the financial system to maintain a healthy economy. In 1978, Congress gave the Fed a dual mandate: maintaining “price stability” and achieving “full employment.” They do this by adjusting interest rates and buying and selling, namely, U.S. Treasury bonds. At the beginning of the pandemic, amidst Covid-related shortages that threatened a recession, the Fed slashed interest rates to zero and went on a bond-buying spree, injecting money into the economy. Coupled with legislated direct relief to people and businesses, this stimulus kept the economy afloat. But the Fed reversed course in March as inflated consumer costs grew overtly evident. 
The Fed has aggressively employed its main tool against inflation: interest rates. The Fed intends to control inflation through a practice known as ‘demand destruction.’ The idea is that in a booming economy, people have more money to spend which drives up demand, and if supply cannot increase to accommodate, prices are pushed higher. By raising the federal funds rate, the Fed can broadly influence the cost of borrowing on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and business loans. Raising borrowing costs redirects surplus money towards servicing debt. Consumers spend less on goods and services, and businesses stop investing and start downsizing which in turn curbs — or destroys — demand. But the Fed’s approach has come under question as critics argue higher interest rates threaten a recession and will not resolve the core issues beneath inflation. 
Many economists argue that inflation is not entirely demand-driven but also supply-sided. Currently, pandemic-related disruptions in the global supply chain are a primary driver of inflation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated these existing supply chain issues, creating serious shortages in food and energy sectors. Russia, the world’s third largest oil producer, accounts for a tenth of global oil supplies. Likewise, Ukraine and Russia contribute nearly 20 percent of global cereals trade. Sanctions imposed against Russia drove up gas prices and energy costs. Ukrainian exports are similarly diminished by a Russian blockade on Ukrainian ports and lowered agricultural production from the war, creating a global food shortage. On the other side of the equation, changes in consumer spending habits during the pandemic — a shift away from services and towards more goods — worsened price conditions by raising demand on already limited supply.
Unfortunately, increased interest rates cannot fix supply chain infrastructure, leaving inflation’s long-term causes unresolved. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell acknowledged the Fed’s rate hikes cannot address the food and energy crisis so pivotal to ongoing inflation. Worse, David Daden for the “American Prospect” warned that discouraging investment might leave businesses unable to solve supply chain issues, prolonging or multiplying inflation woes. 
Look, for instance, at the housing market. It became a major inflation source as house prices surged during the pandemic under historically low mortgage rates. A Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco report concluded that white-collar jobs shifting to work-from-home contributed considerably to increased prices. Similarly, Fortune revealed that investors — from minor landlords to large private equity firms — buying properties contributed significantly to increased housing costs. Raised demand coupled with already-low housing stock created the housing bubble. The Fed targeted this demand by raising mortgages. 
As of Nov. 10, 30-year fixed mortgage rates reached a 20-year high of seven percent, exceeding rates during the 2008 housing crisis. Housing prices fell accordingly, but while the Fed has lowered demand, it also has not. According to Skanda Amarnath at Employ America, “The housing demand that the Fed directly cools is investment demand, not consumption demand.” The demand for housing remains — people need a home to live, after all — while supply continues to remain low. But the Fed’s rate hike discourages developers from investing in new housing, which homebuilding data appears to confirm. Pushing people away from mortgages pushes them into the rental market, choking limited rental supply and thereby driving up rental prices. 
It remains to be seen whether early signs of a cooling housing market bode well for the economy-at-large, or whether the Fed’s interest rate hikes can sufficiently reduce overall inflation amid supply constraints. But on the demand side, fierce debate has focused on the labor market’s victimization under Federal Reserve policy. 
‘Get Wages Down’
From the onset, the Federal Reserve has pointed to the tightened labor market as a necessary target of anti-inflationary policy. Under the Fed’s demand-driven outlook on inflation, low unemployment increases worker leverage, driving up wages and then prices as companies offload higher labor costs. To curb demand, the Fed encourages corporate downsizing (i.e. layoffs) to heighten unemployment and lower wages. 
Chief Powell affirmed that the Fed’s goal is to “get wages down” and that controlling inflation will likely result in “some softening of labor market conditions.” More explicitly, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston president Susan Collins said fixing inflation will “require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment rate.”
But the Fed’s approach runs counter to evidence suggesting wages are not significantly influencing inflation. Instead, "real wages" — inflation-adjusted wages — are lagging behind inflation for many, meaning workers are losing many of their pandemic-era wage gains to higher costs. This conforms to historic trends indicating wages have not impacted inflation for years; inflation grows annually while wages stagnate. A real estate CEO poured fuel on this fire in August by saying inflation could be good for industry if it “put employers back in the driver’s seat.” The admission strengthens criticisms that the Fed and corporations are disciplining labor by lowering bargaining power amid historic wins for the labor movement. 
In September, the Fed forecasted an increase in unemployment from 3.7 to 4.4 percent — meaning an additional 1.2 million people unemployed. But others estimate far less optimistic numbers regarding the Fed’s aggressive policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager, calculates quashing inflation would require three million more unemployed. The International Monetary Fund concluded it would require unemployment levels of 7.5 percent — a doubling of the existing rate and six million more without work. The Fed’s most direct impact will likely be millions more unemployed and workers broadly facing lower wages and worse working conditions.
Doubly concerning are the odds the Fed’s aggressive raising of interest rates will trigger a recession. The Federal Reserve has previously assured it can control inflation without triggering a recession, achieving what it calls a "soft landing." But others are skeptical and have pointed out soft landings are rarely achieved. Powell himself has admitted the path to a soft landing has “narrowed” meanwhile Bloomberg has raised the likelihood of a recession to 60 percent. Given the stakes, many are again warning that the Fed’s approach risks eradicating pandemic gains while leaving inflation largely unresolved — possibly worsening the situation.
But the labor market exceeded the Fed’s expectations in a new report, proving to be rather resilient. ZipRecruiter’s chief economist Julia Pollak attributed this to consumer resilience — so long as consumer demand remains high, companies will continue to hire. Although labor market conditions softened, the data likely delays any slowdown from the Fed. But many, including Democrats in Congress, are pressuring the Fed to ease up, lest they force prices down at workers’ expense. 
Alongside the labor debate, critics are directing attention towards a less examined facet of the inflation crisis opposite of workers: corporations. 
Record Inflation, Record Profits
Record-level inflation alongside the highest profits for corporations in 70 years has elicited accusations of corporate profiteering. The New York Times reports that food and restaurant costs have increased 13 and 8.5 percent, respectively, since a year ago while companies such as PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Chipotle are reporting increasingly higher profit margins on quarterly earnings. Likewise, ExxonMobil and Chevron have recently reported a fourth consecutive quarter of strong profits despite the war driving up prices. Besides food and gas, profit increases are occurring across multiple sectors — the S&P 500 gained eight percent last month after quarterly reports. 
As University of Massachusetts Amherst Professor Isabelle Weber explained on NPR: “Everybody has some sort of an understanding that, oh, yeah, there are issues, so, yes, of course companies are increasing prices in ways in which they could not justify in normal times … what we have seen is that profits are skyrocketing, which means that companies have increased prices by more than cost.” She says rising profits suggest that companies capitalize on higher demand when consumers have more money to increase the amount going to shareholders. 
Democrats have seized on this messaging, accusing corporations of price gouging and driving inflation. The White House has confined attacks to certain industries. Late last year, the White House blamed increased grocery prices on meat processing companies. More recently, Biden accused oil companies of "war profiteering" and threatened a windfall tax if they did not reinvest their profits into production, rather than stocks. 
Some economists pushed back, arguing that supply and demand, not corporate greed, motivated price increases. These economists argue corporate consolidation does not account for inflation since consolidation has existed for years while inflation is recent. They instead point to increased demand: companies are selling more goods and services. Consumers are also willing to spend more. Larry Summers, a former Obama advisor, called profiteering claims “business bashing.”
Proponents of price gouging argue pandemic-driven inflation allows big companies to raise prices past the point of recouping increased costs. According to Josh Belvins at the Economic Policy Institute, “Evidence from the past 40 years suggests strongly that profit margins should shrink and the share of corporate sector income going to labor compensation (or the labor share of income) should rise as unemployment falls and the economy heats up.” Instead, over half of the price increase since the pandemic comes from larger profit margins, with labor costs accounting for only 8 percent. From 1979 to 2019, labor accounted for 60 percent of price growth while profits accounted for 11 percent. To Belvins, this data shows that “a chronic excess of corporate power has built up over a long period of time, and it manifested in the current recovery as an inflationary surge in prices rather than successful wage suppression.” 
Critics of profiteering claims must contend with evidence that attributes soaring corporate profits to ‘pricing strategies’ and inflation. A Guardian analysis of 100 top U.S. companies revealed profits increased an average of 49 percent, with one company reporting quarterly growth over 111,000 percent. The report shows some companies — such as two of the nation’s largest home builders, PulteGroup and Lennar — increased prices by throttling production and constricting supply. Another investigation of earning calls and corporate profits by the progressive organization Groundwork Collaborative says corporate pricing power has influenced inflation. 
The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill authorizing the Federal Trade Commission to punish companies engaged in price gouging, although it will likely fail in the Senate. Similarly, the Inflation Reduction Act imposed a new tax on stock buybacks, but companies may already have found a loophole. 
The highest-earners are disproportionately stoking inflation while the most marginalized are disproportionately suffering its effects. Assets grew considerably under the Fed’s pandemic-era monetary policy, giving wealthy Americans more money to spend — what Edward Pinto calls the "wealth effect" driving inflation. And while the wealthy spend more, those most affected by inflation — the poorest — buy less but pay more. 
The outsized role of the rich — from corporate profits to the wealth effect — has boosted demands for a reconsideration of the Fed’s priorities away from average workers and towards the wealthy. On Twitter, Former Fed economist Claudia Sahm said, “Newsflash rich people spend more money than poor people. Instead of bitching at low-wage workers for getting raises and new jobs, how about you wag a finger at the well off and their spending?”
For the most part, the future remains uncertain. Although some early signs suggest a cool down, it remains unclear whether these effects will permeate into the wider economy. Otherwise, consumers still appear strong and inflation remains high. How the Fed will respond remains unclear but it seems unlikely they will take a less aggressive approach so long as demand performs above their expectations.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that undated mail-in ballots cannot be counted for the midterm elections.
This is the result of a special lawsuit by the Republican National Committee and GOP groups. Hansi Lo Wang of NPR explained that this lawsuit bypassed the state’s lower courts and went directly to the higher courts. He said that the ruling makes ballots mailed in envelopes without dates, with “handwritten dates outside the range of Sept. 19 through Nov. 8,” and absentee ballots with envelopes “dated outside of Aug. 30 through Nov. 8” all invalid for this election, which won’t be counted for the final tallies in Pennsylvania. Even if the undated or incorrectly dated envelopes arrived on time, they are not to be counted.
Voters in two of the state’s largest counties, Allegheny and Philadelphia, had the chance to check the status of their ballots to determine whether they had the proper dates. Chris Potter of WESA notes that the lists for Allegheny County had over 1,000 voters at risk of not having their vote counted. Fredreka Schouten of CNN notes that in Philadelphia County, the number was higher, with 1,800 ballots up for rejection from improper dating. 
The options for such voters were to vote with provisional ballots on election day at their regular polling place, “cure” their ballot by visiting the County Office Building before the end of election day to fix the ballot, or fill out a form so that third parties can “cure” their ballots and present that form to election workers. However, Potter notes, not all counties offered these backup options to cure ballots, forcing some people to still go in on election day and vote provisionally. One of the biggest issues with notifying voters was that due to the last-minute ruling, there was not enough time to notify voters by mail. Dennis Owens of ABC noted that some counties even refused to notify voters that their ballots were invalid, stating they “can’t or won’t” update people. 
The problem is that not everyone can fix their ballot. These are people who chose to vote by mail in the first place instead of going in on election day to their polling locations. Schouten noted that many ballots that were flagged  were received by election officials weeks before the Supreme Court ruling, meaning people might not be in town or able to come in to fix them. 
Others must take off work and wait in massive lines to fix their ballots. Emma Brown of the Washington Post said that many of the City Hall locations that offered ballot changes had hours-long lines.
In reaction to the ruling, Wang noted, many organizations like the NAACP and League of Women Voters filed a federal lawsuit to stop election officials from rejecting these ballots, on the grounds that this would violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act says the right to vote cannot be invalidated based on reasons that are “‘not material’ in determining voting eligibility.” The lawsuits were unsuccessful, but the Supreme Court’s ruling was limited to this election alone. 
This is not the first time undated mail-in votes caused contention. Katie Meyer of Spotlight PA said that there have been years of “highly partisan litigation” that resulted in an unclear legal consensus for these ballots. For years, the current policy has been that voters must sign and date the outside of the envelope, with conflict over whether ballots that come in on time with signatures but incomplete or incorrect dates should be counted. Indeed, Wang notes that in some counties in the past, these misdated ballots have been counted for final election tallies. 
But why the contentious debate over a small percentage of voters? Not everyone votes by mail, and of those people, not everyone forgets the date or writes it incorrectly. In essence, it’s tied to Pennsylvania’s status as a swing state. Every vote counts in determining the final outcome. Neil Vigdor of the New York Times reported that in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz won by fewer than 1,000 votes. 
The split over whether undated ballots should be counted is almost directly along partisan lines: Democrats want these votes counted, Republicans do not. 
Wang explained that Republican advocates believe that ballots submitted without a date — even if they are submitted on time — should not be counted because of the state law stating “voters ‘shall … fill out, date, and sign the declaration’ printed on their ballot’s outer envelope.” They also view the date requirement as a “fail-safe” against mail in ballot fraud. One of their more controversial arguments comes from the idea of “‘independent state legislature’ doctrine,” which finds that in the case of elections, only the state legislatures have power, and the executive and judicial branches shouldn’t have a say. According to Wang, while such an argument hasn’t seen success with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, it might be considered by some members of the US Supreme Court. 
The opposing Democrat viewpoint is in favor of counting these undated and misdated ballots, under the overarching belief of enfranchising voters. Wang explains that such advocates see Pennsylvania’s election law as for the purpose of enfranchisement, and see the history of court cases surrounding this law as also for that purpose. Thus, they argue that the Republican mindset disenfranchises voters, and that when courts are given the choice between enfranchisement and disenfranchisement, courts should choose to help more people vote. They also further argue that the requirement to date is a relic from previous legislation that actually did reject undated or misdated votes, a section of the Election Code that was removed in 1968. They view the front section of mail in ballots as relevant not because of the individual sections like date, but as an overall measure to ensure the ballot is valid, and view the date as insignificant when determining if a ballot is fraudulent. Finally, they make arguments that this decision violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as mentioned when talking about the NAACP lawsuit. 
Such debate over the validity of undated mail in ballots will continue to be argued for future election cycles, allowing both sides to continue to make their arguments in front of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. But for this election? Those votes didn’t count, leaving voters to scramble to find other ways for their voice to be heard.

Last week, the workers of La Prima began the process of unionizing. La Prima is a local coffee franchise with five locations in Pittsburgh: two at Carnegie Mellon, one Downtown, one in the Strip District, and a North Side location that serves as a wholesale coffee distributor. Unlike most dining locations on campus, La Prima coffee shops are not affiliated with Chartwells, the third-party company to whom Carnegie Mellon contracts out University dining services. As such, La Prima workers on campus are not part of local 32BJ of the Service Workers International Union (SEIU), which represents Chartwells employees at Carnegie Mellon. 
La Prima workers are attempting to join local 1776 of United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), a national labor union with over 1.3 million members working in food, retail, grocery, as well as some more niche industries like alcohol and cannabis production. In an interview with The Tartan, Wendell Young IV, president of local 1776, said the union effort "had momentum." According to Young, workers want to unionize because they have low wages, no healthcare benefits, and poor treatment by management. He said that employees felt that "some of the management personnel were inappropriate in their treatment towards workers, and that the employer did nothing to stop it." Young estimated that there are 40 workers at La Prima who would be represented by Local 1776, should the unionization effort succeed.
He compared La Prima to Coffee Tree Roasters, another local coffee franchise of similar size who began efforts to organize last year. In Dec. 2021, the workers of Coffee Tree filed a petition to unionize, which kicked off a lengthy anti-union campaign by their employer. "The employer refused entirely to recognize the union … and in Coffee Tree Roasters’ case, not only would they not, but the very next day fired one of the key workers that was organizing amongst the workforce," Young said, who was involved in the unionization effort.
With the assistance of representatives from Local 1776, workers at Coffee Tree filed charges through the National Labor Relations Board. "They're now working under their first labor contract as a result,” Young told The Tartan. The workers voted to ratify this contract in September, which included provisions for better wages and benefits. Roughly 50 Coffee Tree workers have joined the ranks of the 35,000 members of UFCW Local 1776. 
The unionization process is still in the early stages, and The Tartan will cover developments as they unfold in the future. With Coffee Tree workers' success, Young thinks the baristas of La Prima “have a good chance.”

Last Sunday, I was enjoying a quiet breakfast in Skibo Cafe when I noticed something truly unpleasant on one of the TVs — my absolute least favorite late-night host, Bill Maher, was speaking on CNN.
Maher spoke with journalist Fareed Zakaria about whether or not Democrats' political strategy would help or hinder them in the midterms. If you know anything about Maher, his takes will not surprise you at all. They were strongly flavored with the idea that these damn kids and their "wokeness" are driving people away from the Democratic party. He claims that the lack of urgency among the youth voting bloc stems from the fact "we stopped teaching history, we stopped teaching civics in this country a long time ago." I was surprised to learn this; I seem to recall taking quite a bit of history and civics at my high school, but considering that Maher has also been a high school teacher for the last 25 years, I guess he knows what he's talking about. Except of course he doesn't, what on Earth are you talking about you dinosaur.
But this isn't even what really got my goat. While discussing Biden's attempt to appeal to the youths, Maher talks dismissively about how "Biden had the TikTokers into his office about a week ago … kind of a Hail Mary with this election.” Even more unforgivably, Biden "went all-in on gender reconstructive surgery, which that generation kind of thinks is the civil rights movement of our time." Maher talks about how other countries, like the England and Sweden, hit the brakes on trans healthcare, because they "believe trans is a real thing. … [They are] just saying, 'Woah woah woah ... some of this stuff is trendy, teenagers can be trendy.'" He also argues that the prevalance of trans identities aren't specific to liberal areas: "Why would it be regional if it's a biological issue?" 
After hearing that awful take, my Good Egg sandwich turned rancid in my mouth. I couldn't finish breakfast until I had written at least a thousand words about this clown show of a man. Bless his heart, but Bill has no idea what he's talking about. Framing the issue as "surgery" is not simply dismissive, it is incorrect. Not every trans person receives (or wants to receive) gender-affirming surgery. The real issue is their right to safely live in accordance with their gender identity. Trans youth are disproportionately homeless; they are at a higher risk of suicide, violent crime, and hate crimes than cisgender individuals. Furthermore, right-wing media has reframed trans identities as a sexually deviant behavior, and tacitly encourages vigilante violence against trans individuals on the misled basis that they are groomers and pedophiles. The regional popularity of trans people has an explanation so obvious it feels redundant to say. When the culture around you discourages and mocks trans identities — especially if your state government restricts access to gender-affirming care or legislates how your school is allowed to treat trans students  — it may give you pause before coming out as trans to your family and community. Protecting transgender people is one of the greatest fights of our era, although I don't know to what extent us "Zoomers" would call it "the civil rights movement'' of our time (since there are other contenders). 
Wow, what a hot take Mr. Curvan. Good job. Thanks for letting us all know that you can fire out an opinion piece at the drop of a hat. But, how does that remotely relate to the title of your article?
I'm getting there. First, I want you to consider — why the hell was Bill Maher on CNN? His commentary on trans issues is so intellectually vacuous and devoid of understanding that it truly baffles me. Of course, that's a rhetorical question. He was there because generation-war commentary is his calling card. That's why he felt so qualified to speak about trans issues: because it's something those crazy Zoomers yap about, and he's the sage old man on TV who's gotta put these kids in their place. 
Recently, my attention was directed to a segment on his show where he talks about why young people need to "shut up" about climate change, pointing to the fact that Greta Thunberg has fewer Instagram followers than Kylie Jenner. He makes the scathing observation that Jenner "embodies and embraces a lifestyle that is pretty much the opposite of carbon neutral … and the younger generations fucking love it." He then accurately observes that Bitcoin mining consumes a ridiculous amount of electricity, "yet young people could not love it more if it came with a side of avocado toast." What a bizarre, unhelpful, completely nonsensical train of thought. He's pointing out the hypocrisy within Generation Z — a cohort of approximately 70 million individuals in the U.S. — just so he can regurgitate the same tepid avocado-toast jokes that we've heard a thousand times. It's not commentary, and it's barely comedy. 
The amount of snarky opinion pieces about how young people are ungrateful or lazy, or complaining about "Why are young people killing X industry?" is really frustrating. But, it would be unfair to claim generation war discourse is one sided. I'm reminded of a viral meme. It goes like this: "Remember when we cried as kids, and our parents said, 'I'll give you something to cry about.' We thought they were going to hit us, but instead they destroyed the housing market, melted the ice caps, and quadrupled college tuition." This resonates with a lot of young people, and I see variants of this meme make the rounds from time to time.
But, ultimately, we can't blame boomers, can we? Us young'uns love to blame them for the world we're inheriting, but it's not like generations are some sort of cohesive entity. Last week, I asserted that boomers fell for the "scam" of car ownership, because I think that's an accurate description of what happened. As angry as I am that I live in a country where we demolished dense, economically productive neighborhoods to make room for interstates and surface parking, I can't blame any individual person (except maybe Robert Moses). Our grandparents were all rational self-interested individuals who were sold a lie by the auto industry — something we're just as vulnerable to. Consider gig apps, like Uber and Doordash. Zoomers and Millennials flocked to these apps, but they rely on a replaceable workforce who is liable for their own equipment, and gets no benefits or job security. We allowed these apps to normalize on-demand, poorly-paying gig work, and I wouldn't hold it against Generation Alpha if they're bitter for us handing this problem down to them. Drawing lines between the generations is just another way of dividing people so they blame one another for their economic condition, as opposed to recognizing what actually melted the ice caps and destroyed the housing market — the myopic pursuit of profit incentivized by capitalism. 
Listen, Bill — because I know you're reading this — I can be kinda stupid. I'm not infinitely confident about my political views, and they will certainly change as I grow older. That's what time does. I'm not dismissive of what older people say, because they have perspective and wisdom that I lack. This isn't a tirade against my elders. I just find Maher's takes on young people frustrating and counterproductive. Please, don't go on CNN to talk about groups and issues about which you have no understanding.

My introduction to Shakespeare
I was brought to an English production of “Romeo and Juliet” at the age of nine, one of my mom’s try-hard attempts to make me more “cultured.” Nine-year-old me read through a modern translated synopsis of the play and tried my best to understand it through the vibrant Elizabethan-style clothes and the exaggerated dramatic expressions of Shakespearean lines. Even if I did fail to “capture the beauty” of the language or anything deeper beyond the story, I know I loved the plot. It was dramatic, turbulent, and involved kissing, which was a taboo for most Chinese kids before 16. After observing my excitement, my mom decided to make this an annual ritual. That’s how I know Shakespeare.
My excitement turned into  bitter fear after I was assigned “Macbeth” for English class at 15. We wrote weekly essays on how Lady Macbeth was unconventional, as she declared to be “unsexed” or how the three witches played a role in Macbeth’s downfall. As with all literature essays, it required close language analysis, but that’s impossible if you can’t comprehend 75 percent of the text and thus can’t grasp the exact meaning of iambic pentameter. The confusion was painful and that aftershock followed me as I knew I had to keep taking literature classes for the rest of my two years in high school.
It is true that I was slightly traumatized by those years of “Macbeth,” yet thinking back upon it, that’s precisely the reason why I was able to fall in love with Shakespeare.
King Lear
My favorite piece of Shakespeare is, perhaps, “King Lear” — as A.C. Bradly describes it to be Shakespeare’s greatest work but not his greatest play. “King Lear” is about the descent from “king to man” of the aged King Lear as he decided to split his land and power among his daughters depending on how flamboyant their profession of love for him is. Not only was he deceived by two of his ill-intentioned daughters, but he also decided to exile the only one that truly cared about him. Simultaneously, there was a parallel plot involving Gloucester and his sons where he was also deceived because he could not discern truth and cast out the loyal son. Not surprisingly, both men suffered a horrible fate. Although they had their flaws, many critics throughout the ages have argued whether they deserved such horrible endings. Lear descended into almost complete madness and in one scene runs around naked in a storm on a cliff in England, and Gloucester has his eyes gouged out by Lear’s two horrible daughters.
Undoubtedly, the story is tragic because everyone in the play dies in the end, and the supposed “good” suffer an even worse ending than their evil counterparts. In fact, the ending was so unbearable and tragic that in the 18th Century someone altered it so the good prospered and the evil met their “deserved” fate. “King Lear” made such deep imprints on those that experienced it to the fullest extent, but why?
Many if not all of Shakespeare’s works explore humanity to an unsettling extent. But in “King Lear,” his power transcends the work itself and captures our desire for that “happy ending.” Perhaps because of his dark years in the early 1600s after the death of his son Hamlet, Shakespeare observed something that was truly profound: Most of us might not meet our happy endings, at least not in the traditional sense. The apocalyptic undertone of “King Lear” is clear, especially in the last few lines — “Is this the promised end, / Or image of that horror? / Fall and Cease!” as it creates a solemn drum-like beat by fitting it in the feet of the play. Shakespeare mocks the world and the point of living in what I regard to be his greatest line, “When we are born, we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools,” by comparing our world to a puppet show with our fates predetermined.
Thus, upon the first few readings of “Lear,” that nihilistic pessimism is so dominating that we fail to observe the optimism that faintly shines beneath it. The blinded Gloucester dies after he reunites with his loyal son and the description of his death is perhaps the most beautiful description in literature: “his heart … burst smilingly.” Although the image is somewhat gruesome, it still seems to be the most perfect ending to such a tragic life (in which Gloucester attempted suicide) and makes us ponder if Gloucester’s death actually freed him from a fickle world of tragedy. Perhaps that was the happy ending, but just not the one that’s commonly understood. And Lear, although having experienced too much of the world, reached clarity; and despite not having food or shelter, he rediscovered love and wisdom. Gloucester and Lear, in fact, achieved something greater and more abstract than the materialistic and physical sense of life — understanding life and the concept of “c’est la vie.”
The Shakespearean Cocktail
While many argue that incorporating such difficult texts in the high school curriculum is the true murderer of interest, I invite you to consider how you would get someone to truly understand the greatness of Shakespeare. For instance, a play like “Lear” can struggle on stage. Not only is it extremely hard to produce because of technical difficulties, but how can you convey such a powerful message when the audience is simultaneously grappling with the plot and matching the actors to the characters amidst such “incomprehensible” language? To understand Shakespeare, one needs to immerse themselves in the play and simultaneously step outside of it to observe it in action, but that can be difficult in a production that only lasts an hour to two. Most importantly, how can you not be dissuaded from reading the text when it takes thirty minutes to understand a single page?
Shakespeare makes profound observations on life and humanity, and grasping it is a painful process that requires dedicated reading and most importantly a thorough introspection of oneself. Thus, each retelling and recount of Shakespeare’s work by different individuals is an autobiographically flavored cocktail.

Stop asking me to write about my political opinions.
In fact, stop asking me to articulate them at all. 
Call me a pessimist or an “uneducated Gen Z voter,” but I’m so disillusioned with the political system that I honestly don’t see the point in developing my own political philosophy anymore. As a voter, I’ll never actually see it represented in a candidate, leaving me to scramble to pick a candidate who gets it “close enough” (but really not at all close to what I think needs to be done). 
I see the current political landscape as a place where voters have to be reactionary. When presented with two unideal options, instead of trying to force one of them to fit the “perfect candidate” you have built in your head, just figure out which candidate is objectively “best” for you. There’s no way for us to magically create a person who represents all of our views, and then make that person run for office. Elections aren’t a series of open-ended essay questions on what we think politicians SHOULD do, but rather multiple choice questions that ask, “Which candidate is BEST for your city/state/country/world?” But how does this work in practice?
For me, unfortunately, it means I become a 1-2 issue voter. With the current party divisions and polarization, it means that there’s always a few hot button issues that either side will have opinions on regardless of the rest of the candidate’s platform, solely because they have become national issues. I think it’s unsurprising as a female college student living in a city that my line in the sand became abortion access and gay rights. 
But, it’s not just a matter of voting based on hot button issues; modern politics is heavily context driven. While I would love to make my decisions based on promises of solving our border issues and ending crime, I don’t feel like either of those issues are things that candidates can reasonably promise to solve. It becomes a feasibility issue. When choosing a candidate to vote for, I’m not just looking at all the issues on their platform, but looking at which issues that candidate has direct control over with minimal checks from other branches of government or other representatives from other areas. Frankly, this election, the issues I saw candidates having the most influence over were results of  the overturning of Roe v. Wade: abortion and issues in connected cases, like gay marriage and interracial marriage. There was a large amount of political capital opened up by that Supreme Court case, and this election determined who had the power to make use of it. 
And unfortunately for those of you who don’t want to put in the extra effort, yes this does mean you need to research each candidate, at least a little. Finding my vote/no vote issue wasn’t a matter of just voting down party lines because I could (although with the current set of issues and divisions, that is in fact what I did, just, you know, AFTER researching), but a matter of figuring out what each candidate had on their platform and what about their position gave them influence over that issue. Okay, yeah, it did happen to be mostly Democrats promising to protect abortion rights, but I wasn’t just going to assume that. 
And I’ll be honest — I see my two-part approach to choosing a candidate as a product of my high school debate career. I can discuss and argue just about anything, and I would, for the duration of 45 minutes — that is, if it won me the round. Finding some rational reason to see either side of an issue isn’t that hard. So, for me, if there’s an issue where I can’t find myself able to understand and argue for both candidates' options… whelp there’s my line in the sand, and that’s what decides my vote. 
Looking to future elections where there isn’t a landmark Supreme Court decision to create uniformity across candidate platforms on an issue I care about, I would hope that this approach would lead to a variety of candidates I support. Perhaps even overlapping between political parties. After all, I’m a registered independent and I plan on staying that way. I don’t WANT to go all in for a party because I do believe in some cases it leads to complacency among voters. But, when it comes to voting based on what I actually think will happen after a candidate takes office, yeah, I might vote Democrat down the ballot for at least a few more years.
If, after reading all of that, you still think I’m stupid for looking at candidates on a case-by-case basis and choosing which one I feel like I can’t support, let me give you a real-life example. 
My grandfather worked in local government for years and would tell everyone he knew he was a staunch Republican. But, when it came to what was best for his community, yes he did vote for policies that tended to favor the traditional Democratic viewpoint (a fact that he good-naturedly laughed at when pointed out to him once by my father). I don’t doubt that other members on his town board that were self-described Democrats also found themselves going along with my Republican grandfather on some policies.
When framed on this local level, it really does become a matter of choosing the policies that are best for the constituents, a matter of investigating the costs and benefits and choosing from a list of politically feasible options to find the one that has the most benefits for the community with minimal harms and costs for the town board. Similarly, these town board elections come down to choosing the representatives the community likes the most, not a battleground for political parties. 
It wouldn't be particularly helpful to ask, “How does this not translate to statewide and national elections?" Heck, sometimes it doesn’t even translate to city-wide elections. But, trying to view every election with the simplicity of “will this candidate DO anything that helps me or hurts me,” as is done in these local elections, is the best way for me to navigate politics right now. So the rest of you can keep your opinions to yourself. Or don’t – I’m always down for a good debate, especially if I know it’s not going to matter come election season. Having a one-on-one argument over politics isn’t going to make any candidate fit our viewpoints, so we might as well just work with what we’ve got.

As someone who crochets, one of the most frustrating things I hear on a semi-regularly basis is, “You should sell those!” Yeah, sure, let me get right on that. I’ll open an Etsy shop and send you the link, and you’ll proceed to buy nothing. I know how it goes. So please, stop telling me to monetize my hobbies.
I should preface this with the fact that I have a number of craft-related hobbies: mainly crochet, but I also do some embroidery and a smidge of knitting. These hobbies are one of the main ways I fill my time, and I really enjoy what I do (hence why I do it). I’m not doing it to turn a profit; I like gifting what I make to my friends and family, and I don’t expect anything in return. 
I think part of my problem is also knowing that if I priced what I made at a “reasonable” level, then the people that are telling me to sell what I make would be second-guessing what they were saying. For instance, I crocheted the “Harry Styles cardigan” for one of my friends; it was the first “wearable” that I had made and oh boy did it take much longer than I expected. I probably spent about 50-60 hours on it in total. 
Pricing it is the hard part, though. You have to take into account the cost of materials and labor. Though the yarn I used cost roughly $30 in total, I would price the cost of labor to be about $500 to $600 ($10 an hour), which is what is going to drive people away. That’s completely fair; I wouldn’t pay that much for a cardigan either! If I can get a flannel for five dollars at Goodwill, no matter how much I like Harry Styles (he’s mid), you’ll catch me wearing the flannel. 
I think what really bugs me is how ignorant some people can be about how much time and effort is put into crafts. Believe me, if I could crank out a blanket or a cardigan in less than 10 hours, I would be in debt due to yarn purchases. But alas, that is not how it works. I, thankfully, don’t have people in my life that ask me, “Can you make me one of those?” because if I did, I would be that much closer to having a breakdown.
But realistically, even if I hated myself enough to open an Etsy shop and price stuff much cheaper than I should, one of my biggest fears would be burning out. I honestly love crochet and crafts as a whole; it’s one of my favorite ways to spend my free time and I’m worried that if I make a “job” out of it, I’m not going to love it nearly as much as I do now. I know it’s cliche, but to me, crochet is very much about the journey (even though the destination is also very rewarding). 
Also, I’m a college student. I struggle to find free time as it is. When I’m not working or in classes, the honest reality is that half the time, I don’t want to do anything. While I enjoy my hobbies, there’s just something so rewarding about doing nothing as well. I don’t want to have to spend every second of my free time crocheting or thinking about crocheting; that’s no longer free time. As much as I would love to be a trophy husband who doesn’t need to work and can just crochet all day, that’s not going to be my future. 
So, please, the next time you hear someone does some sort of craft, don’t tell them that they should open an Etsy shop; if they wanted to, they already would have.

On Tuesday, vote cast their ballots in the midterm election. In a contentious vote with abortion on the ballot, the Carnegie Mellon community was called upon to exercise their vote. While everything from TikToks to medical emergencies were involved in this election, come Tueday the election simply happened. Democrats took both the gubernatorial election and the Senate race, and now we’re back writing an EdBoard about it. You may ask why. Why all the fuss, if it seems life merely returns to normal? 
Quite simply: that’s why. The inner workings of our everyday politics and policies are not just decided by fairies in some woodland forest, they are a result of tangible elections, the little circle you fill in on your ballot actually does something. While it may seem futile, especially in our disillusioned political world where it seems like no candidate is completely ideal, voting is actually one of the most important actions you can take as a citizen. 
Now, don’t stop reading.
I know that many of us have been bombarded by advertising, flyers, even people begging us to vote. But, it really is that important. Elections, even if they seem predetermined, are affected by individual action. Your choice to vote or not to vote does change the election. 
Pennsylvania Capital Star reports, “About 27 percent of voters aged 18-29 cast a ballot in Tuesday’s election, according to CIRCLE data, making this midterm cycle the second-highest youth voter turnout in almost three decades.” That’s sad! The highest percentage of youth voter turnout in decades is only about a quarter of eligible 18-29-year-old voters. However, even that much has had an enormous impact and advocacy groups like NextGenAmerica credit young voters with Democrats’ performance in the 2022 midterms. What this means is that every percentage, every vote, factors in. 
What this election should really demonstrate is the impact of voting, that there is something you can do to make your opinions heard in politics. While the world may be full of pandemics and hardship, there is something you can do about it. Is it perfect by any means? Absolutely, not. But it’s something. If you can even have a small say in issues from women’s rights to infrastructure, a say in who has power over the problems you want to solve, problems that do in fact affect your community, shouldn’t you use that power? If not for yourself, for the people around you? The people that perhaps don’t have that power?
There is no magic to politics, and, as far as we’re aware, no perfect world where the candidates on the ballot reflect exactly what you want to see. What our elections are about does not concern perfection, but rather making due with what we have to better our community.
