If you weren’t at Gesling Stadium last Friday evening, you missed out on a very memorable night at Carnegie Mellon University. The men’s soccer team, who had a terrific season overall after finishing first in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference and setting multiple records, unfortunately weren’t able to progress to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, this was quite the milestone for Carnegie Mellon, and our university was blessed to have one of its largest and loudest crowds come out to support the men’s team.
The large and rowdy crowd wasn’t just a result of giveaways from the university. It was the impressive play of the men’s soccer team throughout the year that gradually attracted more and more fans. For the first time in school history, the Tartans advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. Senior center-back Jon Hall was named to the ESPN the Magazine Men’s Soccer First Team Academic All-American of the Year for the second consecutive season; joining him on the first team for the first time this year were fellow seniors Ryan Browne, Ricky Griffin, Austin Good, and Keith Haselhoff. Meanwhile the senior offensive trio of Griffin, Browne, and Pat Lutz combined for 38 goals for the season. Griffin himself had 19 goals, putting his career total to an outstanding 51 goals, including a record five goals against St. Vincent’s College, and collected his second consecutive UAA Player of the Year award.
Despite an impressive and consistent performance throughout the season, the Tartans fell 2–1 to Calvin College, to end the year with a 16–3–1 season record. Carnegie Mellon easily beat Calvin in last year’s NCAA Tournament, 3–0. The only difference this year was that, ironically, the Tartans put out an even better team this year than from the year before. So why did they lose? Well, as the British say, “football is a funny game.”
Both teams came out playing disciplined defense, but unlike at other Carnegie Mellon home games, the Tartans weren’t able to attack with the same force. Two players seemed to be constantly covering Lutz, and Griffin couldn’t seem to find the space that he usually sees. As a result, most of the game was played in the midfield.
But late in the game, Calvin College found a way to get through to the Tartans’ end of the field and win a throw-in. Given that rare chance, Calvin made no mistake in taking advantage of the opportunity. One flick after another in the Tartans’ box led to a goal by Calvin substitute Chris Nance. Immediately, Carnegie Mellon’s head coach Aaron Lujan brought on sophomore forward Brad Edelman in hope of more attacking play. As the Tartans pushed up in search for an equalizer, Calvin College found Carnegie Mellon out of position and scored a second goal.
As all hope seemed to fade away, the persistent attackers for the Cardinal and Gray were able to notch their first of the game just 30 seconds later. The Tartans continued to press and nearly got a late tying goal late in the 89th minute when they were awarded a free kick just outside the Calvin box. Browne, who has had a sensational NCAA tournament, curled the ball to the far post, but Calvin College’s quick goalie Ryan Bratt just got his hand to the ball and swatted it away to clinch the game 1–2 for the Knights.
Despite having one of the best teams ever to play at Gesling Stadium, Carnegie Mellon must now look forward to next season. With the current underclassmen showing much promise and a student body that proved that it is very much alive, the Tartans will look to build upon this year’s success in 2010.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team finished their first week strong, opening the season at home and hosting the University Athletic Association (Ohio Athletic Association Challenge) with a perfect record of 3–0.
Last Monday was the Tartans’ home opener against Bethany College, and they tallied their first win of the season, 60–55. Carnegie Mellon was anxious to run as they took the early 7–4 lead before the Bison had five quick possessions and took their only lead of the game, 9–7. With 14:44 left on the clock, first-year forward Emily Peel hit a jumper, and two plays later, sophomore center Jacki Cortese scored a layup to regain the Tartan lead at 11–9. Heading into halftime, the Cardinal and Gray held a 28–25 lead.
In the second half, Carnegie Mellon’s biggest lead was 11 points, 50–39, with 4:10 to play in the game. The Bison did not let them off easy, going on a 10–4 run in the remaining minutes. The run proved too little too late, though, as Carnegie Mellon pulled out the 60–55 win.
Cortese led in scoring for both teams, tallying 16 points, including a perfect 8–8 performance from the free throw line. Peel recorded her first double-double with 13 points and a game-high of 13 rebounds.
Despite a strong start of the season, Cortese noted that in order to continue on a streak of success, “the team will need to keep its energy high and continue to learn how to respond to situations with more fluency on the court.”
These thoughts carried over to the Tartans’ next game as they hosted their third annual UAA(OAC) Challenge this past weekend. The squad pulled out a 69–61 win over Marietta College on Friday night.
Carnegie Mellon started out a little slow as Marietta scored two quick baskets in the first 1:23 of play. However, the Tartans scored the next 15 out of 16 points to take the lead of 15–5 with 12:26 left in the first half. With five minutes left in the first half, the Cardinal and Gray had a 28–16 lead, but Marietta scored nine straight points, cutting the score down to 28–25. Cortese answered with a three-point play, while sophomore Nicole Vacarella took a full court layout and a nailed a trey to end the half 36–25.
Marietta did not go down without a fight and came out strong for the beginning of the second half. The Pioneers went on a 9–2 run, but Carnegie Mellon answered with eight straight points, advancing the score to 46–34. Marietta first-year Brittany Metcalf started a 12–3 run, but it proved to be not enough as the Tartans made seven of eight free throws to seal the deal with a 69–61 win.
Cortese lead the way with a double-double, scoring 24 points and pulling down 10 rebounds. Fifth-year senior Rachelle Roll and sophomore Alex Hansen added eight points each, while Roll also grabbed eight rebounds.
On Saturday, the Tartans recorded a victory over John Carroll University in the last game of the UAA(OAC) Challenge, 75–69. Carnegie Mellon started out strong with a 13–4 lead in the first six minutes of play, but John Carroll slowly made a comeback and took the lead with 6:39 left in the first half at 26–24. Going into halftime, John Carroll held the lead at 36–30.
John Carroll started back strong to defend their lead, making the score 40–32. The Tartans fought back with a 10–2 run, ending with a trey by first-year Brit Philips to tie the score at 42–42. After the teams exchanged buckets, sophomore Jen Larsen hit a trey to take the lead to 47–46. The Cardinal and Gray did not give up their lead for the rest of the game, ending with a 75–69 victory.
Coach Gerri Seidl previously reflected on this season’s team: “The ’09–’10 squad is athletic. A healthy full squad gives us the ability to go deeper into the bench. We have a little more versatility. One player may be strong as a scorer while her counterpart is more defensively geared. We have the ability to rotate a variety of lineups. We have a long way to go, but this group comes to work every single day.”
The win over John Carroll showed this athleticism, versatility, and hard work that Coach Seidl mentioned and was a team effort. Cortese earned a double-double with 24 points and 12 rebounds, Larsen took 15 points and seven rebounds, Phillips scored 10 points and dished out six assists, and Peel added nine points and nine rebounds.
Larsen was named to the All-Tournament team, while Cortese was named the tournament’s most valuable player.
The Tartans will hit the hardwood next when they visit Grove City College on Tuesday for a 6 p.m. tipoff.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s cross country team traveled to Cleveland’s Highland Park Golf Course this past Saturday to compete at the NCAA Division III Championships. Sophomore Matt Jacob led the way for the Tartans to a 12th place finish at the meet, which was hosted by Baldwin-Wallace College. First-year Emily Wobb competed at NCAAs, serving as the sole representative of the women’s team.
The Tartans came into the meet looking to improve on their 13th place performance in 2008. This looked to be quite a challenge, as that Tartans team was led by ’09 graduate Brian Harvey’s ninth-place individual finish. But as junior J.P. Allera had said about the current team’s strength after they swept the Carnegie Mellon Invite, “We don’t have any guys really far up [in the rankings], but ... our spread was really low.” That low spread proved to be the difference this year, as the team managed to improve their team standing by one place despite their highest individual finish being 61st place.
That performance belonged to Jacobs, who crossed the finish line in 26:29.0, only 2.6 seconds ahead of junior Dan Addis, who came in 67th. Allera was right behind them, finishing in 26:34.1 for 73rd overall. Senior captain Dario Donatelli finished next for the Tartans, with a time of 27:03.3. The closeness of the group demonstrated exactly what Allera had talked about; last year, the Tartans’ top four finishes were ninth (Harvey), 54th (Donatelli), 145th (Breck Fresen ’09) and 168th (Addis).
Rounding out the field for the Tartans in Cleveland, junior Nate Bussiere crossed 5.5 seconds behind Donatelli, senior Chris Rizzo finished in 28:09.8, and junior Justin Kurp crossed six places later in 28:24.0.
“There were a few factors that led to the team’s higher finish this year; however, the main reason was that we were much closer as a team and were able to put together good races on the same day,” Donatelli said. “Last year, the team had a lot of potential but ... did not perform up to potential at nationals, but this year we had a much better performance on that day.
“I do feel that we accomplished what we set out to do. The goal was to finish better than last year, and we were able to.... I have high hopes for the team next year as they are only losing two runners and have a lot of experience, so they are in good shape for the future.”
Wobb’s participation in the meet was a result of her standout first year. She led the way for the Tartans at every meet en route to the championships, earning an at-large bid to compete after finishing seventh at last weekend’s Mideast Regional at Muhlenberg. Wobb finished 120th on Saturday, completing the race in 23:47.1.
Wobb and the rest of the women’s cross country team will look to build off their performances this year as they head into 2010. The men’s team also will prepare to compete next fall.

The Carnegie Mellon University swimming and diving team defeated the University of Rochester and Washington & Lee University in a dual meet hosted by the Tartans on Saturday. The women topped Rochester 167–90 and W&L 165–92 while the men defeated Rochester 189–71 and W&L 153–107 in what was the teams’ last tuneup before Kenyon’s Nike Cup in two weeks.
The Tartan women won every single event in the meet, with junior Molly Evans raking in a win in the 1000-yard freestyle in 10:33.02, the 100-yard backstroke in 1:00.44, and the 200-yard backstroke in 2:11.89. First-year Dorothy Yu also scored points for the team, winning the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke. Senior Sara Andrews also pulled out a win in both of her events, swimming the 200 freestyle with an impressive time of 1:58.67 and the 100-yard freestyle in 54.89. Sophomore Victoria Adams was victorious in the 500-yard freestyle, touching in with a time of 5:18.83 while fellow teammate sophomore Hannah Gonzalez took victories in the 200- and 100-yard butterfly.
“[Both teams] swam spectacularly yesterday, and it feels good to win because it puts us in a better spot for Nike Cup,” Yu commented.
Others that contributed to the team to lead them to their win were sophomore Jen Sung, who finished second in the 1000- (10:59.89) and 500-yard freestyle (5:24.11) and third in the 200-yard butterfly. First-year Breanna Stillo stood second in the 100-yard breaststroke behind Yu with a time of 1:09.25 before pulling out a win in her 50 freestyle with a time of 25.26, just second to junior teammate Brianne Burton by .01.
Junior Rebecca Ussai, who placed second in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly, was happy with her swimming  yesterday, saying, “I felt like I had a great meet because I was excited to face the strong competition. The men’s and women’s team both had a great meet and won by a large margin.”
The victory over W&L was special for the men’s team, as it was the first time they had won in the past four years. First-year Dan Glaser-Garbrick had a great meet, winning the 100- and 200-yard butterfly and the 200-yard individual medley. 
Junior Justin Whaley stood second in 1:57.65 behind Glaser-Garbrick in the 200-yard butterfly. Junior Alex Hanson also swam well, winning the 200-yard freestyle and finishing right after Glaser-Garbrick in the IM with a time of 1:58.95. Hanson was able to just touch out senior Jon Spring in the 200 free, winning by .13 over Spring’s 1:46.59. Senior Andrew Seo, competing in the final dual meet of his collegiate career, won both the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke. In the 100-yard breaststroke, senior Jason Huber also swam well, finishing second with a time of 1:00.30, and in the 200 breaststroke, sophomore Michael Rong was able to place second with a time of 2:15.64.
Glaser-Garbrick commented on his success yesterday: “It was fun, but I know it’s only one small victory and next time, it’s a whole new race.”
For the long-distance events, The Tartans swept the field with senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki winning the 500- and 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 4:46.79 in the 500 and 9:40.14 in the 1000. Junior Frank Olechnowicz touched in second in the events, with senior Gates Winkler finishing out the race placing third in both events.
The divers dominated as well for Carnegie Mellon, as sophomore Olivia DeFazio won both the 1-meter and 3-meter events for the women and the group of senior Matt Kuhn and sophomores Eli Fatsi and Mike Alexovich took the top three spots on both boards for the men.
The team will next compete at the Nike Invitational hosted by Kenyon College on Dec. 3 through Dec. 5.
Jonas Altman-Kurosaki is a Sports Co-editor for The Tartan.

During the opening round of the NCAA Division III Men’s Soccer Championship, senior Ryan Browne put up an impressive three goals across the two games, scoring twice against Thomas Moore and clinching the win over Medaille College on a penalty kick. Browne’s performance helped advance the Tartans to the sectionals round of the tournament for the first time in Carnegie Mellon’s history.
The University Athletic Association (UAA) also recognized Browne for his efforts, naming him Men’s Soccer Athlete of the Week.
Such success is no strange feat for Browne, who has been a four year starter for the Tartans. Along with serving as a consistent driving force from the midfield, Browne has tallied numerous national honors from College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), the UAA, and the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). Most recently, Browne joined a handful of his teammates in being named Academic All-Americans by ESPN the Magazine. 
A native of Pittsburgh, Browne notes the small feel of a big city and the convenience of being close to his family as bonuses of going to school at Carnegie Mellon.
Browne stays involved in the world of student athletes, serving on the Student Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC) to promote school spirit within the campus community while also connecting with surrounding communities through mentoring and outreach initiatives.
Browne will head to New York City after graduation to work for Citigroup in their Capital Markets division.
Before he goes, he has some parting words for his underclassmen: “Whatever it is you do in your life, always strive for perfection and to be the best. It is important that you never become complacent and just satisfied with where you are. Always have a drive for bigger and better things and have the discipline to put in the hard work and time and you will succeed.”
Browne has clearly been following his own advice over his career at Carnegie Mellon and can be proud of his noteworthy athletic and academic accomplishments.

The Carnegie Mellon University men’s basketball team traveled to Wooster, Ohio, to compete in the College of Wooster’s Al Van Wie/Rotary Tournament. The Tartans lost their game on Friday to Wooster 74–61 before pulling out a 72–65 win against Heidelberg College on Saturday. The Tartans’ record is now 1–2.
Trailing for the first half against Wooster, sophomore Joe Kromka played well as he hit a jumper with 1:05 on the clock. During the second half, the Tartans went on a seven-point run to try to catch up with 12:30 to play, but Wooster responded with a seven-point run as well. The Tartans fought back at the end of the game, but Wooster was able to hold fast for the 13-point win.
Tartan senior Jack Anderson contributed to the game, raking in 21 points, along with senior Jon Wolleben and sophomore John Duhring, each adding 10 points to the score. 
First-year guard Christian Shepley, who played 24 minutes during the game, was disappointed with the loss against Wooster: “Unfortunately our team just made too many mistakes in the beginning of the game to be able to catch back up to Wooster and give ourselves a chance to win,” he said.
On Saturday, the men’s team competed in the consolation game of the tournament again Heidelberg College. Junior Matt Pettit played a great game with a career-high 28 points to the team, leading the Tartans to the 72–65 win. Carnegie Mellon trailed Heidelberg after the first half, 29–34, but the Tartans were able to gain momentum during the second half and took a 44–43 lead with 14:09 on the clock on Pettit’s layup. The Tartans and Heidelberg volleyed with the lead, tying the score four times during the second half. Pettit also raked in a team-high 11 rebounds. Anderson also recorded a double-double for the men’s team, earning 17 points and 10 rebounds.
Pettit commented on the game yesterday, saying, “It felt good to contribute to our team’s win. I was definitely able to feed off our team’s intensity in the second half and capitalize on it. However, this is just the beginning for us: We will continue to get better as a team.”
The Tartans return home with their 19th annual Radisson Carnegie Mellon Invitational on Saturday with tip-off at 3 p.m. The Tartans will then play against either Hood College or Manhattanville College at 3 p.m. on Sunday.

When the average individual thinks about college sports, often Division I powerhouse teams such as University of North Carolina or the University of Pittsburgh come to mind. Division III sports receive no respect because many people believe that Division III is merely for athletes who couldn’t make a Division I team. However, any top D3 athlete knows that they can compete with some of the top teams in D1, and many of the students at Carnegie Mellon are realizing this as well.
Just last Friday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team competed in their first ever NCAA Sweet 16. And possibly for the first time, the stands at Gesling Stadium were filled to capacity. Some people may say it was the free pizza and T-shirts, but after attending the game, that was definitely not the case. Posters and T-shirts littered the stands. Avid fans dressed up in red to show their support for the Tartans. The crowd was definitely an impact on the game, due to the various cheers that almost propelled the Tartans to an amazing comeback.
Overall, the Tartans’ sports have been making a greater impact on the typical student’s life than many people realize. The past few weeks, the hype of this particular soccer game was off the charts. One of the Facebook events for the game reported that over 400 people were coming to the game, and that number was definitely reached.
Also, the men’s tennis team recently came off a huge victory over number 2 ranked Amherst College. This win was the most memorable victory in men’s tennis and vaulted this improving program into the top 10 for the first time in history. Their women’s counterpart has solidified their top five ranking after coming off another strong fall season. The women’s tennis team has consistently been ranked in the top 10 for the past three years. With good coaching and hard-working players being recruited for all sports, Carnegie Mellon sports will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.
As the Tartan athletes become a force to be reckoned with, so is the fan support. With a few victories and continued effort from fans to show up to sports games, Carnegie Mellon can diversify its talents to become recognized not only as having strong academics and groundbreaking research, but also as a formidable opponent on the field. Fans are becoming more attached to the teams, and this support will create a more unified student body. To quote one of the chants from Friday’s soccer game, many will proudly say they are “A Tartan till I die, I will always be a Tartan till I die.”

Last weekend, Carnegie Mellon hosted the Siemens Competition, a research competition that brings together brilliant high school students from across the country. 
Funded by the Siemens Foundation and overseen by the College Board, the Siemens Competition was created in 1997 to promote innovations in the fields of math, science, technology, and engineering. 
Students from six regions in the United States have the opportunity to work individually or with a group (usually an accredited university) on a project of their choosing.
Carnegie Mellon was responsible for hosting the Section Four regional finalists this weekend. 
On Friday, the 25 winning students showcased their presentations in Rangos Hall for family, friends, judges, professors, students, and everyday citizens to view. The teams stood by their posters outlining their methods and conclusions in solving various problems.
Noted speakers at the event included Eric Grotzinger, Mellon College of Science’s associate dean for undergraduate affairs; Jim Whaley, the Siemens Foundation’s president; and Chuck Gordon, CEO and president of Siemens Corporation. They praised the students for the contributions to research. 
“The need for innovation has never been greater,” Gordon said. The next step in these students’ journey is the national competition in New York City on Dec. 7.
The research groups involved took up a wide variety of topics:
1: Anirudh Nandan, Michelle Leonetti, Salonee Shah
This group worked on reducing the formation of scars after an injury. Although scar tissue aids in the healing of wounds, it is of an inferior quality compared to the normal tissue that is found in the body.
The group tested different materials that could be used to support healthy tissue formation in the body and would potentially reduce scar tissue formation. They tested not only different gels (with compositions similar to human skin), but also a fiber created by electrospinning. This is a technique that allows the fiber to be very fine and thin, making it resemble the fibers in the extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix is the substance in which all cells in a tissue are suspended. Applying the treatment at different angles can affect the placement of scar tissue and induce a more rapid recovery.
2: David Park, Erica Chung
This group had two major goals: to characterize five different antibodies that may be able to prevent hepatitis C and to develop a model that will test for the agents that cause hepatitis C. 
They were primarily concerned with two envelope proteins — E1 and E2 — which were specifically designed to target liver cells.
3: Ruoyi Jiang
Jiang tested the drug Paclitaxel (or Taxol) on microtubules in cells. Microtubules are one of the proteins that help maintain the skeletal structure of the cells. More importantly, microtubules are required during cell division as they help pull chromosomes to different ends of the cell for segregation. 
Taxol interferes with the functioning of microtubules, causing them to resist mitosis and causing the cell to undergo apoptosis (self-induced death). He used newly developed computer programs to simulate the action of the drugs on the microtubules, and this technology could be applied to any biological mechanism, allowing the discovery of the most effective drugs quickly.
4: Shaunak Bakshi, Peter Massey
This group attempted to find a treatment for Alzheimer’s in fruit flies. A protective antioxidant called alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to improve memory performance, and they observed its effect on Alzheimer-causing plaque deposits in the brain. 
They also used a method of olfactory associative learning — learning related to the sense of smell — in which they put the flies through Pavlovian shock avoidance techniques by associating an electric shock with a specific smell.
5: Cynthia Chen
Chen looked for a treatment for Fragile X syndrome, a mental disability. The syndrome is caused by the loss of the protein FMRP, which results in defective synapses, which are the connections between neurons. 
Chen researched the DNA mutation that prevents FMRP synthesis, in addition to a molecule that helps bind RNA and induce protein production. Chen was hopeful about the prospects of the project in the future. “[The project] may lead to the design of effective therapy that can replace the activity and proper function of FMRP.”
6: Jason Shieh
Shieh studied acute lymphoblastoma leukemia (ALL), which is the proliferation of lymphoid tissue. 
Lymphoid tissue contains a number of white blood cells and is mainly concerned with protecting the body from infections. 
Shieh tested several factors of the disease, including the ALL cells’ interactions with other cells, the development of an in vitro cell culture system, and the application of this culture system to other leukemia specimens.
7: Cathy Zhou, Israt Ahmed, Stephanie Chen
This group used ESR spectroscopy to find the uranium concentration in an Equus tooth found in Russia. 
This type of analysis involves exciting electrons and analyzing the resultant magnetic field.
This method allowed the group to determine the age of the tooth.
8: Jiayi Lin, Ellis Darby
This group used optical tweezers, which use a laser beam to combine opposing forces in order to trap very small particles. 
The group studied “Brownian vortexes,” a new type of heat engine that employs a third force to cause particles to move in a circle. 
With this, scientists can move molecular particles without actually touching them or puncturing the membrane in which they are located.
9: Joshua Pfeffer
Pfeffer researched a mathematical model called the Super Kähler-Ricci Flow, a better version of the Ricci flow. The Ricci flow defines the curvature of several geometric surfaces that look flat up close but appear curved from far away (much like how we perceive the Earth to be flat). 
The Ricci flow only works in lower-dimensional space (3-D or 4-D), so Pfeffer invented a mathematical tool that would define such surfaces in higher-dimensional space.
10: Kevin Zhao
Zhao used a molecular simulation to observe the harmful effects of oxidized DNA — which is modified DNA that has been acted upon by molecules that contain oxygen — and its removal by the MutM protein. 
“Our DNA is under attack by reactive oxygen species,” he explained. He noted an energy barrier between DNA with an oxygen group attached and DNA without it — it was more energetically favorable for the MutM protein to remove the DNA with the oxygen group.

The Starship Enterprise of Star Trek fame has been sailing through the Final Frontier for years. Today it is hard to imagine a source of enough energy to keep a ship operating at warp drive so effortlessly. Living in the age of fossil fuels severely restricts our attempts at boldly going out into space. There have been numerous proposals of alternate propulsion schemes over the years, but the most notable of the various ideas is that of the solar sail. 
Solar sails use light to propel spacecraft. Light is made up of a number of particles called photons. Each of these photons has an associated momentum. Just as two colliding marbles exchange momentum, a photon is capable of transferring some of its momentum to any object it may collide with. This transfer of momentum is maximized when photons bounce off the body, in a well-known phenomenon called reflection.
A single photon, or even a large stream of photons, produces no perceptible acceleration to a body of a macroscopic size on Earth. This is why we do not feel the constant bombardment of photons from every light source around us. In the vacuum of space, however, there is no resistance offered by gases, and while still not perceptibly larger, there is an increase in the amount of force photons exert on a body. Naturally, a body with a large surface area for the photons to bounce off will experience a larger force. Furthermore, if the body is lighter, according to Newton’s Second Law, it will be accelerated faster. This is the basic concept behind the use of solar sails.
Solar sails are sheets of mirror-like materials that are made such that they are extremely light and have as large a surface area as is permissible by their weight constraints. These “sails” are attached to spacecraft and are allowed to rotate so as to reflect as much sunlight as possible (as sunlight is, again, just streams of photons). The ship with the solar sails is steered by orienting the sail so as to reflect the incident light. The ship will always accelerate only perpendicularly to the vanes of the sails, and this provides a convenient means of steering the craft.
Conventional rockets carry more fuel for propulsion than the intended payload. This large amount of fuel does not last long enough to propel a spacecraft to the farthest ends of our solar system. Though Voyager 1 did manage to travel out as far as the Kuiper Belt (an asteroid belt at the edge of our solar system), it did so using the gravity of the planets it passed to propel it (a technique known as swing-by) and did not rely solely on fuel. 
Today, the use of the solar sail seems the most promising means to sustain a voyage in space indefinitely. Calculations by NASA have shown that solar sails, if made light and large enough, can accelerate a spacecraft many times faster than conventional rockets. While the acceleration is small, over time, these sails can cause the craft to travel at speeds that would allow it to travel to the edge of our solar system in around 5 years (compared to the 12 years it took Voyager 1). As a result of such studies, there have been a number of proposals for materials for the solar sails. These proposed materials should also be heat resistant, as they will be continually exposed to light. The materials may be complex chemical compounds such as Kapton or Mylar or might even be sheets of aluminum-coated carbon fiber. Energy Science Laboratories have created a material that, while thicker than standard sails, is manufactured so as to be porous. This reduces the weight of the sail to around the same as that of standard solar sails while making them easier to produce.
One problem encountered with solar sails is that they cannot be assembled here on Earth and then shot into space. The sails are fragile and are highly susceptible to damage in Earth’s atmosphere. Some materials are so fragile they cannot be unfolded by any method known to us today without tearing the sails. The sails therefore have to be carefully unfolded or assembled in space before they can begin operating as intended. 
NASA is currently working on a number of projects related to materials for the solar sail, including some to make them sturdier. In less than a year, Louis Friedman and his team of scientists at the Planetary Society will launch LightSail 1, one of the first light-driven spacecraft ever. This ship will carry almost no payload but is meant for testing purposes, following which, over the next three years, more flights will be scheduled. The ultimate aim of the project is to send LightSail into deep space using no fuel. In three years, it should become clear how viable a solution solar sails are to the problem of interstellar propulsion. By then, we should also feel less envious of Captain James Kirk; only a little less envious, though, as we still have to work on the transporter and the phaser.

Dede Koswara, an Indonesian man, had been nicknamed “Treeman” for a large portion of his life. At first glance, any hints of normal pairs of arms, hands, legs, and feet were nonexistent — they had been covered by 13 pounds of a massive, thick structure that resembled the color and texture of curved tree roots and bark more than they resembled anything human. As reported in an article in The Sun, Koswara was not in pain but was unable to move his hands — his former life as a fisherman was eventually replaced by that of a freak show performer. 
Despite his condition, Koswara was hopeful that doctors would be able to find a cure, and eventually they did — doctors discovered that Dede had a rare form of a human papillomavirus, or HPV, an infection of the skin. Human papillomavirus infections are caused by a papillomavirus, a virus that can enter the body through cuts and other small wounds, called microtraumas. Due to the mechanism with which the virus replicates, it can only infect body surface tissues, such as the skin or the outer layers of the mouth. Once inside the body, the virus replicates its DNA in host cells, after which causes the host cell to die, releasing more virus material. The process is then repeated, multiplying the number of viruses quickly.
HPV may be commonly thought of as a sexually transmitted infection, but this is not necessarily the case. There are over one hundred types of human papillomaviruses that have been identified, which are classified numerically. Different types infect specific parts of the body, causing specific reactions. Some are benign and asymptomatic while others can cause warts; certain types of HPV can even cause cancer. There are proteins in the body that usually function to suppress tumor formation, but the cancer-causing papillomaviruses have the ability to inactivate these.
While HPV would be the cause of Koswara’s warts, there is an underlying genetic reason as to why his condition spun out of control. 
Koswara has a recessive genetic disorder known as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which is characterized in part by an increased susceptibility to HPV. The few who have had this disorder have been distinguished by the abnormal quantity and size of warts that grow on their hands and feet. 
Warts will also grow on the rest of their body, including their head, but with less intensity and frequency than those on their limbs.
Currently, the cause for this genetic disorder is unknown, but the specific genes that are mutated have been located. Researchers propose that the genes affected are responsible for proper zinc distribution inside cells. In a normal individual, zinc is properly stored to suppress viral protein formation, since zinc is vital for viruses. In afflicted individuals, virus suppression is limited, resulting in an uncontrolled growth of warts and papules on the skin.
Eventually, Koswara underwent many surgeries to remove the warts that had hindered his life. After nine surgeries, over 12 pounds of warts had been removed from his body — a power saw had to be used to remove those on his hands. Still, what used to be a tangled, thick mass of growths was reduced to the shape of a human hand. Fingers were distinguishable; Koswara, previously unable to eat, write, or perform other activities that required fine motor skills, was now able to regain normal function, including the ability to use a cell phone. However, the warts regrew; doctors will have to perform two surgeries every year for the rest of his life. Koswara will never be fully rid of his condition, but his life is no longer threatened.

Sleeping helps memory storage
In a new study published in Science, researchers from Northwestern University indicated that sleeping is an important aid in memory development. This is different from the strategy of learning in one’s sleep, which has been generally disproven in scientific studies. Participants were told to remember the location of 50 separate objects on a screen, each accompanied by a sound. Those who took naps shortly after learning were better able to recall the association than the control group which did not nap. The sleeping group had the sound linked to the association played to them while asleep.
While the study provides interesting results, it raises more questions than it resolves. Applications such as studying while listening to music and then listening to the music while sleeping are intriguing, but John Rudoy, the author of the paper, explained that more work is needed.

California limits television energy usage
This past Wednesday, California became the first state in the nation to impose limits on how much energy television sets can consume. The new California Energy Commission regulation aims to reduce TV power drain by 33 percent by 2011 and 50 percent by 2013. The rules apply to all televisions sold in California except those larger than 58 inches. Because California represents such a large segment of consumers, these regulations will have widespread effects.
With flat-screen sets replacing older cathode ray tube televisions, the energy drain has increased in recent years and is estimated at 10 percent of household electricity usage in California. Environmental advocates hope that the reduction in television energy consumption, along with other energy reforms, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3 million metric tons in the next 10 years.

Mammogram report creates controversy
A report released Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent company, stating that women should not get routine mammograms until age 50 has come under fire over the past week. The report justifies its decision not to recommend screenings between age 40 and 50 by claiming that false positives cause unnecessary stress given the number of actual positive cases. 
A number of organizations have opposed the report, saying that traditional recommendations of regular mammograms after age 40 are important for early detection of breast cancer. The American Cancer Society and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) both opposed the findings. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and the White House noted that the report does not reflect government policy and that government programs will continue to support regular screenings.

Just like those smart students in your class who know exactly how to solve a problem after just reading the question, experienced cooks hold sharp, eight-inch chef’s knives confidently. From a distance, they can tell if the pasta is uncooked, and once an egg is cracked out of its shell, they know if that particular egg is fresh or not. 
In an attempt to make the kitchen and cooking more approachable, I have compiled this list of what I do in my own kitchen. With a better basic knowledge of working in the kitchen, some of you will find peace and joy in cooking.
Cold cuts
Remember high school chemistry? An object at a lower temperature has less molecular movement, and this applies to everything in the kitchen, as well. Meat, cheese, and vegetables are firmer when they are cooler. 
Think about crunchy, cold salad: The vegetables are easier to chop when cool. Chilled meat is also easier to cut because it holds its shape better. 
While cutting meat, make sure to cut it across the grain. The grain in meat is the muscle fiber, and you want to cut across the muscle fiber as it makes for tender meat. 
Seasoning
Caramelize when you can. This is not referring to caramel sugar candy but browning onions, chicken, and steak. The brown color that catches onto vegetable or meat as you cook is because the natural sugar is being caramelized, and this imparts more flavor to the food. 
Onion can bring magic to many dishes. The flavors of onion are transformed when it is cooked differently, and adding onion in various ways to a dish lends a rounder sweetness to the dish. When boiled, onion imparts its sweet flavor to the boiling water and you get a sweet broth. The onion itself becomes translucent and soft. When onion is sauteed in oil, the water in onion evaporates at lower temperatures than oil or butter, and with less water, the sugars and other minerals in the onions are more concentrated, giving them a stronger, sweeter, caramelized flavor. Different cooking methods impart different flavors for a reason.
Aside from salt and pepper, many kinds of natural flavoring give a more complex flavor, and one can end up with something striking. Think of salty bacon in omelets, soy sauce in stir-fry, grated Parmesan over pasta, and honey in place of sugar. 
Measuring correctly
American recipes measure amounts in volume and not by weight, so scooping out flour from a dense flour bag will give you more flour than needed. The actual amount of flour you get varies significantly. The ideal way to measure a dry ingredient is to spoon the ingredient into the measuring cup for consistent density. In practicality, stir the dry ingredient to prevent any lumps and dense areas before measuring, and then level off the dry ingredient with the dull side of the knife. 
Not all sugars are equal
Granulated sugar, light brown sugar, and dark brown sugar cannot be substituted in baking like they can incooking. They are chemically different. Brown sugar has higher molasses content than white granulated sugar. Baking with brown sugar when the recipe asks for white sugar can give you a very dense cake. Most of the time, brown sugar, both light and dark, can be use in savory dishes. The milder sweet taste it provides is not as aggressive as white sugar. 
Read the textbook and follow the equation
Follow the recipe the first time. You don’t have to like the first taste. Tasting is a matter of personal preference, and you can identify what you don’t like and make the change next time.
If you don’t follow the recipe, and something is messed up, you don’t know where exactly you went wrong. Knowing exactly what you put in for the first time and understanding how the resulting flavor developed from each ingredient is crucial. After good practice, you will gain a sense of how each ingredient contributes.
This kitchen sense — how a dish is built up from simple flavors — will take you a long way in cooking. Once you’ve become a seasoned cook, you can see, smell, and taste the dish by just reading the recipe.

Would you like green eggs and ham?
Are you kidding, Sam-I-Am? Most readers would jump at the chance to taste some of the delicious-sounding treats described between the covers of a book.
In order to keep readers from ruining their favorite books by drooling over fictitious food, here are some recipes for snacks straight out of well loved literature. Plan to spend a day with your friends and a well stocked kitchen, and get ready to make food that you’ve only read about before. Just remember to save some to munch on the next time you open your favorite book!
“Eat Me” cookies
Alice in Wonderland
Although they won’t make you magically grow or shrink, these cookies are great to eat while following Alice’s adventures, and they are far better than mock turtle soup.
Ingredients:
1 stick of ready-made refrigerated sugar cookie dough
1 can of vanilla icing
Tubes of colored icing of your choice with writing tips
If you’re a cookie purist, you can, of course, make your own dough, but it’s easier to use a store-bought tube of cookie dough to make these delicious cookies. Just slice the tube into cookies, bake, and after waiting for the cookies to cool, cover them with a thin layer of the white vanilla icing. Pick out a colored tube of icing with a special narrowed tip for writing, and write “EAT ME” in multicolored letters on each cookie.
Plum puffs
Anne of Green Gables
(Adapted from Food & Wine Magazine)
Travel to Avonlea with these delicious plum puffs. They are Anne’s adopted mother Marilla’s specialty, and she promises that they make everything better.
Ingredients:
All-purpose flour
1 14-ounce package all-butter puff pastry (thawed)
6 plums, cut into small wedges
1/4 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling
1 1/3 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 large egg, beaten
Preheat oven to 375 °F and cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle flour over a clean countertop or table and roll out the pastry to about 1/8 inch thick and cut it into six-inch squares. Put the squares on the baking sheet and freeze them for about five minutes.
Toss the plum wedges in a bowl with the sugar, cornstarch, and cardamom, and mix well. Then spoon a helping of this mixture into the center of each pastry square. Take the corners of a square and pinch them together to seal the mixture inside. Do this for all of the pastries, and then pinch the seams closed at the bottom of the pastries while leaving some space open near the top. Bake for about 25 minutes.
Aunt Petunia’s violet pudding
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
More than one reader groaned inwardly when a misguided house-elf caused Aunt Petunia’s delicious-sounding violet pudding to tip over onto the floor. Now you can make the pudding yourself, but make sure you first give some laundry to any house elves that might be hiding around your room.
Ingredients:
1 package of vanilla Jell-O pudding mix (8 servings)
Purple food dye
Sugar cake decorations (flowers are preferable)
2 bananas, 1 carton of strawberries, 1 carton of blueberries
1 canister of whipped cream
First make the pudding, adjusting the amount you use depending on the number of people you’re serving, but feel free to make a lot because this treat keeps well. Follow the directions on the label, and then add the purple food dye until it’s just the right shade of violet. Pour the pudding into a bowl and layer the top with thick slices of bananas, followed by thin slices of strawberries. Squirt the whipped cream liberally on top — make a mountain if you feel like it — and then sprinkle the blueberries on top of this Mt. Everest of sugar and decorate with the sugared flowers.
These are just a few of the many delicious recipes mentioned in books. If you’re still feeling hungry after trying these treats, attempt making some pasta puttanesca from A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning, rout cake from Emma, or rice pudding from A Winter’s Tale. Have fun eating, reading, or doing both at the same time!

When one thinks about all of the amazing things that Pittsburgh has to offer, high-quality Japanese cuisine doesn’t typically come to mind. However, here in the area around Carnegie Mellon, we have a wide selection of Japanese restaurants at students’ disposal. Carnegie Mellon students have always had fantastic, tasty, and affordable sushi available just a short walk away.
Why eat sushi?
Sushi is high in protein, low in fat, and contains omega-3 fatty acids that help prevent diabetes and blood clots. While one should always be aware of the origin of the fish and seafood to limit parasitic risk, overall, sushi is a low-risk, healthy meal option.
When looking for an exciting new restaurant or just a place to grab some lunch, consider these sushi venues, all within walking distance of campus.
Sushi Too
Chances are you’ve seen their sushi boxes around campus, but have you ever tried Sushi Too fresh at Resnik Café? The pre-boxed sushi makes for a nice meal whether studying late at the library or catching a quick lunch at the UC, but venture over to Resnik House for fresh, personalized rolls made right in front of you.
“I love eating the campus sushi,” said Ryan Oksenhorn, a first-year CIT student. “It’s a quick, easy, and light meal. It’s not like much of the other campus options — all fried and greased. They make you feel slowed down and unhealthy.”
Not feeling like fish? The chefs at Sushi Too will gladly whip you up a medley of vegetable rolls. Cucumber, asparagus, and fresh avocado rolls, served with a hint of ginger and wasabi, make for a healthy and tasty lunch alternative. The best thing about Sushi Too: the convenience. Not having to leave campus for your appetizing sushi snack is always a positive.
Sakura
Sakura Teppanyaki & Sushi is perfect for an elegant meal. Situated right off Forbes in Squirrel Hill, Sakura is a short walk for Carnegie Mellon students and is well worth the trip.
Whether you’re entertaining parents for a weekend or treating your significant other to a classy dinner, Sakura has the perfect atmosphere. While the prices aren’t significantly low, the sushi is fresh and incredibly well-prepared.
“I especially like the specialty rolls,” said Collin Burger, a first-year in CIT. “Every time I go, there is something different on the menu. They like being super creative with their specials. Just last week they had this deep fried roll called the Green Fuji Roll. Fried sushi was a first for me; that was interesting.” Creativity has definitely become a facet of the Sakura chefs. The owners, Fengping Geng and Feng Gao, love to inspire diversity with their weekly menu changes.
“Last time I was there,” Burger said, “I got this special called the spicy tuna sandwich. It was this mound on rice just smothered in the best-tasting tuna and avocado. I swear, it was the single best thing I have ever tasted.”
Oishi Bento
Located in a small nook right near the University of Pittsburgh on Oakland Avenue, this restaurant offers its customers fast, cheap, and delicious Korean and Japanese cuisine.
The upside: You can get more than enough food for under five dollars. With teriyaki bento boxes, rolls of sushi, and soups galore, Oishi is well-priced and speedy with its delivery. The downside: Getting a table can be nearly impossible. Oishi customers follow a specific procedure — you order your food at the register and then claim property on one of the two floors of seating. The only problem is that since Oishi is a pretty popular place, it can be difficult to find a table.
“I brought a couple of my friends to Oishi just last week,” said Eliot Knudson, a first-year in H&SS. “They had never 
been there, but they loved it. My advice: If you have a bigger party, try going earlier in the evening so you can get a table.”

Rituals play a role in many parts of life, from day-to-day habits like brushing one’s teeth after getting up in the morning to religious ceremonies. The flow of university semesters, the semiannual registration for classes, even the passing of the seasons is a kind of a ritual in its eternal cycle.
Last Friday at 7 p.m. at The Frame Gallery, senior art and dramaturgy major Molly McCurdy and junior dramaturgy major Lauren Parks staged a production centered on the presence of rituals in our lives. Upon entering Pantheon of Neologisms, visitors were met with a fantasy-like area in which the exhibit was acted out. Multicolored streamers hung from the ceiling, swinging in the dim light as a carousel horse hung overhead and a wooden mummy-like sculpture leaned against a wall. A silent montage of film clips flickered against a wall, as a mixture of chanting songs played in the background.
Everywhere visitors looked, they saw objects juxtaposed out of their own worlds and into The Frame. The production space was divided into four sections that corresponded to the four seasons.
McCurdy and Parks began the production with spring and performed their way through all of the seasonal areas in order, acting out various rituals along the way. In the spring cave, constructed with fairy lights and hung linen, they played with flowers; they then played ball games on a trampoline in the summer area, in which hundreds of blue and white plastic bags were fastened to the walls.
The autumn area consisted of a swathe of flags and tapestries creating a canopy over a sitting area constructed with pillows, surrounded by random candles, toys, and a platter of food. Finally, winter was created by a small pool filled with water and surrounded by suitcases and mirrors. The last room, bare except for an ornate chair in the center and filled with red light, represented the nirvana that could be obtained through these rituals.
McCurdy and Parks made their way through the seasons several times, acting out rituals like bowing to an altar, playing with toys, and arranging food and offering it to guests. Other than this repetition, their performance was mainly improvised. Guests talked, ate the offerings of food, and watched the rituals being performed throughout the seasons.
The exhibit was fascinating and beautiful, mixing elements of nostalgia with exotic pieces like small religious statues and foreign flags. First-year art major Lauren Faigeles commented on the impression of the exhibit as she watched McCurdy and Parks perform: “It’s like childhood for adults.”
After the performance, guests were free to mingle and examine the structures around them, as well as partake in the food. “If I could live in a dream land, this is how I’d want to live,” Jena Tegeler, a first-year science and humanities scholar, said as she sat under the autumn display.
The entire production area was constructed in a single night, although McCurdy and Parks had been collecting supplies for several weeks. When asked about the inspiration for this production, McCurdy said that it was based on “fluxes and happenings from the ’60s,” and it was a way to “recreate your own sense of origin.”
“We’re working with cycles and things we like,” Parks said as a way of summary. “It’s about social dramas, rituals, ceremonies, and finding nirvana.” When asked if they had found nirvana through this production, Parks and McCurdy laughed, and McCurdy responded, “In a way.”

This past August, 11 Carnegie Mellon students traveled to Panama for a week to participate in a medical brigade. A medical brigade consists of a team of student and medical professional volunteers organized into a mobile medical unit, setting up temporary day clinics to diagnose and treat patients for free. We were joined by one student from Albion College, two students from the University of North Carolina, and many nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and nursing students from Samuel Merritt University in California. For three days, we visited the two communities of Chriqui Viejo and Soloy.
Memorable moments: Beth Aguila
While shadowing a nurse practitioner for the day, I saw one family that I will never forget. The family consisted of a mother who was eight months pregnant, her two sons, and a grandmother. They had walked for nearly an hour and a half to visit our temporary day clinic.
The two children and the mother had all of the typical issues plaguing the community — severe dehydration, vitamin deficiencies, parasites, and fungal infections. However, it was the grandmother who captured my attention. She was nearly 80 years old, and she had come to the clinic to watch the two boys while her daughter was given a checkup. Although she seemed remarkably healthy for an 80-year-old woman, we realized that she had severe tachycardia — a condition in which a person’s heart rate exceeds the normal range for a resting heart rate.
We discovered that the grandmother usually goes for an entire day without drinking water or eating. Since food and water are so scarce for her family, she often gave up her share for her pregnant daughter and grandchildren. The nurse and I then attempted to explain to her the importance of eating and drinking at least seven glasses of water a day, especially in such a hot region.
However, it was not this learning experience that made me remember them; instead, it was the pure joy and gratitude the grandmother and her family felt toward us that was memorable. For the rest of the day, every time the grandmother saw me, she would grab my hand and thank me profusely. This experience showed me how just 20 minutes of providing care to a family who almost never gets the chance to see a medical professional can mean the world to them.
Memorable moments: Eda Akyar
While on the brigade, we encountered many truly amazing and memorable Panamanians whose stories were uplifting, to say the least. As a non-native Spanish speaker, I worried about my speaking abilities upon arrival in Panama. I had taken seven years of Spanish and studied abroad during the summer for seven weeks in Madrid, Spain after my first year at Carnegie Mellon; however, due to the fact that we would be working with Spanish speakers who had no English education — unlike many Spaniards in Madrid — in addition to some Panamanians who knew only their own indigenous language, I knew I would face the challenge of a language barrier.
But after a week of complete immersion, I felt as if I had gained all of my speaking abilities (and confidence) back.
On the third day of our brigade, I had a chance to shadow a doctor. Toward the latter part of the day, one of the providers pulled me aside; she needed help translating. After working through two patients with her, she told me to go ahead and just try my own patient. And so, with the provider’s supervision, I took a history of my own patient, explaining to the provider all of the patient’s health conditions and lifestyle, diagnosed the patient, and produced some recommendations for medicine and dosage.
I then saw three more patients on my own. Although we were working in rather uncomfortable conditions — a lack of proper lighting or air conditioning leaving us drenched in our own sweat — I had never felt happier in my life.
Being able to communicate with the patients, I established a comfortable relationship with them. I was able to empathize with them, which made me more determined to provide the best care that I possibly could. With the provider double-checking my every decision, I made recommendations for each patient, considering family history and environmental factors including home life and typical working conditions. The best part of the whole experience was walking the patient over to the pharmacy to pick up the medicine that I recommended — the gratitude I saw in each patient’s face was indescribable.
Ultimately, our brigade provided free medical care to nearly 700 patients in only three days. Our Carnegie Mellon brigade was able to raise and deliver over $60,000 worth of medicine to Panama. The medicine we provided helped patients with a wide range of illnesses, spanning from vitamin deficiencies to heart murmurs. The brigade experience was truly one of a kind, and we all look forward to our next brigade to Panama this coming summer.

OneRepublic and Jason Mraz, a pop rock band and an alternative singer-songwriter, recently released new albums. With the band’s new song list, OneRepublic is attempting to prove that they are more than just a one-hit wonder, while Mraz showcases some of his best moments while on tour around the country. Read on to find out how these new albums fared critically and if they’re worth the listen.
One Republic — Waking Up 
You may only recognize OneRepublic as “those guys that sing that ‘Apologize’ song,” but with the release of their sophomore album, Waking Up, on Nov. 17, they’re determined not just to provide the world with a carbon copy of the song that propelled them into the mainstream scene. In an interview for Campus Circle, drummer Eddie Fisher mentioned that people shouldn’t expect another “Apologize” on Waking Up, saying, “If you chase something that massive, you have a high percentage of it completely failing.”
The album’s leading track, “Made For You,” represents the CD as a whole, merging different styles and orchestral elements. Starting off by showcasing Ryan Tedder’s piano skills, the song then progresses into the band chanting lyrics from “All the Right Moves” (another song on the album), and concludes with exactly the unexpected: the audio of a conductor tapping his baton and a boys’ choir angelically repeating what the band has just sung.
“Secrets” is a prime example of how the cello (the band’s most unique characteristic) can be blended with a powerful chorus and almost hip-hop-like verses about how the songs written are true and not just money-makers. Songs like “All This Time” and “Fear” also feature the cello greatly, while other songs break new ground, like the quirky “Everybody Loves Me” (relying heavily on the acoustic guitar’s twang) and “Good Life” (featuring a strong drum beat and a faint synthesizer).
“This time/don’t need another perfect line/don’t care if critics never jump in line/I’m gonna give all my secrets away.” This is a lyric from “Secrets,” and it sums up the band’s identity in that they write honest, heartfelt lyrics that don’t seek out a number one spot on the Billboard charts, even though with Waking Up, that’s certainly a realistic feat.
Jason Mraz — Beautiful Mess – Live on Earth
This past August, Jason Mraz performed at Chicago’s Charter One Pavilion, and on a stage adorned with oriental rugs, Mraz let loose a wonderful volley of sweet melodies to a throng of his devoted and adoring fans. Recorded as part of his Beautiful Mess – Live on Earth tour, which is still ongoing, Mraz’s live CD and DVD of the concert were released on Nov. 10 to great critical acclaim. It features not only the smash hits “I’m Yours,” “The Remedy,” and “Lucky,” but also Mraz at his absolute best.
Mraz burst onto the scene in 2002 with his debut album, Waiting for my Rocket to Come, and the single, “The Remedy,” which peaked in the top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. This was not the last we would see of Mraz as, just three years later, he released the album Mr. A-Z, receiving some commercial and critical success along with hitting fifth on the Billboard album chart. Just last year, Mraz released We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things, which brought him by far his widest level of recognition and great international success.
Mraz’s Beautiful Mess – Live on Earth is a skillfully put together CD and DVD album that takes some of his best tracks from his first and third studio albums to form quite the set list. Mraz is adept at orchestrating a symphony out of his legion of fans and controls his audience as if he’s been doing it for years, knowing when he needs to add a little extra and when to just simply kick things into gear.
At one point during the concert, Mraz jokes that pretty much all he’s got are love songs, which is a very true statement. While he does sprinkle in pop sounds and extremely catchy rhythms and beats, his lyrics focus on love quite a bit. If you’re interested in catching him live, check out www.jasonmraz.com for his upcoming concert dates.

Music is a language that predates words. It consists of simple sounds and beats put together to create a rhythm. Even banging on a trash can or shaking a salt shaker is music. Twentieth-century composer John Cage thought that any sound could be music: “There is no noise, only sound.” Regardless of the method, music has been around for a very long time and presents itself in various sizes, shapes, and forms as it has been transformed through cultures and traditions. The definition of music itself is one that cannot be simplified in one term, as many cultures’ interpretations differ.
Music was also an important part of culture in Greece. Greek philosophers and ancient Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. In ancient Greek theater, musicians and singers had a prominent role, and choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. One of the earliest musical traditions comes from India, as references to Indian classical music — or marga — can be found in the ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition, the Vedas.
Common elements of music include pitch, rhythm, and dynamics. There are many more branches, as well as ones that stem from these few. While these terms and what they do were not always important, each of these elements has become necessary to communicate the language.
The development of music has occurred with the influence of natural sounds. It is very likely that it was influenced by animals and how they communicated. National Geographic published an article suggesting “that not only are natural sounds such as whale and bird songs music, but that their songs may be part of a ‘universal music’ that provides an intuitive musical concept to many animals — including humans.” Macaque monkeys drum objects in a way that shows social dominance. Even the beating of one’s chest has a figurative meaning, but the sound it creates brings meaning to life.
Although no one can give a firsthand account of what music sounded like in ancient times, artifacts like bones have been found with lateral holes, resembling a flute. At the Indus valley civilization archaeological sites (currently parts of Pakistan and India), various stringed instruments have been recovered.
Though these discoveries may give us an idea of early music, the music we create today is all built upon what has already been done. In the 20th century, the way to hear music was by listening to the radio or a phonograph in the earlier years. The genres of music have also become more defined as jazz took its place and became a strong influence over the course of the century. It originated in the southern states with an influence of African and European sounds. Rock music has also become popularized. It has spread out to become rock and roll, rockabilly blues, and country music. The guitar has a great influence on the sound of rock. Various styles of music have incorporated many instruments, such as the guitar, the piano, and the drums. While the drums were once used to communicate among Africans because the drums spoke when they could not, it has become a staple in music today.
Other forms of music — such as hip hop, modern, opera, barbershop music, cante jondo, disco, funk, new jack swing, and thousands of others — have been created throughout generations and in different countries. Because of this, there are several hundreds of musical instruments, as just about anything can be considered an instrument since hitting, plucking, or striking anything makes a sound. Songs today involve so many pieces of music; it is incredible to see how it has evolved over the centuries. String instruments and wind instruments are two kinds, but with all of the technology made available and all of the sounds electronics and nature have to offer, the musical possibilities are endless.
Musicians use these instruments or no instruments at all to perform and express themselves. Sometimes, artists can better express themselves through sound than through words. Gustav Mahler, a Bohemian-born Austrian composer and conductor active in the late 1800s, once said, “If a composer could say what he had to say in words, he would not bother trying to say it in music.”

Dear Rohit,
I have a problem. As of today, I have never had a real girlfriend. You know, someone who I actually took places and we would hold hands — mushy stuff like that. And now, I’m feeling a little overwhelmed seeing a lot of my friends in committed relationships. Is it okay that I’m 19 and have never had a real girlfriend? What can I do to rid myself of that fear of being alone forever? Help!
—Scared and Dateless
Dear Dateless Darling,
It sounds lame, but everything happens for a reason. It may seem like there are oh-so-many people with significant others frolicking all over campus, grossing out the typical passerby, but that doesn’t mean everyone is kickin’ it with someone special. You’re in college now, and I think the most important part of college is learning about yourself. You’ll be able to know what you want and what you don’t, what turns you off and what gets you... excited. Life is too short — and if the right girl is around, you two will find each other.
Regarding fear of loneliness that lasts forever, don’t worry. Things tend to work themselves out. Just remember that life can change in a moment and you never know when that moment will hit you.
I’m still waiting.
Don’t fret!
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I’ve never been the person who approaches a girl to ask her out. In fact, I’ve only done it once and only after some serious seesawing with myself. However, I have found myself in a position where I really like someone. The only hang-up is that she’s a junior and I myself am a lowly first-year. How can I get past that sinking feeling of inferiority and, at the same time, confront my fear of actually trying to ask a girl out?
—Pretty Passive Person
Dear P to the third power,
My most sincere advice would be to pick up some courage and just ask her out. Seriously! How can you expect to get what you want if you don’t go for it? Think of it like this: Things could always go really wrong. But you’ll never know how horrible everything will go until you dip that toe into the pool of love, or whatever it is that you are dipping into.
As for the older woman, who knows if your lady isn’t the cougar type? She could like a younger man, assuming you’ve completed puberty. More importantly, two years may seem like a lot of time now, but it’s not much at all. I can think of plenty of couples, mostly of the celebrity persuasion, that have up to 15-year gaps in age.
Tap that!
—Rohit

Let’s face it, folks: We’ve been spoiled. In contrast to the last couple of years, we’ve been granted the blessing of fall this year. Not just autumn, but an autumn that’s felt more like summer. The leaves have been holding out for months and the grass is still green. Never before has my resplendent supply of T-shirts lasted me so long. But our time of Indian summer is winding down, and I have a feeling that it might make this winter’s transition even rougher.
Now, to put things in perspective, I will remind you that Pittsburgh actually has a temperate climate. Sure, our winter feels like the worst thing in the world — long and wet and lonely. My friend Ben, however, spent last year in Iceland, and you’d better believe things are a lot rougher there. In a country riddled with depression (that’s personal and economic depression), it’s hard to keep a level head during the eternal winter season.
So what do they do? Well, in addition to eating various kinds of animal meat you’ve never heard of (and probably don’t want to), residents sometimes get together for a good ol’-fashioned sing-along. Using simple acoustic instrumentation, these gatherings are informal and usually just a way of warming up the cold and windy winter nights — a little whiskey, a little song, what more could you need?
On Dec. 4, the sing-along returns to the winter season, but this time as an interactive trans-city experience. Ben will be hosting a group in Cleveland, Ohio that will be in live video/audio communication with a group in Pittsburgh to be hosted at the Waffle Shop. The cities will switch leading songs by the likes of R. Kelly, Beck, Dolly Parton, and more. It’s a modern twist on an old-fashioned winter remedy. We may not be in Iceland, nor yet in the heart of our worst months, but it can’t hurt to start a new routine in curing the winter blues.

100 Years Ago
Nov. 24, 1909 
A notice appeared in The Tartan advising that the dean is in possession of a box of cigars that he offers to students who visit him. I can only wonder if President Cohon has his own box of old stogies to hand out, though I suppose he’d have candy cigars instead.
50 Years Ago
Nov. 18, 1959
Over 100 spectators apparently turned out for a co-rec volleyball semifinals match between the “Chicks” and the “Coeds,” an impressive number for what is basically an intramural game. I feel like someone in charge of varsity sports should get on the phone with 1959 to figure out the secret to attracting a crowd.
25 Years Ago
Nov. 20, 1984
A first-year graduate student vented in a Letter to the Editor about a past article wherein the original author was naive enough to claim that drugs only harm the individual using them directly. I hear you, brother — I can’t even count the number of times I’ve had to verbally abuse my friends for not doing drugs with me.
10 Years Ago
Nov. 22, 1999
An advertisement from a loving couple ran this week seeking a 21- to 33-year-old college student or graduate to have a baby for them because they are infertile. They were offering $25,000 in compensation plus any expenses. I’ll just take a minute here and let that one sink in.
5 Years Ago 
Nov. 22, 2004 
The Person’s Opinion section asks students what they think of Congress’s decision to increase the limit of the national debt by $800 billion to $8.18 trillion. One first-year’s response is: “Shit. That’s a lot of zeros.”

Nov. 24, 2008 
It is announced that the Hunt Library will soon be renovated with hopes of changing the ambiance of the place where many of us spend long hours studying. Hey Hunt, I’m willing to get the ball rolling on my grand design for a roof water slide.

The debate over Mayor Ravenstahl’s proposed “fair share” tuition tax plan continued in earnest last week. Amid national press coverage and growing outrage in campus communities, lawmakers, administrators, and lawyers began gearing up for a December showdown.
“We will not rely on the revenue [produced from the tax] for 2010,” Ravenstahl told The Tartan at his office last Thursday. “We can band-aid it together.... At the end of 2010, though, we’ve got a very serious decision [to] make. We either need to find $15 million, or these cuts will happen. If they don’t happen, the city will go bankrupt. The black eye that Pittsburgh would receive, or the draconian cuts we would have to make … would not be a good thing for the institutions that reside within it.”
The comments came in the wake of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority’s (ICA) rejection of his tax. The ICA’s unanimous rejection of the budget on Wednesday ensured that the mayor would have to deliver a revised budget by Dec. 31. 
His new proposal could not rely on the tuition tax for revenue in 2010; otherwise, the city could face state seizure of its funds.
Despite the ICA rejection, city council members Ricky Burgess, Darlene Harris, Jim Motznik, Tonya Payne, and Theresa Smith stood by the mayor at a Thursday press conference. “I think that our educational institutions have to participate,” Burgess told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “They have to support our city, and to participate in funding the services that are given to all of our constituents, including their students.”
The mayor has also hired Joseph C. Bright, former chief counsel to the state Department of Revenue, “to add heft to its argument that a 1 percent levy on tuition is legal,” according to a Post-Gazette article last Wednesday. Mr. Bright claims the city will win the court battle to get the tax on the books for 2011, due to a state law that gives municipalities power to tax broadly defined “privileges.”  
Post-secondary education administrators in Pittsburgh and nationwide continued to pile on criticism of the tax. Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon made his first public statement concerning the tax Friday. He listed Carnegie Mellon’s more than $1.4 million paid in taxes, fees, and services to the city annually and the more than 15,000 jobs the university creates as examples of the university’s contributions.
“At a time when Pittsburgh is trying to attract and retain young people, it should not become known as the only city in the U.S. to impose what is being called a ‘privilege tax’ on its students,” Cohon said. Ravenstahl told The Tartan that studying in Pittsburgh was one example of the “privileges” the city will tax.“It’s what we’re allowed to do, to act locally, and it’s that reason and that reason alone,” Ravenstahl said in response to a question about his framing of higher education in Pittsburgh as a privilege.
“If given the choice, there would be at least two options I would pursue: the $52 tax being raised to $144 on anyone who works in Pittsburgh; the second would be raising the payroll preparations tax to your institutions,” said Ravenstahl. Both measures would require changes to state legislation, which the mayor said he has pursued unsuccessfully for some time.
“I don’t disagree that there’s not a level of unfairness to this [tuition] tax,” he said, adding that, at the same time, city residents unfairly shoulder the burden of paying for city services. He claimed that his inability to extract more funds from commuters and non-profit institutions has forced him to target students’ wallets.
Students spoke out against the tax Friday, when 50 students attended a city council meeting downtown. Four students spoke at the meeting, their first opportunity to engage Pittsburgh’s lawmakers. Students have also set up a website at www.stoptuitiontax.org to organize their opposition, and many plan to attend city council’s public meeting about the tax on Nov. 30.
“The city’s current budgetary problems — the result of over 60 years of financial mismanagement — should not be placed on the backs of students working hard to better themselves,” said Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola, Student Senate Chair Aaron Gross, and Graduate Student Assembly President Patrick Gage Kelley in a formal e-mail statement of opposition last Thursday.
“How many consultants hired by the city have to tell the Mayor to cut or reduce underutilized services, before he stands up to city workers’ unions? Just because we’re not a strong voting bloc doesn’t mean he should get away with not pursuing other obvious solutions,” Erin Burns, a senior anthropology major and resident of the city said. “Not to mention the fact CMU’s 10,000 students would pay the most of any college under this tax. Where’s the proof that we consume more services than the 50,000 other students in the city?” Burns said.
As the controversy around the tax has grown, the city has attracted nationwide attention. USA Today covered the tuition tax last week, as did the national higher-education periodical Inside Higher Ed. The Inside Higher Ed article described recent attempts to tax revenues from higher-education institutions in Boston, Providence, and Berkeley. M. Matthew Owens, an associate vice president for federal relations for the Association of American Universities (AAU) warned 62 member institutions about 18 months ago of the coming wave of municipalities looking to tax higher education.
This topic across the country is “quietly brewing in university and college towns.... All eyes are on Pittsburgh to see how they handle this and whether it works,” said Kim Griffo, the director of the Clemson University-based International Town and Gown Association, in Inside Higher Ed.

Between 10 and 15 businesses are launched out of Carnegie Mellon each year, nearly half started entirely by students. This statistic was announced by Art Boni, the director of the Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon at “Starting a Company as a Student at Carnegie Mellon University,” an alumni panel held on Wednesday night. Boni has published numerous papers about entrepreneurship, with one of his most recent titled: “Innovation in an Academic Setting,” which is precisely what Wednesday’s panel was about. This was one of the six events held Nov. 16–20 that Carnegie Mellon hosted as part of Global Entrepreneurship Week. The events were sponsored by a variety of departments, clubs, and schools of Carnegie Mellon.
The week kicked off on Monday with an Entrepreneurship and Innovation Network Night. “In the four years I have been at Carnegie Mellon, this was the first event I have been to at the university that allowed undergraduate and MBA students to network and exchange ideas,” Lauren McMicken, a senior economics major who attended the event said. “I was surprised how many students I met that had already started companies and were working on their next big project. Everyone I met was really excited to tell me their ideas and to hear about mine.”
Other events during the week included a 90-second elevator pitch competition, an alumni panel about starting a company as a Carnegie Mellon student, and a faculty panel about commercializing next-generation technologies at the university, along with a social entrepreneurship and innovation lecture, a mixer, and a mini job fair.
Wednesday’s alumni panel was moderated by Steve Fleck (MBA ’04), the chief technology officer and co-founder of ClearCount Medical Solutions Inc., which Fleck started while he was getting his MBA at the Tepper School of Business. Participating in the panel were Nathan Martin (BFA ’00), the CEO and lead designer at Deeplocal; Bryan Kaplan (BS ’02), the co-founder and vice president of operations of Collaborative Fusion Inc.; Jessica Trybus (MET ’04), the CEO and founder of Etcetera Edutainment; and David Chen (BS expected ’10), a current student and CEO of Fooala Inc. 
All of the panelists launched companies while students at Carnegie Mellon — some even before. Chen started a tech company prior to Fooala when he was only 11.
Panelists were asked how they stayed close to their customers while being at school, what resources at Carnegie Mellon helped them the most, and what challenges they faced and how they overcame them. All panelists agreed that Carnegie Mellon opened many doors. Trybus said, “I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing now without Carnegie Mellon ... people are always so accessible and willing to help.”

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute have converted a 2001 Scion xB into an electric commuter vehicle that will serve as a test bed for a new community-based approach to electric vehicle design, conversion, and operations.
The vehicle is part of a new research project, ChargeCar, headed by Illah Nourbakhsh, associate professor of robotics. The project is exploring how electric vehicles can be customized to cost-effectively meet an individual’s specific commuting needs. It was made possible when a philanthropic alumna, Donna Auguste (Ph.D ’83), provided a grant to the CREATE Lab headed by Nourbakhsh to study ways to achieve high efficiency in electric vehicle power systems by incorporating a supercapacitor.
The ChargeCar team includes three students: senior computer science major Vibhav Sreekanti, senior information systems major Paul Dille, and SHS junior Matt Duescher. Also on the team are co-principal investigator Gregg Podnar, research engineer Josh Schapiro, senior research programmer Chris Bartley, project scientist Ben Brown, and Intel Labs Pittsburgh senior researcher Jason Campbell.
“Most electric cars today are being designed with top-down engineering to match the performance of gas-powered cars,” Nourbakhsh said. “Our goal is to revolutionize urban commuting by taking a different approach — by first analyzing the needs, conditions, and habits of the daily commutes of actual people and then using this ‘commute ecology’ to develop electric vehicles suited to each unique commute.” The researchers calculate that a typical Pittsburgh commuter might save 80 percent of energy costs by switching from a gas car to an electric car.
Dille is responsible for accepting and analyzing commuting data from people in the United States, Ireland, Italy, and Australia. “A major problem with vehicles today is that they are made for an average commuter in mind. The issue is that every person is unique, which implies that every commute is unique.”
Thus, this project is very community oriented. “We take data files produced by a GPS unit inside the car and do various calculations on the data in the file,” said Dille. “All drivers have to do is have a GPS unit turned on during a commute, go to our website, upload their commute file, and in a matter of seconds see graphs of speed distributions, elevation, and power, and statistics like energy cost of gasoline versus electricity for their specific commute. With all the data we collect, we hope to build algorithms to tailor solutions to individual commutes.”
By customizing each vehicle to the owner’s specific commute, ChargeCar  will save money for some owners by allowing them to purchase the minimum number of batteries necessary. “The number one cost of electric vehicle ownership is the batteries,” Nourbakhsh said. “Smart power management will save money initially because it pairs a low-cost battery pack with a small supercapacitor. And it will continue to save money by increasing efficiency and extending battery life.”
Podnar developed the high-level designs of the conversion of the Scion xB, selected the motors, controllers, and energy storage system, and designed the power control system. “The supercapacitor is efficient at supplying high currents on acceleration and accepting high currents when regeneratively braking. By off-loading the battery from these high currents, we get more of the stored energy from the battery, we recover more energy when regeneratively braking so we can use it for longer range, and the battery will last longer,”  Podnar said.
Researchers  also developed predictive energy management. “By looking ahead we can predict the energy needs of the next segment of travel. If it is going to be downhill or approaching a stop sign, we want the supercapacitor to start fully discharged. If we are about to climb a hill or accelerate from a stop, we will want the supercapacitor fully charged,” Podner said.
The converted Scion xB will be a testing ground for developing smart power-management techniques, measuring battery lifetimes, and refining conversion techniques.

Carnegie Mellon spent “One Week on Death Row” last week as our Amnesty International (AI) chapter hosted three days of events that encouraged the campus community to discuss their opinions on the death penalty. 
Amnesty International is an international organization dedicated to undertaking research and action in order to prevent human rights abuses. The organization now has more than 2.2 million members, supporters, and subscribers in over 150 countries and territories, in every region of the world.
Amnesty International on Carnegie Mellon’s campus is specifically focused on abolishing the death penalty and informing the campus community of the complexities and realities of the death penalty in the United States.
“This is our first time hosting this event and we want to provide an unbiased space for people to learn and talk about the death penalty,” the president of Amnesty International,  Amy Badiani, a junior global politics and policy management major said. Another member of Amnesty International agreed with Badiani. “We don’t want to enforce views on the campus. These events are to welcome an open conversation,” Aneesh Bhoopathy, a first-year cognitive science major, said.
The first event was a death penalty debate. Participants were given a list of arguments for each side to aid them, but they were also able to make their own claims. 
The board members asked numerous questions to the group like, “Does the death penalty constitute cruel and unusual punishment?” and “Is life in prison an alternative to the death penalty?” It started as a structured debate but turned into more of an open forum, allowing participants to ask questions while defending their positions.
The second event was more focused on educating participants on the injustice of the death penalty. Board members explained the historical opposition to the death penalty and stated that Amnesty International refers to the death penalty as the “ultimate denial of human rights.” 
After the presentation, guest speaker Martha Conley, Chairperson of the Pittsburgh chapter of Pennsylvanians Against the Death Penalty (PADP), discussed the injustice of the death penalty.
Conley cited many cases in which innocent people were sent to jail or even executed because they were not able to fight the system. “Innocent people don’t take plea bargains, because they can’t imagine they’ll be convicted,” Conley said. “They don’t understand how high the justice system is stacked against them.”
She feels that the number of innocent people who are put on death row is alarming and that there are some consistent factors that cause these people to be sentenced to death, such as police and judicial misconduct. This misconduct includes withholding evidence and threatening or torturing people to get them to confess. The last event was a screening of the documentary Race to Execution, which follows the lives of two death row inmates, Madison Hobley of Chicago, Ill., and Robert Tarver of Russell County, Ala., and discusses how race affects America’s judicial system — specifically that of the death penalty. 
According to the film’s website —* www.racetoexecution.com/main.html*, “revealing how race infects our capital punishment system, Race to Execution invites dialogue into the larger community about this systemic crisis within our justice system. Race to Execution reveals that once a victim’s body is discovered, the race of the victim and the accused deeply influence the legal process: from how a crime scene is investigated, to the deployment of police resources, to the interrogation and arrest of major suspects, to how media portrays the crime, and ultimately, jury selection and sentencing.”
In the documentary, family members, reporters, and the inmates share their opinions on how race did or did not influence the cases. 
“The movie was really interesting,” Brianna Agyemang, a senior economics major, said. “I never thought about death row from an inmate’s perspective and I never knew how big a part race plays.”
Over three days, Amnesty Interntional brought the death penalty issue to Carnegie Mellon and provided a space for people to reject or solidify their opinions about the death penalty. 
Ashish Thakrar, a junior ethics, history, and public policy and music major, said the event was great and that he wished even more people would get involved. “This kind of thing is essential to the CMU community because it is the role of the university to promote and foster these kinds of conversations,” he said.

Design Outside of Design
Tuesday, Nov. 24 at 5 p.m.
Breed Hall (MM103)
Design is now stepping outside of the studio and can now be seen in laboratories, accountants’ dens, writers’ studies, boardrooms of organizations, and the local meeting places of communities. Many see the future of design existing within its potential to enable trans-disciplinary solutions to the complex problems and challenges of the modern world. 
This lecture by Laurene Vaughan will critique and reflect on a body of projects currently being undertaken within the Design Research Institute at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, where the objective has been to take design outside of design, and through this discover new paradigms for design practice.
Lessons from Living Life on the Boundary
Thursday, Dec. 3 at 4:30 p.m. Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
In her lecture, Nadine Aubry, a Raymond J. Lane Distinguished Professor and the head of the department of mechanical engineering here at Carnegie Mellon University, will discuss mechanical engineering and how it lies at the crossroads of physics, mathematics, engineering, and the arts. She will also reference the field as being the backbone of numerous applications in aerospace, automotive energy, the environment, nanotechnology, bioengineering, materials, robotics, and information technology. 
Aubry will then describe some contributions her own research group has made to the field, which focus heavily on a connection between fluid mechanics and other academic disciplines.
Aubry describes her life as having “always been at some kind of boundary.” She’ll share experiences about growing up in metropolitan Paris and the rural French Loire Valley, about being a female in a mostly male-dominated profession, and about immigrating to the United States. 
She hopes that sharing her experiences regarding her feeling “a sense of not belonging” can be helpful to Carnegie Mellon students feeling like they’re in the same position.

CIT sponsors Toys for Tots
Walking by the University Center last Monday, one might have seen a World War II memorial. Carnegie Mellon first-year CIT students began their fourth annual U.S. Marine Corps Toys for Tots drive there from noon to 3 p.m. The program was started by the College of Engineering First Year Advisory Board and raises money for toys for children. Anyone in the campus community is encouraged to donate in centers located throughout campus, and all toys should be in unwrapped and new condition. Locations include Student Activities, Student Life, Housing and Dining, CIT, and the Mellon Institute, among others.
The memorial highlighted an airplane repair hut, field hospital, and the role of dogs in security in the military. WWII veteran alumni were present, as well as Dan Hamilton of Pittsburgh for the memorial. The program came to a close with the release of a dove and the playing of "Amazing Grace." Students were able to collect more than $1000 worth of donations and toys last year in this beneficial service-learning project.    
Toys for Tots originated in 1947 as a pilot project when Marine Major Bill Hendricks, along with other reservists, donated 5000 toys to children in need. The program was such a success that the Marines made it a nationwide campaign in 1948. 
CNBC Meeting of The Minds

In the fall of 1621, the Pilgrims held a three-day feast to celebrate a productive harvest, an event many regard as the nation’s first Thanksgiving. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the last Thursday of November as a national day of thanksgiving. This week, we take a look at some of the lesser-known numbers associated with the holiday:
Million turkeys raised in the United States in 2009: 250
Billion pounds of sweet potatoes produced in the United States in 2009: 1.8 
Pounds of turkey consumed by the typical American in 2007: 13.8
Cities in the United States named after the holiday’s main course: 3 (Turkey, Texas; Turkey Creek, La.; Turkey, N.C.)
Cities/townships in the U.S. that are named "Cranberry": 8

With the release of Sarah Palin’s autobiography, Going Rogue: An American Life, and her daughter-turned-teenage-mother’s ex-boyfriend’s naked photos in Playgirl last week, the Republican Party has a lot to worry about.
In the months following her failed campaign for the Presidency, Palin has turned the loss into a “he said, she said” story. The headlines of popular online and print media outlets are seemingly dominated by cropped photos of a nude Levi Johnston and excerpts from Palin’s supposed tell-all book.
The Palin family is dividing the Republican Party and reducing it to an increasingly small circle of gossip-mongering teenagers. As Palin promotes her 413-page autobiography, she is deliberately skipping certain cities in which she was unpopular during the 2008 Presidential campaign, such as Washington, D.C. and New York. While Palin constantly attributes her (seemingly unending) negative portrayal in the news to the media, she reduces herself to a caricature, thereby reducing the Republican Party to a caricature of itself.
Not only is Palin an embarrassment to the Republican Party, but her (and her family’s) exploitation of the political stage is embarrassing. From Palin’s book (in which she overzealously uses exclamation points and calls reports that paint her in an unflattering light “erroneous”) to Levi’s constant interviews and calls to the paparazzi, the Republican Party is being reduced to a superficial shell of some of its most extreme members, much like how the Democratic Party is reduced to images of radical, tree-strapped environmentalists.
Reducing political parties to their media images will not lead to progress for civil rights and equality in this country. Perhaps the worst part of the Palin plague is that these negative stereotypes aren’t even being perpetuated by those across the aisle — they’re being perpetuated from within, by an individual with a significant amount of political clout in the party and her family members.

Belle de Jour is your typical high-class London call girl: blonde, sophisticated, and... in possession of a Ph.D.? The blonde bombshell and great literary mystery recently revealed herself to be Dr. Brooke Magnanti, developmental neurotoxologist, cancer epidemiologist, and apparent literary figure. We now know the real Belle de Jour, the pseudonym that spawned the book Secret Diary of a London Call Girl, which spawned the eponymous TV series.
Ever seen the TV series? “I’m very high-class,” British actress Billie Piper says breathily, “which means I charge by the hour. And I charge a lot.” The hotel elevator doors close in on a busty Belle headed for a client’s penthouse. “Escort, hooker, prostitute, whore... I don’t mind what you call me. That’s just semantics.” The trailer flashes to Belle wearing only balloons, Belle in bed with two other girls, Belle pulling up black stockings. How did an aspiring neurotoxologist get herself into this bind?
It turns out the then-Ph.D. student ran out of money in the final months of completing her dissertation and turned to a quick-fix job that doesn’t require much training or skill. 
For 14 months, the soon-to-be Dr. Magnanti worked as a call girl and documented her adventures in what some consider to be quite excellent literary form.
Her recent revelation went viral, from criticisms about glamorizing prostitution to praising her openness about the situation. In an interview with New Scientist, Brooke explained that getting that extra cash allowed her to pursue science rather than change careers. She also touched on the underpaid status of Ph.D. students.
As someone who aspires to go to graduate school, this got me worried. I was going to be that underpaid, underappreciated, overworked graduate student. What’s an ambitious student to do under the current educational system? I investigated both sides.
To Belle’s proponents, or those who will refer back to her situation when the dissertation is unfinished and the bank is empty, here are two reasons why Ph.D. students should not double as call girls, hookers, escorts, or whatever the semantics may be:
In the TV series, Belle advocates that one should keep life and job separate. “Hannah,” Piper says, motioning to a rack of business casual. “Belle,” she says, motioning to a rack of negligees and black lacy things. “Never the two shall meet.” 
I would hate the hassle of separating laundry into even more piles: light-colored normal clothes, dark-colored normal clothes, devilish-colored lingerie, and your presumed white lab coats. Clearly, having two identities escalates the amount of effort it takes to do laundry. You wouldn’t want those see-through panties to accidentally end up in the pockets of your metaphorical white lab coats.
It probably isn’t so glamorous. To state the obvious: Magnanti is smarter than your average hooker. Though she does get prestigious penthouse clients, servicing those with less — ahem — experience, and probably n = 0 PubMed citations isn’t exactly the scientific fantasy.
To Belle’s critics, who argue that her past is shameful, that she is ruining the collective reputation of higher education, and that there are much better options to get through a tight time, well, there are two jobs I’d consider to be lower than a prostitute or whore, whatever the semantics may be:
Whoever the idiot was that thought of imposing a 1 percent tuition tax on the city’s colleges, further ingratiating the financial strain of students... a.k.a. the mayor of Pittsburgh.
Whoever thought about supporting it. The financial situation of students is dire as is. Are they working to perpetuate more situations like Belle’s?
Finally, to Dr. Magnanti, for using her newfound fame to promote her current research on how pesticide exposures cause neurodevelopmental disorders: Brava, Belle, brava.

As your Student Body Vice President for Finance, my role is to oversee the spending of the revenue generated by the $92 per semester student activities fee that all students pay. This is primarily done by serving as chair of the Joint Funding Committee, which allocates yearly budgets for CoSO-recognized student organizations. This means that unless you are a student organization leader, my work is likely invisible to you. Therefore, I’d like to briefly summarize my initiatives over the past semester.
In September, I passed a slate of amendments to the Student Body Constitution and Joint Funding Committee Bylaws, which were approved by the Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly. The most significant changes included increasing the size of the JFC from 11 to a maximum of 17 students, adding attendance requirements to hold JFC members accountable for their responsibilities, and changing the JFC funding policy for groups splitting off from existing student organizations.
That same month, I launched a publicity campaign to recruit applicants for the JFC, which in previous years had consisted mostly of Senators and a few organization leaders. This year’s 17-member committee is arguably the most diverse JFC yet, with 13 undergraduate and four graduate students representing all eight colleges, all class levels, and varying ethnic backgrounds, campus involvement, and levels of Student Government experience.
The committee convened in October, and representatives were assigned to organizations shortly after. Unlike in previous years, JFC members have begun meeting with our groups in the fall to truly get to know the organizations we represent, though the budget proposal process does not begin until January. In addition to meeting with their executive boards, I have urged the representatives to attend their groups’ events and general body meetings.
In addition, one of the goals set forth by the President’s Student Advisory Council is to encourage more collaboration among student organizations on campus. This has also been an area of focus for the JFC, both by encouraging the groups we are working with to hold joint events and by establishing a stronger relationship between our committee and CoSO.
If you have any questions about JFC, the funding process, or issues related to the Student Activities Fee, you can e-mail me anytime at sbt@ or stop by my office hours on Mondays from 4:30–5:30 p.m.
Have a good Thanksgiving, and good luck with finals.

Whenever one hears about Internet crime, one usually pictures a case of identity theft, fund embezzlement, or stalking. In a recent arrest of several California youths, however, all three of these crimes were combined in a bizarre affair involving the burglaries of several Hollywood celebrities’ houses.
A group of six young adults, christened by newspapers and entertainment websites as “The Bling Ring,” and ranging from ages 18 to 27, have been stealing jewelry, clothing, and other celebrity memorabilia from residences in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Victimized celebrities include Lindsey Lohan, Paris Hilton, and Orlando Bloom.
The real stroke of genius of the “Bling Ring” is the way they orchestrated these burglaries. By checking websites such as TMZ.com and MySpace, they could check the daily schedules of these celebrities and even their addresses. The Ring could then coordinate the timing of the thefts with when the celebs said that they would be out of the house.
The thefts have not been mild. In a search of one of the members of the Ring’s houses, police found over $20,000, designer jeans, and photographs of Hilton, all suspected to be taken from the socialite’s home. The Ring was able to return about three or four times before they were targeted by the LAPD.
The sheer resourcefulness of the kids amazes me, especially since it was not an overly elaborate crime. All it took was a few clicks of a mouse, a map, and a car. We’re so used to living in the digital age and loving all of the services it has to offer, but when drawbacks like these hit, they hit hard.
A more pressing issue, however, is the fact that the information was on these social networking sites to begin with. With the recent upsurge in popularity of self-promoting websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, people are finding it easier to give a brief vignette on how they feel, what they’re doing, or where they’re going, but you’d think that these same people — especially celebrities who probably have more followers on Twitter than I do skin cells — would know better than to put their personal info up in great detail where anyone can see it. Sure, it’s nice to hear about the latest celebrity scandal purely to indulge in some healthy schadenfreude, but details like your in-depth daily schedule are best kept to yourself.
As for the kids involved, you may think to yourself: Is this the work of fanatic stalkers? Or some troubled rich teens with too much time on their hands? Considering it was clothing that was stolen, one would probably be more apt to believe the stalker theory. But when you consider the clothing and accessory budgets of some of these celebrities, it could have been a stylistic or financial move on the Ring’s part. And what else are a bunch of teens going to do in a celebrity-rich neighborhood of California on a Saturday night?
Opportunity and boredom: What a winning combination.
Dylan Mori (dmori@) welcomes all reasonable responses.

President Obama’s recent trip to China was, for the most part, hardly worth mentioning. You might expect a meeting between two of the world’s most powerful countries to result in statements that shape global policy. Nothing like that happened this time, at least not according to the U.S. media.
But while American media and Washington’s ambassador to Beijing, Jon Huntsman, continue fighting about what actually occurred in meetings with the Chinese administration, we will focus on what matters to us: his talk with students.
While in China, Obama was able to speak to a group of four hundred specially selected Chinese students. To an audience described as docile by ABC News, Obama talked about the future of the China-U.S. relationship, openness, and freedom of expression and religion. The students shot back with hard-hitting questions like: “Why did you get that Nobel Prize?”
According to reports, students left the room thinking Obama was an enjoyable and friendly man whose solutions might not work in China. Possibly, this reflects more upon the attitudes of the students chosen by party and university leadership to be present, or maybe this is part of a larger trend, with the intellectual youth of China believing they need to find their own ways to progress as a country. The “change” campaign that Obama ran on, led by community involvement and transparency of information, may not be the right fit for China.
While the meeting with students was originally intended to be televised nationally, it was only shown on local Shanghai stations and at “watch parties” around China, although the entire transcript is now available online.
So as America discusses at length  whether Obama pushed hard enough regarding nuclear waste and Iran, we here at The Tartan are considering these four hundred students who heard our President speak. It is their voices that will be directing the future of China.

Last week heralded a new age in the evolution of our dear Facebook. No, there wasn’t another newsfeed redesign or privacy update. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg and friends weren’t even involved in this change.
On Tuesday, the publishers of the Oxford English Dictionary decided that “unfriend” was their word of the year for 2009. In case you are one of the five students on campus without a Facebook account, or in case you always keep every single one of your Facebook friends, I give you the new official definition:
“Unfriend — verb — To remove someone as a ‘friend’ on a social networking site such as Facebook.”
Eloquent, don’t you think?
The past week has shown the word of the year to be controversial. Across the Internet, bloggers have decried this outrage. Columnists have challenged the validity of “unfriend,” claiming that terms such as “defriend” are much more popular. While I admire these protesters, I feel that they do not address the deeper issues at stake.
I personally take umbrage with this neologism for a multitude of reasons.
For one thing, “unfriend” isn’t even a new word. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it was used in print in 1659, and even back then people were worried that a “Difference which hath happened betwixt” them might cause them to be “mutually Unfriended.”
Aside from the fact that the “word of the year” for 2009 seems to be 350 years old, it seems a bit premature to assign a word to a year in the middle of November. Do people stop using language after Thanksgiving? If it turns out that the 2012 apocalypse happens slightly sooner than anticipated and is instead this December, I think that “unfriend” might be a little weak to describe the end of the world.
As if their sense of timing weren’t bad enough, half of the board members probably don’t have Facebook accounts. They don’t understand that “unfriending” someone, as they so officially put it, is an emotional and personal decision. By giving an official definition to this difficult process, Oxford University Press has limited our ability to define ourselves.
Facebook encourages us to share our inner souls with the entire population of the Internet, all of whom care deeply about what we are eating for lunch today and how much homework we have due tomorrow. It helps us to expand out of our social bubbles by suggesting new friends that, I’ve found, end up being people I’ve always been missing in my life. It reminds us to post on our friends’ walls when it’s been too long (according to some brilliant algorithm, no doubt). And let’s not forget the most important use of Facebook — advertising new relationships or the fact that we’re looking for one. It’s a wonder that civilization made it so long without this indispensable information source.
With its promotion of this new “unfriend” moniker, Oxford University Press is not bringing a new word into the official lexicon. It is, in fact, working to undermine the very foundation of modern society. Where Facebook encourages us to find new friends, this organization seems instead focused on destroying social connections. “Unfriend” is just the latest in the Oxford dictionary’s succession of antisocial vocabulary, joining such pernicious terms as pugnacious, acrimonious, donnybrook, and the ever-popular tetricity. Compare that to Tuesday’s word of the day on the socially responsible Urban Dictionary: “Palintologist — A person that [sic] follows/studies political dinosaurs.” I think the distinction is pretty clear.
Now, I can understand why Oxford University Press has chosen to set itself against the coming Facebook utopia. Books and newspapers are dying, and dictionaries have been on the way out for years. Logophiles are endangered, their only sources of comfort esoteric Scrabble boards (the ones that have no triple word scores but give extra points for diacritical marks). It’s only natural to want to preserve one’s own breed by sacrificing the greater good of society.
The decision of Oxford University Press to choose “unfriend” over such attractive finalists as “netbook” and “sexting” is a desperate effort to maintain its so-called relevancy while fighting against social unity. Facebook should be a place for making friends, not losing them. Decades from now, when anthropologists look back at 2009, I hope they do not characterize it the same divisive way as Oxford University Press.

Imagine that you’re speeding down the highway in your Audi, windows rolled down, radio cranked up so that you can barely even hear yourself singing along to the familiar tunes. And who’s that next to you, harmonizing? That’s just Aida, your robotic passenger.
Aida, or the Affective Intelligent Driving Agent, is a robot designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that is meant to sit in the passenger seat of the car and help improve people’s driving habits, according to Wired magazine. Aida, according to the article, is meant to make people safer and happier drivers by analyzing their driving habits, tracking frequent routes, providing real-time traffic information, and making friendly suggestions about buckling up and following the speed limit.
MIT researchers explain in the article that having Aida in the car will actually help drivers’ skills because the robot will act as a passenger — facial expressions and all — which studies have found improves people’s driving.
It’s impressive to see new and innovative uses of the constantly evolving technology of current times, especially ones that are designed to improve the safety of people on the road, as opposed to the  cell-phone calls and texting that currently only distract drivers. It’s also impressive that Audi is partnering with the MIT labs to turn this research into reality instead of relegating the robot to the labs of universities.
We look forward to the day when we can drive in a tricked-out Audi with Aida riding shotgun, intermittently directing us where to turn as we chat about the weather and what’s happening in the world.

I used to babysit my cousin in high school. When I would reject his propositions, he would get mad at me, put his hands in his ears, and shout so that he couldn’t hear me. Eventually, I realized that you just can’t rationalize with a 5-year-old.
I recently came to a similar realization when the people of Pittsburgh re-elected Luke Ravenstahl as mayor, as he approaches the city’s problems with the rationalizing capability of a 5-year-old.
Recently, Ravenstahl proposed a 1 percent tax on the tuition of all students enrolled in post-secondary institutions. The mayor has met with opposition to this tax from the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education, college administrators, students, and Pennsylvania state representatives. The tax has been unanimously rejected by the Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority — a group that discussed the legitimacy of the tax and Ravenstahl’s proposed budget — yet he is still pursuing it.
I recently sent a letter to the Pittsburgh city council members to show my opposition to the tax. In the letter, I described the tax as a violation of both common sense and economics. I explained that if Ravenstahl had taken a course on economics and paid any attention in class, he would be familiar with the concept of “negative externalities” and “positive externalities.” Negative externalities occur when an individual or organization makes a decision for which they do not pay the full cost, due to the fact that their decision is bringing about negative and expensive effects. These should be taxed so that the producers pay to make up for the deadweight loss created by the product. Ravenstahl has painted college students as “negative externalities,” claiming that by being in this region, we are freeloaders.
This is where his economics falter. Most students contribute taxes and pay for Port Authority in our tuition. And what would this city be without its post-secondary institutions? Probably something like Detroit. We give the city the prestige to have anything happen here besides a football or hockey match.
Imagine this city without a single post-secondary institution. Businesses that were started by graduates would be gone; the community service that students do for the city would no longer exist. In one school year alone, Carnegie Mellon students amassed 80,000 hours of community service. It is clear that we are a positive externality, not a negative one.
I hope that in making the budget decision, Ravenstahl keeps money on his mind as well as solid economic analysis to make his decisions. The least I ask of Ravenstahl is to grow up, take his hands out of his ears, and assess the current situation rationally to come up with an appropriate solution.
