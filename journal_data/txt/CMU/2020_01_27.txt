This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
The Los Angeles City Council wanted to win the World Series. The Council’s favorite team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, lost the World Series in 2017 to the Houston Astros, and again in 2018 to the Boston Red Sox. They were disappointed when the Dodgers lost, but, like most fans, they were going to accept it.
However, the angry fans turned conspiracy theorists turned out to be right. The Astros cheated during their World Series-winning 2017 season with illegal video surveillance of other teams, and the manager of the Red Sox, then with the Astros, turned out to be a central figure in that scheme. This inspired the Los Angeles City Council to ask the MLB to award both titles to the Dodgers. They were inspired by the magical organization that is the NCAA, where titles are erased from history in the name of integrity and athletes go hungry after earning their coaches millions. With the NCAA’s precedent, the City Council set out to ask the MLB to award the World Series to the Dodgers.
They braved dangerous wastes of online fans laughing at them. They ignored former Dodgers asserting they did not want a trophy they did not win. They persisted even though everyone said they would fail. The City Council almost quit, but then they saw Barry Bonds locked out of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and they remembered baseball was a game with integrity. One councilman reminded himself, “cheating is not the new norm.”
The City Council entered MLB headquarters with caution. Yankees fans glared at them as they filed in, still angry that their favorite team is good. The City Council passed the foreign players they promised signing bonuses to that would never be paid, the dozens of minor league teams abandoned by the MLB, and problematic team owners. Nothing would distract them from bringing home the World Series.
They finally reached Rob Manfred, the Major League Baseball Commissioner. Manfred’s office was dark to help him sleep with what he’s done. The City Council began its argument. They claimed the Astros did not earn their spot in the postseason and the World Series fairly, even if the cheating did not go on in the World Series. The Dodgers surely deserved the title instead of the cheating Astros who beat them. The Yankees fans whined that the cheating Astros beat them in 2017 too, but Manfred ignored it. Manfred listened patiently. After the City Council finished, Manfred shook his head: “it’s just a part of our tradition.”

It’s time for another series of Tartan Super Bowl Predictions, and I’m excited to say that Tom Brady will not be featured this year. In what is likely the portents of impending doom for Darth Brady and the Evil Empire, they find themselves on the outside looking in at a Super Bowl between the Chiefs and the 49ers.
Not to beat a dead horse, but seeing fresh faces in the NFL’s Championship game is exciting. Patrick Mahomes has had an all-star caliber season with ESPN rushing to debate whether or not Mahomes is the best to ever play the game after some of the NFL’s best QBs are showing their age: Brady, Roethlisberger, Manning. Jimmy Garrapolo finally gets a chance, too, now that he’s come out from under Brady’s shadow.
But the most exciting thing about this Super Bowl is that both QBs have talented players supporting them on both sides of the ball. The Chiefs’ wide receiving core and 49ers’ run game present challenges to a Niners’ defense that is likely the best in the game right now, and a Chiefs’ defense which has stepped up its game this year. Basically, this Super Bowl is shaping up to be a mixed bag of performances making the game at least a little interesting.
Now, what you’ve all come here for: The Prediction 2020.
Matthew Benusa
Editor-in-Chief
35–0 Chiefs
Patrick Mahomes gets hurt on the first play of the game, and Miami Dolphins legend and Chiefs second-string QB Matt Moore comes into the game to lead the Chiefs to a blowout victory. Unfortunately, Jimmy Garoppolo can do little to stop the overpowered Chiefs offense, with its newly-found confidence behind the gun-slinging arm of Moore. 
At half, Andy Reid will eat an ice cream cone.
At the end of the game, Moore will get to celebrate his tremendous win with a Super Bowl MVP award. Moore will throw for 438 yards on 32 completions across 36 attempts. There will be one interception thrown to 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman. 
The 49ers will have a lackluster performance: two fumbles, two interceptions, 200 yards on the ground and none through the air, and they will find themselves in the attacking red zone only once during the game. Garoppolo will throw to a wide open Travis Kelce in the end zone who will step out of bounds before coming down with the ball. They will miss the field goal one play later. 
If anybody is interested in betting against me, don't. I would like to keep my money.

45–21 Chiefs
The Chiefs are going to have an easy win. Their defense is rock solid, and they only need to finish strong.
Harrison Butker will be the MVP. He has the most heart, and he's going to score a last-minute 35-yard field goal. In fact, at least 30 percent of the Chiefs' points are going to come from field goals. The Chiefs are going to fumble once, but because of their rock-solid defense, they'll intercept twice and force a fumble. The Chiefs will have a 55 percent pass completion rate, far more than the disappointing 32 percent pass completion rate by the 49ers.
At halftime, Mr. Peanut will come back from the dead. The crowd will applaud, but will still be emotionally conflicted, not having fully processed their grief at his death.

39–27 Chiefs
Damien Williams will be the MVP for getting 300-plus rushing yards. 31 percent of the Chiefs' points are going to come from field goals. 
Football is all about who wants it more and the 49ers aren't going to want it enough — not as much as the Chiefs. The 49ers are going to suffer three interceptions and two fumbles while the Chiefs will suffer two interceptions and two fumbles. One of the four fumbles will be unrecovered, and will just go out of bounds. The completion rate for passes will be 60 percent.
At halftime, there will be a military flyover, and Conan, the dog who ‘killed’ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is going to do a HALO drop into the stadium. Everyone will stand and sing the Star-Spangled Banner while saluting Conan in a celebration of country and football. We will recognize in the broken howled chords the last gasp of empire.

On Friday, the Carnegie Mellon University track team went up against the Case Western Reserve University track team in the 12th annual Battle for the Obelisk.
In an historic showing, the Carnegie Mellon University women’s track team went out and put up the most points scored in team history — 86 against Case Western Reserve University’s 50 — and in doing so, managed to sweep the podium in three different events.
It was apparent the women’s team would be a force to be reckoned with from very early on. On the track side of the competition, Senior Leah Kendrick’s time of 9.42 saw her win the 60-meter hurdles, with senior Joanna Baranowski and first-year Liz Barre just behind, at 9.44 and 9.53, respectively. Sophomore Taylor Jacobs then won the 800-meter run, coming in at 2:25.25, and first-year Samantha Giordani won the 60-meter dash with a time of 8.04. Giordani was also top of the podium for the 200-meter dash, clocking a time of 25.92, not only setting a meet record but also improving her school record.
The Carnegie Mellon University women found success in long-distance events as well, sweeping the podium of the mile run with seniors Kate Reilly and Wade Lacey placing first and second with times of 5:16.89 and 5:34.04 respectively, and junior Isabelle Chickanosky placing third with a time of 5:36.79. With 5:16.89, Reilly also surpassed the meet record, set by herself a year ago, by nearly three seconds. In both the 3000-meter run and the 5000-meter run, senior Abigail Levine came out on top, with times of 10:52.73 and 18:35.44 for the respective races. Kristen Seballos placed second in the 3000-meter run with a formidable 10:54.88, and first-year Joyce Zhang placed second in the 5000-meter run at 18:38.80.
The Tartan women’s team also triumphed in both relays, with the 4x400-meter relay consisting of Baranowski, first-year Jasmine Fahrenkrug, junior Valerie Reiling, and Giordani clocking in at 4:12.58, and distance medley relay consisting of senior Valerie Collins and first-year Mona Yuan, along with Reilly and Lacey finishing with a time of 13:24.37.
With the field events, the Carnegie Mellon University women’s team performed just as well. With heights of 3.72, 3.12, and 3.12 meters, seniors Michelle Karabin, Baranowski, and sophomore Ashley Zhang swept the pole vault podium. In the long jump, first-year Francine Leung came out on top with a leap of 5.05 meters.
In terms of the Tartan men, the competition was closer, but having scored a total of 77 points against Case Western Reserve University’s 58 points, the victory was just as solid.
The Carnegie Mellon men performed well in the field, sweeping the shot put, with first-year Bailey O’Malley putting in a winning throw of 14.71 meters, and his teammates, junior Bram Miller and first-year Len Huang coming in second and third with throws of 13.92 and 13.26 meters, respectively. Additionally, junior Logan Stahl was victorious in the weight throw with a toss of 14.92 meters. In the triple jump, senior Fred Dauphin placed first with a jump of 13.73 meters, while junior Matt Sloan came in second with a jump of 13.11 meters.
The Tartan men also found success on the track. Junior Marvin Bennett Jr. won both the 60-meter dash and the 200-meter dash, with times of 7.06 and 23.02, respectively, and sophomore Graham Eversden claimed the top-of-the-podium position in the 800-meter run, clocking in at 1:57.77.
In terms of the distance events, seniors Evan Yukevich and Liam Walsh placed first and second in the mile run, coming in at 4:22.64 and 4:23.50, respectively, and senior Hunter Hartshorne won the 3000-meter run for the second year in a row with a time of 8:41.27, breaking the meet record he set last year. The 5000-meter run, on the other hand, saw senior Edward Goebel at the top of the podium with a time of 15:14.21, with sophomore Michael Obroin placing second with a time of 15:24.42.
The Carnegie Mellon University men’s distance medley relay team consisting of Yukevich, first-years Zahir Saiyed and Leland Davies, and Walsh beat out Case Western Reserve University’s team with a time of 10:49.38.
Altogether, the Tartans accumulated a total of 163 points against the Spartans’ 108 points for an unassailable victory. This triumph marks the fourth straight win of the competition by the Tartans, many of whom achieved new personal bests and season’s bests. Now, the Tartans look forward to competing against Denison University in Granville, Ohio on Saturday, Feb. 1.

The U.S. Figure Skating Championships were held in Greensboro, NC last week. The competition’s results are often used to determine which skaters will be on the U.S. team at the World Championships, World Junior Championships, Four Continents Championships, and Winter Olympics. As such, it is a critical competition that presents an invaluable opportunity to U.S. athletes of all ages. Two of the most exceptional skates of the competition occurred in the Ladies Championship.
Bradie Tennell, the 2018 national champion, was looking to reclaim her title from the 2019 national champion, Alysa Liu. Knowing her opponent’s free skate would include several big elements, Tennell needed to establish a solid lead with her short program. Skating to the rhythm of a Kirill Richter medley and with no room for error, Tennell opened her short program with a triple Lutz-triple toe combination, receiving a grade of execution score of 2.19, her highest of the program. She then followed that up with a double axel and a well-choreographed spin sequence to close out the first half of her short program. Tennell kicked off the second half of her routine with a triple flip that received a Grade of Execution (GOE) score of 1.89, followed by a fluid, energetic step sequence, finishing with a series of spirited spins.
Having received positive GOE scores on every element in her short program, Tennell’s score was almost guaranteed to be huge. With a technical elements score of 43.11 accompanied by a program components score of 35.85, Tennell’s final short program score of 78.96 surpassed the previous U.S. Nationals short program record by nearly two-and-a-half points, propelling her into first position going into the free skate.
At the beginning of the free skate, however, all eyes turned to 14-year-old Alysa Liu. Having won the Championship in 2019 to become the youngest U.S. figure skating champion in history at age 13, Liu was planning to do something big.
Skating to “Illumination” by Jennifer Thomas, Liu kicked off her free skate with a triple axel-double toe combination, receiving a GOE score of 2.40. Her second jump was to be historic: the first quadruple Lutz attempted by a woman at the U.S. National Championships. Though the jump was under-rotated, which resulted in a negative GOE score, Liu successfully landed the Lutz, becoming the first lady to land the jump, as well as attempt it. Following it up with another well-executed triple axel, along with a triple toe, Liu concluded the first half of her program with a flying combination spin.
Leading into the second half of her routine with a dynamic step sequence, Liu performed a flawless triple Lutz-triple toe combination, before executing an impeccable triple Lutz-Euler-triple Salchow. After a beautifully-crafted choreographic sequence and a triple flip, Alysa Liu closed out her free skate with a combination spin and a layback spin, having received positive GOE scores above +1 for every element she performed with the exception of the under-rotated (but nevertheless, historic) quadruple Lutz.
Receiving a technical elements score of 91.75 and a program components score of 68.37, Alysa Liu’s final free skate score of 160.12 far exceeded the 149.81 she needed to win the competition. Her combined score totaled 235.52—over 10 points higher than her closest competitor. This triumph also makes Liu the first woman since Ashley Wagner to win the U.S. Figure Skating Championships consecutively.
Although the Winter Olympics are still two years away, there are still plenty of competitions in the meantime for these ladies to compete in. It will be, without a doubt, an absolutely fascinating and thrilling experience to watch them continue to hone their skills and develop their routines. With the U.S. having spent over a decade without an Olympic medal in ladies’ singles, it is entirely possible that one of these ladies can end that drought.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), roughly 810 women in 2017 unnecessarily died every day due to pregnancy and childbirth complications — that’s almost 300,000 per year. But Dr. Tamar Krishnamurti, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and adjunct faculty member at the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon, has been working hard to reduce that number with her app: My Health Pregnancy (MHP).
MHP, currently being beta-tested at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, was developed by Krishnamurti’s startup Naima Health. Krishnamurti founded the company alongside Engineering and Public Policy professor Alex Davis and University of Pittsburgh Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science Dr. Hyagriv Simhan. The companies' goal is to reduce the rates of infant prematurity through algorithm-based risk identification and early intervention. MHP offers actionable personalized messaging to decrease the risk of complications.
This messaging can range from something as simple as diet suggestions and warnings against smoking to more urgent content such as cues to contact a physician or requests to call 9-1-1 in a domestic abuse situation. MHP also takes great care to be discreet in these situations, in case a domestic abuser is surveilling the woman’s communications.
“We do early risk identification and intervention using models we have developed on multiple large national data sets,” Krishnamurti said in an interview with The Tartan.
The WHO reports that 75% of maternal deaths are from the same five causes: severe bleeding after birth, infections after birth, eclampsia/pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy), complications from delivery, and unsafe abortions.
“Our focus is on the precursors to prematurity (preterm birth of infants),” Krishnamurti explained.
Maternal mortality is also a global issue: according to the WHO, almost 90% of maternal deaths in 2017 were in Sub-Saharan Africa or Southern Asia.
“Smartphones can be a highly effective information delivery system in many geographic regions, including [Sub Saharan Africa] and South Asia,” Krishnamurti said. “Currently, MHP is a US-based maternal mobile health platform. Smartphone-based tools, when implemented thoughtfully and mindfully of technology access, have the potential to minimize health inequities.”

The devastating nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima, Japan occurred in 2011. Nine years later, wildlife populations have returned to the areas affected by the catastrophe. Researchers at the University of Georgia recently performed a camera study published in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. They took more than 267,000 wildlife pictures of the landscape, showing that more than 20 species have returned to the area, including raccoon dogs, pheasants, foxes, Japanese hares, wild boars, red foxes, weasels, sika deer, black bears, masked palm civets, and macaques.
According to James Beasley, a wildlife biologist and associate professor at the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia, both the public and the scientific community have inquired as to the whereabouts and livelihoods of wildlife in the years following nuclear accidents such as those in Chernobyl and Fukushima.
“Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,” Beasley remarked in a press release. He stated that the species most commonly seen in the photos from the study, like wild boars, typically come into conflict with humans. “This suggests these species have increased in abundance following the evacuation of people,” he explained.
To effectively study Fukushima, Beasley’s team worked with Professor Thomas Hinton at the Institute of Environmental Radioactivity at Fukushima University to split the landscape into three zones by contamination level: the highest where humans were completely excluded, intermediate where humans were restricted, and low radiation where humans were permitted to inhabit. These designations were largely based on those established by the Japanese government following the Fukushima Daiichi catastrophe. 
Cameras captured pictures of the landscape over 120 days. Over 26,000 of these images were from the uninhabited area, about 13,000 were from the restricted area, and roughly 7,000 were from the inhabited area. An overwhelming 46,000 of the photos contained wild boars. A few other species that were more common in the uninhabited and restricted zones were raccoons, Japanese marten, and Japanese macaque. 
The control zone for the research was the uninhabited zone since no data was recorded on wildlife populations in the evacuated areas. This was ideal as it was close to the human-inhabited zone and had a similar landscape. The researchers also investigated how variables such as vegetation type and elevation affect wildlife populations. 
“The terrain varies from mountainous to coastal habitats, and we know these habitats support different types of species. To account for these factors, we incorporated habitat and landscape attributes such as elevation into our analysis,” Beasley noted. “Based on these analyses, our results show that level of human activity, elevation, and habitat type were the primary factors influencing the abundance of the species evaluated, rather than radiation levels.”
Although the activity pattern of most species was similar to that of their activity pattern in other regions, wild boars were more active in the day than other wild boars in human-inhabited areas were. Researchers speculate that they are changing their behavior due to the lack of humans. Japanese serow also appear to be changing their behavior; they usually avoid humans, but the photos showed that they were often present in rural regions inhabited by humans. This behavior is likely a reaction to the increasing population of boar in the uninhabited zone.  
While this study does not attempt to accurately assess an individual animal’s health, Hinton said, “[it] makes an important contribution because it examines radiological impacts to populations of wildlife, whereas most previous studies have looked for effects to individual animals.”

Alcohol consumption has been decreasing in the United States in recent years. According to the research firm Bernstein, the average alcohol consumption has dropped from 10.34 liters per person in 1980 to 8.65 liters per person in 2017. One possible reason for this decrease is increased awareness of alcohol's health impacts and the wellness movement. Another is the rise of the experience economy, which places more importance on quality and presentation than on quantity. With campaigns like Dry January and the emergence of alcohol-free bars, a market for so-called non-alcoholic spirits has arisen. These spirits are targeted at drinkers who want to enjoy the social side of drinking without the negative side effects. This movement is about creating an experience with complex flavors that the drinker can sip over a meal or conversation, like wine and cocktails.
Ethanol, the type of alcohol we drink, is made naturally by the fermentation of sugars by yeast. However, fermented drinks can only reach about 15 to 20 percent alcohol, because the yeast can’t survive in higher concentrations. Distillation reaches a higher concentration of alcohol through separating the components of a liquid mixture by exploiting differences in the relative boiling points of the mixture's components. In a traditional spirit distillation process, ethanol is converted into vapor and then condensed into liquid. Distillers repeat the process several times until they achieve a desirable alcohol-to-water ratio. The familiar spirits, such as vodka, rum, or whiskey, are distilled in this way to obtain a higher concentration of alcohol than possible by fermentation alone. However, distillation can also be used to reduce alchol content.
The makers of nonalcoholic spirits are trying to create complex, nuanced flavors using botanicals, herbs, barks, nuts, and seeds. Some companies use these to try to replicate traditional alcohols, such as with gin’s signature flavor of juniper berries, while others are creating their own flavors. One company, Seedlip, formulates its own mixtures using a technique called maceration — soaking the source of the desired flavor in a cold liquid. This mirrors how traditional herbal medicines have been made for hundreds of years. The base for this process is a neutral grain spirit, which works because of the molecular geometry of alcohol.
If you’ve ever mixed water and oil, you know that not all liquids are miscible, or able to be mixed. Molecules with similar polarities tend to be miscible. Water, for example, is a polar molecule, while oil is nonpolar. Alcohol sits in between: it has both polar and nonpolar parts, meaning it can mix with either hydrophilic (polar) or hydrophobic (nonpolar) molecules. This is what makes alcohol so good at carrying flavors. Because the alcohol evaporates readily, drink makers can then distill the resulting mixture to remove most of the alcohol and concentrate the flavors. Each botanical is distilled using its own optimized individual process. In the case of Seedlip, the finished product contains a small amount of alcohol (still less than the 0.5 percent legal limit to not be considered alcoholic in the US), though other brands use different, completely alcohol-free methods. Another option is steam distillation, which extracts essential oils from the botanicals by passing steam through the ingredient. 
These products are, in fact, more than flavored water with a hefty price tag. With more and more people avoiding alcohol, these nuanced alternatives are gaining popularity. With time, nonalcoholic spirits might be worthy alternatives to regular alcoholic products.

In the midst of America’s war against opioids, the National Institute of Health launched an initiative called Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL). A nationwide effort to curb the usage of opioids and find more effective treatments for chronic pain, HEAL has recently given a group of researchers at Carnegie Mellon the chance to find an alternative treatment to the chronic pain caused by a genetic disorder known as sickle cell anemia.
Principal investigator and biomedical engineering department head Bin He chose to research sickle cell disease after being inspired by his previous work in EEG and MRI imaging of the human brain. In particular, encountering participants with sickle cell disease in prior research gave him a glimpse into one of the major sources of chronic pain. “For many of those [affected], the disease is going to be with them for the rest of their lives," He stated in an interview with The Tartan. It was then that he decided to bring his research to a clinical objective. In his words, “I decided that just watching how the brain works wasn’t enough. I wanted to help patients.”
The team’s main objective is to create a noninvasive device that will target the specific areas of the brain responsible for pain by utilizing a technique known as ultrasound neuromodulation. “It’s really about bringing physical energy to the brain,” said Professor He. “Essentially, it’s a high-frequency sound for imaging that perturbs and modulates the transcranial signal.”
Compared to the usage of analgesics (pain-relieving medication), He believes that neuromodulation is a far more effective option due to its non-invasive nature and its ability to localize the source of pain within the brain. In addition, He stated that most drugs provide somewhere between 1000% to 10000% of the required amount of active ingredient needed to relieve the pain, leading to several severe side effects. Those side effects would be minimized with a treatment option like neuromodulation, only treating the areas of the brain responsible for chronic pain. 
Nevertheless, this isn’t the first time that the modification of neural signals has been used to relieve a form of chronic pain. Neuromodulation’s predecessor, Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), has been proven to be an effective remedy for chronic pain caused by Parkinson’s disease. According to the Mayfield Clinic, DBS usually involves a surgically implanted device that sends electrical signals to brain areas responsible for body movement, and electrodes are placed deep in the brain, which are connected to a stimulator device. However, ultrasound neuromodulation’s non-invasive basis would certainly eliminate the surgical component of implantation, and therefore lower the risk of unintended effects in the human body.
Professor He hopes that the techniques and principles from the device used to treat sickle cell anemia could also be applied as an alternative treatment to many other types of chronic pain. “The sickle cell disease population is relatively small, though the clinical problems are important,” He added. Additionally, his technology has several other potential applications to improve patients' quality of life.

Spoilers for The Rise of Skywalker, although, let’s be honest: you’ve either seen this or you don’t care.
It’s foolish of me to care about this as much as I do. This is the ninth film in a 43-year-old franchise now owned by Disney. I am aware of how childish and long this entire piece is and how stupid it is for me to be as passionate about Star Wars as I am.  
That being said, I passionately hate Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. What’s unique about this is that this is the only Star Wars movie I truly hate. I don’t hate any of the others, even the prequels and other Disney canon movies. I still enjoy those for what they are and get a kick out of them for introducing various world-building elements and for having good character moments. 
The Rise of Skywalker is devoid of any of this. There is only one good scene. The rest is bottom-of-the-barrel schlock with no thought, passion, or really anything of note. It messes up the sequel trilogy so badly that it will be studied for years to come as how not to plan a trilogy. I wouldn’t say I am angry about it so much as really depressed, and I am aware of how dumb that is. So join me on my quest for therapeutic catharsis as I go through why I think it failed and how it got to that point.
The tragedy of J.J. Abrams, the hack
The problems within this film, and this trilogy, rest on the shoulders of J.J. Abrams. He is a good producer, but not a good writer or director. His movies are excessively fast-paced without any room for  character development, and he is heavily reliant on nostalgia to elicit emotion from the audience in a way that doesn’t make sense for the story or characters.
There are many examples of this, but let’s look at the ending of The Rise of Skywalker. At the end, Rey takes Luke’s and Leia’s lightsabers back to Tatooine and buries them at the ancestral Skywalker home. When asked who she is, she says that she is Rey Skywalker. She gets approval from the Luke and Leia Force ghosts, and she looks off at the binary sunset as the famous score from the original swells. On the surface, you feel something because of nostalgia. But it also makes no sense.
Luke’s lightsaber formerly belonged to his father Anakin, aka Darth Vader. Anakin was a slave on Tatooine, and his mother was killed by a local tribe he massacres later, including the women and children. Luke wanted to get off Tatooine, and both of his guardians were burned to death by stormtroopers. Leia never stepped foot on Tatooine. The Skywalker name is also one associated with two guys who fell to the dark side and became genocidal maniacs, while the heroic one exiled himself after his Jedi academy was destroyed by his nephew, whom he nearly killed. 
On top of that, Rey barely knew Luke. It was Leia that trained Rey for a year after Luke died, but her surname is Organa, not Skywalker. Leia is also the only person related to the Skywalkers who spent her whole life fighting evil no matter what. 
Also, the point of the movie just 20 minutes before was for Rey to accept that even though her heritage is that of Palpatine, the evilest dude ever, she can still be good. So why take the name Skywalker if she is already content with being herself? This entire ending means nothing for the story. It’s just there as cheap fan-service and nostalgia.
But J.J.’s greatest weakness by far is his insistence on “mystery box storytelling.” Basically, the mystery surrounding the story is always centered on some MacGuffin, either something physical or some important information, like Rey’s identity or the location of Palpatine. Those aren’t inherently bad tropes: the original Star Wars is based around an iconic MacGuffin. But J.J. makes them insufferable because he turns the movie into a series of fetch quests for items, and he moves between these fetch quests so quickly that there is no time for the character moments or scenes to breathe. So nothing matters. 
The Last Jedi, for all its flaws, did the trilogy a favor by getting rid of the mystery box stuff. Episode IX could be free of those mystery box elements and tie together the trilogy’s theme of identity, legacy, and how the Force shouldn’t be monopolized by a few people. But none of that happens. With the exception of Kylo Ren, all the other characters don’t have any arcs or important things to do. There are no stakes or consequences. Chewbacca, C-3PO, and Rey die, but the deaths are reversed within a few scenes. And the scenes in which they supposedly die aren’t even allowed to linger or breathe.
The most insulting part of this movie is that it really does make every other one worse when looking at the whole saga. Anakin sacrifices and kills Palpatine at the end of Return of the Jedi to bring balance to the Force. But in this one, Palpatine is suddenly back with no set up other than a two-sentence introduction in the opening text and a Fortnite Easter egg (no I am not kidding), only for his granddaughter Rey to kill him again. So the original saga’s focus on the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker is totally pointless, as are the previous two movies. 
Misdirected hate
I was originally in the camp of blaming Kathleen Kennedy for this sequel trilogy going so wrong. While she is not totally faultless, I think the failure of this movie and trilogy is much more nuanced than it just being her fault. She has been with Lucasfilms since nearly the beginning, handpicked by George Lucas to succeed him in 2012, so he clearly trusted her. When Lucas criticized Disney, it wasn’t really directed at Kennedy either. 
However, the warning signs were there from the start. The entire extended universe canon up until 2012, now called Legends, is almost entirely scrapped so the new films can have their own story. By 2015, they were going to release The Force Awakens, and then sequels would come out every two years. In addition, there were a bunch of anthology movies, new trilogies, TV shows, video games, comics, and books to juggle, all of which would be made canon. How is she expected to manage multiple new projects in a new canon and keep good quality control of it all? 
Of course, it’s easy to say “that’s her job, so she should do it.” But she’s not a storyteller like Lucas, and clearly, there were issues in management given all the directorial changes. Really, it’s what happened after The Last Jedi that confirms that management issues mostly aren’t Kennedy’s fault. 
Both before its release and after the backlash the movie got from fans, she stuck by Rian Johnson’s vision. However, the defense faded quietly, and J.J. Abrams was brought back to finish the job. Upon the release of the movie, The Rise of Skywalker essentially undoes everything the last one did. Rey’s not a nobody. She is a Palpatine. Rey tries to throw the lightsaber away on Ahch-To, but Force ghost Luke catches it and says, “I was wrong.” Kylo is redeemable, and he kisses Rey. 
The most disgusting one is how Rose, played by Kelly Marie Tran, is sidelined. Tran got massive hate, much of it sexist and racist, for her role. She went from being a central character in episode 8 to having barely over a minute of screen time in The Rise of Skywalker. Lucasfilms capitulated to the fans that hated Episode 8 while simultaneously trying to satisfy everyone else, resulting in the Frankenstein of a movie we got. But it’s out of character for Kennedy. She specifically made it clear that she wasn’t going to capitulate to toxic fans.
The likely scenario is that Kennedy hedged her bets on Rian Johnson to prove to Disney executives that trusting the writers and directors to make their vision was a good idea rather than relying on corporate muppets like J.J. to do their bidding. Of course, things went off the rails, and it’s clear that those same executives made her change her tune and pulled the strings on J.J. to have him make the most corporate and soulless Star Wars movie ever. Yes, Kennedy should have definitely had a plan from the beginning, but the leaked script of episode 9 also shows that they actually were going to pay things off more properly. Lucasfilms is just another victim of Disney milking intellectual property without understanding what made it successful.
A New Hope
All is not lost for Star Wars though. The Mandalorian is excellent and has won back many fans, and it seems that Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni will have some more involvement. The Clone Wars season 7 is also coming out. Jedi: Fallen Order is a great game. The other movies still exist for all of us to enjoy, and time will tell what we think of the new trilogy. Many people, including me, used to hate the prequels but now enjoy them for what they are. Maybe the same will happen with The Rise of Skywalker. Maybe. For now, it gets a solid 2/10.

Two months ago, dancer and YouTube sensation Dominic “D-Trix” Sandoval was scheduled to make an appearance at Carnegie Mellon, but the event had to be postponed. However, the wait was worth it when he finally took the stage in McConomy this past Thursday.
I have loosely followed D-Trix since 2007, when he first came into the public eye as a contestant on the third season of So You Think You Can Dance, one of my favorite shows. After a win on America’s Best Dance Crew in 2009 (which I sadly missed as a 10-year-old with no control of the TV remote), he met and befriended YouTuber Ryan Higa while touring with his dance crew in Las Vegas. Higa, the most popular YouTuber at the time, encouraged Sandoval to join the platform, and D-Trix’s channel TheDOMINICshow has amassed 3.6 million subscribers since its creation in Jan. 2010.
His channel consists of a wide variety of content, including but not limited to comedy sketches, “ULTIMATE DANCE CHALLENGE” videos where he teaches other YouTubers dance routines in a single day, and food challenges where he and his friends try to eat an excessive amount of food in a short time period. While maintaining his YouTube channel, he has also recently picked up the piano and joined the cast of So You Think You Can Dance as a judge this past year. Sandoval seems to do it all.
His appearance at Carnegie Mellon proved this point even further. Hosted by Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Asian Student Association (ASA), Sandoval came to the university with a unique show that featured a piano duet, some iconic D-Trix dance moves, a last-minute inspirational speech, and a whole lot of self-deprecating comedy.
He shared his more difficult experiences and infused them with humor without detracting from the seriousness of the topics discussed, which included alcoholism, family, and faith. His duet with girlfriend Bethany Mota was a sweet and funny back and forth about their romance and about ignor- ing the hate that their 10-year age gap brings. To be perfectly honest, I was so engrossed in his stories that I didn’t take any notes about the specific jokes that hit. His way of looking at the bright side of everything was really admirable, and his more inappropriate (considering some of Dietrich’s administration was present) jokes were met with uproarious laughter.
After his main set, which ran overtime because everyone was so engaged in his storytelling that they lost track of time, there was a question and answer session with D-Trix, which was moderated by ASA’s Vice President of Events, sophomore Justin Wang. Although led by Wang, the questions were primarily from the audience, who mostly asked questions about his experiences and asked for advice.
D-Trix finished in a respectable eighth place on So You Think You Can Dance, which is impressive considering he had never had prior training due to his freestyling, b-boy background. Someone asked him about his experience on the show, and he said that there’s something about “having an ego as a hip hop dancer.” He explained, “I thought every other dance style was trash ... I was so unaware, and the whole thing was a joke.” He didn’t expect to get that far in the show, which he attributes it to the fact that he was playing around while going through the whole experience. Even though he didn’t have an awareness of the other styles, he said there was something beneficial about “be[ing] the first one to call yourself out.” Skill isn’t everything, a big part of it is your “ability to show up.”
As for shifting platforms, he isn’t hostile to others who rise to fame rapidly on the internet. Someone asked about his opinion on TikTok dancers, and he thought it was “completely cool whatever people use as a platform.” As a person who jokes about dance himself, he thinks it’s great that people can “continue to get paid to play.”
D-Trix himself hopes to contribute more on Instagram and potentially join the ranks of TikTok, although he has bigger dreams in the future. He plans to release a music video album on his YouTube this summer and hopes to work on short and feature films. He wants to create musicals that speak to him and feel real, calling out High School Musical as an unrealistic representation of teenage life.
When asked about how to stay focused, improve, and stay calm when faced with challenges such as dance auditions, he advised that it is important to have “the ability to turn off your brain and enjoy while you’re there.” Speaking on choreography, he said, “It’s not about what it is, but about creating what it is.”
Lastly, there was a meet-and-greet session. Finally meeting someone you’ve watched since you were eight is a hard experience to describe. It’s surreal. Especially when they’re as authentic as you expect them to be. D-Trix was funny, humble, and gracious, on and off stage, which made the event all the more meaningful.

With constant streams of snowflakes, frigid gusts of winds, and winter in full swing, many students have begun bundling up. But staying warm comes at a price, and for some Carnegie Mellon students, shopping at high-end retail stores for winter clothes is unaffordable.
Thrifting is a rising and popular trend among students, with the total resale business generating $17 billion annually, according to the United States Census Bureau. There are many reasons why students should consider purchasing second-hand clothing, but the most prominent reasons are prices, the quest to find unique clothing, and environmentally conscious shopping.
“People should thrift because they are saving money in not having to buy retail,” Eva Schenker, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University and avid thrifter, said. “They are also helping to mitigate climate change by reducing clothing waste, and you can find some really cool, vintage stuff at a thrift shop that you would not be able to buy elsewhere.”
Due to the rising popularity of thrifting, Pillbox has visited four local thrift stores, and here are our thoughts:
Adored Avalon
Avalon Exchange, which is located at 5858 Forbes Ave, is well-known around campus for its robust selection of clothing. Upon entering the store, one is automatically drawn to the racks of bright sunglasses, which are organized by color.
The clothing racks, which are sorted in a simplistic fashion, are ever-changing with new inventory hitting the shelves every day. From cashmere sweaters and designer goods to graphic T-shirts, Avalon holds it all.
“If you’re nosy, or nebbie as you say in Pittsburgh, you will enjoy peeking around the store because there are a lot of fun, wacky things,” Aaron Valentic, the associate store manager of Avalon said.
The employees at Avalon each have different tastes and acquire different articles of clothing, but the common denominator between their practices is the attention to detail that they pay when selecting clothes, Valentic said.
The variation in style is evident, so there is something for everyone. But because of their exclusivity and quality, prices at Avalon tend to be higher.
“Avalon has higher prices than many other thrift stores because it’s curated through consignment,” first-year Ryan Stoltzfus, a frequent customer, said. “But you never know what you are going to find. One day, you can just go in and find a vintage Christian Dior jacket on the same rack as some frayed jorts.”
Avalon—which has expanded to other locations in different states—originated in Pittsburgh. The store has been at the current location for over a decade, but it will soon be moving to a nearby building, allowing it to double in size.
However, despite its expansion, its main priority is still remaining a welcoming and enticing store.
“We’re a fun little neighborhood store, a little secret in Pittsburgh,” Valentic said. “ It is all locals, but we will get a lot of college students and recent graduates. Everyone comes in the store. You’ll [even] get women who are 80 and want a fur.”
Thoughtful Thriftique
Thriftique, which is run by the National Council of Jewish Women, is located on 125 51st St. When you first enter the store, you are greeted with high ceilings, bright lights, and bustling shoppers. This store is spacious and clean, but the selection is simplistic.
The racks are comprised of basic articles of clothing, resembling any large thrift store. Similarly, there are also non-clothing, household items for sale in the store.
What really sets this thrift store apart from others is the message behind it. The store is a nonprofit organization, and its proceeds go back into community projects.
They are currently paired with Allegheny County to provide prom dresses for high school girls in the county. A room—hidden from public view—contains rows of bright and stylish dresses.
The store also has other programs including back-to-school shopping where, in the past year, they have provided 600 students with new supplies and clothing. The store also provides specific people with vouchers, so they can afford to go in and shop.
Not only is the store kept in pristine condition, but you also know where your money is going. Not only are the reasonably priced clothes that you purchase recycled into the community, but so is your money.
“I’ve been here for 40 something years, and I just love it in this store,” Deborah Olszewski, an employee of the store, said.
Eccentric Eons Fashion
This vintage store, which houses clothing from the turn of the century till the early 1980s, is located on 5850 Ellsworth Ave. Peeping through the windows, one can already see a chaotic combination of mannequins adorned in funky clothing. Once inside, you are immediately greeted with lively music.
Not only does the store contain perfect costume pieces, but it also has a nice selection of clothing that can be worn daily. Right next to the front door, there is a rack of cashmere sweaters that have never been worn.
The owner of the store does not buy any goods online. By hand selecting the goods, the employees at Eons Fashion are not only able to check the quality of the goods, but they are also able to discover the story behind each piece.
“Every piece has an energy to it,” said Beth Shari, the store manager of Eons Fashion Antique. “It is fun to think that these pieces have been in existence for so long, and they’re still able to be enjoyed.”
Creative Clothes Minded
Even from the exterior of this store, Clothes Minded’s personality speaks volumes. Located at 4740 Liberty Ave, this store is easily visible due to its neon sign and the stylishly dressed mannequins in the window.
Inside, the checkered baby blue and white tiles contrast dramatically with the plethora of distinctive decorative pieces. From locally painted artwork and statues to shoes, it will take a couple of moments to take in the view.
“[The store] is very expressive,” Copeland Liddell, the store manager at Clothes Minded said. “It is moving. It is one of those holes in the wall where everyone can find themselves finding themselves.”
Similarly to its decor, Clothes Minded’s clothing racks are an everlasting surprise. From sparkly shirts to Burberry crewnecks, finding anything is possible. With very little cohesion between the clothing, this store is perfect from browsing if you are looking to make a spontaneous purchase.
Thoughts on Thrifting
Regardless of which thrift store you visit, there are many reasons to purchase second-hand goods. Not only are you able to cultivate your own unique style, but you are also making environmentally and economically wise decisions while shopping. The beauty of thrifting is that person is able to find their own reasons for why they thrift.
“Thrifting allows me to try new styles without breaking the bank,” Stoltzfus said. “Some multi-thousand dollar outfits straight from the Paris runway can be replicated for less than $20. It is always exciting finding some unique vintage piece because chances are that nobody around you is going to have that same article of clothing.”

Mac Miller, considered a revolutionary collaborator by the rap community, tragically died in 2018 at the age of 26, sending ripples across the musical world. His last album before his death, Swimming, was his energetic leap into self-discovery and was considered an unfinished musical arc for the young artist. However, due to the efforts of Miller’s producer Jon Brion and his family, his first post-mortem album, Circles, was released on January 17. Circles is the epilogue to the inspirational life led by Mac.
The first song and the title track, “Circles”, plunge the listener into his self-awareness with its first line: “this is how it look(s) like, right before you fall.” The song is a reflection on the circular nature of time and how hard it is for Mac to change himself, as he keeps ‘drawing circles’ in vain. “Complicated” is a 4-minute symphony on the complications in day-to-day life. Brion describes this song as one of Mac’s first attempts into the low vocals and sync-pop rhythms that are present in this song and throughout the album. He continues the theme of not being able to fix “the mess” that he has made, describing his head as ‘cluttered.’ The next song, “Blue World”, starts with a snippet from the 1950s song by The Four Freshmen, and talks about Mac living in a closed world and questioning reality. He makes references to “The Devil,” adding the theme of his struggle with mental health.
“Good News” was the first single that was released after Mac’s death, and shifts focus on the perspective that other people have of Mac. He feels like he has to suppress all the negative feelings that he has because others tell him he is good. He hates “being dealt” all the cards, and uses this idiom as a metaphor for the pressure he feels from being a music artist. He says he just “wants to lie down” for a little bit, a line considered a grim foreshadowing of his untimely death. He continues an outsider perspective on “I Can See”, where he is ready to look for “balance” and “switchin’ location.” “Everybody” is an inspired cover of the song “Everybody’s Gotta Live” by Arthur Lee. His layered vocals and strumming guitars do not hide the saddening reality with which the song ends: “Everybody’s gonna die.”
“Hand Me Downs” features clever lyrics backed by a thumping beat and a flourishing synth. This is one of my favorites on the album, drawing a similarity based on the homophonous similarity of passing down genes and hand-me-down “jeans.” For the rap fans that admire Mac, his song “Hands” is a traditional rap that ruminates on his negative thoughts over pitchy vocals. The last song on the album, “Once a Day”, is a confusing finish to the album, talking about a broken relationship similar to his themes on “Woods”, featured halfway through the album. However, it is important to know that Brion cried as soon as he heard the initial lyrics of this song, and wanted his fans and the world to see what he saw in Mac through the placing of this song.
Overall, Circles is a perfect sequel to Swimming, where Mac departs from his traditional rap style into synth-pop melodies. The internet is riddled with feelings once more since Mac’s passing, combing through his lyrics to find even deeper metaphors and meanings. Personally, I consider this album the swan song of Mac’s arc of self-reformation. Mac’s lyrics are not necessarily deep, but his publicized journey with mental health and drug addiction adds a personal layer for me. I think this album can resonate with anyone who has lost their way in the world. This poignant album crosses genres and is evidence of Mac’s talent and flair with music, where he finally finds solace in sadness.

Little Women, released back in Dec. 2019, is the seventh adaptation of the famous Louisa May Alcott novel of the same name. The new screenplay written and directed by Greta Gerwig boasts a talent-filled cast including, but not limited to, Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep. While Little Women, at first glance, appears to be yet another coming-of-age period drama, Gerwig’s retelling gives the piece a unique sense of boldness and sprightliness that I found to be rather refreshing, but also, in a way, calming.
From a more technical standpoint, the movie was well-shot—the cinematography done beautifully—with Alexandre Desplat’s score assisting in the general flow and transitions. Although in the background, the quaint and often lively notes set the tone as much as the lighting, camera angles, and shots presented on-screen.
Though the beginning felt a little slow, Little Women is paced quite well overall and avoids rushing its story. It is appropriately engaging, and the characters have depth and are well-rounded in general. Little Women also does a fine job of balancing the larger societal issues the film addresses—several of which are still relevant in the present day—with wit and light humor while maintaining the severity and reality of those issues.
The frequent flashbacks throughout the entirety of the movie did become rather distracting, with subplots and backstories being introduced between conflicts and resolutions, but this was, in hindsight, understandable. While the film’s storytelling strategy could have been implemented better, it facilitated the mixture of the darker and lighter parts of the plot, provided insight when needed, and moved the plot forward at a manageable pace. All in all, this choice by Gerwig does not significantly detract from the message of the movie, nor my overall enjoyment of it.
The story told onscreen stayed relatively close to the source material in terms of the major plot points and details. Even portions of dialogue were aptly preserved—a rather bold and impressive feat considering the endeavor of adapting an 800-page novel into a two-and-a-quarter-hour screenplay. The most radical and apparent departure from the novel, however, comes at the conclusion of the film. Whereas in the original story Jo opens a school for boys in Plumfield, Jo opens a school for girls instead, reflecting the rise of women’s colleges and the beginnings of gender equality in education.
This, I believe, is a justifiable change that works in tandem with the feminist themes running throughout the movie. Time and time again, period-persistent issues such as the double standards and differing expectations between men and women, along with the lack of opportunity for occupation and financial independence for women become central to the plot. 
Reflections of these issues can still be found in contemporary culture, and by addressing these phenomena in Little Women, Gerwig makes more awareness and activism possible in order to mitigate these pressing issues.
Little Women is a well-timed film that puts forward a critical message at a critical point in time. With the recent developments in feminism and women’s rights, it seems appropriate that the feminist ideals presented when Little Women was first published over a century-and-a-half ago are brought back into the spotlight with the release of this most recent movie adaptation. Furthermore, Greta Gerwig’s creative decisions, such as having Jo open a school for girls, play an integral role in shaping the time-tested story in a transformative manner. These edits enhance the meaning of the film without feeling forced. As a matter of fact, these changes, in the context of the movie and the original novel, feel like deviations which Alcott herself would have approved.
Little Women may not be the best film of the past year, but it is, without a doubt, one of the most significant. Its message is clear-cut in a way that throws off any guise of subtlety while remaining meaningful and captivating—truly a defining piece arising from a historic novel.

Last week, Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees approved a 3.2 percent increase in undergraduate tuition for the 2020/2021 academic year, setting tuition at $57,560, room and board at $9,210, and a “traditional first-year meal plan” at $6,340 a year. 
This year’s tuition increase follows a 2.9 percent increase for the 2019/2020 academic year, and a 2.87 percent increase the previous year. The 3.2 percent increase will largely support the costs of instruction, as Provost James H. Garrett told The Tartan in a statement. 
According to the Provost’s office, Carnegie Mellon spends “nearly half” of its operating budget on instruction and educational services for undergraduate and graduate students. In the fiscal year of 2019, “tuition alone covered only 44 percent of these expenses,” Garrett stated. 
Garrett added that in addition to instruction costs, the university must “make significant strategic investments” relative to student experience, citing costs like the ongoing 20 million dollar classroom renovation project, new facilities like the recently completed ANSYS Hall, and newly built spaces in Posner Hall.
In the emailed announcement sent to students, Provost Garrett said that “we expect Carnegie Mellon’s contribution to financial aid for undergraduate students to increase 3.8 percent.” “We are committed to expand access to a Carnegie Mellon education by making it as affordable as possible,” Garrett said.
Carnegie Mellon’s financial aid budget “regularly increases in relative proportion to the increase in tuition so the university’s commitments to current students with financial aid can be met,” Garrett told The Tartan. He said that the endowment, as well as donations from alumni and friends of the university, supports from 10 to 12 percent of the undergraduate financial aid budget. 
Students shouldn’t expect to get more in federal loans next year to make up for the cost of increased tuition, however. The limits for federal loans provided to university students, last set in 2012, are not expected to change prior to next school year. Because the federal loan amounts have “remained flat,” Garrett states that universities “have made up that gap” with university money and financial aid.
Garrett told The Tartan that some of his top priorities as provost are affordability for students. He noted that “financial aid is not enough” to attract a “more diverse student community to CMU.” Garrett cited two recent efforts that try to expand on financial aid: the Tartan Scholars Program, which supports the needs of a selected group of 50 academically high-achieving students from a low-income background, and the Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows program, which grants $5,000 to selected faculty who utilize inclusive teaching methods.  
Last year, Garrett said, Carnegie Mellon was able to provide "97 percent of demonstrated financial need." As of now, the university “cannot currently guarantee to meet the full financial need of all our admitted students,” but, Garrett stated, “we are committed to this goal and have been making significant progress toward that goal.”

Every year, more than a tenth of Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate population takes the computer science course 15-112. The only class with more coverage of the undergraduate population is Interpretation and Argument, but that class is structured so that each section is taught different material. No one class at Carnegie Mellon is quite the same as 15-112.
Professor David Kosbie, associate professor in the School of Computer Science, has taught 15-112 for almost every semester since the class’s inception 13 years ago. “There are a lot of freshmen in the course, and we have to help these students learn to manage CMU,” said Kosbie. 
According to Kosbie, managing Carnegie Mellon means developing positive working habits and healthy relationships toward stress, but it also means pushing young students to work hard and challenge themselves in a new, collegiate environment.
And with students working harder, more educational support follows. Kosbie said, “More learning support then pushes students to work even harder. I don’t know which is the cause or the effect.” Right now, according to Kosbie, the goal is to provide roughly one hour of individual instruction for every student in the class. Obviously, two professors can’t provide individual instruction to over 500 students a semester, so the department hires 50 undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs) to fill the gaps. Each TA should average about 10 students in their recitations. That means TAs should spend an average of 12 hours per week on their responsibilities to students: grading quizzes and homework, and providing educational support across a variety of study sessions and recitations.
For some TAs, however, responsibilities don’t end there. Head TA Austin Schick is responsible for helping decide and implement certain changes for the class, and as Schick and Kosbie said, the course changes every semester. Schick, a senior in Computer Science, says that in order to handle all of the duties of 112 TAs, “we’re taking a new structure: one head TA, two associate head TAs, and seven division leads.” The division leads are responsible for a set of managerial duties related to the class, such as dealing with extensions for deadlines, running self-care events, and requesting room assignments.
Two division leads, Lisanne de Groot and Asad Sheikh, a senior in chemistry and a sophomore in statistics and machine learning and human-computer interaction respectively, have somewhat overlapping responsibilities dealing with the mental health of students. De Groot manages student extensions, which forces her to be plugged into her phone almost all day. “Every few hours, I receive a new request,” said de Groot. Sheikh is responsible for running events that push students to take care of themselves. “Being a TA is really fun because we know what it’s like to be a student, so we can shape the class using things we liked about it,” said Sheikh.
With all of these additional responsibilities, TAs sometimes spend more than 20 hours a week on their responsibilities. De Groot and Sheikh mentioned working more than 20 hours in a week sometimes, especially during grading weeks. Schick said, “On light weeks, I work 20 hours a week. On heavier weeks, I work 20 hours a week.” The most a TA will be allowed to work in a week is 20 hours, but Kosbie makes a point to tell the TAs to stop working so hard. “These TAs bleed 112 blue. They grow up through the course, and because of that, they put in more than 20 hours a week no matter what we say.”
All of the TAs are deeply passionate people. One of the things mentioned by everyone is how much the TAs care about 15-112, and everyone said something about how deeply each TA has to care about education. TAs push students hard, and the students work to match it.
In the past, the culture around 15-112 has turned Carnegie Mellon into a more inclusive space. Once upon a time, 15-112 TAs and the students taking the course were predominantly men. Now, much like Carnegie Mellon’s gender ratio has moved toward a more equal one, 15-112 sees many more women students and TAs. Kosbie recognized this early in the development of 15-112, saying that one of their first social goals with the class was to develop a more inclusive environment for everyone.
Now, the class has changed again. Mental health initiatives, such as the ones led by Sheikh, are an integral part of the 15-112 experience this semester. Just last week, the first event was held. A group of students colored together, taking a break from the stress of Carnegie Mellon. The effectiveness of these new initiatives to decrease student stress and refocus certain priorities will be seen in the coming semesters.

“The Institute for Software Research was originally a collection of people doing great things, but whose work just didn’t fit neatly into any of the available niches. With our experience over the years, we are discovering unifying themes, and that we actually have a great deal in common, in terms of interests and methods and overlapping topics,” said Jim Herbsleb, now at the helm of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Software Research (ISR).
Herbsleb was appointed the director of the ISR in Dec. of 2019, replacing former director Bill Scherlis. Herbsleb discussed his new role, plans for the future, and the history of the ISR with The Tartan.
Originally, Herbsleb only worked in software engineering. Later, Herbsleb changed direction, becoming the director of the ISR’s Societal Computing PhD program. He has been a Carnegie Mellon faculty member for 17 years now, and has been involved with the ISR since its earliest stages. Preceding his new role, Herbsleb was the ISR’s interim director.
“Several years in, the role really helped me gain a better understanding of how my colleagues were approaching the issues of measuring, understanding, and shaping the impact of technology on society,” Herbsleb said.
Over the past decade, he has been transforming the ISR undergraduate course Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing. He watched it grow from three students in his first offering to its current size of sixty students, along with a substantial waitlist.
Looking to the near future, Herbsleb said, “As we see computing technology take on an ever larger role in everyone’s life — from social media, to automation, to the Internet of things, to cyber-physical systems, to socio-technical systems — many of the research themes that ISR is known for are increasingly front stage.”
The ISR currently faces the unique challenge of building systems that integrate software, hardware, and human elements. With the expanding amount of data collected by companies and governments, and difficulties in disseminating information, privacy is also relevant to the ISR. Some of its other noteworthy objectives are protecting wildlife and combating fake news.
Herbsleb touched on the role automation plays in combating the rapidly escalating costs of societal-scale systems. He explained that automation can repair bugs, enable self-healing systems, and ensure the quality of highly configurable systems.
“Computing technology and software are in everything from light bulbs to thermostats to electric shavers, not to mention the millions of lines of code in the typical car. So there is vastly more code to maintain than just a few years ago. Moreover, the trend is to connect everything to the internet, which means things can interact in unexpected ways, and there are many more ways for an attacker to gain access,” Herbsleb said.
The ISR seeks to understand complex, socially-impactful systems that, as Herbsleb put it, can “fundamentally change the nature of work and create new security threats.”
Some of the social impacts of these systems include clashes between corporations’ commercial interests and our privacy, and wide circulation of information and disinformation. Herbsleb said, “groups of like-minded people form isolated echo chambers, reinforcing each others’ beliefs. This can give interested hobbyists a place to talk about their favorite topics, but it also means that misogynists, flat-earthers, and white supremacist groups can form isolated groups within which they egg each other on without confronting dissenters.”
Herbsleb’s research covers collaboration and coordination, especially that of open source ecosystems. “With colleagues, I developed and tested a theory of coordination we called socio-technical congruence. The guiding idea is that any technical project can be thought of as a network of engineering decisions that mutually constrain each other, which defines a distributed constraint satisfaction problem for that project,” Herbsleb explained.
Constraint satisfaction problems can be solved with social algorithms, Herbsleb says. “When there is a good match — congruence — between the problem and the social algorithm, the project experiences higher productivity and fewer bugs.”
Reflecting on Scherlis’ former role at the ISR, Herbsleb says that “Under [Scherlis’] leadership, the ISR made great hiring decisions, developed a unique research portfolio, and positioned itself in a key role in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. He put together a staff that I think is unmatched in SCS, which continues to have a huge role in our success.”
When Scherlis became director, Herbsleb recalls the ISR having around four members. The ISR’s expertise was limited to software architecture, applied formal methods, and security. Under Scherlis, the ISR integrated major research programs in privacy, design of languages, facial recognition, illegal online marketplaces, socio-technical systems, automated bug repair, adversarial game theory, and more.
Now, Scherlis has an executive role at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which he left the ISR to pursue.
As for the immediate future of the ISR, Herbsleb sees no discontinuities in its current work. However, the ISR will be moving to the new Tata Consultancy Services-funded building (TCS Hall) shortly after commencement this year.
“I’ve toured the TCS site, and I think it is going to be a great home for us. But it is a little isolating, since traveling between TCS and other CS buildings like Gates and Newell-Simon requires venturing outside,” Herbsleb commented.
Regarding the whole of the ISR, Herbsleb said, “I think we all want to recognize and build on our common ground, but maintain our openness to new and nonconforming ideas, problems, and approaches.”

Carnegie Mellon hosted its 21st annual Martin Luther King Jr. Writing Awards on the eponymous holiday dedicated to the civil rights leader. The reception was open to the public, with an audience comprised of students from around Pittsburgh and beyond, award winners’ families, and faculty from nearby colleges. 
The awards opened with the School of Drama choir performing “We Shall Overcome” and “Glory.” From there, Myia Culbreath, a senior history major, and Provost James Garrett gave the opening remarks, which emphasized the importance of the event and how far it has come. 
The awards themselves were then presented by the awards’ founder, Jim Daniels, who is a writing professor in the English department. There were four main categories: high school poetry, high school prose, college poetry, and college prose. 
In addition, there was a special award and performance for a play submitted, as well as awards for the winner from each individual school that participated in the awards. 
The winners in the main categories shared their pieces for the audience. The Tartan reached out to the winner of the college prose prize: Julia Hou, a senior computer science major at Carnegie Mellon. She talked about her piece, titled "To the Boy Who Groped Me in Seventh Grade," and the value of writing to her. 
“Sharing my experiences through my lens allows me to take back control in situations where I feel like I don’t have any, and I learn a lot about myself when I do,” she shared. She also later said that the best part about sharing her experience is “that there might be someone out there who listens to you and realizes they can relate.”
She echoed the sentiments of the opening speakers about the importance of the awards. “The awards are important because it provides a way for people to get their stories out there, feel like their voices are being heard. This is especially true with stories of discrimination, because it takes a lot of vulnerability to put those on paper.”
The event closed with M. Shernell Smith, associate director for the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, celebrating the winners. She asked the house lights to be turned up to then celebrate the winners’ families for supporting them. 
Daniels told The Tartan about his plans for the awards in the future, including hosting more writing workshops involving the previous winners, as well getting more schools involved and increasing the prize money. 
He emphasized the value of individual stories, “having discussions,” and “hearing the range of experiences” in getting people “to talk about the issues that divide us,” and said that he will remain committed to getting more people involved in the awards.

Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) has established a new scholarship fund for SCS students to honor Jacobo Carrasquel, a longtime SCS first-year academic advisor who retired last September. Carrasquel, from Caracas, Venezuela, spent nearly four decades at Carnegie Mellon, attending first as a student before becoming a teaching faculty member and academic advisor.
As a faculty member, he taught students from all seven colleges at Carnegie Mellon, and helped establish the university’s campus in Doha, Qatar. Because of his longtime devotion to and significant impact on the university, he was granted the title of professor emeritus this year.
According to federal education reports, Hispanic students make up less than 6% of the overall student population at Carnegie Mellon.
Within SCS, Hispanic students make up less than 1% of the graduating class according to the school’s 2017 Factbook. The newly established need-based scholarship is intended to encourage more minorities with financial needs to apply, and is primarily geared toward Hispanic students planning to major in computer science. Both current and newly-admitted SCS students are eligible to apply.
“I have always believed in the strength that comes from diversity,” Carrasquel told The Tartan. “One of our goals has been to increase [the number of] underrepresented minorities in SCS. This scholarship will help this cause.”
The scholarship is also the first of its kind in Pittsburgh, according to Carrasquel, including among our neighboring universities.
Funding for the scholarship will come largely from community donations. The scholarship’s fund is featured on the “Explore Our Funds” page page for SCS, where it is currently accepting donations. The goal is to raise $50,000 over the next three years, which would support two or three students.
In general, Carrasquel advises students with financial needs to talk with their academic advisors. He points out that many companies find it in their interest to invest in new talent, and thus, donate money to Carnegie Mellon to support its students.
“These companies look for specific students,” he said. “For example, male undergraduates who are interested in finances, female undergraduates interested in the aviation industry, minorities who are interested in cybersecurity, etc.”
Companies’ donations do not amount to full scholarships, but they may be in the amount of a few thousand dollars, which can significantly lessen financial burdens. Carrasquel wants students worrying about Carnegie Mellon’s financial burden to know that academic advisors may be able to connect them with opportunities for tuition help.

2020 has barely begun, but it already feels stretched out. Trump’s impeachment dominates the main pages of basically every news outlet. Democratic activists are fragmented and shouting at each other, insisting that their choice of candidate is the only one that can beat Trump in the upcoming election. Your social media feed is probably no exception to this trend, with your friends sharing news updates and trying to make sense of the world. These same topics with the same handful of opinions appear to be the only noise worth making.
It might seem hard to argue that events like the impeachment process or the 2020 presidential election are undeserving of our attention. However, there comes a point where all our energy is being spent on a handful of issues, and we overlook other crucial topics that are worth our attention. We might even find ourselves losing our stamina for action.
Political burnout can sap motivation to take proactive steps towards change or otherwise continue to engage in the world. Although visceral reactions of outrage might have good intentions, what has come out of the short-lived anger after seeing sensationalist headlines? Maybe you clicked “retweet” or reacted to some posts on Facebook. Maybe you marched in some protests here and there or called your local representative and went on with your day as usual.
The world needs this kind of passion, but we need to be mindful that these few issues that appear to be all-encompassing in our current world are not the only ones at hand. Amid the impeachment process, how many of us were aware that pharmaceutical executive John Kapoor was sentenced to 66 months in prison, a step towards holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for their contribution to the opioid epidemic? How many of us are aware that the travel ban will be extended? How about the protests in Puerto Rico that are calling for Governor Vazquez to step down, one even bringing a guillotine to the governor’s mansion?
It’s hard to keep track of everything happening at any moment, especially when it feels inescapable in your environment. Online algorithms know that you’re more likely to click on a feel-good story about a cute baby koala rescued from an Australia bushfire than you would Colombia’s Amazon tribes’ tapping into rainforest protection funds or the emerging Amazon Council that intends to enforce environmental policies.
Don't underestimate the importance of local news. Part of being an active member of society is being aware of who represents your area or how your local politics can protect you and your neighbors. Learn about the large polluters that contribute to Pittsburgh's poor air quality, and hold these plants accountable for endangering the city's health. Our city is planning to adopt law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) to avoid throwing nonviolent criminals into jail and, instead, tackle the issues that drove them to crime. Our public transportation system has shrunken and become less accessible. These issues may appear to be relatively small in comparison to the "big-issue" topics on your Snapchat story recommendations, but local engagement can help create the foundations for new policies and larger-scale change.
With all this being said, it's also important to remember to take a break when you need one. After inescapable, repetitive, and seemingly fruitless discussions about the current presidency, at what point does our adrenaline crash into overwhelming fatigue? Outrage fatigue can emerge from the constant bombardment of global issues. To combat this, let's try to maintain our political energy by refocusing our attention to different causes that we can commit ourselves to. Try to be more conscientious of when your built-up rage and want for action shifts into cynicism and hopelessness. Especially in turbulent times, it's important to learn how to rest rather than quitting.

It happened again. I sighed as I opened up Facebook to see a new post on the private Facebook page Overheard at Carnegie Mellon reading, “at schartz [Schatz]: [I] don’t believe in [ADHD].” That post indicated another unknown member of our community who did not “believe in” my neurodivergence, a condition that affects how I function in my day-to-day life. I was reminded yet again that there were people in proximity to me who probably thought I was a charlatan after extra-time and note-taking accommodations, despite medical textbooks referencing ADHD since as early as 1775.
Ableism seems to be a recurring pattern in the Carnegie Mellon community as chronically ill, disabled, and neurodivergent people — especially autistic people — seem to be the butt of a joke or rant every few months on the popular Facebook pages Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens or Overheard. In April, an Overheard post that quoted someone calling tech people “borderline autistic” had disappointing reactions. In the early fall semester, someone posted a now-deleted meme that mocked autistic people in Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens. In October, a moderator of that same group posted a meme shaming people who use the Wean elevator to go up one floor.
Ableism at Carnegie Mellon is not limited to Facebook posts; it also extends to ableist language in students’ vernacular, negative attitudes that Carnegie Mellon faculty and students hold toward neurodivergence, and the general inaccessibility of campus buildings.
Ableist slurs such as the r-word and "lame" are relatively common in the comment section of our Facebook groups and in our regular conversations. However, just as frequent is the demonization of the word “autistic.” There seems to be a trend of using “autistic” to derogatorily describe anything ridiculous or socially awkward instead of using it to describe people with the disability. Some of you may think that “words are just words,” but words shape attitudes and associations. Through constant misuse of the word, autism is negatively connotated and associated with ignorance and social undesirability. These associations can lead to ableist incidences, such as someone trying to correlate a former Carnegie Mellon student’s bigotry with autism in my inbox.
Almost every student who has needed accommodations for class can probably share a story about faculty being unsupportive toward the student’s needs. One academic advisor told a student that most students who get accommodations try their best not to use them and that she should follow their example. I’ve also had a TA once tell me that I didn’t need my extra-time accommodations. Faculty who exercise this type of policing actually harm the success of students with invisible disabilities or neurodivergence. If faculty are constantly judging for themselves if students are worthy of their accommodations, then they are actively discouraging students from self-advocating for the resources that they truly need.
When I was running around campus with ABLE CMU to prepare for our accessibility awareness campaign, I realized then how inaccessible main campus is for those who aren’t able-bodied. The College of Fine Arts building has so many more stairs than elevators that I don’t know if there was a straightforward way to get to the studios without using the stairs. There is a room in Porter Hall that can only be accessed through stairs. As able-bodied people, we don’t really think about how much longer it takes to get to the basement of Hamerschlag Hall by only using ramps and elevators than it takes to just use the stairs down to Rothberg's Roasters. Our privilege makes us unaware of the struggles that disabled people endure while navigating a partly inaccessible campus.
Before I conclude this article, I want to make a couple of disclaimers. First, I’m not insinuating that everyone on campus is malicious through these instances of ableism. I understand that people who make these ableist remarks or use ableist language lack awareness or knowledge of their problematic behavior. Also, the people mentioned in the article were very responsive to fixing their mistakes when addressed. I find that very admirable. For example, I commend the creator of the Wean elevator meme for adding a disclaimer stating: “definitely take the elevator if you need it!” Second, nowhere in my article do I state that everyone in our community is ableist. In fact, I appreciate all the allies who sometimes take the effort to advocate for disabled and neurodivergent students. I also have had positive experiences working with the Office of Disability Resources. However, there shouldn’t be just a few allies on campus who occasionally speak up against ableism in the community. If the Carnegie Mellon community wants to claim that they are inclusive of disabled and neurodivergent people, everyone needs to participate in unlearning ableism. Finally, if you already practice allyship with the disabled and neurodivergent community at Carnegie Mellon and are actively eliminating ableist language from your vocabulary, then the “call outs” in this article are obviously not meant for you.
Carnegie Mellon can definitely do better in how it treats its disabled and neurodivergent community members. For starters, the administration can include disability and neurodivergence in cultural competency training for staff and faculty. Individuals reading this article can also take away the points of being aware of ableist language. The most important way to support disabled and neurodivergent people is by unlearning the ableist idea that people need to deserve their existence or comfort. Who cares if people are taking the elevator one floor up? Are you going to personally vet each person that enters the elevator for the sake of a minor convenience? Do you really want to ostracize and out someone with an invisible disability for the possibility that the elevator will be a little emptier? If people could be less concerned about gatekeeping existence and happiness, then disabled and neurodivergent people can safely exist and use their accommodations without being judged.

The U.S. is not the only country where one's gender identity can disqualify them from military service. This past week, Byun Hui-Su, a South Korean transgender woman, was discharged from the South Korean military. The former staff sergeant is now planning to pursue legal action and wishes to return to service.
Cisgender women are allowed to serve, and make up for more than 10,000 members of the South Korean military. However, because Byun underwent sex reassignment surgery, the government considers her to have a “mental and physical disability” that disqualifies her from service.
South Korea has a ways to go in terms of LGBT+ rights. Not only does the country fail to have marriage equality, the military also goes so far as to punish some same-sex relationships with up to two years in prison. Article 92-6 prohibits “indecent acts” such as sodomy.
The South Korean government claims that it does not exclude gay and transgender people from serving. Although Article 92-6 does not explicitly discriminate LGBT+ citizens from serving, the military has yet to investigate or convict heterosexual members for engaging in the same behaviors that would have booted LGBT+ members out.
Like the U.S., South Korea holds their service members to stringent physical and mental standards. This leads to the argument that it is irresponsible or dangerous to allow transgender people to serve just as it would be irresponsible to let someone with a disabling physical condition into the military. We also see this sentiment in the U.S. as well, with President Trump enacting the transgender military policy just last year. 
Of course, military service for any country is demanding physically and mentally. It would be naive to say that every country should lift all medical standards and requirements for joining the military, but gender identity should not be a potential disqualifier. In three years of allowing transgender people into the United States military and granting access to gender-affirming care during their service, there has not been a valid sign for concern for allowing transgender service members. It can be easy to assume that transgender people are mentally unfit for service because gender dysphoria is a mental condition. However, gender dysphoria is not a mental illness, and there is no evidence that it prevents successful service. If this were the case, the U.S. would have let go of all service members with gender dysphoria instead of cutting off access to hormones or gender-affirming surgery.
While many other cisgender Korean men actively try to postpone their mandatory military service, Byun is willingly marching to the front lines. Her previous service has demonstrated her competence, and her strides to continue her service further confirm her capability to serve her country.

An anonymous submission to the Facebook page Confessions from Carnegie Mellon last week made me stop in my tracks. The poster of Confession #696 stated that they don't know why people “make a big deal about walking alone at night” and that the worst that would happen is “a crazy” would walk up and “ramble or taunt some nonsense.” This is our society's default attitude towards victims: the responsibility to protect the vulnerable members of our communities falls on vulnerable people. In 2018, the #MeToo movement brought out stories of the sexual harassment that thousands of women, men, and LGBTQ people around the world have faced, and Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony at the hearings for Kavanaugh's appointment resulted in an outpouring of anger and sadness from women who revealed the pain and trauma of not being believed.
As a woman who grew up in India, I became aware of the horrors of sexual assault after the 2012 Nirbhaya attack, where a young physiotherapist was gang-raped by drunk men on a moving bus. The rape, the graphic details revealed by the media, and the raging debate across the nation that revealed fundamental contradictions in our society were defining moments in my 13-year-old mind.
The first question that many in the older generation asked was “why did she even go out at night?” after shaking their heads in faux-sympathy at her suffering. They attempted to imply that, while her rape is terrible, it was inevitable because she had made the mistake of going out at night. But in a country whose majority worships goddesses like the powerful Durga, the women were no longer under the illusion that they were safe. Apps were launched to help women protect themselves. There were rumors of phones being designed for women with a special SOS button. Most initiatives to protect women were at an individual level rather than a societal one. And any woman who was attacked after going out at night now had to “share the blame” of being attacked, the common refrain being that she had already known what would happen if she’s out at night.
It’s frustrating. It feels like one is screaming into the void; the noise drowns out the screams of millions of women who must bear the burden of managing personal and professional lives while fearing for their safety. It also has irrevocably changed family dynamics. Men became more proactive in protecting women now that they were armed with more information and awareness on sexual assault from the news media. As women became braver and reported the sexual harassment they faced from family members, a critical issue once considered taboo began to be illuminated. Women are not safe anywhere: not at home, not outside, not in the day, not at night. 
Almost seven years after the Nirbhaya incident came the horrible rape and murder of a young veterinarian who was returning home from work in my home city of Hyderabad. It was sickening to scroll through news reports and hearing the debates on the issue was even worse. Nobody supported the rapists, but they blamed the victim for having been out at night. In 2017 alone, Reuters reported that over 32,000 rape cases had been filed in India, or about 90 per day. If there isn’t societal action taken to combat this epidemic,  our women won’t be safe anytime soon.
This isn’t just a phenomenon in India, though. A Twitter thread started after hearing Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony highlighted the lengths to which women go to to protect themselves: holding keys between their fingers, pretending to be talking to someone on the phone, not wearing ponytails that could be grabbed. Taking precautions against hostility takes a significant amount of mental energy. Additionally, members of the LGBTQ community also continue to suffer due to this violence. Transgender murder rates have been spiking in recent years.
If we believe that campuses are safe havens from the horrors of the world outside, we're being delusional. Chanel Miller, who attended a fraternity party at Stanford University, was sexually assaulted while unconscious behind a dumpster by student Brock Turner. Just last year, a University of Southern Carolina student was kidnapped and murdered after getting into a car thinking it was her Uber. There have been incidents two semesters ago in which women reported being chased by strangers in the neighboring areas of Carnegie Mellon. It was later reported that the chasers were from Denison University and had been participating in a “scavenger hunt.” While the Denison students were let off without any criminal charges filed against them, an undercurrent of fear ran through female students on campus. What is fun and games for some people is a matter of life-and-death for people belonging to vulnerable communities. 
Carnegie Mellon also has much more to do in terms of protecting members of these communities. Of 877 undergraduate women who took the Association of American Universities Campus Climate survey, 18.6% reported that they had experienced victimization incidents of nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability, 10.1% reported experiencing victimization by penetration by physical force or inability to consent, and 13.8% reported victimization by sexual touching by physical force or inability to consent. 9.3% of the Trans (man or woman), Genderqueer (or nonbinary), Questioning, or Non-listed (TGQN) students reported experiencing victimization by nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent, 3.4% reported penetration victimization by physical force or inability to consent, and 9.3% reported experiencing victimization by sexual touching by physical force or inability to consent. 
Women and TGQN students at Carnegie Mellon experience this form of harassment at disproportionately high rates compared to men. Of the 613 undergraduate men who responded to the survey, 4.8% reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent, 1% reported experiencing incidents of penetration by physical force or inability to consent, and 1.2% reported experiencing incidents of victimization by sexual touching by physical force or inability to consent.
The original poster of confession #696 has so casually reduced harassment to “taunting some nonsense," a reflection of the callousness with which we treat our fellow humans in distress. Providing support and justice to victims is the least that any university or community can do. Participatory action research at Carnegie Mellon to combat this silent suffering endured by so many of our peers is long overdue. We should have mandatory annual initiatives that teach us concepts such as consent and how to help as bystanders. This is not a radical idea. If Carnegie Mellon intends to help bright and intelligent students “create the future,” it should ensure that the students go on to create a world that is open and safe for members of different communities.
