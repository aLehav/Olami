Last Sunday, NBA fans were treated to an impressive All-Star weekend. Or perhaps it was the boring Super Bowl and its awful Maroon 5 performance that made an actually typical All-Star game and disappointing Slam Dunk Contest seem so entertaining. Hamidou Diallo won the Slam Dunk Contest, Jayson Tatum won the Skills Challenge, and Team Lebron won the All-Star game.
Overall, it was a decent weekend of entertainment. The All-Star game itself was the usual chuck threes and dunk game without defense a fan could expect (save last year’s game which was pretty enjoyable). Giannis Antetokounmpo dominated the first quarter, and Team Lebron came back for the win. That’s essentially all you need to know. Otherwise, the NBA really managed to hit a home run that other franchises are really struggling to do. Just the draft itself was fun to follow. Giannis did his draft shenanigans, stealing Ben Simmons from Lebron’s draft plan only to trade him away later for Russell Westbrook.
That set up a bit of drama with Westbrook and Joel Embiid, where some holdover beef from a recent game between their respective teams got dragged out by the usual over-the-top nature of Westbrook refusing to drop it during an interview. 
Although there were some pretty big snubs, like Rudy Gobert, old legends Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade got added to make it all up. Rest assured, all fans shed a tear seeing Nowitzki hitting those deep threes and Wade lobbing it up one more time for Lebron James. And it would be a travesty to not include the fact that Ray Allen demonstrated his beautiful form in the Celebrity Game, which treated us all with memes of Lebron trying to recruit Allen out of retirement.
The other fixture to note was the 3-Point Contest. Stephen Curry set the bar high in his hometown of Charlotte, but the dark horse sleeper, Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets, upset the festivities and shot himself into relevance. He earned the respect he deserves for what he does for the Nets. Harris drained the money ball racks in both rounds to just barely edge out Curry with 26 points to 24.
Perhaps the best part of all the festivities were the celebrities that the NBA brought in to perform. Meek Mill opened the All-Star game in what is perhaps the best comeback of all time — from sitting in a jail cell to an All-Star weekend performance. It made for out of this world player introductions, and everything was smooth and sleek from one thing to the next, unlike the transitions in the Super Bowl halftime performance.
J. Cole’s halftime show was an absolute masterpiece. He kept it simple, with just him, a stage, two backup singers, a band, and no overdone pyrotechnics or seizure-inducing lights. The audience actually looked into it, as opposed to the paid dancers at the Super Bowl show, and they were into it for good reason. The performance felt intimate, with J. Cole’s life on stage seen in his interaction with the audience. Most of all, J. Cole himself was into his own music, and the genuine passion was infectious even through the TV; it wasn’t a shirtless convulsion while belting out ear-splitting lyrics. Hopefully, other leagues can learn from the NBA on how to put on a show, and other celebrities will look to the masterclass performances of J. Cole and Meek Mill so that we can all get the relaxation and entertainment we deserve.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
I’ve written a lot about football so far in Penalty Shouts, and this week has to be no different. It’s been a gut-busting week for Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and confirmed bad guy. If I recall correctly, you heard it here first that Kraft sucks, so it’s safe to say that this is the first time Penalty Shouts has had a scoop on a piece of breaking news. But what did he even do? The facts of the case so far are that he solicited prostitution — as a 77-year-old — from a spa called “Orchids of Asia.”
There needs to be a quick sidebar for a serious moment. Human trafficking is an awful crime, and the women who worked at the day spa were not there by their own volition. To think that Robert Kraft, billionaire, could not have found women who chose to work in the industry is naive. And frankly, it’s always terrifying to think that people like Robert Kraft are the type of people that have been granted positions of power in the world.
But “Orchids of Asia?” Are you serious? It sounds like the business wanted the Feds to bust down their door and find a prostitution ring. And to get caught at a place called “Orchids of Asia?” I’m stunned at the sheer stupidity of Kraft. He had to have known the Feds were onto the place.
There are so many other things he could have done, too. Prostitution is legal in Nevada, so why not just take a weekend trip to Las Vegas? He could have taken a little time to throw in some gambling. Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands too, so why not take a week-long trip to Europe? I heard that most drugs are pretty easy to obtain in the Netherlands, so Kraft could even keep up his coke habit. Here’s the best thing he could have done: not solicit prostitutes.
Kraft is 77 years old. Yet, he’s living like he’s still a strapping young lad. He should take a moment, reorganize some priorities, and realize that his very conventionally attractive 39-year-old girlfriend is going to keep him young for a long time.
The worst part about Kraft’s crime is that a recent publication cites a source close to Kraft who says that he changed a lot after his wife’s death six years ago. It didn’t take him too long to find a young girlfriend, so it seems like his latent sexual promiscuity didn’t come out of nowhere. Maybe what got him down were the 48 years of happy marriage or the recent successes of the Patriots. Maybe it was the billions of dollars in net worth. Whatever made Kraft change like that, it probably wasn’t a lack of meaning in his life now that his wife is dead because that would require a soul from before a few years ago.
I promise the next few weeks won’t be football, but sometimes, it’s just too easy to write about the league. The comedy writes itself, and the league needs to do something to help itself out.

It’s officially baseball season, and Bryce Harper still hasn’t signed a contract. In more exciting news, the Pirates have won their first Spring training game against the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of 3-2. One game isn’t enough to extrapolate for anything, but it’s always good luck to win the first outing of the season.
Before the first game, manager Clint Hurdle made the decision to set out the first four starters of the rotation. The Opening Day start goes to Jameson Taillon, and the rest of the rotation goes to Trevor Williams, Joe Musgrove, and Chris Archer in that order. The fifth spot is up for grabs during the next month.
But the first start of spring training went to utility pitcher Steven Brault. In two innings, Brault threw two full innings without giving up a run. After Jean Segura and Andrew McCutchen reached base for the Phillies in the first inning, Brault got the next five batters out including Phillies slugger Rhys Hoskins.
After the first two innings, the Pirates pitchers gave up seven hits and two earned runs, and they combined for six strikeouts. The two runs came in the last two innings to Geoff Hartlieb, who ended up with the win thanks to a top of the ninth inning home run from Center fielder Jason Martin.
For the first few innings, the Pirates struggled to get a hit. Shortstop Kevin Newman got the first hit of the game, a double, in the fourth inning; Newman moved to third on an infield ground ball, and he scored on a wild pitch by Jose Alvarez. There were only a total of three hits in the game, and the other hit, not from Newman and Alvarez, went to right fielder Bryan Reynolds.
As for the fielding play by the Pirates, right fielder Patrick Kivlehan and third baseman Colin Moran both had throwing errors in the first inning. After that, the fielding was clean for the Pirates with the Phillies notching zero hits with runners in scoring position. The Phillies left seven runners on base.
The result doesn’t say much for the outcome of either team’s season, but it’s a good sign that the Pirates were able to stick with a Phillies team that featured a lot of their season hopefuls. Jean Segura, Rhys Hoskins, J.T. Realmuto, and of course, ex-Pirate Andrew McCutchen are all on track to be some of the quality players on the Phillies roster.
Even on the mound, the team threw quality arms at the Pirates. Enyel De Los Santos, Seranthony Dominguez, Jose Alvarez, and Adam Morgan combined for seven strikeouts. Four came from De Los Santos, and there was only one hit allowed by Alvarez. So it’s a good sign that the Pirates were able to hang in with the Phillies in their first spring training game.
In other news, this game was the first game for the Pirates with a 20-second pitch clock. The Post-Gazette reported that Clint Hurdle has been working with his pitchers to complete their windup within 15 seconds. It’s the first season that the clock has been introduced at the Major League level, and like most rule changes, players are split. However, it seems like the young Pirates rotation is willingly adapting to the change.
Coming up for the Pirates is a full week of games from Sunday to Sunday, with a doubleheader on Friday against the Phillies and Blue Jays. Their first televised game is Wednesday, March 6 on ESPN against the Red Sox. Then, a few games between March 7 and 23 are televised on AT&T SportsNet.

Carnegie Mellon’s new Tepper Quadrangle has been awarded a LEED gold certification, earning a score of 73 points on the LEED scale for its focus on sustainable architecture and reducing its environmental impact. To earn a gold certification, a building must earn between 60 to 79 points.
According to Tepper School Dean Robert Dammon in a Carnegie Mellon press release, “From the start, the Tepper Quad was planned as a green building.” Several elements of the building’s construction — from the 120,000-gallon cistern for collecting rain water to the voided slab construction that made ample use of recycled plastics—were incorporated with the certification in mind. Additionally, while other buildings on Carnegie Mellon’s campus also have the LEED gold certification (e.g. Gates Hillman complex, Scott Hall, the Collaborative Innovation Center), none of them are as large or complex as the Tepper Quadrangle.
Pursuing a LEED certification is no small task, as the specifications are stringent. Not only must architects consider the amount of material they are using for a building and the processes of construction, they must also plan built-in features that can help offset the inevitable environmental impact. Because these features are difficult to integrate, they must be planned out beforehand, making the building planning process more cumbersome for designers. Furthermore, the current guidelines for LEED also consider ease of transportation to and from the building as a way of regulating vehicle carbon emissions, awarding more points to buildings that are pedestrian or bike friendly. The associated complexity of all these requirements can drag out construction times, making construction projects last longer than initially intended.
There are those, however, that believe the LEED certification process is not strict enough. In fact, some see LEED as a glorified badge awarded to firms who have the time and patience to pursue such certifications rather than a certification that’s given out for actual architectural merit. Some of the greenest buildings in the world have no certification, solely because they decided not to pursue any. Thus, while a LEED certification does designate a building as more environmentally friendly than its non-certified peers, it is important to keep in mind that money and bureaucracy play a role in which buildings are certified and which are not.
Ultimately, Tepper’s LEED certification should be considered a net positive, as it shows that the university cares about its impact on the environment. Hopefully, future expansions of the campus will follow this trend of green architecture, allowing Carnegie Mellon to expand in an eco-friendly and unobtrusive manner.

There are some websites that you probably know you should not click on. They might have a weird domain name, or ads that tell you about hot singles in your area, or other seedy but innocuous symbols of internet malfeasance. The website's real purpose, however, is to give your computer some sort of nasty malware, or to obtain your personal information. 
Unfortunately, users often visit these websites anyway. To combat exposure to risky domains, one common strategy is to blacklist sites that have been flagged as known malware or phishing URLs. Services such as Google Safe Browsing maintain a list of dangerous sites and warn users when they try to access them. 
A study titled "Predicting Impending Exposure to Malicious Content
from User Behavior" from Carnegie Mellon's CyLab and Japanese telecommunications company KDDI, improves on this model by building a system that attempts to predict when users are about to attempt to access risky sites, allowing more time for possible intervention. 
Ph.D. candidate and co-author Mahmood Sharif told The Tartan that the '"traditional defenses like anti-viruses and blacklists" are often reactive rather than proactive, which can put the user at risk because "by the time they react, users are often about to execute malicious programs or visit risky websites." Furthermore, current systems operate as the "last line of defense" with very few protections after a user chooses to bypass a warning.
The researchers, including Sharif, Carnegie Mellon Professor Nicolas Christin, and Jumpei Urakawa, Ayumu Kubota, and Akira Yamada from KDDI research, used browsing data from over 20,000 KDDI mobile phone users who opted to help build and train their model. 
They found that 11 percent of users were, in fact, exposed to sites in the Google Safe Browsing database at some point, and that exposed users had some meaningful differences from users that were not, both in terms of their behavior in their browsing sessions and their answers to behavioral questions on a survey. 
Users who were exposed to malicious sites tended to browse longer and later, requesting more web pages than unexposed users. Users who frequented advertising or adult websites were more likely to be exposed. 
Somewhat counterintuitive, the study found that the strongest effect in the survey responses was whether users reported they had anti-virus software installed, perhaps because it allows users to be more confident when proceeding to view pages flagged as risky. Users who stated that they tended to proceed past browser warnings also were more likely to be exposed, which suggests that some other measures may be needed to deter risky behavior.
The system the researchers built, according to Sharif, "leverages cues from users’ browsing behavior that are indicative of future exposure,” like the categories of websites they are visiting and the rate of content downloading and uploading.
The study uses this system to try and predict if a browsing session will result in exposure, which it did with around a 90 percent true positive rate and a one percent false positive rate. This low false positive rate was only achieved once the researchers expanded their definitions of true positives to include websites marked as risky within the next year. "Too many false positives can disrupt users’ normal (and safe) browsing, and may lead the system to be unusable," said Sharif. 
The code used to train the neural networks has been released, but the training data has not, due to privacy concerns.
The authors of the paper hope that systems like these will give users more time to think about the risk of accessing dangerous websites or allow networks where a compromised computer could be catastrophic to terminate a browsing session before exposure. This study pokes at the squishy vulnerability that all our personal devices suffer from — risky behavior from the human operating it.

The Antarctic ice shelves are one of the main victims of climate change. A report published in Nature Communications by a team of researchers co-led by the University of Cambridge finds that the stability of a floating Antarctic ice shelf is threatened by meltwater lakes on its surface. The flexing of ice shelves has been hypothesized and simulated by computer models in the past, but this study represents the first time it has been observed in the real world. 
Most of Antarctica is blanketed by the four-kilometer-thick Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough ice to raise the global sea level by around 58 meters. For most of the year, temperatures above the ice are below zero, keeping the continent solidly frozen. However, the fringes of the ice sheet are made up of floating ice shelves that are no more than a kilometer thick and partially exposed above the ocean. In summer months, these floating icebergs are susceptible to melting, especially as the climate continues to get warmer.
If melted ice water runs off the steep slopes of ice sheets into the ocean, there is little risk to frozen ice shelves. Unfortunately, surface depressions on the ice shelf allow water to pool into large lakes — the weight of these meltwater lakes exerts tremendous pressure on the floating ice, forcing it to sink deeper. Around the edges of the lakes, the ice flexes upwards to keep itself afloat and compensate as the water drains.
“It is this filling and draining of lakes that causes the ice shelf to flex, and if the stresses are large enough, fractures might also develop,” said Dr. Alison Banwell of the University of Chicago, lead author of the paper, in a University of Cambridge press release. 
The researchers used helicopters to install pressure sensors and GPS receivers near the surface lakes to monitor the rise and fall of water levels in the ice’s depressions.
Professor Doug MacAyeal of the University of Chicago said in a Cambridge press release, “It was a lot of work to obtain the data, but they reveal a fascinating story. Most of the GPS signal is due to the ocean tides, which move the floating ice shelf up and down by several meters twice a day. But when we removed this tidal signal, we found some GPS receivers moved down, then up by around one meter over a few weeks whereas others, just a few hundred meters away, hardly moved at all. The ones that moved down then up the most were situated where lakes were filling and draining, and there was relatively little movement away from the lakes. It is this differential vertical motion that shows the ice shelf is flexing. We'd anticipated this result, but it was very nice when we found it.”
Due to this newfound link between surface melting and weakening of ice shelves, many believe that the recent ice break-up around the Antarctic Peninsula may have been triggered by surface meltwater lakes that created fractures in the ice, a process set into motion by atmospheric warming. Banwell and MacAyeal previously suggested that the disastrous breakup of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002, where 3,250 square kilometers of ice was lost, could have been caused by this very phenomenon.
The team hopes that their report will inspire studies into flex and fracture in Antarctic ice shelves, as well as the development of ice sheet scale models that could predict the stability of the ice sheet in the future.

On Sept. 19, 1982, at Carnegie Mellon, the smiley was born after Professor Scott Fahlman suggested using ":-)" and ":-(" to denote emotions online.
What started as a simple icon on forums spread like wildfire, and before long the entire world had accepted emoticons into their lexicon. New variations emerged over the years, until emojis gradually began to replace the emoticon. Today, emoji use only grows by the day.
It’s easy to understand what makes emojis so appealing. They are cute and colorful, fun to play with, and also carry a depth of meaning — all while being relatively quick to type out. Likewise, an emoji is quick and easy to read: a smiley face means happiness, while a frowny face means sadness. 
But beyond those simple emotions, the interpretation of an emoji can be hugely subjective. In fact, Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, said “emojis usually have dialects” in an interview with The Verge. In other words, your personality, your culture, and even your age can determine how you interpret an emoji. And that’s only further complicated by how emojis can look different between platforms.
Since how an emoji is interpreted is so important to understanding the rest of the text, it’s easy to see how quickly misunderstandings can crop up. A winky face can mean that the line before it was either flirtatious or sarcastic, while a “:P” can change a cruel statement into a friendly jab. But people don’t always agree on what exactly an emoji means: in a workshop titled “Emoji Law 101” hosted by law firm Bryan Cave, LLP, the lawyers attending couldn’t even agree that the “unamused face” emoji looked unamused!
While misunderstandings are frequently expected in everyday conversation (texting is hard!), in a court of law that misunderstanding can cost thousands of dollars. As everyday emoji use increases, we are starting to see more references to emojis being brought up in court documents. The first instance of the word “emoticon” in a court case appeared in 2004; since then, over 171 court cases have at least referenced either the word “emoticon” or “emoji,” of which 53 were in 2018 alone! A few notable cases include:
In 2016, a 12-year-old girl in Virginia was charged for threatening her school after posting an Instagram message with a gun, bomb, and knife emoji in it.
In 2017, an Israeli couple was charged for misleading a landlord into believing that they would sign a lease for his apartment after sending emojis that the court felt “conveyed great optimism.” 
More recently, prosecutors in the Bay Area conducted a prostitution sting that included Instagram messages from the alleged pimp, containing emojis that the prosecution felt “implied a working relationship.”
Admittedly, most of those 171 court cases did not hinge on an emoji in making the final ruling. Many judges decided that the emojis were immaterial and omitted them. But, with how prevalent emojis have become, that might need to change. As Goldman said, “We need to make sure that the emoji gets proper credit.”
We can only speculate as to the future of the emoji, but who better to do so than the creator of the smiley himself, Fahlman. In his 2017 interview with Julian Routh of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Mr. Fahlman remarked that he hadn’t “seen [an emoticon] in an international treaty yet, but expect to within the next 3 ½ years :-).”

One of the sights to behold at the Pittsburgh International Airport is the collection of art on display for travelers as they land. The airport is, as Michael Neumann and Shohei Katayama put it, “a welcome mat for Pittsburgh.”
Neumann and Katayama are two Masters of Fine Arts candidates at Carnegie Mellon who have worked on a new art installation called “Flight" for the Pittsburgh International Airport. The colorful and delicate art piece is composed of 225 individual aluminum pieces, each in the shape of a paper airplane, and they all come together to take the shape of a large paper airplane. 
Both Neumann and Katayama cited multiple inspirations for their work of art, but their primary influence was Pittsburgh itself. 
“We see this work as encapsulating the creativity and craft of city. The people here and the people who come here to work and attend school weave a colorful fabric of innovation, creativity, care, and culture that is the fingerprint of Pittsburgh. This sculpture is aspirational, embodying the thoughts and dreams that inspire Pittsburgh," the artists said.
The installation is one of many art pieces commissioned by the airport, adding a lot of life and color to what would otherwise be a plain airport. The sight is inviting for travelers and really emphasizes the vibrancy of the Pittsburgh community. As Neumann and Katayama put it:
“We wanted the travelers arriving to the Pittsburgh International Airport both coming home and staying here for the first time to feel joyful, excited, welcomed and open to potentiality of our community.”
They had a challenge ahead of them to create this art piece, and keeping with the theme of honoring the community, Neumann and Katayama say they could not have made this project without the help of several locals.  “We worked with people here in Pittsburgh like Lawrence Hayhurst in Mechanical Engineering's TechSpark space here at CMU, received advice from CMU professors Bob Bingham and Carol Kumata, had metal fabrication done with Ray Appleby and Colin Butt at Technique Architectural Products, West Penn Laco mixed our Auto paint and the beautiful paint job was completed with Bruce Harvey at Pro Comp Custom.  We also had [9000] dollars of very special paints supplied to us through a generous sponsorship with Brian Fox, and Jill Brick at RM paints.” 
The two are proud of the work they’ve done. For them, it’s all about “the opportunity to give weary travelers a smile.”

Since her debut single “Issues” released two years ago, songwriter-turned-singer Julia Michaels has attracted listeners like myself with her unique voice and honest lyrics. Although I didn’t follow most of her early work, her name has stayed on my radar. After listening to some of her recent collaborations with some of my favorite artists, like Lauv’s “There’s No Way” and James Bay’s brand new “Peer Pressure,” I was particularly excited to hear that she recently released an EP, Inner Monologue Part 1. Based on the title of her EP, I was curious to see how Michaels would take her reputation for honest lyrics and continue that theme throughout.
“Anxiety” (feat. Selena Gomez)
Of all the songs on this EP, this is probably the most honest, with Michaels expressing how it feels when those around you don’t understand what you’re going through, particularly regarding her struggle with anxiety. I could really connect with and relate to Michaels on a personal level, particularly when she sings, “I got all these thoughts, running through my mind / All the damn time and I can’t seem to shut it off” and “Feel like I’m always apologizing for feeling / Like I’m out of my mind when I’m doing just fine.”
“Into You”
This is one of my least favorite songs on the EP. It was a strange mix of upbeat and slow, with clichéd, confusing lyrics. The lyrics were quite vague to the point where I came up with three different possible scenarios it could apply to, without ever figuring out which one it was. Maybe there’s a certain beauty to that, but I just found it to be an even more frustrating song because of it.
“Happy”
Once again, Michaels carries a raw, relatable message, but in a very repetitive and incomplete way. Something does not quite connect throughout the song, and the music once again weirdly tries to pick up and become more upbeat during the chorus. But the execution is off. It falls flat of an anthem, although it feels like it is trying to achieve that vibe.
“Deep”
This is a bit of a wishy-washy song. First, it starts off weak, since I literally couldn’t understand what she was saying in the beginning at all. Additionally, this one is also super repetitive, and the lyrics are once again unexciting. The only thing that this song has going for it is that, unlike the other songs, it is more interesting musically. The composition just flows much better, particularly since so many of the tempo changes in other songs seem excessively choppy.
“Apple”
Like “Deep,” this one offers a nice musicality to it. Although at first listen the lyrics were a bit weird, Michaels’ breathy singing and request for a genuinely happy relationship — and to not overthink things — provides the EP with a refreshing change of pace and theme.
“What a Time” (feat. Niall Horan)
So it seems that both my favorites on this EP are the ones that feature another artist. “What a Time” is probably my top pick though. Combining strong musicality and beautiful lyrics, Michaels and Horan’s work embodies nostalgia. It takes listeners on a journey through a relationship that may not have ended well, but brings back fond memories. Michaels sings, “I wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad parts / I know we didn’t make sense,” and yet she can’t help but reflect positively on it. However, as the song progresses, it transitions from the repetition of the sentimental  refrain: “what a time, what a time, what a time,” to a more melancholy “what a lie, what a lie, what a lie.”
There were a few good songs on here — like “Anxiety” and “What a Time” — but overall the EP was pretty unremarkable and unmemorable. Although it delivered what the title promised, there was almost too much inner monologue to the point that it’s kind of messy and seemingly unfinished. I can understand how inner thoughts can sometimes be circular and spiraling, and if done well, the repetition could have been a powerful tool. But most of these songs did not capture that type of urgency, and the lyrics were not strong enough to hold my attention. It will be interesting to see if Michaels continues her train of thought nicely in any future EPs or albums, as many of the messages found in Inner Monologue Part 1 were good but not fleshed out as much as they could have been. However, despite the lack of diversity in musical composition and the repetitive nature of most of the songs, Michaels’ refreshing honesty was appreciated, as it is fairly uncommon in popular music.

There tends to be three broad categories of films in terms of the audience who watches them. The first category is the crowd-pleasing kind of film. The second category is where films are made as art. The third category blends the two previous categories. Woman at War is a film that belongs in the third category. 
The film follows an environmental activist named Halla as she declares war on the aluminum industry in Iceland. Her life becomes more complicated when she learns that her request to adopt a child has come through and she has to balance the obligation she faces as an environmental activist with her new duty to become an adoptive mother.
The film is a strange marriage of tones and genres that shouldn’t work on paper, but is executed pretty brilliantly. It’s simultaneously an offbeat comedy, an intense thriller, a statement on climate change and sustainability, and a character drama all at the same time.
What keeps the film together is the main character, Halla. This character is so interesting to watch. When you first see her on screen, she’s knocking out the power lines that lead to an aluminum smelter and hugging the Earth as she runs through the Icelandic terrain. It’s excellent visual storytelling that reveals so much about the character, and is such a great way to introduce her. As the film progresses, this character drives so much of the story and changes quite a bit. She feels the pressure of her actions weighing on her throughout the film, and it leads her down a more extreme path to get what she wants. She is always on the edge of being caught, and that conflicts with her desire to adopt a child. This dynamic gives the film personal stakes, and it grounds the overarching conflict concerning environmental collapse and sustainability. 
The film’s offbeat comedy is another great aspect that keeps it grounded. While it’s possible the film could have decided to go for a darker route and keep the tone serious the whole time, it helps that the film doesn’t take itself overly seriously. The offbeat tone makes the serious nature of the topics it discusses more easily digestible and it also makes the film much less dreary and more watchable. The comedy itself is also very unique, with multiple recurring motifs such as musicians playing the film’s score on screen or a Hispanic tourist getting accidentally arrested by the Icelandic police multiple times. It’s very entertaining and it adds an extra layer to the film’s style.
The film also does a great job of addressing the issue of climate change and environmental collapse. Despite the film being small-scale in nature, it makes the conflict feel larger than the way it’s presented through small tricks. Whenever characters have conversations, they keep their phones in the freezer to prevent the government from overhearing their conversations. They have news broadcasts and radio commentators talking about Halla’s actions. There is a great sequence where Halla is releasing her manifesto, and the way the social media firestorm is depicted is incredibly effective and well done. 
Perhaps the most unique aspect to the film is that it’s not just a blanket statement that ends the discussion at “climate change is bad.” It actually explores the ramifications of Halla’s actions and whether or not she is a hero for taking such drastic actions against the industry. It’s an interesting discussion of whether extremism is a valid form of protest and a valid method to get an opinion heard by the government. Halla never hurts anyone with her actions, but should her actions still be considered terrorism? Personally, I would say no, but the film leaves enough up for interpretation that someone else can have a different opinion on Halla. The best way to discuss a heady topic in a film is to keep the discussion going long after the film ends, and Woman at War is successful at doing that. 
The film is also technically on point. It’s so smoothly edited, and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. It’s not a perfect film: the third act meanders a little too much. But Woman at War is a very ambitious and well executed film that explores a lot in a short span of time. Whenever the film is released in the US, I would highly recommend checking it out. I’m giving this film a solid 8/10.

Avocado toast gets a bad rap. Whenever it comes up in conversation, it always follows with “how millennial” or “so hipster” voiced with semi-disdain. Yes, avocado toast is popular among millennials and my generation, Gen-Z, but that doesn’t mean it deserves all the eye rolls. Avocado is one of the best foods in the world (in my humble opinion), and the more dishes we put it in, the better. I’ve had avocado toast in Greenwich Village, the most hipster place imaginable, and in Pittsburgh, at a small café. There are so many options when it comes to making your own too.
Much of what I cook depends on what I have in the fridge. For this avocado toast, I happened to have a couple slices of naan, so that’s what I went with, but bagels, waffles, or just plain old sliced bread works just the same. I’m also a huge fan of mustard, so I slather it in every sandwich I make, but if you like mayo, relish, or any other type of spread, go for it. The best thing about cooking for yourself is that you get to decide everything.
Ingredients
-   1 avocado (duh!)
-   1 tomato
-   2 eggs
-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   Salt and pepper
-   2 slices of bread, toasted
-   Mustard, to spread
Directions
1)  Peel and pit the avocado. Cut it into slices, or mash if you prefer. Cut the tomato into slices.
2)  On a skillet, heat the olive oil at medium-high. Crack the eggs into the pan and fry until they’re cooked to your preference (Tip: If you have egg rings to mold them into a nice circle, they're useful here). Season the egg with salt and pepper.
3)  Toast the bread and spread mustard on each one. Carefully place the avocado and tomato slices on the bread, topped with one egg on each slice.
Enjoy your avocado toast with a soy chai latte and some ambient indie-pop music in the background. Embrace the culture!

This week, If Beale Street Could Talk will be screening in McConomy. 
This is Barry Jenkin's second film, and it's proof that Moonlight was no fluke. This film is another absolutely beautiful work, and it's shocking that it's not nominated for Best Picture this year at the Academy Awards. The film follows a pregnant woman as she struggles to prove her fiancé is innocent of a crime. 
The film is incredibly well directed by Jenkins, and if he keeps this trajectory going, he will solidify himself as one of the best directors working today. It's very well shot and acted, and the cinematography and color palette are amongst the best from last year. The score is absolutely incredible too. The story itself is very powerful, with many great scenes between each of the well-written characters. I will say it again, but it really is a shame that this film is not nominated for more awards. This film deserves a lot more recognition than it got. Check this film out this weekend, and definitely be on the lookout for this director's films in the future.

Movies
Theremin - An Electronic Odyssey (Amazon Prime)
I recently rewatched this movie after acquiring a theremin of my own — and boy, did it make me feel guilty about the feeble squeals I made it produce. This documentary features the theremin in contexts that are in the popular imagination, namely, making goofy space sound effects in the back of sci-fi movies, but it centers the origins of the theremin, and the story of its creator, Léon Theremin. It features performances by theremin virtuoso and Theremin friend Clara Rockmore, and lengthy interviews with Robert Moog. Theremin was obsessed with the capacity to weave music, it seemed, out of thin air using subtle contortions of the human body that manipulated an electromagnetic field. He married one of the dancers who played his instruments by standing on it. The marriage came to an abrupt end when he was forcibly taken back to the USSR, and I won't spoil what happens because they build up a gorgeous suspense in the documentary, but I will say they have incredible contemporaneous footage of a certain someone who was still alive when the documentary was made in 1993.
Zodiac
This is one of David Fincher's most underrated films. If the title didn't already give it away, the film follows a journalist as he tries to piece together the identity of the Zodiac killer. It's an incredibly intense and fascinating film that follows each of these characters as they obsess over who the Zodiac killer is. This is probably the best film about a factual serial killer to be made. The 60s and 70s era of San Francisco is recreated beautifully and with an incredible attention to detail that is common for all Fincher films, right down to the detail of the clothing of the murder victims. The script is also incredibly tight, with the sequence of events being very cleanly followed and the passage of time being convincing and not forced. It's so tightly edited too, and never once do I feel the runtime of the film, and it is nearly three hours long. The film has a very great way of getting inside your head too. You follow these characters as they obsess over this case, and you yourself get wrapped up in the chaos of it all and start getting paranoid, trying to piece together what is happening. I highly recommend Zodiac to everyone. It's a very underrated and overlooked film, and it's a masterpiece. 
TV Shows
Daria (MTV's website and Hulu)
This show is, by no means, a new discovery. This late 90s classic emerged from MTV's iconic show Beavis and Butt-head, where Daria Morgendorffer was a featured character who moved away during her sophomore year of high school. Daria picks up where the title character's story left off, following her journey at her new high school, Lawndale High School. Despite having been out for over two decades, viewers can find the show's take on topics like race, gender, societal pressures, and — of course — millennial cynicism relatable. In addition to its excellent incorporation of dry humor approach with social commentary, the show demonstrates excellent character development. Watching Daria evolve from a disenchanted and misanthropic sophomore to a more understanding and matured high school graduate is rewarding, and never seems to lose its appeal regardless of how many times I re-watch the series. Even if life appears pessimistic at best, even the most gloomy "misery chick" can look back and say that "there is no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can't be improved with pizza."
The 100 (Netflix)
The 100 debuted on The CW in 2014, two years after The Hunger Games was released and made a lot of money and all the other young adult series with post-apocalyptic premises were snatched and turned into movies (Divergent) and TV shows. The 100 takes place 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse killed all life on Earth, and the last remaining survivors of the human race live in space on the Ark. A hundred detained delinquents, including Clarke (Eliza Taylor), are sent down to the Earth to see if it is survivable. Not only is there fresh air and green life and sparkling streams, the teenagers soon find out that they are not alone. The show has five seasons on Netflix, my favorite being the second one. It takes a couple episodes in the first season for the show to find its identity and move beyond being a typical CW show of teen angst and gorgeous people. Once it finds its footing, it’s a stellar series that burns through the plot and lets its characters drive the story. The 100 is great science fiction, and has production values and actions sequences nearly as good as Game of Thrones with a small fraction of the budget and prestige. If you like science fiction, horror, action, political drama, or even just great characters, I can’t recommend The 100 enough.

An agreement was reached on Feb. 13 between The Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ, (SIEU 32BJ) and Chartwells to bring back all five of the full-time food service positions that had been cut. The jobs were reposted, and the number of full-time union jobs offered by Chartwells is back up to the level of the fall semester, at 118 workers.
This past Tuesday, a delegation comprised of students visited the offices of Director of Dining Services Pascal Petter and Resident District Manager for Chartwells at Carnegie Mellon Jeff Sinciline to deliver a petition in support of keeping the jobs. A delegation of employees took a similar trek on Jan. 3.
Both delegations emphasized that they wanted Chartwells to continue to comply with Article 8 of the union contract, which states that full time workers must be given priority over part time workers if it ever comes time to make layoffs. As The Tartan reported two weeks ago, the five full time employees’ jobs came under threat at the same time that Chartwells was increasing part time hiring, allowing them to hire workers without the same benefits that a full time worker would be granted.
The Tartan spoke with Elizabeth Stanton, who has worked at Carnegie Mellon for over 14 years and currently works in the Heinz Cafe in Hamburg Hall, about why she chose to participate in the employee’s delegation.
Stanton told The Tartan that it was important to deliver the message in person because it would allow people to see the different situations of Chartwells workers. Stanton has a lung disease that requires her to use tanks of oxygen, whose costs would be prohibitive should they have to be paid out of pocket if she lost benefits upon a loss of full-time employment.
Traci Benjamin, a Communications Specialist for the SIEU 32BJ, told The Tartan, that “not every service worker is represented” and that the delegation was also meant to encourage elevating the conditions of part time workers who are not represented by the union.
“What worked was that we all came together as a unit,” said Stanton, citing a petition that students circulated. Though she is glad that “everything is resolved” she noted that in the 32 years her mother has worked as a food service worker at Carnegie Mellon, she could not remember a similar round of layoffs in breach of union contract, which she noted happened in the first year of the new contract with Chartwells.
The petition, created by junior chemical engineering major Lavonca Davis, received 315 signatures online from students, faculty and staff, and was delivered by the delegations to Petter and Sinciline. It cites Carnegie Mellon’s 2025 strategic plan, which asks community members to “continue to set a tone at all levels of leadership that stresses the critical importance of diversity, and hold university leaders and community members accountable for progress.”
Davis, who was also a lead organizer of the student delegation, stated that “The purpose of the delegations were to make Pascal Petter and Jeff [Sinciline] aware that we, the students, support the food service workers on campus. They all work very hard to feed us and keep us happy, and they deserve to be respected.” She said that the delegation was inspired by the worker’s delegation and drew on guidance from union organizers.
The student delegation, which happened after the jobs were restored, emphasized their continued commitment to ensuring that Chartwells continued to comply with union contracts, and asked the university to pressure Chartwells to do so.
As sophomore Artificial Intelligence and Hispanic Studies major Rebecca Rovins read from a prepared statement in Petter’s office, “We would like to acknowledge and thank the University for their help in encouraging Chartwell to restore the several employees that were illegally and unfairly laid off... it is, however, unfortunate it took almost two months to resolve this problem.”
The seven students in the delegation were a mix of graduate and undergraduate students who stressed their connection to a variety of student organizations across campus. 
Daniel Sun, a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering and Public Policy and a part of the committee to select Chartwells as the new vendor, told Petter in his office the committee had emphasized good labor practices from potential vendors and that he was “extremely disappointed as a member of that committee that this happened in the first place.”
Petter, Director of Dining Services, told The Tartan that Carnegie Mellon’s contract with Chartwells did not permit them to be involved in the negotiations, but the student delegation showed “Carnegie Mellon’s community thrives due to the passion and engagement of students on important societal concerns,” and said that the university would “continue to serve as an independent voice” in future labor disputes.
Sinciline gave a statement that Chartwells was “pleased” that the union and Chartwells came to an agreement and credited the capacity to maintain the level of full time employment to the new Tartan Express grilled cheese truck. Chartwells, he said, “believes in fostering a culture of open communication and values the feedback of our employees” and has agreed to continue to meet with the union to hear concerns.
Stanton said that the student she interacts with on the job are “like [her] family,” since they have come to know each other in their interactions every day, and she is grateful that the students “[came] behind us.” Davis cites the development of the relationship between workers and employees as a potential outcome of these delegations, but junior Jorge Alvarez, who was in the delegation, stated “I wish that more students at Carnegie Mellon would want to participate.”

Giving the campus and Pittsburgh community a taste of what is to come, the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival hosted a sneak preview event on Friday with a screening of Woman at War (Kona fer í stríð), directed by Benedikt Erlingsson.
One month before the festival is set to kick off, the event introduced the festival’s theme for 2019, “Faces of Wo/men.” Through this theme, the festival aims to start conversations about gender generally, and gender through stories about individuals’ relationship with society. The event was co-presented by Carnegie Mellon’s Sustainable Earth and the University of Pittsburgh Student Office of Sustainability.
An Icelandic, French, and Ukrainian co-production, Woman at War follows the story of Halla (Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir), a choir conductor in her forties who believes the foreign-sponsored aluminum smelting plants in the Icelandic highlands are ruining her country. She repeatedly disrupts their operations by cutting wires and shutting off the power. Her life is disrupted when her four-year-old request to adopt a child from Ukraine is suddenly accepted, and she must reconcile her duty to her heroic, but still criminal, crusade and her duty to become a mother to an orphaned child.
The post-screening panel discussed the relationship between Halla’s cause and today’s society, and began a conversation about conservation and sustainability. Moderated by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette film critic Barry Paris, the panel featured individuals from the Pittsburgh community devoted to environmental and sustainability causes. As the panel immediately followed the film, the first part of the discussion focused on Iceland and the country’s economic and environmental issues.
“The problem that’s happening in this film, the problem with the aluminum smelters is a prevalent problem in Iceland,” said panelist Young Sarah Grguras, president of the University of Pittburgh’s Student Office of Sustainability, who recently visited Iceland and some of the places featured in the film. “Something that we learned while we were there was that the reason that they continue making these aluminum smelters and the reason they have to make more is because Americans don’t know how to recycle.”
Maren Cooke, founder of the Pittsburgh Sustainability Salon compared to the conflict with the aluminum smelting plants in the film with Pittsburgh’s long history of industry. While many immediately think of the city’s original steel and coke plants, Cooke drew parallels to the newly-built Shell Ethane Cracker plant in Beaver County, and the Falcon Ethan Pipeline System, a planned 97-mile network running through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio to feed Shell’s plant.
“I thought, [the film] is a true story, but it isn’t...and you kind of wish it were,” Cooke said. “Cause there’s stories where there’s an antihero, and she wasn’t an antihero really unless you were one of those government ministers. She was really a ‘hero hero,’ standing up for everybody.”
In response to an audience question about the panelists’ roles and experiences as environmental activists, the conversation shifted to how they each worked to spread their message and promote sustainability.
Abbey Mui of Carnegie Mellon’s Sustainable Earth explained how this year, Sustainable Earth pushed for an environmental element of booth, and the reactions from organizations were mixed. Some of the organizations who participate in booth have the resources to buy wood, paint, and other materials every year, throwing away the previous year’s materials that are perfect candidates for reuse.
“By changing these rules, we disrupt what the norm is, and we really make them think ‘Why are we doing this, why is this okay? Why can we just continue to throw things out when we can always reuse?’” Mui said. I think when you disrupt, it gets a lot of people to think about what they’re doing.”
All three panelists discussed different avenues of action individuals can take that are not as extreme or dangerous as Halla’s actions in Woman at War. Mui reiterated the importance of changing individual behaviors, and that the first option is to refuse, refusing to buy something unnecessary, followed by reusing, and then finally, recycling.
For Cooke, changing personal actions is an important step, from taking public transportation to riding a bike, but to truly combat climate change, the government needs to take action.
“A lot of this is systemic. We have to change policy,” she said. “We have to get market forces on the right side instead of on the wrong side…and these are all big issues that have to be attacked through government.”
Grguras added that while recycling and composting are important things that she emphasizes every day, individuals themselves need to come together to find solutions to these large, world-spanning issues.
“Join a movement, support people in a marginalized group that are most affected by these things, and don’t give up,” Grguras said.

On Feb. 11, President Trump signed an order titled “Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” one of the first major bureaucratic steps in managing and overseeing continued advances in artificial intelligence research and development. The order aims to further prioritize research, development, and integration of artificial intelligence.
As Carnegie Mellon has established itself as a world center of AI research, now even offering a dedicated undergraduate major in the field, the order will undoubtedly have an impact on the future of university research.
The executive order notes the creation of new educational grants, with eligibility from high school up to early career researchers, as well as grants to “encourage the integration of AI technologies into courses in order to facilitate personalized and adaptive learning experiences for formal and informal education and training.”
Further, it maintains that certain guidelines are to be established to ensure the safety of developed technology, and directs federal agencies to make more of their currently private data and models open to researchers.
In a university statement responding to the initiative, Carnegie Mellon announced that it “enthusiastically supports” the efforts of the executive action, saying that “responsibly leveraging data as a national resource and investing in an AI-ready workforce will bring new energy to our national innovation ecosystem.”
The press release continued, “we look forward to continuing to work with public and private sector partners to drive innovation in the field, educate tomorrow’s AI talent, and promote public policies that will lead to broad societal benefit and economic opportunity,” thus implicitly placing the university at the center of the future of American AI research and development mentioned in the initiative.
Carnegie Mellon has maintained a research relationship with various federal entities for upwards of 70 years, most recently seen in the Army AI Task Force established at Carnegie Mellon’s National Robotics Engineering Center last month.
As Carnegie Mellon recently moved to “accelerate collaborations” with defense contractor Lockheed Martin this past week in a new research partnership, citing the company’s “significant investments in AI” as motivation, AI research at Carnegie Mellon continues to have broad federal importance. Due to this, it is possible that the university will be both the beneficiaries of an injection of research and development funding, and perhaps subject to the regulatory guidelines to be established by the National Science and Technology Council Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In terms of funding, David Danks, Philosophy Department Head & L.L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy and Psychology, told The Tartan that “the Executive Order is likely to be generally helpful in securing funding and data access for AI development in the US, [but] it is also very high-level, and so it is difficult to predict the exact impacts.”
He continued, “much will depend on the decisions of particular agency heads, as well as subsequent guidance and enforcement. The details will matter, and they are simply not spelled out in the Executive Order.”
Regarding the potential of job displacement, Tae Wan Kim, Carnegie Mellon professor of AI and business ethics told Fortune that “there’s not much information about how to address the trade-off between AI-powered [technology] and unemployment” in the executive order. The concerns of a lack of regulatory guidance don’t end as job loss, however.
In terms of the ethical considerations specified in the executive order, Danks stated that “the executive order does involve some attention to ethics, but almost never as an integral part of the research, design, development, and deployment processes.”
While the order does mention maintaining “safety, security, privacy, and confidentiality protections,” as well as “protecting American technology, economic and national security, civil liberties, privacy, and values,” ethical implications of AI advances are never specifically mentioned in the order, as Danks noted.
Danks, who earned an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship for his research “focused on the human impacts when autonomy is introduced into a technological system” told The Tartan that “the Executive Order should have emphasized the importance of integrating considerations of ethical and social impacts throughout all stages of AI creation.”
Danks argues that the above approach “would focus on understanding an AI’s potential to advance or harm people’s values and interests, rather than a purely legalistic approach that emphasizes prohibitions and checklists of requirements.”
Considering that none of the regulatory and oversight agencies have been established, and how funding is yet to be decided by Congress, the potential outcomes of the “Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” are vast. But as Carnegie Mellon continues to make significant strides in AI research, future federal research priorities and guidelines will only continue to have importance to the university.

It is estimated that almost 30 million people in the U.S. suffer from an eating disorder, and college students are some of the most susceptible to developing them. Sufferers of the illness may feel as though they are alone in their struggle, but in reality there is a significant chance that at least one of their classmates shares a similar situation.
Many students are not aware of resources both on-campus and off-campus that are available to help them. Even then, Carnegie Mellon does not offer many specialized services for eating disorders on campus. When thinking about what Carnegie Mellon has to offer, the response I received was mostly limited to the Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) offered free-of-charge for students. However, the accessibility of the services remains a concern to some.
Some have found that it is difficult to schedule an appointment, taking up to weeks. The cost of off-campus services such as therapists, intensive outpatient (IOP), and hospitalization can be out of students’ budget or can be a daunting time commitment. Further, the stigma surrounding mental health and seeking help may further steer students away. However, when I reached out to people on campus, there were a handful of students who wanted to break the silence by opening up about how eating disorders impacted their lives.
Dietrich sophomore Sarah Shaheen is nearly the ideal college student. She seems to strike a balance between a strong academic performance and an active social life. To others, she is perceived as happy and confident. However, she also happens to struggle with anorexia. Already existing struggles with anxiety, combined with issues with body image, pushed her into a vicious relationship of restricting food and exercising. It didn’t take long before she realized she had to “choose between [her] eating disorder and a life in college.”
Freshman orientation week required stamina that an eating disorder couldn’t sustain. Classes became more demanding. Many social events, from get-togethers to on-campus organizations, included food somewhere. Some people close to her started picking up clues to her illness. Although she thought she was recovering, she found out right before spring break that she had hit her lowest weight. As a result, she spent her first spring break at college at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). After inpatient treatment, she was recommended to follow through with IOP, but the demanding time constraint seemed to be too much to balance with school. Ultimately, she decided not to. She was not aware that a significant number of Carnegie Mellon students have gone through IOP care through UPMC during their time in college, and accommodations to help students receive treatment while pursuing their education are available. When hearing this, she reflected and said that knowing this may have impacted how she evaluated her pros and cons and perhaps even her final decision.
Like Shaheen, CIT freshman Kaylee Liang’s struggles with eating disorders began before she came to college. She, as well as some others, found that the rigors of university helped her keep her mind off her disorder and thus aided with her recovery. However, she cites stress as one of her main triggers of urges to relapse, which is a common trigger for many other college students who suffer from the illness. New pressures, such as moving away from home for the first time and academic stress, can often push students towards a desire for control or perfection, especially at such a competitive school as Carnegie Mellon.
Liang also brings up an important aspect of the discussion of eating disorders: cultural pressure. Eating disorder rates are climbing in East Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Korea. The booming plastic surgery industry in Korea, for example, may drive people towards unrealistic body images. It doesn’t help that with the relatively collectivist nature of the cultures in these countries, this pressure can further reinforce the stigma around mental health and impose a desire for conformity, potentially discouraging individuals from talking about their struggles or seeking the help that they need.
Racial minorities, in general, tend to have higher rates of undiagnosed eating disorders, an aspect of eating disorders that commonly gets overlooked.
Other sides of the issue on campus are block sizes and dining options. Some students have encouraged the university to make changes to meal plans. Shaheen suggested a sample guideline to show what healthy portions look like for different types of people. Eating disorders can be sneaky and can be “hard to tell when you’re slipping up.” What can make recovering from an eating disorder so difficult lies in trying to bounce back to “normalcy.” It can be hard to recall what normalcy was or even define what a healthy diet even consists of.
A sample guideline, Shaheen argues, could give students at least a loose benchmark as to what “normalcy” might look like given their activities and their basic needs. University Health Services (UHS) does have a nutritionist on staff, but only for two days a week, making it potentially incompatible with the schedules of students who may need help.
Food insecurity has also been cited as a problem. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, had struggled with anorexia in the past. Today, she is still struggling with the illness and the physical consequences she has been battling for years. The burden of food insecurity places additional pressure on her, often leaving her no choice but to restrict her diet, further exacerbating her condition.
Those in her situation may also find that having an excuse to continue previous behaviors may hamper efforts to recover. To help with the broader problem of food insecurity, Carnegie Mellon recently established a food pantry.
The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) announced that this week is National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. The theme for 2019, “Come as You Are,” aims to broaden the conversation of eating disorders and promote more unifying conversations on the topic.
Although topics like healthy eating habits and positive body image pop up in events like our annual Fresh Check Day, it is imperative that students know that there is help available, and that there is no shame in seeking it. “You don’t have to hit rock bottom before you get help,” Shaheen says. Prevention and early detection are some of the most effective ways of treating eating disorders. If you or someone you know may be struggling, The Tartan encourages you to reach out.

Amazon’s recent decision not to establish part of their new headquarters in New York following local outrage and municipal politicians unwillingness to agree to the $3 billion dollar subsidy deal. This decision has highlighted the characteristics of tech giants' relationships with the cities they are headquartered in. First, they’re smart to not pay money when they don’t have to. Second, they’re just like all the other companies you love to hate.
Amazon's decision to withdraw from New York came as a surprise after New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Governor Andrew M. Cuomo declared a $3 billion dollar tax break in return for the promise of 25,000 jobs in the headquarters and at least $27 billion dollars in revenue generated by the company. 
After protests against Amazon in Queens, New York, where the headquarters was to be built, and local lawmakers' unwillingness to engage in the subsidy deal, Amazon pulled out with no space for renegotiation. This abrupt shift brings to light the economic incentives driving the company. Though they might be everyone’s favorite delivery service and hip tech company, the forces that drive them are the same as most other corporations: pursuance of capital, and that alone.
The secrecy involved in the new headquarters search process was in service of one thing: what city or area would offer Amazon the most lucrative real estate and tax breaks. In response to Amazon’s cheerfully competitive videos that teased different possible headquarters locations, few were quick to criticize the search process. But what was going on behind the scenes was less a rational search process and more a means of pitting cities against one another and attempting to milk small municipalities for as much as they could offer.
The negotiation process was so secretive that lawmakers in the considered cities were forced to sign confidentiality agreements that barred them from even commenting on their existence, keeping cities from negotiating with knowledge of other cities' offers. This pitted them against one another in a disgraceful, exploitative silent auction, one that was ultimately decided by who could offer the most for the least. 
In business terms, it's brilliant. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos probably knew the most attractive places to create a new headquarters were those with unforgiving real estate market and high corporate taxes, like New York City, Northern Virginia, or California. That was the cleverness of the very publicized, yet extremely private search process: get places with high taxes to think they have to compete with low tax-low infrastructure municipalities. The plan clearly worked, at least partially, to attract lawmakers in Northern Virginia and New York City.
However, when the deal was publicized in New York, local lawmakers and residents alike were not thrilled with the deal that Amazon had negotiated with Mayor De Blasio and Governor Cuomo. After state lawmakers had negotiated that $3 billion in tax breaks were not in best interests of the area, Amazon made headlines for simply walking away from the deal.
There really could be no better example of a company’s true motivation than that. Amazon, with their lofty claims of job creation and investment, had valued their existence in the area at $3 billion, essentially to be footed by the local government. When this valuation of their presence in the area was challenged by the representatives of Queens, rather than renegotiate or budge, Amazon simply walked away.
The fact that they could just walk out on the deal with no renegotiation highlights both the immense power of Amazon and the gullibility of lawmakers and cities across the nation. Everyone had played Amazon’s competitive cities game, and the first time it faced an adversary in New York, Amazon knew it could just pull out of the deal and commit to greater investments in Northern Virginia, where they had already been promised cash grants of $22,000 per job created in the Crystal City location.
Amazon's entire search process was a successful ploy to seek out lower municipal taxes.
Amazon, as a corporate entity, already pays very little in federal taxes. This tax season, they’ll pay no federal corporate taxes. The only federal taxes the company pays are those coming from the pockets of employees in federal income tax, the rest of the corporate taxes are written off in deductions due to of Amazon's strategic payment of employees in stock, investments in research and development, and investments in properties and equipment. 
Every dollar that Amazon saves in municipal taxes is a direct increase in revenue for the company, considering that their federal tax rate is already so low. So following a campaign that encouraged cities across the nation to engage in a silent tax break auction, Amazon should not be surprised that people were upset when the details were publicized.
The self-interested nature of huge corporations like Amazon cannot be forgiven by the potential benefits an area can receive when they arrive. It is true that Amazon can create many jobs, create real estate investment in the areas they settle, and have some positive benefits in general, but that doesn’t mean that municipalities should feel pressured to offer huge tax breaks as an incentive when Amazon clearly doesn’t need them. 
Companies and their shareholders are driven entirely by the potential to earn a profit, and that alone. Though the campus community remains captivated by the allure of tech giants, seen in countless laptop stickers and the desire to earn prestigious internships and jobs, it is important to remember that large corporations like Amazon aren’t the cool tech utopias you might think they are; they are massive corporations whose unequivocal powers allow them to mold municipalities, avoid massive amounts of taxes, and earn incredible amounts of money for their executives and shareholders. Perhaps take that into consideration before bringing the vast knowledge you learn at Carnegie Mellon into the workforce.

On Feb. 4, a sixth-grader at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland, Florida was arrested following a heated confrontation with a substitute teacher over the student’s refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. As of last Monday, the student is facing misdemeanor charges for disrupting a school facility and resisting an officer without violence, according to The Washington Post.
It’s not difficult to see why this arrest became so controversial: the 11-year-old African American student refused to stand for the pledge because he claimed the flag was racist against black people. When the substitute teacher pressed him to stand for the pledge — something that is not mandated by school policy — the student first lashed out against the teacher and continued to shout and make threats when the administrative dean and school resource officer arrived at the classroom, accusing them, as well as the school, of being racist.
Many see this as another prime example of racial discrimination, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida issuing a harsh rebuke against the school’s behavior and management of the situation, branding it as a denial of the right to free speech and an instance of the over-policing of black students. But this raises an important question: was this arrest racially motivated?
Unfortunately,  differing testimonies make it impossible to know for certain what happened that day. The student has one account, the school had another, and reconciling the two is what the court system is for. However, if we consider the facts as they are presented to be at least somewhat accurate, then this was not solely an act of discrimination against a black student, as the school does not require everyone to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, and the student was being disruptive and uncooperative with the administration.
When students enter a school, they do not lose their First Amendment right to free speech. In this specific situation, the student’s First Amendment Right was not denied to him, as the school does not have a policy that forces everyone to stand for the Pledge (unlike in states like Texas). Rather, the problem here was one of miscommunication, as the substitute teacher was not made aware of such a policy, an oversight that the school is responsible for. To equate that miscommunication with intentionally denying a student their right to free speech is an exaggeration.
In terms of the student’s behavior, it was clearly inappropriate for a school setting. While a student’s constitutional rights are protected when they enter a school, students do sacrifice some freedoms in exchange for an education. After all, it would be wrong to say that students should be allowed to do and say whatever they wish within a classroom, as anarchy is not conducive to learning. For a school to function properly, there must be some sense of order, and it is expected that students will listen to faculty instructions and adhere to rules of conduct. If the student had responded calmly to the substitute and the school officials, then this whole fiasco might never have happened. Instead, the student chose to disrupt class and escalate the situation, which of course led to disciplinary action. Arresting the student and issuing formal charges may seem severe, but considering that there were threats leveled against both the dean and a resource officer associated with the local police, it is not unreasonable. All students, regardless of race, should be held to this same standard, and if a white student behaving the same way were treated more leniently, then that would be adequate proof of racism.
While neither party is blameless, the greater transgression is still on the part of the student, as his overreaction is what ultimately catalyzed this chain of events. Also notice that, in considering these two aspects of the situation, race did not come up. That’s not to say that race is irrelevant; it could still be possible that this was racially motivated and that school officials harbor an implicit bias towards black students. But flinging the accusation of racism is a stretch given that there were relevant, non-racial reasons for the disciplinary actions taken.
By no means am I belittling the problem of racism or racial discrimination. There should be no doubt that institutional racism continues to thrive in the U.S., spurred on by a blatantly racist administration and its policies. Instead, we should be more mindful about how and when we apply the term “racism” or “racist,” as these labels should not be taken lightly. Race is not always the motivating factor. Sometimes, people act inappropriately, and action needs to be taken. Removing a disruptive student from a classroom is not an act of racism or an attempt to silence minority voices: it is simply a school trying to maintain order and ensure that the primary goal of education can continue. To frame the incident entirely through the rhetoric of discrimination is to inflate the occurrence beyond reason.
When a race-related controversy arises, we should dissect the situation and critically evaluate each part rather than jumping straight to conclusions that do not necessarily align with facts. Designating an act as an example of racism or calling someone a racist should only come as a result of careful deliberation rather than gut instinct.

On Friday, Feb. 15, another mass shooting took place in Aurora, IL at the Henry Pratt Company. The shooting was out of the public dialogue within a week of it happening, but there was one aspect of the shooting revealed that should have garnered more attention. The shooter, whose name I will not mention, was not supposed to have a gun in the first place. He was convicted for aggravated assault in 1995 in Mississippi. He passed two background checks in his initial attempt to buy the gun, but then he failed a third one, which led to his Firearm Owner’s Identification (FOID) card being revoked. A letter was sent to him to relinquish the Smith and Wesson he bought, but, due to an oversight in the law, the police did not actually come to seize the weapon once his FOID had been revoked. 
This lack of action is just one of several cases that demonstrates how weak gun regulation is in the United States. What’s the point of having a background check if the police can’t even seize the weapon when a red flag is raised and after the owner’s FOID has been revoked? With instances like this, I would like to make the case that there is no good reason to be against stronger gun control laws.
The immediate arguments against gun control often point towards localized instances of gun control policy such as Chicago, and use those as an example of why gun control doesn’t work. If a shooting happens in a state or area with gun control, that equates to a failure of gun control. Locally, we see this argument pop up as Pittsburgh debates its own firearms ordinance in response to the Tree of Life terrorist attack last October. 
It is true that there is an inherent problem with localized gun control. It doesn’t stop those who want a gun from going to a different part of the state to get a gun. Even if the gun laws are passed through state legislature instead of local or city, someone can still go to another state to get a gun. Inconsistent gun control is ineffective gun control. If Pittsburgh passes the firearms ordinance bill currently being debated, that doesn’t stop anyone from other parts of Pennsylvania from coming into Pittsburgh with a gun, and it would be difficult to enforce too. This only strengthens the case to have more consistent gun control laws on a federal level. 
On the subject of enforcement, laws obviously only work when they are enforced. What’s being revealed with the Aurora shooting and other past shootings like the Marjory Stoneman-Douglas is that gun laws have not been sufficiently enforced. The police can already seize private property on the mere assumption that the property will be used for criminal activity, but, for some reason, they can’t seize a gun from someone who clearly shouldn’t have it. If a background check fails to catch an out-of-state felony conviction, then that should be a call for the system to be updated, not to abandon the system entirely. 
The last major argument against gun control is that criminals will have guns anyway if there is gun control legislation. In Australia, the poster child for strict gun laws, the price of a semi-automatic handgun on the black market as of a 2014 article is fifteen thousand dollars. It led to criminals loaning out weapons due to the sheer price of the weapons. Gun regulation can’t stop all gun trafficking, but it makes it significantly more difficult to even obtain one illegally. 
The reason for bringing up these talking points is to show how each point against gun control is actually another reason to strengthen gun control. It sounds contradictory, but it makes intuitive sense. If something is broken, it needs to be fixed. There needs to be stronger enforcement of background checks, and it needs to be on a federal level. There should also be a federal database for gun sales. These are two ideas that a majority of gun owners support, according to a Pew Research Poll. But their voices aren’t represented by the gun lobby. 
Ultimately, for those against gun control, it’s easy for them to defend their arguments. They don’t need to jump through loopholes to explain the lack of enforcement or the lack of consistent regulation. They can simply say “no” and hold a firm stance against gun control. It’s a shame because it completely ruins any meaningful conversation on the subject and destroys any chance of reform.

On Friday, news broke that Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution in Jupiter, Florida.
When I first saw the news, I was disturbed and upset, but I can’t say I was particularly surprised. A 77-year-old billionaire paying for sex? I sent a link of the news to friends, and the first responses ranged from “What the—?” to a laughing emoji. The whole case feels laughable, but it’s not. On the contrary — it’s the least laughable thing possible.
Kraft was charged as part of a wide-ranging investigation into prostitution and sex trafficking in South Florida. He was the biggest name among dozens of men charged. While there’s nothing positive in this whole situation, I think that having a well-known name like Kraft — who is coming off another Patriots Super Bowl — intertwined in this case is important. If he hadn’t been linked, this news would have been reported by local Florida and picked up by some national outlets, but Sports Illustrated and ESPN wouldn’t be talking about this. To be completely honest, I might not have heard about it, being confined to my college bubble. This news brings to light a huge problem that’s finally being talked about: human trafficking, and more specifically, sex trafficking.
Around the world, there are 40.3 million people enslaved in the human trafficking network, which is worth $150 billion and ranges from forced labor, to forced organ donation, to forced sex. In the United States, human trafficking seems like something that happens in a country thousands of miles from here. It’s modern-day slavery that, of course, doesn’t exist in our country. That’s the furthest from the truth. Human trafficking is rampant in the United States, and our complacency is making it worse.
According to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, there were 5,147 reported cases of human trafficking in 2018, 3,718, or 72.2 percent of them being sex trafficking. Out of the cases, 4,233 were female, or 82.2 percent. All cases are different. Some young women are contacted online for modeling opportunities. Or they’re young girls sold for sex by their fathers, ranging from the ages of 4 to 18. They are all victims. Some may escape but never fully recover, and others are never found.
In Florida, police found a video of Kraft paying for sexual acts in a spa and massage parlor. In 2018, the most common venues for sex trafficking took place in illicit spa and massage businesses. But this isn’t just a problem in Florida, the state with the third most cases, or California, which had 760 cases, by far the most last year. This is happening everywhere. Last August, the Pittsburgh police arrested 40 people involved with prostitution in a sex trafficking crackdown. In the area, sex trafficking has been increasing, partly attributed to the opioid crisis. Addiction has driven people to turn to prostitution or pimping, while Pittsburgh’s location between the East Coast and the Midwest markets makes it an ideal location. 
Both the Pittsburgh and Florida investigations took weeks, careful planning, and many resources. For now, Kraft is the biggest name in the current case, and we will have more important information in the coming days and weeks. He is facing two misdemeanors, and if found guilty, may not face jail time. If guilty, he will face the consequences in one way or another, from the law, the NFL, and the public.
But I don’t want this to be the “Robert Kraft scandal,” though I wouldn’t be surprised if it got its own Wikipedia page someday. This story shouldn’t be about him; it isn’t about him. It's about the victims who are ripped from their lives and turned into slaves. It’s about a seedy underbelly in our country that we need to talk about. We hear about drugs and opioids and violence. And yes, those are all criminal activities that deserve our attention, but so is human trafficking. We need to talk about it more, but why aren’t we?

How do social and political movements employ memories of the past?
On Thursday, Kirsten Weld, an associate professor at Harvard University, gave a talk with the intent of answering this question through the lens of the Spanish Civil War. Her new book, The Spanish Civil War’s Impact and Legacies in Latin America, analyzes the effects of this grand event on the world, but more specifically, on Guatemala and Chile. 
A quick recap of the war goes something like this: First, in 1936, leftists and reformists staged a bloodless removal of the Spanish monarchy and created a new democracy. They instituted land reforms and other radical leftist measures seen as communist in the context of the recent Russian revolution. Second, the right-wing of Spanish politics — fascist, monarchists, and clergymen — joined together to form the Nationalists, led by Francisco Franco, to launch a coup in the Spring of 1937.
This led to two years of an ideological civil war. Communists, Republicans, and anarchists fought against fascists, monarchists, and radical Catholics. During this period, the new fascist governments of Germany and Italy sent extensive military aid to Franco. The Republicans were aided by the new Soviet Union, but isolated by the United States, Britain, and France. Finally, in 1939, the Nationalists were victorious over the Republicans and Franco ruled over fascist Catholic Spain for over 40 years.
The heroic and ideological narrative of the war has been evoked again and again as symbols on the side of both anti-fascist and religious anti-communist struggle. Many famous writers have also used the Spanish Civil War as a setting for grand ideological conflict. During the war, Ernest Hemingway wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls, a fictionalized account of the grand battle for freedom. Later, George Orwell would write Homage to Catalonia as his personal account of fighting for the Republicans. 
The late Senator John McCain would go on to give homage to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, a volunteer military unit of Americans who fought for the Republicans, in an article titled “Salute to a Communist.” In it he wrote, “And even though men like Mr. Berg [a recently deceased member of the Abraham Lincoln brigade] would identify with a cause, Communism, that inflicted far more misery than it ever alleviated — and rendered human dignity subservient to the state — I have always harbored admiration for their courage and sacrifice in Spain.”
This heroic narrative of the Spanish Civil War has an immense power to evoke ideological fervor, which is why it has been repeatedly called upon in literature and political discourse. Among former colonies of the Spanish empire, this power is even stronger. Social and political movements, particularly in Chile, Guatemala, and Mexico, continue to evoke narratives of struggle from the 1930s. It is interesting that the right and left seem to hold two counterposed histories of the conflict. The left sees it as heroic, doomed to fail, and the last stand against fascism; the right sees it as a successful reassertion of traditional values of family and church over the godless communists who threatened every aspect of life. Both leave out details that they find difficult to fit into their constructed narratives.
But how does this historical conflict continue to impact the political environment in the United States? Since the election of President Trump, the United States has grown increasingly divided over ideology. Many pundits have harkened the new era back to the interwar period, the setting of the Spanish Civil War. Recently some have gone even further. 
In particular, Rod Dreher, a senior editor at The American Conservative, wrote an article entitled “The Tragedy of Franco’s Spain.” In it, he asserts that despite the moral righteousness of the Nationalists, Franco’s rule was a tragedy because he “was not a good man.” Dreher is “glad that Franco won the war” because a Republican victory “might easily have meant the Church’s annihilation, as well as the annihilation of much of Spain’s cultural patrimony.” Dreher is a kind of “family values” fundamentalist Catholic who laments the growing tide of secularism that has engulfed the western world. This is clear when Dreher writes, “There is simply no way for Christians to read about what the Left was doing to Spanish Catholics before the civil war, and to believe that the wrong side won that conflict.” 
His view is that the Nationalists, who held fascist beliefs, were on the right side of the war because they protected traditional Catholic values. This narrative is growing within the environment of the alt-right which has for a long time used “family values” as a thinly veiled cover to oppose LGBTQ rights. 
Religious politics is not new in America, but what we see now is the resurgence of the narrative of authoritarianism linked with traditionalism, spearheaded by fundamentalist religious groups, in opposition to growing leftist, socialist thinking among young Americans. It may not be communists, Republicans, and anarchists against fascists, monarchists, and radical Catholics again, but it seems that the old allegiances didn't die: they merely evolved.

As someone who has spent 10 years growing up in Sweet Home Alabama, many thoughts crossed my mind when I saw a tweet from The Democrat-Reporter, a local paper in Linden, Alabama, showing a shocking editorial piece titled "Klan needs to ride again." In it, the editor, Goodloe Sutton, called for the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) to clean out Washington and lynch Democrats. Was I surprised that such a strong call for violence was made from a local paper in my home state? Unfortunately, no.
Our history, from our involvement in the Confederacy to our latest Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and alleged sex offender Roy Moore, has not been something to be too proud of. Despite that, was I still disappointed? Of course. Understating the impact of a domestic terrorist group by saying that it "didn't kill but a few people" and inciting violence can be interpreted as a call to action. This is not a matter of free speech; this is a matter of enabling and empowering violence. Regardless of race, religion, or political ideology, such messages should not be tolerated, even under the name of "free speech."
Also, as the editor of an opinion section in a university paper and a strong believer in the freedom of speech, I find it my responsibility to grant my writers as much agency over their own beliefs. The point of an op-ed is to allow people to express their own voices. I strongly believe that part of my duty is to help our university community feel welcome to speak out about topics they believe in, regardless of their stances. I don't care about the letter on my writers' voter registrations indicating their respective party, or which candidates they would support if given the opportunity; in fact, I even encourage controversial or unpopular voices to be shared to spark dialogue. When it comes to editorials submitted to me for editing, all I care about is that they can effectively communicate their message in a respectful way, that allows room for dialogue. The First Amendment protects people from government persecution so that we can have dialogue that can affect policy and change. Advocating lynching and encouraging a domestic terrorist group are none of those things.
This was not the first time Sutton published something so insensitive and provocative. Chip Brownlee, the Editor-in-Chief of Auburn University's The Plainsman, recalled receiving copies of The Democrat-Reporter and being aghast at Sutton's content. Various opinion pieces have targeted immigrants, Jews, women, racial minorities, and the LGBTQ community. Although The Democrat-Reporter is a small publication, Brownlee felt it was important for the general public to be aware of the kinds of media some people are still consuming today. To do so, he has tweeted photos of Sutton's pieces. When posting Sutton's most recent one, Brownlee “didn’t really expect it to become this big of a thing.” However, his tweet caught fire, racking up over a thousand retweets, catching the attention of multiple renowned publications like the BBC and NBC, and resulted in Sutton resigning from the paper.
Public calls for Sutton to step down, coupled with the paper's poor performance, may have had an impact in Sutton leaving the paper. Senator Doug Jones, known for having prosecuted members of the KKK involved in the Birmingham church bombing that killed four young girls in 1963, tweeted "Good riddance Goodloe. His dangerous views do not represent Alabama or the small-town papers in Alabama that do great work every day. The good people of Linden deserve so much better than these racist rants and I am confident they will get it with new editor, [African-American] Elecia Dexter," indicating a potential new shift for The Democrat-Reporter. Additionally, Sutton had some of his accolades stripped following the editorial, including being removed from his alma mater's — University of Southern Mississippi’s — School of Mass Communication and Journalism’s Hall of Fame. Auburn University also voted to revoke Sutton’s community journalism award on Feb. 19.
Where does Sutton go from here? Even before he stepped down, it was apparent that he wouldn't have a change of heart. It was even more disappointing to hear that he had no regrets, claiming “it got me about $10 million in free publicity. I know I would do it all over again.” He obviously has retained his extreme and racist beliefs and admiration for domestic terrorists and had no shame in vocalizing them by saying that “the Democrats have been terrible... the KKK are the nicest." Currently, he claims he is in the process of writing several books and plans to "drink beer and sex young women. I am not going to do anything with [the paper]. I’m going to be a deadbeat — an out-of-work deadbeat." 
Even with this personal destiny, Sutton seems to be content enough with his actions. He viewed being offensive as part of the job description for being a journalist, which he claimed is "what we're supposed to do." He wanted those who did find offense in his editorial to know that “it’s not their country. It’s our country and if they don’t like it, they can go to hell.” If condemning intolerance and believing everyone in this country deserves the inalienable rights explicitly stated in our Constitution warrants such a sentence, I'll happily throw myself into the eternal flames.
Editor's note: I met Chip Brownlee through Associated Collegiate Press (ACP) in Oct. 2018 and discovered that he is currently attending Auburn University, the university in my hometown (Auburn, AL), where he is double-majoring in political science and journalism.
