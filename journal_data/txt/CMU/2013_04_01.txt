The men’s track and field team seized victory in its home mini-invitational on March 30, besting squads from Denison University, Allegheny College, SUNY Fredonia, and Waynesburg University. The men’s squad succeeded in both the running and field components of the competition, winning six field events and three track events.
The women’s team placed second behind Waynesburg University, winning four of the five events and scoring 129 points. First-year distance standout Rekha Schnepf said, “I think that for our second outdoor meet, both teams are looking pretty strong.... People are just improving a lot, because after going through indoor, everyone’s had at least a few experiences running in track events.”
The distance teams for both squads are performing at high levels. Sophomore Erin Kiekhaefer, senior Emily Wobb, and sophomore Halley Bayer placed second, third, and fourth respectively in the 1500-meter run. Bayer also won third in the 800-meter run, with a time of 2:25.44. Senior Leila Bouabdellaoui won second place in the 3000-meter steeplechase, with a time of 12:25.01.
Sophomore Sara Kelly said, “This was a good starting point; hopefully we can get a little bit of momentum going to the upcoming meets, which are going to be bigger.”
The women’s sprint team also did well. First-year Jenna Asperslag finished second in the 100-meter dash and third in the 200-meter, and fellow first-year Alexandra Lewis received second in the 200.
Junior Jacqueline Guevel took first in both the 100-meter and 400-meter hurdles, and junior Carineh Ghafafian finished third in the 400-meter run. “We have a lot of new girls this year and it’s nice to have some new faces.... We have a couple girls who are just powerhouses,” Bayer said.
Bayer praised the 4 x 400  relay team of Kiekhaefer, sophomore Sasha Spalding, Ghafafian, and Guevel, giving particular credit to Spalding. “[Spalding has] really been a key player,” Bayer said. “She even started throwing and jumping.” Spalding also competes in the heptathlon for the track and field team.
The men’s side of the team captured the first-place prize with 234 points. First-year javelin thrower Paul Hamerski placed third in the javelin, trailing less than three feet behind the javelin winner, junior David Markowitz.
Speaking of the throwers, Hamerski said, “everyone just did their best ... we’re all just trying to improve.” He went on to commend senior thrower Pat Robinson and Markowitz particularly for their personal records at the mini-invite, saying, “it’s all pretty much a constant attitude of getting better.”
Young players were pivotal to the men’s team, with sophomores Thomas Vandenberg and Douglas O’Connell finishing in the top two of the 800-meter running event, followed by first-year Marc-Daniel Julien in third. The men’s team captured the 4 x 400 relay, as well as the second-place prize in the pole vault due to a strong showing by sophomore Mike McDermott.
Richard Max Reinertsen, a first-year jumper, won the triple jump and placed fourth in the long jump behind fellow first-year Patrick Chang, who claimed third. “This year’s team is really, really large, with a large freshman class who’s contributing a lot,” Reinertsen said.
The track and field team improved its overall unity at the tournament as well, with competitors making a conscious effort to observe and cheer on their teammates in other events. “We’re trying to, at meets, watch the other events and be supportive as a team,” Kelly said.
And, at the end of the day, the team enjoyed the meet. Reinertsen said, “I think it was nice to be at a home meet, and to be able to relax and have fun on a beautiful day.”

The Carnegie Mellon men's tennis team traveled south this past weekend to compete against two top ranked teams, Washington and Lee University and Johns Hopkins University. The Tartans defeated the Washington and Lee Generals 5–4 and lost to the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays 2–7.
In Lexington, Va., the Tartans opened with doubles. Sophomore Thomas Cooper and senior Jooho Yu led the team with a win at No. 3 doubles. In singles, the Tartans won four matches to take the match. First-year Abhishek Alla's win at No. 2 singles, first-year Yuvraj Kumar's win at No. 4 singles, and senior Harsha Rao's win at No. 6 singles tied the match at 4-all. Senior Duke Miller won at No. 3 singles in a second set tiebreaker to clinch the match for the Tartans. 
Kumar said, "It was great to bounce back from a disappointing loss in doubles and win a quick victory in singles."
On Sunday, the Tartans battled the Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays and lost 2–7. Cooper and Yu won again in doubles, while the other two Carnegie Mellon doubles teams lost to be down 1–2 before singles. When asked about his teammates' performance, first-year Kosuke Hasegawa said, "I want to give a special shout-out to Thomas and Joohu for doing an exceptional job at getting things done both days."
Sophomore Christian Heaney-Secord was the only player to win in singles. He fought and won the match in three sets, calling it a "huge" win.
The team will compete against Duquesne University at home this Friday.

In a rematch of last month’s Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championship, the outcome remained the same as Johns Hopkins University nipped the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team 5–4 Sunday afternoon. The fourth-ranked Blue Jays improved to 7–2 on the season, while the seventh-ranked Tartans slipped to 8–4.
The Tartans faced setbacks going into the match, with junior Katie Cecil out with an injury. “It was difficult for everyone to have to move up a position. We hope Katie has a quick recovery,” said sophomore Angela Pratt.
The Tartans were originally up 2–1 after doubles and gained more momentum when sophomore Chelsea Motie won at No. 1 singles. The pressure was on the No. 6 singles match, but Johns Hopkins junior Abby Clark sealed the win with a 6–3 victory over Carnegie Mellon sophomore Bryn Raschke. Pratt gave the team its final victory of the day in the No. 3 singles.
The Saturday before, the Tartans took on Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., falling 2–7 to the 18th-ranked Generals. Carnegie Mellon picked up its first point with a 8–1 victory from the doubles duo of first-year Brooke Tsu and sophomore Lydia Utkin in No. 3 doubles. First-year Abbey Hamstra won her 11th match of the season when she defeated Claire Cahill from Washington and Lee at No. 5 singles.
The team remains positive about the outcome of the weekend. “We were really close in all of our matches,” Tsu said.
“The team showed a lot of passion, but we couldn’t get it done,” Cecil said. “We will bounce back.”
The Tartans put the losses behind them as they look forward to host the University of Pittsburgh on April 10.

Baseball’s opening night game last Sunday between new American League (AL) West opponents, the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros, began a season that will introduce one of the most sweeping changes in Major League Baseball. The season will also hopefully see the Pittsburgh Pirates achieve their first winning season since 1992.
The most notable of these changes is the Astros’ move from the once-six-team National League (NL) Central to the previously four-team AL West in an effort to balance the divisions and to give teams a more even field in which to win their division and guarantee a playoff spot.
With this move, the AL and NL are now balanced at 15 teams apiece, forcing Interleague play to shift from a three- to four-week novelty during May and June to a year-round necessity. The Pirates and the rest of the NL Central should be relieved that their six-team divisional logjam is finally remedied, even if it means removing the pitiful Astros. Unfortunately for the Pirates, the division is still stacked, and they face an uphill battle to finally posting a winning season.
Let’s look at each team in the NL Central, breaking down off-season moves, strengths and weaknesses, as well as predicting how they will finish come September.
First Place
Cincinnati Reds
The Reds finished last season in first place with a devastating offense and a lights-out pitching staff. Even though they finished last year with the second-most wins in baseball, the Reds were still active this off-season, trading center fielder Drew Stubbs for right fielder Shin-Soo Choo from the Cleveland Indians in a three-team deal. While some people question this move from a defensive standpoint — Choo has never played center fielder in his major league career — the offensive impact is quite apparent. Choo fills the large hole at their lead-off spot and turns the already potent Cincinnati lineup into one of the best in the league.
Second Place
St. Louis Cardinals
The Cardinals seem unfazed by any loss of talent. Each year, several key players suffer injuries, and yet St. Louis keeps winning. This year is no different, with ace Chris Carpenter and starting shortstop Rafael Furcal already lost to season ending injuries.
All that being said, the Cardinals have one of the best farm systems and have several minor league players who are expected to contribute this year, including outfielder Oscar Taveras who will start the year in the minors, and three young pitchers starting in the majors — Trevor Rosenthal, Shelby Miller, and Joe Kelly.
Third Place
Pittsburgh Pirates
After a close call last year, this should be the year that the Pirates have their first winning season in over 20 years. All-Star Andrew McCutchen is fresh off his best season and still has room to grow. Catcher Russell Martin made waves in the off-season by turning down a contract to remain with New York Yankees and instead signing with the Pirates. Hopefully this influx of leadership, in addition to the continued improvement of McCutchen, slugging third baseman Pedro Alvarez, and former All-Star Gaby Sánchez, will help the Pirates avoid the late-season slumps that plagued the team the past two seasons.
Fourth Place
Milwaukee Brewers
Even after losing slugging first baseman Prince Fielder last offseason, hitting the ball was never the Brewers’ main issue after leading the league in runs and home runs last season. Milwaukee’s real problem lies with its pitching. Milwaukee recently signed veteran free-agent pitcher Kyle Lohse ago to bolster its starting rotation behind ace Yovani Gallardo. While this move certainly helps firm up their starting pitching, there are still major questions with the young pitchers rounding out the back end of the rotation.
The bullpen is also a mess for the Brewers. Last year, closer John Axford blew seven of his first 23 save opportunities — part of the team’s league high 29 blown saves.
Fifth Place
Chicago Cubs
Last year the Cubs were really bad, and this season appears to be no different. Playing for the future is Chicago’s strategy during the second year of general manager Theo Epstein’s rein. The Cubs have a good group of young players lead by Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo, but they still need another year or two to reach their full potential.
A strong free-agent class headlined by starting pitchers Edwin Jackson, Carlos Villanueva, and Scott Feldman may give the Cubs some spark this season, but the real payoff will come in a few years when all of the prospects Epstein has amassed begin to make the majors.

Assistant professor of mechanical engineering Carmel Majidi recently won an award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program. The award comes with a $360,000 grant that will be used in part to fund a Ph.D. student working for Majidi in the field of soft robotics.
Soft robotics is a new domain in robotics where the robots are made of soft materials, as opposed to the types of rigid materials that conventional robots are made out of. These soft materials include elastomers, which are soft rubbers that are elastic and very stretchable. They can also be composed of fluids or gels.
One of the motivations behind soft robotics is to make robots and machines that are more life-like than curren robots. “The idea is that if robots and machines are made out of soft materials, then they will exhibit more of the functionality and properties that natural organisms have,” Majidi said.
According to Majidi, “The award addresses a very important challenge within the broader field of soft robotics.” Many of these challenges stem from the two necessities in soft robotics: electric power and materials to help power these biologically inspired robots. In addition, there is a need for materials that are able to harvest energy from their environment. The purpose of the Air Force award is to produce new classes of elastomers that can convert elastic deformation into electricity. When the soft robots move in an environment, they undergo large elastic deformations and collide with the surrounding surfaces. Thus they are going to absorb a lot of elastic energy that would otherwise be wasted. These robots contain special types of materials and transducers, and they can convert that elastic energy into electrostatic energy. This energy can be used to power different electronics inside the robot.
Majidi’s lab focuses on creating the materials that comprise soft robots.
One type of material that Majidi researches is an electronic artificial skin that would go on the outside of the robots. Inside the skin are sensing elements that can detect surface forces: surface friction, slip events, impact, collision, and contact pressures. The electronic skin can act as a stretchable type of electronic circuit that can go around the robot and support some of its electrically powered elements.
There are many potential application domains for the soft robots, such as  the area of actuators (artificial muscles). Some of the technologies that Majidi wants to produce in terms of energy harvesting could potentially be used to help power artificial muscles and soft robot actuators. This energy harvesting could also be used for producing electricity to power the on-board sensors, electronic switches, and different circuit elements in the soft robot.
“The field of soft robotics is relatively new, but some of the underlying principles have been around for decades,” Majidi said. One paradigm in soft robotics is inflatable soft robots — these are elastomers that are inflated with compressed air, similar to balloons. According to Majidi, there has been decades of effort put toward artificial muscles based on this principle of pneumatic inflation, which uses pressurized gas to inflate devices. The novelty is that there have been a lot of advancements in rapid prototyping and in the fabrication and advanced manufacturing techniques. Now researchers can take the existing principles and apply them to create much more elaborate types of soft robots at different length scales.
“Another area that I’m involved with is soft matter electronics,” Majidi said. “These are not necessarily robots, but they could function as a robot skin.” They could also function as wearable electronics, devices that can be put on human skin. These are thin sheets of soft rubber embedded with microfluidic channels of different types of fluidic matters. A lot of the current work in Majidi’s lab is focused on that approach to stretchable electronics. “That also motivates a lot of the work in this Air Force award — which is to create electrostatic generators to help power the soft matter electronics and sensors,” Majidi said.
“I’m very grateful for the award and I’m very excited by this research,” Majidi concluded. “It’s great for the group and for the Carnegie Mellon community because it creates this opportunity to do cutting-edge research.”

The energy climate of the nation, and especially southwest Pennsylvania, was been transformed by the discovery of the Marcellus Shale. The fracking boom has been a source of controversy, and has brought up many important questions regarding the economy, the environment, and policy. Recently, researchers from Carnegie Mellon have traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak with policymakers and share their recently completed 30-page policy guide on shale gas.
The team that traveled to Washington included engineering and public policy professor of the work and assistant director of policy outreach for the Scott Institute Deborah Stine, civil and environmental engineering professor Jeanne VanBriesen, associate professor of engineering and public policy and professor in the Tepper School of Business Michael Griffin, head of the mechanical engineering department Allen Robinson, and Ph.D. student in engineering and public policy Austin Mitchell. All are also associated with Carnegie Mellon’s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, which was launched last September.
The team’s main goal in Washington was to give policymakers and members of government a primer on shale gas, and inform them of the current research that was occurring at Carnegie Mellon in regards to water resources, air pollution, and gas wells. The group also focused their attention on pushing for a research initiative between universities, government, and industry.
The researchers stressed that there are many problems on how research is currently done in shale gas. According to Stine, many academic institutions are working on a “shoe- string budget,” with very little funds available when it comes to shale gas research. Mitchell also notes that research conducted by the gas industry can sometimes draw skepticism.
“There’s always that question of ‘well, is the work biased?’ and even if the work is good, it’s tough to avoid those sorts of questions. If somebody from the environmental group pays for the work, then you have the opposite occurring,” he said.
Enter the university-government-industry research initiative. The team believes that this collaboration between the different parties will result in better energy research with better solutions. Stine believes this setup would allow an independent board to prioritize research funds, and reduce the redundancy that is currently occurring in shale gas research. Mitchell also stresses the need for communication across institutions.
“What we’ve experienced is all these different people need to come together to support this initiative and to support research and understand what basically is going to be a huge part of the energy landscape of what’s to come,” he said. “That is something that we collectively believe is necessary to set a new agenda for conducting research in this area. I think it can allow us to maximize the benefits of shale gas but also understand and minimize the costs.”
In Washington, the group  members met with representatives from the Obama administration, members of the Senate and House of Representatives, and representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to discuss their policy guide and give their pitch for the research initiative.
According to Mitchell and Stine, the trip seemed to be a success. “I think it was very successful. We got very little negative feedback,” Stine said. 
According to Mitchell, everyone they met was informed and receptive to their ideas. “I think we did a really great job communicating our research and community the need for this initiative,” he said.
There were, however, questions of concern regarding how this initiative would be implemented, who would pay for it, and what specific processes would need to take place. According to Mitchell, currently all of the budget allotted for shale gas research goes to government organizations such as the EPA and the Department of Energy.
To Stine and Mitchell, this trip to Washington was just the beginning. Moving forward, the Scott Institute will continue to publish about three to four of these policy guides a year, according to Stine. In May, a similar group within the institute will travel to Washington, D.C. to brief policymakers on renewable energy resources. With shale gas estimated to account for almost half of the natural gas supply in the United States by 2040, the researchers in the Scott Institute hope to impact policy as soon as possible.

Bees are a lot smarter than most people credit them. How do bees know where to find the best flowers? When they find these flowers, how do they tell other bees where they are? These are tasks that may appear trivial at first glance, but actually involve complex and miraculous processes.
Howstuffworks.com explains that bees use two main tools in their search for food: a solar compass and an internal clock. Bees use their solar compass to remember the location of objects relative to the sun. Since they are able to see polarized light, their solar compass is unaffected by whether it is a sunny or cloudy day. The second tool, a bee’s internal clock, keeps track of how long the bee has been searching for food.
What is amazing about the combination of these abilities is that bees are even aware of how the sun moves throughout the time that they are searching for food. This means that when the bee returns to its hive, it can tell its hive mates exactly where the food is relative to the current position of the sun — not just relative to where the sun was when it found the food.
LiveScience describes a new theory regarding how bees detect flowers: Most plants have a slight negative charge relative to the air around them, while flying bees have a positive charge. Wired explains the positive charge of bees by using the analogy of wings accumulating charge as they zip through the air the same way that electrical charge accumulates on a person shuffling across a carpet.
To test whether these opposite charges help bees locate flowers, researchers used artificial flowers, half of which were electrically charged and filled with sweet nectar, the other half of which had no charge and were filled with a bitter solution. As expected, the bees quickly learned that the good food could be found in the electrically charged sweet flowers.
But the real test came when the researchers switched off the electrical charges. When none of the flowers was electrically charged, the bees simply visited the flowers randomly. The results of this experiment suggest that bees do indeed use the electric charge of plants to find nectar-rich flowers. What’s more, biologists discovered that flowers that have already had their nectar harvested become more positively charged. This way, bees know not to waste their time visiting flowers that no longer have much nectar.
After locating where nectar-filled flowers are, bees need to communicate to their fellow hive mates where they are. Howstuffworks.com explains that if the food is close to the hive, the bee will perform a round dance. This type of dance consists of traveling in loops in alternating directions. The round dance does not point in the direction of the food, it merely tells the other bees that food is nearby. When food is close, the other bees can usually find it on their own simply by using their odor senses.
A more complicated dance, which is performed when food is far away, is called the waggle dance. The waggle dance consists of flying in a straight line followed by returning loops. The direction of the straight line indicates the direction of the food in relation to the sun. 
For example, if the bee runs straight up the hive walls, this means that the food can be found by flying toward the sun. Conversely, if the bee runs straight down the hive wall, the food can be found by flying away from the sun. The quality of the flowers are indicated by the speed of the returning loops.
The most important part of the waggle dance is the waggle run. As the bee flies its straight line and returning loops, it vibrates its wings and waggles its abdomen. By doing so, the bee moves the air around it, allowing other bees near it to learn the location of the food by the change in air movement.
Bees are not to be taken as mere insects — with solar compasses, internal clocks, electrical attraction to plants, and intricate dances, they are a highly efficient and cooperative species that find food and communicate in astonishing ways.

Human – Neanderthal hybrid identified
Skeletal remains found in Riparo di Mezzena, a rock-shelter in northern Italy, may belong to the first known human-Neanderthal hybrid. Current studies focus on analyzing the jaw structure, which differs drastically between Neanderthals and modern humans. The structure of this jaw was a blend between a Neanderthal’s receding lower jaw and a modern human’s prominent lower jaw. The genetic analysis revealed that the remains contained mitochondrial DNA of a Neanderthal, suggesting that the individual would have been the descendant of a female Neanderthal and a male Homo sapien. This study indicates possible “ethnic cleansing” of the Neanderthals by sexual assault. Further research will reveal more information about Neanderthal and human interactions.

Shortcut to international  space station
Last Thursday, two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut arrived at the International Space Station a mere five hours and 45 minutes after their launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. This express route resulted in a trip that was about 45 hours shorter than the traditional trips. Before this trip, the Russians had been exploring alternate routes over the past three years. This express route was tested during three unmanned cargo flights. The expedited route involves very precise steering and calculations, making space debris and any other potential problems even more threatening. The abridged travel time also allows astronauts to arrive at the space station before the onset of microgravity-induced sickness, which will allow the astronauts to better perform their experiments on the biological effects of microgravity.
Russian engineers are already working towards cutting the travel time further, aiming for less than two orbits.

Biological indications of criminal recidivism
The Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, New Mexico completed a study demonstrating that neuroimaging techniques can predict the likelihood of criminal recidivism after being released from prison. The study examined impulsive and antisocial behavior focused in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the brain’s regulatory center for behavior and impulsivity. It was determined that inmates with low ACC activity were twice as likely to reoffend than inmates with high ACC activity. People with damaged or inactive ACCs tend to have “changes in disinhibition, apathy, and aggressiveness” and are typically identified by “acquired psychopathic personality,” the study states.

There is an alien world in the subterranean depths of Doherty Hall, a world in which fine arts students feverishly try to imbue their creations with artistic spirit. Last week, a chunk of that world was excavated for the rest of campus to see.
Basement Miracle, the 2013 master of fine arts thesis exhibition, opened last Friday in the Miller Gallery in the Purnell Center for the Arts. The MFA thesis exhibit, organized annually by the School of Art, features the work of graduating master of fine arts students and offers an opportunity for the students to display their work in a professional gallery exhibition open to the public.
The exhibit, which consists mainly of sculptures and installations, spans all three floors of the Miller Gallery. The works use a variety of media and touch upon many different subjects, although there are some common themes such as the integration of technology and science. The exhibition draws a sizable crowd of both Carnegie Mellon students and the greater public.
The first floor of the exhibit showcases an installation by Erin Womack called “Guardian of the Threshold,” which consists of a dark room with a shifting face projected onto the screen and three African masks protruding out of the back of the room. The face, demonic in nature, changes in sync to the constant throbs of music in the background, creating a tense mood throughout the room.
The second floor seems to have a broad theme of technology and industrialization. All of the works on this floor feature the use of machinery or engineering.
Luke Loeffler’s works “Bug Out” and “Aqua Vitae” deal with the politics of alcohol and seem designed to give off an industrial aesthetic. “Bug Out,” for example, features a contraption that rotates a liquor bottle in a wooden frame. “Aqua Vitae” displays lab materials such as beakers and bottles of chemical compounds.
“Aqua Vitae” also showcases recordings of deep sea vents and three fish swimming in a sink. According to Loeffler, “in some cultures alcohol is considered the water of life. The ocean is also thought of as the birthplace of life, especially deep sea vents. In this piece I’m conflating these two things, and I’m confronting the stereotypes of moonshiners.”
In addition to machines and contraptions, many of the works allow for audience participation as well. 
“(Un)bound”, by Felipe Castelblanco, for example, features an air compressor and a device that packages air, allowing viewers to pack and take home their own boxes of air.
Castelblanco described the idea behind the piece: “I was interested in air as public space that is becoming privatized and controlled; even this very common thing, air, is not equally distributed,” he said. “Some air is polluted and some air is fresh. This looks at the world and politics, and what created this social structure.”
Another work that features audience involvement is “Borderland” by Craig Fahner, an installation with coal-filled jars and speakers hanging from the ceiling. The coal serves as radio antennae that change the wave they broadcast depending on how far away they are from someone.
According to Fahner, the piece was inspired by the National Radio Quiet Zone in West Virginia, an area where any device emitting radio waves is illegal due to the black hole research conducted there. On creating the piece, Fahner said, “It took a long time to finish. I planned it in October and I designed the software and electronics for it. It was a long process, but the School of Art had a lot of resources I was able to use to make my own circuit.”
Some works involve neither intricate engineering nor complicated technology but are effective nonetheless. Steve Gurysh’s “The Long Cloud,” for example, is a Geiger meter clicking away before a picture of a patch of desert. It is a simple but nonetheless haunting piece that conveys the dangers involved in nuclear technology.
The third floor only showcases two works, and therefore, there is not as much of a theme. However, the works themselves were still highly interesting. Dan Wilcox’s “Onward to Mars” featured photographs that Wilcox took during his time at the Mars Desert Research Station, where he spent two weeks on a simulated Mars mission, as well as a book he made documenting his thoughts at the time.
According to Wilcox, “I was always interested in Mars and I read all kinds of books about it. But these were all from a macro perspective, and I wanted to see what it’s like for an everyday person to do work and live on Mars.”
Finally, one of the most visually stunning installations in the exhibit is Scott Andrew’s “Gilding the Lily,” an installation filled with elaborately designed oval “mirrors” that show projections of surreal glam monsters. These mirrors, which are also outfitted with speakers, all play at the same time, combining to create a sound akin to chanting. This chanting, together with the fantastic images, makes viewers feel as if they are stepping into some sort of Buddhist Narnia.
“Gilding the Lily” is actually a self-portrait, expressing Andrew’s interests in dance, ideas of gender, and sci-fi/fantasy genres. It is also a reflection of the work he has done over the years. As he explained, “I have been doing a combination of performance and installations, and I have a blend of video and sculpture in this piece. Also, I usually work with performers, but in this I performed as all the characters.”
Although it features few works from only seven artists, Basement Miracle is certainly worth browsing for the sheer originality and variety of subject matter that it offers. Combining different designs, technologies, and a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences, Basement Miracle comes together to be something that is unique to Carnegie Mellon.
Basement Miracle is open through April 21 in the Miller Gallery of the Purnell Center for the Arts.

Warning: This article contains spoilers.
Season three is coming — dark and full of terrors. And most importantly, when you’re on Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.
The long-anticipated release of the third and most recent season of Game of Thrones aired last night on HBO. Since the end of season two, which aired in late May last year, the hype has only escalated recently.
The series, based upon the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by American author George R. R. Martin, was launched in April 2011. Martin originally intended the series to be a trilogy but has since decided to extend the series to seven novels, all of which are about as thick as encyclopedias. The novels, five of which have been released, follow characters whose stories are strewn with more plot twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
Because Martin is positively cruel with his characters, it’s impossible to say who the main characters are: Just as you’re getting used to following one, he or she dies. As of the end of season two, the primary characters (knock on wood) included Daenerys Targaryen, a platinum-haired mother of dragons; Jon Snow, a lord’s bastard who fights frozen zombies; Tyrion Lannister, a clever dwarf with a family from hell; and Robb Stark, an accidental candidate for king who leads an army. On the continents Westeros and Easteros, storms are brewing over who will take over the throne, and from there, a plethora of problems ensue.
The amount of detail that goes into writing the novels and the screenplay is arguably the most compelling part of the show. The story lines are so intricate that Martin has even divulged key plot points from the last two novels to the show’s creators, HBO’s David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, in case something should happen to him before he is able to finish writing them.
Few people had heard of the books, which are now bestsellers, until the release of the show. For a show that’s just turning two years old, Game of Thrones has acquired a massive cult following. The story and characters have positively exploded in pop culture, flooding the Internet and garnering nods from TV shows like The Office and television personalities such as Jon Stewart. At the end of season two, episodes were attracting more than 10 million viewers, pushing the show to the third-most popular in HBO’s history.
Season three started last night with an episode entitled “Valar Dohaeris.” In a horrifyingly stressful moment, the network’s online service, HBO Go, was overloaded by the amount of viewers trying to access the episode, which delayed viewers from watching.
During the episode, the story lines of all the major players were set up for yet another season of intrigue. Jon Snow’s journey beyond the Wall continues, and we finally met Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall and a new key player.
It was clear from this episode that the drama beyond the Wall, which involves not only a rebellion of Wildings but an army of the frozen undead, will be a significant portion of the season. Though not much was seen of Snow’s half-brother Robb Stark, in this episode he continues to deal with the backlash from his mother’s decision to release their prime prisoner, Jaime Lannister (a.k.a. the Kingslayer) and march North back to their home at Winterfell.
In the Southern capital of Westeros, schemes and plots continue to emerge: Tyrion, everyone’s favorite witty ex-Hand of the King, deals with family and daddy issues — and as a result, he loses what little credibility he had managed to gain. Sansa Stark, daughter of poor dead Ned Stark, is offered an escape from her prison in King’s Landing by Lord Baelish, the sneaky whorehouse owner and banker of the king. The new queen, Margaery Tyrell, butts heads with her mother-in-law, Cersei — the letter-ripping former queen and mother of Joffery Barathan, the worst human being to walk the Earth.
Across the Narrow Sea, the beautiful and badass Daenerys Targaryen, faithful adviser Jorah Mormont, and her three growing dragons procure a ship and sail to Astapor, a new location for viewers. In just one episode, she deals with slave traders, a warlock attempting to assassinate her, and an army of eunuchs.
All in all, the episode seems to focus on the schemes of King’s Landing, the dragon queen of Easteros, and the horrifying terrors of the frozen wasteland beyond the Wall, leaving viewers both satisfied and curious for the season that will continue to unfold over the next 10 weeks.

“My name is Lizzie Bennet,” says the title character in almost each and every episode of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, usually followed by some clever catch phrase that sums up the episode. The 100th and final episode should probably have begun with, “My name is Lizzie Bennet, and while this whole web series thing is awesome, this isn’t actually Pride and Prejudice.”
The web series is an expanding form of media entertainment which entails posting videos to the Internet, usually in a set of episodes. This style of entertainment is relatively new, and has only had its own form of awards — the Streamy Awards — since 2009. The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is an adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, a novel that follows Lizzie Bennet as she struggles with social expectations for young women in early 19th-century Britain.
The Lizzie Bennet Diaries was a fantastic idea. Creators Bernie Su and Hank Green took a famous and well-known tale and used it to experiment with web series, a burgeoning form of entertainment. In their version, modern-day Lizzie Bennet uploads a video twice a week, describing the events of her life and starring herself, her two sisters Jane and Lydia, and her best friend Charlotte Lu (Pride and Prejudice’s Charlotte Lucas.) The Diaries are funny, light, and fun, especially in their initial episodes.
One of its biggest successes is the character of Lydia Bennet. In the novel, Lydia is silly, vapid, and vain. In the web series, Lydia is a much more vibrant and living character. She’s still a party girl, but the series does not disregard her emotions.
However, Lydia’s modern equivalent of her trip to Brighton — New Years’ in Las Vegas — was where the characterization started to go wrong. The creators turn the novel’s scandal — the unwed Lydia running away from home with a man — into an emotionally abusive relationship. This male character isolates and demoralizes Lydia in the web series, and then threatens to release an Internet video of the two of them having sex.
These two situations are not simply two versions of scandal in two separate periods. Pride and Prejudice Lydia chose her own course, in a way that Diaries Lydia does not. While Austen does not portray Lydia’s emotional state in Brighton — we only hear of it when Lizzie does, after the fact — Lydia at least had agency in the novel. She chose to run away. There is a world of difference between running away from home with a jerk and being emotionally abused. When a woman in a novel written in 1813 has more agency than a woman in a web series created in 2012, you have a problem.
But the greater issue lies in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries as a retelling of Austen’s most famous novel. Pride and Prejudice is not a classic novel because of its improbable love story. How many other virtuous yet poor girls were swept off their feet by rich men in Victorian literature? And how many of them do we remember?
We remember Austen because she was one of the best satirists in the English language. She created characters that were the epitome of satirical wit: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and even Lizzie herself all represented different facets of Austen’s own culture during that period. These characters are brilliantly written, funny, and memorable on multiple levels, but they are not suitable for every age and period.
Austen’s satire is timeless, but it is not applicable to modern-day America. The differences between social norms, societal expectations, and personal hopes in early 19th-century England and early 21st-century America are vast, and Austen’s humorous critique of the former does not apply to the latter. Austen satirizes a 19th-century phenomenon: the absolute need for women to conform if they want to have financial and social stability. Though the creators do try to replicate Austen’s restrictive world — mostly by having the Bennet girls worry about college and financial security — the two situations just aren’t the same. Women today must deal with social expectations, of course, but their entire futures no longer rely on emulating such a strict ideal.
That being said, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is a great example of what a web series can become. This new form of entertainment is one of the most interactive forms ever. Each of the characters in the series has his or her own Tumblr and Twitter accounts, updated regularly, and they each answer questions and comments in a variety of Q & A videos. The writers and creators of the show worked hard to make these characters as real and accessible as possible. While Pride and Prejudice may not have been the most judicious choice of a story to start out with, the web series genre has a bright future.

If you love spring break, partying, and Britney Spears, go watch Spring Breakers now. If you hate spring break, partying, and Britney Spears, go watch Spring Breakers now. Go straight to the nearest theater playing it. Even if that means taking the 61D all the way to the Waterfront in this endlessly miserable Pittsburgh weather, it’s time better spent than sitting in your bed whilst having a Vampire Diaries marathon with a jar of Nutella in your hands.
Spring Breakers is the latest project by controversial director Harmony Korine. Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and the otherwise-obscure Rachel Korine (wife of the director) star as four bored college girls who just want to have fun. However, their idea of fun entails stealing a car to rob a local Chicken Shack, going to insane parties, and getting tied up with some messy drug dealers. James Franco plays one such drug dealer named Alien who is incredibly suspicious, yet declares himself a “gangster with a heart of gold.” Clad with absurdly questionable tattoos, grills, and cornrows, Franco decides to take these four girls — who seem too dazed to be suspicious of the fact that he is a dangerous drug dealer — under his wing. The exception is Gomez’s character Faith, who somewhat serves as the moral compass of the posse. But when Franco plays Britney Spears’ “Everytime” for the girls on his grand piano, it is enough to win everyone’s trust and love.
Another great reason to watch this movie is rapper Gucci Mane, who stars as rival drug dealer Big Arch. The man wouldn’t even take off his ice cream cone chains for the movie — but I suppose that it helped bring out his character. The rapper honestly didn’t even have to act; he was method acting even more than Franco simply by impersonating himself. I guess that’s all you can ask from a fading rapper clutching at his last minutes of fame by the chains.
But don’t assume this is a just a vapid intersection of Project X and Girls Gone Wild. Neither is it an exploitation of Disney stars. The film makes a very dark transformation from a crowd-pleasing party to a dark underworld of reckless violence. Also, the “spring breakers” themselves are very entertaining and carry the film well enough to defy expectations; they make debauchery seem like an acceptable art form for cinema.
Never for one second will you be bored watching Spring Breakers — and I don’t mean that the director continually tries to shove things down the movie-making machine so as not to lose your attention. Spring Breakers is a believable-yet-fantastical portrayal of four girls who decide to flirt with the dangers of being young, wild, and free. You’ll either love it or hate it, and probably for the same reasons. Either way, it’s unlike anything you’ve seen before, and that alone is worth a trip to the movies.

“Growing up sucks.”
This sentiment was all over the radio in the ‘90s when bands like Nirvana, Radiohead, Weezer, and other alt-rock misfits ruled the airwaves, but it has recently been lacking in much of newer popular music. That being said, Nathan Williams, who performs under the name Wavves, clearly went back to his childhood CD collection (remember those?) in preparation for his band’s fifth outing, Afraid of Heights, released last Tuesday on Mom+Pop records.
The record draws heavily from and pays homage to the greats of punk and alternative music in both musical and lyrical style. Like those artists he emulates, Williams writes songs about self-loathing, boredom, and a general disdain for just about everything — but with melodic, quiet verses and choruses with guitars and drums turned all the way up, they sound fun enough to shout along with the car windows down.
Williams has been recording under the name Wavves since 2008 with a rotating lineup of backing musicians. Along with Stephen Pope — the only other consistent member of the group — Williams recorded the entire fifth album himself and on his own dime. This independence afforded the pair a great deal of freedom of exploration, as well as a great diversity in music styles on the album. Album opener “Sail to the Sun” travels at breakneck speed with a flying guitar riff that brings you all the way up, and then slams you back down before you have a chance to catch your breath. “Dog,” on the other hand, features haunting strings and calm acoustic guitars that, if it weren’t for Williams’s nasal vocal delivery, would sound like an unreleased track from the Nirvana MTV Unplugged in New York performance.
Unlike 2010’s breakthrough hit King of the Beach, which sounded like it was recorded in your mom’s basement, Afraid of Heights features slick production that doesn’t polish away the rough edges. The greatly improved production also coincides with forward leaps in song writing; Afraid of Heights is much more consistent than many of the previous Wavves outings. He indulges in spacey studio experimentation and loose song structure at times — such as on “Mystic” and “Everything Is My Fault” — but as a whole, nearly every song sounds focused and fully realized.
On Afraid of Heights, Williams is just as full of self-loathing and boredom as before. But while on King of the Beach he sounded like he was having fun not having fun, this time the stakes feel higher and the mood a little less carefree. Perhaps he’s grown up, and realized that the privilege of complaining about boredom doesn’t last forever. Afraid of Heights shows a songwriter with enough perspective to look back but also enough maturity to start looking forward — and what he sees in both directions scares him (just listen to the title track or the regret-filled rocker “That’s on Me”). In many ways, Afraid of Heights harkens back to a time (the early-to-mid ’90s) when it seemed that being a slacker counted as a full-time profession to anyone could make a career of it. But as Williams now seems to have realized, we all have to grow up sometime.

Student-made robots, famous fashion labels, top-notch actors, and world-class writers are born every now and then from Carnegie Mellon.  Nevertheless, senior economic and statistics major Doug Heckmann, senior mechanical engineering major Casey Parzych, and senior information systems and business administration double major Anthony Lorubbio still managed to surprise the community by developing their own vodka label, Fortis. 
The three have been working on this project since the fall of their junior year. Seeing how well they work together, one would have thought that they have been friends for a long time. Yet, in fact, they did not meet until their entrepreneur class that semester. As a result of their different majors, Heckmann, Parzych, and Lorubbio have knowledge and expertise in all different areas, making them a diverse and extremely strong team. 
Fortis' delicately sweet taste differentiates it from other brands, a result of its unique distilling process with fair-trade, organic sugar cane. The idea was bred while the team was researching possible grains to make vodka; apparently, the team unanimously chose sugar cane due to its scrumptiousness and individuality. 
While they were researching filtering methods, the team also decided to invest in a carbon filter process. "The product that resulted was some of the smoothest vodka we'd ever tasted," Lorubbio said. 
Heckmann, who is in charge of sales and finances, decided to target customers who enjoy a locally produced hand-crafted spirit. The label is looking to launch its Synthe Absinthe next month during Carnival weekend.
One of the biggest lessons the team has come to learn is time management, both in terms of staying on top of the school's very heavy workload and maintaining the business' standards. Nights seem to be growing longer and longer: "We did not name our company 'Midnight Madness Distilling' for no reason," Parzych said.  
The future is a great unknown for many graduating seniors, but the trio is committed to continually building this company and developing not just Fortis, but all of their brands e.g. Synth. While there are many renowned competitors out there, Heckmann, Parzych, and Lorubbio know that they are different and really believe in their own products, which they hope will lead to future success.

Tucked away in a side gallery on the second floor, Japan Is the Key… is a small and seemingly nondescript new exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art. The exhibit, which opened last Saturday, features Japanese color woodblock prints, watercolors, and ivory figurines made in the first half of the 19th century.
Although the exhibit is fairly small — filling only three small rooms — it probably could have been condensed further. The exhibit is largely homogenous, mostly because nearly all of the works are from the same time period and use the same medium. Oftentimes, the walls are lined with a long series of works by the same artist. Aside from the occasional watercolor and the small ivory collection in centrally placed display cases, the works almost exclusively consist of color woodblock prints. Even the color palette of pale reds and sea blues is very similar from print to print.
The exception is a striking series of taller, narrower prints by Torii Kiyonaga and Tamagawa Shucho that line the middle room. Looking closer, the subjects of the prints look oddly cut off, like badly cropped Facebook profile pictures. Still, from afar, the sharply vertical shape makes these prints the most visually captivating pieces in the exhibit.
Though the exhibit is not the most eye-catching or diverse overall, there is beauty to be found in these pieces through the technique and level of detail used to create them. Even centuries later, the lines of the prints are crisp and precise, and the colors fade exquisitely and seamlessly across the paper. A particularly striking example of intricate, pristine printmaking is “Night Rain at Oyama” by Utagawa Toyokuni II, which streaks diagonal lines across the page to represent sheets of rain obscuring a view of the mountain.
Within the exhibit, there are two distinct categories: landscapes that provide wide, sweeping views of mountains and lakes, and closer snapshots of human life (usually women). Despite the repetition within these categories — one can only look at so many prints of Mount Fuji — the subject matter is perhaps the most thought-provoking dimension to the exhibit. Considering the time period during which they were made, some of the pieces are surprisingly satirical and suggestive. Kitagawa Utamaro’s “The Four Accomplishments,” for example, is a parody of classical painting style that depicts courtesans in an Edo pleasure house, many of them in playfully suggestive poses.
These kinds of pieces clash with our highly traditional and hierarchical understanding of feudal Japan, and challenge us to reassess our understanding of the role of art in 19th-century Japan. Though on the surface, these prints may look repetitive and bland, a few of them make playful artistic commentary that is easy to overlook.
In this way, Japan Is the Key… requires more patience and willingness to think than many art exhibits. These pieces won’t grab your attention right away; in fact, they may bore you after a while. Japan Is the Key… is not for museum goers who want to breeze through an exhibit; it requires a closer, more careful look and a viewer who is willing to search for the hidden value in a work of art.

Dear Patrick,
I just read the April Fools’ Day issue of The Tartan, and I am very offended. Your article insulted my club/major/personal identity. I demand recompense! What’s the best way to go about attaining it?
Thanks,
Brusquely Upset, Satisfaction Yearned, But Otherwise Decent Yarn
Dear BUSYBODY,
Easy now, let’s not start throwing around heated words like “recompense” when we don’t really mean it. Okay, so you were offended, and you found a joke off-putting. Why? Does it make light of a serious subject? Do you just not like jokes at your expense? Take a moment and think about this. It’s a little too easy nowadays to cry outrage and complain to people in power when a joke simply didn’t land well.
If a joke actually was offensive, then I’m sure it was not intended to be so hurtful. Yes, many jokes are at peoples’ expenses. They are also funny. It’s too easy for both the joker and the butt of the joke to forget the people at either end. Let’s not start a witch hunt unless someone really deserves it. But if we do, I’d rather be one of the people holding a torch.
This column isn’t funny because I’m all out of jokes,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m pretty sure my boyfriend is a robot. He’s usually pretty emotionless and cool. He takes all instructions very literally. This is all well and good, except I can’t get him to remember to do stuff for me! How can I update his programming?
Thanks,
Rather Obnoxious Boyfriend Oblivious, Since Emotions eXcite Uninterest, Alterations Likely
Dear ROBOSEXUAL,
Your boyfriend isn’t a robot. He’s an engineer. Yes, the two can be very difficult to tell apart. They both can seem cold and emotionless. Many tread the uncanny valley. But while robots run only on electricity, engineers need electricity and Mountain Dew.
If you want to get your boyfriend to do what you want, then you’re going to need to brush up on those skills from your required programming class and write him a script (not the drama kind). A few simple, straightforward commands, preferably commands he can enter into his phone as reminders. Then he’ll do exactly as you ask.
Unless he throws a runtime error,
Patrick Hoskins

Hyde Park on Hudson
9:30 11
Remember your high school history textbook? Remember those little boxes on the side that kept the reading from becoming too tedious? Hyde Park on Hudson is one of those boxes. Bill Murray portrays President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during a 1939 weekend getaway with his mistress and the King and Queen of England. Those who enjoyed The King’s Speech will probably find something interesting here.
Lincoln
9:30 12:30
This is like your high school history textbook if it were written by William Shakespeare and narrated by Morgan Freeman. Daniel Day-Lewis turns in an unsurprisingly virtuosic performance as our 16th president, for which he won his third Academy Award. The screenplay, written by celebrated playwright Tony Kushner, is immaculate, documenting a few months leading up to the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment. Spielberg’s direction seems appropriate as well, highlighting the detail of the extraordinary process.
Les Misérables
9:30 12:30
Everyone knows the songs and the story. This most recent adaptation of the famous musical has garnered a lot of praise for its supposedly admirable decision to record the singing live. Unfortunately, the cast of movie stars are clearly not trained for the stage. Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe shout through their roles, everything at absolute full volume. The fact that Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks are able to transcend this veritable disaster in brief roles is a testament to their talent.
West Side Story
7 10
This is one of the all-time great Hollywood musical productions. Of course, when you’re adapting material like this — Leonard Bernstein’s score and Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics — it’s hard to screw up. But this colorful masterpiece is a delight from front to back, swaying effortlessly between emotional ranges. The singing and dancing never falter and the production design is something to behold: New York rendered in gleaming, vivid Technicolor.

Update: It has been reported by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Pittsburgh city fire fighters found no fire in Doherty Hall. Deputy City Fire Chief Jerry Hirschfeld reported that the exhaust system in Doherty began circulating sawdust through the building.
A fire broke out in the lower levels of Doherty Hall around 9 p.m. Wednesday evening.
Fire engines and police cars were seen at the service road near the base of Doherty Hall and on Frew Street near Baker Hall. 
Nick Chisholm, a chemical engineering Ph.D. student, said, "I was in the building and we smelled smoke," adding that he noticed a strange smell when he was grading papers in the upstairs portion of the building.
Daniel Campos Zamora, a sophomore art and psychology double major, saw smoke coming from the dust collection system of a CNC milling machine, which automates the milling of metal materials, on the C level of Doherty.
"There was the smell of something burning for a while, and we asked if we should pull the alarm," Zamora said. He contacted campus security and was advised to sound the fire alarm.
According to Matt Finlay, a creative writing junior, the fire interrupted a Carnival Committee meeting. 
The university has not yet commented on the incident.

Candidates for student body president (SBP), student body vice president (SBVP), student body vice president of finance (SBVPF), and student body vice president of organizations (SBVPO) responded to questions about their platforms in Monday’s and Tuesday’s student government election debates. The president and vice presidential debate, held on Monday in McConomy Auditorium, featured Lindsay MacGillivray, a junior biology and psychology major, and Peter Masters, a sophomore international relations and politics and environmental policy double major, against Thomas Healy, a junior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major, and Caitlin Jones, a junior business administration major. The audience for the debate was sparse; fewer than 20 of McConomy’s seats were filled.
In addition to representing the student body’s wishes in their decision-making, the positions eligible for election play an instrumental role in dictating the functioning of crucial student government organizations including the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) and Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO).
The debate began with questions asked every year, including “What do you believe is the most important role of student government?” and “An issue each year is how to make student government more approachable to the general campus, and to generate a sense of transparency — would you say that this year’s student government has done a good job at generating that sense of transparency and being approachable?”
An important part of Healy and Jones’ platform is the spreading of school spirit.
“We already have a great athletics program in place, and it’s just a matter of students knowing when these events are taking place,” Jones said.
The second part of the presidential and vice presidential debate began with a question about Carnegie Mellon’s campus culture: “How do you see the student body president’s role in addressing stress culture and how would you address it if elected?”
Healy emphasized the role of the student body president as implementing ideas, rather than coming up with them.
“We’re not going to be the ones who come up with the ideas of how to cure every problem at Carnegie Mellon; we’re two students within this university. I think the university itself and the staff of the university are going to come up with those ideas…. Our main role is going to be backing [the administration] up on their initiatives.”
MacGillivray continued the theme of carrying out proposed ideas by addressing the perspective of students, saying, “I do feel like the student body needs to feel empowered to speak up for themselves and to say ‘this is something I want to take on; these are the ways in which my impact could really help campus.’ ”
After the debate, some onlookers thought that the candidates lacked specificity.
“They didn’t address specifics; when they answered my question they basically both said that they were going to hold a bunch of meetings,” said senior economics major Bryan Wade.
Amy Quispe, a senior computer science major who ran for student body president last year with Wade, agreed. “I was thoroughly unimpressed with the candidates. They did a very good job of reiterating how they were going to crowd source student ideas, and then find other students to implement these ideas for them, and then take credit.”
“I think that tends to happen in these debates and in these large elections: The platforms are generally very broad pictures,” said Anshul Dhankher, a junior chemical and biomedical engineering double major.
Dhankher also emphasized the importance of experience for presidential and vice presidential candidates. “I would say that Lindsay and Peter’s side — both sides have great experience — was a little more specific in terms of concrete ideas and experience in student government. Especially on Peter’s side, with JFC and CoSO, that [experience is] almost necessary to have, going forward.”
Tuesday’s debates for SBVPF and SBVPO, held in Rangos Hall, had even fewer attendees than Monday’s.
The first debate, for SBVPF, was between Joshua Swanson, a sophomore psychology and statistics double major, and Jaden Potea, a sophomore statistics major.
Several debate questions asked the candidates about how they would strengthen communication among student organization leaders, other branches of student government, and the JFC, which allocates money for organizations’ budgets.
Potea advocated for a more transparent approach, keeping the JFC and SBVPF in constant communication with other key figures like the Student Senate and Graduate Students Association’s (GSA) finance chairs.
“One thing I would like to do is work with either the finance chairs to just make sure that the JFC’s rationale, their reasoning is supplied to them in detail…. I think it’s important to make sure the reasoning the JFC used to budget a certain way, to make sure that that knowledge is available,” he said.
Swanson, too, advocated increased communication between various heads of student government.
“I also think continuing with the office hours between the SBVPF and the SBVPO is important, because we do overlap in a lot of areas,” he said. “It’s going to be very close; both of them have strong platforms and strong ideas. It’s going to be about who can muster the most support,” said Vivek Nair, a junior electrical and computer engineering major and member of Student Senate.
“It’s going to be interesting because last year it was an uncontested position. The fact remains that the platform for SBVPF doesn’t have that much flexibility. How they can differentiate themselves from that description is what’ll define this election,” Nair said.
The debate for SBVPO included junior psychology major Corinne Rockoff, sophomore business administration major Susanna Park, and sophomore mathematics and economics double major Radowan Khan.
The Bridge, a new tool for campus organizations, was an important part of the SBVPO debate. Candidates all emphasized its utility when answering the question, “How will you ensure student organization leaders use the Bridge to its full potential, and how will you use the Bridge to help student organizations?”
All of the candidates agreed that many organization leaders and students were not fully aware of the Bridge’s purpose.
“I think people still don’t know what Bridge actually is, and what Bridge actually does,” Park said. Park advocated meeting with organization leaders to show them how to use the Bridge and providing online guides on Carnegie Mellon’s website. Park, a Computing at Carnegie Mellon (C@CM) teaching assistant, also suggested incorporating the Bridge into C@CM’s curriculum.
“I think it’s incredibly essential that students are aware of the Bridge and understand how to use it; it’s especially important now that a lot of important administrative functions are being done through the Bridge,” Khan said.
Rockoff agreed that the Bridge was severely underutilized, mostly because organization leaders don’t know how to use it.
“A lot of the questions about the Bridge at present are on the ‘where is the button for’ level; people just don’t know how to operate the system,” she said. 
To alleviate this issue, Rockoff recommends “very detailed, but still at the basic level, how-to guides—quick questions and answers, most commonly asked questions.”
“The Bridge is a huge thing that’s happening right now that works directly with the SBVPO; it seems like that’s sort of the next step they can take to improve the work the SBVPO does, because it’s a resource that is meant specifically for organizations on our campus,” said MacGillivray, who attended the debate.
Andrew Schwartz, a sophomore information systems major and Student Senate sergeant at arms, considered what each candidate had to offer the position of SBVPO.
“I think Corinne has a deeper knowledge of the overall student body, and I’m not sure how that perspective would affect CoSO but I’m interested in finding out. I think that Radowan has a very deep understanding of the way CoSO operates, so I think that also makes a very interesting dynamic.”
Students can vote for candidates as well as view their submitted platforms online at stugov.andrew.cmu.edu until Tuesday. All three debates are also available for online streaming by cmuTV.

A website called Lashzone, which functions as a paper mill service, recently sent a number of emails to Carnegie Mellon students. The university staff and administration views these emails as threats to academic integrity. They also coincide with the university’s current attempt to update its policy on academic integrity.
According to Lashzone’s website, the service offers “professional assistance on post-secondary homework, assignments, essays, lab reports, assignment revision...etc.” Students wishing to spend money for the site’s services would send their assignments to the website, prepare for another major event like a test during the week, and then simply receive the requested, completed assignment in a reply email before the due date.
Holly Hippensteel, dean of student affairs, notes that although multiple students forwarded the Lashzone emails, “We don’t know how many students were contacted.”
Student reaction to the solicitation from Lashzone was mixed. One first-year student said he wouldn’t do it himself, but he doesn’t mind it. “The kids don’t learn anything in the end — but it’s their choice. Let them do what they want,” he said.
Alternatively, Je-Hoon Oh, a first-year chemistry major, had trouble understanding why students would partake in a paper mill program. “Why would students want to copy someone else’s work, especially in this age?” Oh asked. 
Oxford University students received similar emails in January, with student responses akin to Oh’s. “I wouldn’t use it — my prose style is weird and identifiable, and I also quite like my degree,” one Oxford first-year said. “But I fully encourage its proliferation on the basis that the ‘yoof’ who do use it are more likely to get caught. And I am basically a pretty spiteful person.”
Although it is unknown whether Lashzone is trulya homework site or just a phishing site aimed to scam students, students and administration have concerns about Lashzone. According to Hippensteel, “The emails were provocative, which got our attention. It’s a relatively new website, and some feel it’s a phishing site while others think it’s a homework site. But we felt there was enough discussion that we decided to let faculty know. Lashzone is certainly not the only online paper mill out there.”
Hippensteel notes that Coastal Carolina University has a website that keeps track of paper mills, with over 250 already identified and located. She also feels that, besides being morally wrong to use, sites like Lashzone offer a risky proposition for students. There is no guarantee — besides the site’s own pledge — that it does not copy and paste the same answers for different students’ assignments, which would be plagiarism by definition.
“The idea of using a paper mill is probably risky in the age of Turnitin,” Hippensteel said. Turnitin is a plagiarism detection and prevention website created by iParadigms. 
Hippensteel does admit that there may be stressed, desperate, or lazy students who would attempt to use the website to their advantage, which is a concern.
Hippensteel also notes that Carnegie Mellon is looking to update its academic integrity policy. 
“The current policy was last revised in 1990, so it’s long overdue. It came out of a conversation from faculty senate, and thanks to students, we had a chance to look at the policy in March.” The changes look to clarify the current policy and make it clearer.
Currently, the policy focuses on the issues of cheating and plagiarism. However, the major change adopted by the new policy would be to clearly list “unauthorized assistance” — such as services offered by Lashzone — with the current two categories. Although unauthorized assistance is currently covered in the current policy, the new policy would make it clear to students that collaboration is not permissible unless students are explicitly given permission by their instructors. Using things like cell phones, cheat sheets, and outside help would therefore not be allowed unless the professor permitted.
“It’s about honest communication,” Hippensteel said. “And if you are unsure about a professor’s policies, you can just ask professors and you’ll get an answer. Students can also go online and see the policy.”

Four Carnegie Mellon seniors launched PayTango, a fingerprint-based payment method that eliminates the need for identification and debit cards. Senior information systems majors Brian Groudan, Umang Patel, and Christian Reyes, and senior human-computer interaction and industrial design double major Kelly Lau-Kee developed PayTango in the Tech Startup Lab course taught by computer science assistant professor Luis von Ahn in fall 2012.
Groudan, Lau-Kee, Patel, and Reyes effectively combined their talents to search for a solution to a universal problem: People have to carry around too many cards. Credit cards can be lost, card numbers can be stolen, and it can be a hassle to pull out a card while holding a cup brimming with hot coffee. 
They invented a much easier method of payment that uses fingerprints instead of cards.
“Biometrics was a really good way for us to explore how to eliminate the need to carry around extra ‘stuff’ to identify yourself. And that’s kind of the vision that we have moving forward, is that through the use of biometrics, we can strengthen the security to verify that a person is [who they say they are]…. There are a lot of applications,” Lau-Kee said.
PayTango allows people to pay using two fingerprints. The first time someone enrolls with the system, they must swipe their card as their fingers are placed on the scanner. 
It takes around 10–15 seconds to associate the card data with the person’s biometric data. 
Then, when that person returns, they can use their card by simply scanning their fingerprints, a process that takes only a few seconds.
Although he does not yet use PayTango, sophomore mechanical engineering major Michael O’Connor said, “This seems like an amazing technology that will make my life much easier and that will protect people’s financial information.”
The PayTango founders did not originally think their idea would turn in to a full-fledged business. 
According to Lau-Kee, the first time they considered starting a company was when they participated in the University of Pennsylvania PennApps hackathon, the largest college hackathon in the world. 
Groudan, Patel, and Reyes attended the hackathon and built the device using only an iPad, a fingerprint reader, and a magnetic card reader. 
The product was demoed and received recognition and multiple awards, demonstrating its viability.
PayTango has come far since the PennApps hackathon. Last Tuesday, the company graduated from Y Combinator, an incubator program in Mountain View, California that supports the development of entrepreneurial companies. 
After successfully completing the three-month program along with 46 other businesses, Groudan, Lau-Kee, Patel, and Reyes demoed PayTango in front of more than 500 investors, including many prominent Silicon Valley entities.
“We’re still amazed that we’ve gotten this far,” Lau-Kee said.
The business is currently going through its first round of funding. Additionally, PayTango has been installed at multiple dining locations within Carnegie Mellon, including The Underground, Skibo Café, and the Exchange. 
A few hundred students already use PayTango, and the device has had, according to Lau-Kee, “really good reception.”
Lau-Kee continued, “Universities are a great place for us, because where we can deliver the most value is in these very tight ecosystems and networks. Here, you use one single ID card to pay for everything, to get into your dorm…. It’s great for us to develop the product and fine tune it in a controlled setting.”
Lauren Hartman, a junior communication design major and cashier at the Exchange, said, “There have been mixed responses to PayTango; most of them have been positive. A lot of people think it’s really cool, other people have been more cynical, thinking, ‘Oh, it’s kind of big brother-ish.’ It’s the control of it, that other people might have access to their information, how safe is it to actually use.”
The PayTango team is working to address and counter student concerns. 
They are also planning to branch into other universities and venues such as gyms, restaurants, and convenience stores.
Lau-Kee is the only PayTango founder still taking classes at the Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh campus. She, as well as Groudan, Patel, and Reyes, plan to continue their development of PayTango post-graduation.
“Our plans are pretty much to run with this as far as we can go. The great thing is, we’re so young. We don’t have as much at stake as if, say, we were 30 years old. Over the summer we’re going to go out to the Valley and develop this even further,” Lau-Kee said.

In an email to the entire campus community sent last Friday, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno announced that the university is investigating allegations regarding the filming and circulation of sexually explicit photos and videos in the university’s chapter of the national Beta Theta Pi fraternity. The university is also investigating whether these alleged videos and pictures will constitute a violation of the university’s community standards or the law. Pending the outcome of the investigation, both the university and the fraternity’s national chapter have suspended the university’s chapter, colloquially referred to by students as “Beta.”
According to Casalegno, University Police initiated the ongoing investigation after an anonymous student raised concerns about “alleged videos and pictures of a sexual nature being taken inside the chapter facility of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by certain members of the organization and shared by email with other members [of the fraternity].”
In a press release on the school’s website, the university stated, “CMU’s top priority is the safety, security, and well-being of our community. Carnegie Mellon does not condone nor tolerate violations of university community standards or the law.” The university states that it will pursue internal disciplinary actions against the fraternity and its members if they are found to have violated the university’s community standards. The university also intends to refer any evidence of criminal wrongdoing to law enforcement officials.
The university has not yet elaborated on the exact nature of any alleged community standards violations or legal infractions. Rather, Casalegno emphasized, “The investigation is ongoing, and we do not yet know the circumstances of the capturing or the sharing of images or precisely what violations of University policy or the law may have taken place.”
Nevertheless, in an email following Casalegno’s announcement, Jared Cohon, Carnegie Mellon President, expressed that he was “shocked and deeply disappointed when [he] learned about these allegations.” He further stated, “These alleged activities are wholly inconsistent with our values and will not be tolerated.”
Casalegno’s announcement does not come as news to some students. Prior to Casalegno’s email on Friday, senior industrial design major Maureen Griswold posted, “If you don’t know what this is referring to, women were raped at Beta and evidence was found supporting it,” in response to an anonymous post on the CMU Confessions Facebook page about the suspension of the fraternity.
On the anonymous fraternity and sorority rating site greekrank.com, a user by the name of “Shame” posted on March 26, saying that Beta should “expect criminal allegations along the lines of sexual assault, and possibly distributing sexual content involving a minor.”
Casalegno, in an email to the student body, urged “anyone with related concerns or questions to speak to [her] or to University Police directly.” 
“The concern raised and the focus of our investigation is on the taking and sharing of images. We will be reaching out to anyone whom we believe may have any information that would be relevant to this investigation. And, important to note, that if ever anyone has information about this matter or more serious issues related to this investigation or otherwise, I urge him or her to come forward,” Casalegno added.
Neither the national Beta Theta Pi fraternity nor Carnegie Mellon’s local chapter could be reached for comment.

Arts pass program
After a presentation from a member of the Student Activities office, the Senate discussed and voted upon funding for the Arts Pass program. Student Activities is now in its second year of collecting data on use of the Arts Pass program, and encouraged Student Senate to continue its funding. Student Senate voted to fund the Arts Pass program for $18,000.
Elections Board bylaw changes
Student Body President Will Weiner addressed the Senate regarding proposed changes to the student body election bylaws. 
The changes proposed ensure that students running for student body president officially have a vice presidential candidate on their ticket; and that campaign spending is limited to $500, with the maximum value of an item that can be given to an individual being $25. 
Additionally, the value of items used in a campaign are also counted against this $500 total, so that individuals with special connections on the pricing of items do not gain an unfair advantage.
Table sharing proposal 
As part of an initiative designed to address overcrowding in spaces such as the University Center and Tazza D’Oro, Student Senate installed signs that can be placed on a table that occupants are willing to share with someone else. This program is designed to maximize seating and avoid situations in which large tables are occupied by only one person each.
Chair report
The Chair Report to the Student Senate addressed meetings held with business owners on Craig Street. There is a proposed Town Hall meeting, to be held with businesses on Craig Street, to address Carnegie Mellon’s changing culture and the possibilities for incorporating Craig Street as a social area for the Carnegie Mellon community.
Communications
As part of the Senate With You outreach event, there are plans to erect a large advertising balloon on campus April 8–10, and for students to sign the balloon with what their dreams are. The balloon will be inflated and left on the CFA lawn until final exams.

If I had a dollar for every internship opportunity that had everything I was looking for until the fine print of “unpaid, academic credit available” — why, I'd probably be able to afford to take the job.
As a professional writing and English double major, I have never had a paid internship. My work, in and out of school, has never been paid. When comparing summer plans with my peers — coming from a variety of majors, mostly in the technical fields — their reactions are always the same: “Don't take the job, then! Hold out for someone who'll pay you. Isn't that technically slave labor?” And, unsurprisingly, my answer is always the same: “There are no paid, fulfilling jobs for me to take, especially in this economy.”
I may be biased, but I believe the problem of unpaid internships exists almost entirely in humanities fields. I have never witnessed a computer scientist forced to choose between a fantastic, experience-boosting unpaid internship and a boring, unrelated internship that pays them well. But this scenario is something my friends in the humanities must deal with. Internships rarely allow humanities students to have it all.
That fine print in internship ads can be a death sentence, particularly for those not from affluent families. Money always comes first; you can't pay rent with all the “experience” you get from an unpaid internship.
It's unrealistic for companies to think that their interns will be diverse when so many candidates don't apply simply because they can't afford it. Even more insulting is when companies offer a minuscule stipend below minimum wage, thinking that it will put them morally ahead of those that don't pay at all.
However, my main problem with unpaid internships is how pervasive they are within the humanities. The field is already the butt of many jokes — especially at Carnegie Mellon — so why add more problems for its students to deal with? When it already feels like your major is being questioned 24 hours a day, not having a company validate your skills with a paycheck is depressing.
To illustrate, during my search for jobs post-graduation, I filled out a  [*careerbuilder.com*]((http://www.careerbuilder.com/) profile and signed up for email updates on jobs that matched my résumé and skill set.
The potential jobs I was matched up with? Office assistant, office manager, and secretary.
Out of hundreds of jobs on careerbuilder.com, the site couldn't find a single paying job that remotely matched my interests. Sure, the results might just lie with how the website’s algorithm works, but it’s insulting nonetheless. Meanwhile, when I widened my search to include internships, the world seemed to open up and I found plenty of unpaid opportunities waiting for me to take advantage of.
For me, the reasoning behind this situation seems to be simple. To companies, my skills are not worth paying for compared to those of my technically-minded peers. After all, the companies already believe they are going out of their way to so generously give me “experience”; how dare I ask for anything more?
To a degree, tech companies are able to pay interns because of how the economy currently works. But that does not excuse the historical precedent of the rampant unpaid internships for humanities students.
I spent the last four years honing my skills, trying to be a jack of all trades so I could become an irreplaceable asset who deserves to be paid. I can do more than just read and write — I can think critically, work in groups, lead teams, write persuasively using time-honored rhetorical techniques, evaluate what audiences want, translate complicated jargon into coherent and concise pieces, and use a plethora of software to create aesthetically pleasing designs, just to name a few of my skills.
These are the kinds of abilities that will help keep a company afloat — no matter its field. Successful companies balance both technical skills and communication skills.
But unpaid internships have become ingrained in society. Humanities students are willing to work for free because companies do not value their skills. And so, the vicious cycle began when students were grateful simply to land internships — no matter the cost — and companies realized how much they could get away with when hiring interns.
There is no clear solution to this issue. However, the solution will have to start with how society views the humanities and the value it places on the skills taught in the field.

Last week, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Proposition 8 bans gay marriage in California, while DOMA denies federal marriage benefits to those in same-sex marriages. Inspired by the Human Rights Campaign, an organization working for LGBTQ rights, many Facebook users changed their profile pictures to a pink equal sign against a red background in support of marriage equality.
While support for gay marriage is admirable, Internet activism doesn’t result in true change when it comes to controversial issues. If they want success, social media campaigns must focus on getting people out from behind their computer screens.
Currently, social media is unable to motivate users to create lasting change. According to Malcom Gladwell, a staffwriter for  The New Yorker, social media creates weak ties, “[which] seldom lead to high-risk activism.” Strong relationships promote action, but these connections are hard to build online.
While changing a picture or liking a campaign page on Facebook raises awareness of national and global issues, it does little to create tangible benefits for those in need. Gladwell notes that each of the 1,282,339 members of the Save Darfur Coalition’s Facebook page on average only donates $0.09. These contributions amount to a mere donation of approximately $115,410. 
This meager donation from well over 1 million people for a war-torn region shows that, while social media can garner support for a cause, it is unable to motivate people to take action.
Additionally, Michigan State University research assistant Jessica Vitak found in a study that the more intensely people use Facebook, the less likely they are to participate in other forms of political activism. While she found that they may be influenced by others’ posts, people are less likely to promote change in public the more they promote change from their own computer.
In order to promote real change through social media, campaigns need to reinvent how they advertise. Those hoping to promote change must do more than ask others to like their photo on Facebook or share their link, which only raises awareness. While awareness is valuable to any campaign, people aiming to promote change should focus on tangible ways that people can help outside the realm of social media. Their descriptions of issues should not focus on sharing or liking a post. Instead, leaders of a cause should include ways in which people can publicly address an issue in their community or nation.
The Supreme Court may rule that legislation like DOMA and Proposition 8 are unconstitutional, but these decisions won't be made because of changed profile pictures. They will be influenced by the testimonies of those brave enough to present their cases and those who leave their computer screens to protest in public.

Unless you don’t use Facebook, or you have been living under a rock for the past week, you have probably seen in your news feed that many profile pictures are now equal signs.
Internet social activism is a growing trend that you can advocate with the press of a button — and it keeps hitting social media users with different campaigns. The most recent one before the current campaign for marriage equality was Kony 2012.
Obviously, there are many criticisms to this kind of activism, the most germane being that it doesn’t do anything to further a cause. Liking a Facebook post and changing your profile picture does not help the Supreme Court decide anything in the coming months, just as changing your profile picture to feature Kony last April did not end up really helping the people of Uganda.
But the silver lining to this — the good side to what is almost affectionately called slacktivism, a combination of  “slacker” and “activism”, — is that it gets the word out.
Internet activism makes people aware of issues and can inform others about the issue. People who had no idea about Kony but were truly interested could do research and help provide the Ugandans with supplies they needed. On the other hand, even if those people did not end up giving to the cause, at least they were educated about the issue from seeing the mass of changed profile pictures.
Regarding marriage equality, the changed profile pictures, the Human Rights Campaign’s logo, creates kinship against the wave of opposition to the repeals of Proposition 8 and DOMA. While there are issues of making the campaign an “Allies” fight as opposed to LGBTQ individuals addressing their own conflict, seeing the mass of equal signs would surely comfort someone struggling with his or her sexual identity.
Research also shows that slacktivists are not necessarily slackers. A 2010 survey by TNS Global suggests Internet slacktivists are just as likely to donate their money to a cause as non-slacktivists, and even twice as likely to volunteer. They are also more likely to recruit people to a cause, request donations, and sign petitions that end up changing politicians’ positions. The bottom line is that people’s activities are not defined by their online activity.
Even if it might not be the best way to help win any legal or financial battles, slacktivism can be a key to garnering support and promoting discussions of controversial issues.
This type of activism helps fight the social battles — and win them.

Proposition 8, California’s ban on gay marriage, and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which prevents same sex marriages from being recognized at the Federal level, went before the Supreme Court last week. The court has several options regarding these two laws, but it should dismiss the Proposition 8 case on procedural grounds and overturn DOMA in the name of states’ rights.
Potential rulings on Proposition 8 could be wide and varied. It could strike the amendment for just California because the California Supreme Court ruled a gay marriage ban unconstitutional. This decision would be considered a narrow ruling. The court could also say that any state ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional and strike it down for the country, similar to Roe v. Wade. This would be considered a broad ruling. Additionally, the court could dismiss the Proposition 8 case altogether, saying that to continue a lawsuit, you must have been harmed in some way, and the supporters of Proposition 8 have not been harmed by gay marriage. The court could also declare that civil unions and marriage are the same thing, which would have very unclear implications.
If the court takes a broad ruling, it would give the Federal government police power — the power to regulate people, not as consumers, income-earners, or smokers, but as human beings living, breathing, and trying to get married. This power is reserved for the states.
If the court takes a narrow ruling, it would respect states rights and police power, but only overturn California’s gay marriage ban. But there is no need to. The court should not only respect states rights and police power, but also preserve everyone’s freedom to marry by dismissing the case on the grounds that those suing have no reason to be in court.
In all seriousness, if someone’s gay neighbors get married, he or she is no worse off. Gay people already live together. It really doesn’t affect anyone else if they’re granted the legal rights of marriage.
When someone sues the Federal government, it’s because he or she was hurt or otherwise damaged. When the gay couples suing the government won their case in California court, the damages done to them were repaired. They were allowed to marry. They didn’t appeal the case. The case is in Federal court now because the supporters of Proposition 8 continued the case. They have no right to be in court because they were not damaged.
If the case is dismissed, then gay marriage remains a state decision — as it should be — and gay couples in California get to marry. More importantly, this decision legally recognizes that gay marriage has no negative externalities, and nicely slaps the faces of Proposition 8 supporters by telling them that their position is so invalid that the court won’t consider their arguments.
The DOMA case is simpler. Gay marriage is a state issue. Conservative justices must limit Federal power by saying that the Federal government can't invalidate state police power in recognizing marriages. I believe that the liberal justices will cast four votes for overturning DOMA and Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy will join them on the grounds of Federalism.
Interestingly enough, Section 2 of DOMA isn’t being challenged. This section says that states don’t have to recognize gay marriages made in other states. This flagrantly violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution (Article IV, Section 1), which states that laws made in one state have to be respected in another. Why this isn’t being challenged in court is a mystery — it’d be a very quick way to repeal DOMA.
The court is likely to overturn DOMA and to at least recognize gay couples’ rights to marry in California by taking either a narrow ruling or dismissing the case altogether. Either way, it’s a win for gay marriage and a win for limited government and states’ rights.

My preparation for the interview to study abroad seemed perfect. The opportunity to leave RWTH Aachen University, Germany for Carnegie Mellon sounded like the opportunity to travel to a better place.
When I found myself being assessed on my capacity to represent my home university abroad, I displayed my enthusiasm for Carnegie Mellon, a place I read about in Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture. There was, however, one question that I had not seen coming:
“As an ambassador for our university, what is it that you would tell an American in order to make him come here for a year?”
At the time, Carnegie Mellon seemed to be an escape from a place whose strengths I did not yet recognize. There are several flaws of my university and the approach it takes to educating future engineers.
With four to five courses each semester, the workload in Germany  — particularly having problem set after problem set thrown at me — was frustrating. Instead of fostering interests in a specific subject, the weekly workload made it impossible to further research a topic presented in class. My expectations of a scholarly life full of captivating insights were not met. Quite the opposite, at no point did the university appear to care about its students, with the most difficult subjects like thermodynamics yielding 40 percent fail rates. Achieving a C+ or B- on an exam was often considered an above-average performance.
I also did not see myself thriving in an environment with large class sizes and little space to study, both due to funding. Even though RWTH Aachen is funded more adequately than any other university in Germany, according to Financial Times Duetschland, our “first-year experience” in engineering is sitting in a gigantic lecture hall with over 1,000 students. During my first year, I had trouble coping with the fact that I seemed to have turned from an individual into a mere number. I could not help but feel that my institution would not notice if I dropped out.
Finding study locations during the most intense periods of the semester became an art itself. A long queue of students waiting outside the library at 8 a.m. was a common observation.
This lack of funding hurt the undergraduate experience, as it made individual lab experiences impossible and it impinged on lectures. Malfunctioning microphones in the lecture halls of Germany’s top technical university are expected. Despite the university officials’ promise to make lecture hall equipment reflect the high standards of RWTH, the implementation of these changes are slow. If installing a new microphone is economically unfeasible, how can one even hope for a more practical lab experience that utilizes expensive equipment?
Professors also often have limited availability. The conversations I have had with professors always inspired me — reason enough to fantasize about how great close collaboration between students and professors would be. While teaching assistants were available to speak multiple times a week, professors were not often available because they rarely have set office hours. One of the reasons for that is the role of professors at a lot of German universities. Rather than being heavily involved in research themselves, professors act as managers who define the pathway that research in their department should take. Therefore, their connection to undergraduate students is often limited to the lectures that they give.
Because of these aspects, Carnegie Mellon embodied the “Promised Land” in terms of education. I dreamed of small classrooms, fair grading, and problem sets that taught meaningful material. In America, there would be professors with regular office hours, available computer clusters, and grades that reflected the work put into courses.
My hope was that combining experiences from German and U.S. universities would help students become better engineers.
While my experiences at Carnegie Mellon have allowed me to realize my home education system’s flaws, they have also allowed me to identify its strengths, which I will talk about in my next article.
This article is the first in a series of articles detailing the realizations of an exchange student studying at Carnegie Mellon.

Activists protesting organ harvesting in China, as well as activists from the Human Rights Campaign, have begun regularly appearing on campus this past week.
In particular, the issue of alleged organ harvesting in China is both incredibly important to discuss and deeply complex. 
However, perhaps the methods activists are employing to bring attention to this issue could be re-evaluated.
One of the activists’ most common locations is the main entrance to campus — the first step on the stairs facing Forbes Avenue. This position requires most students to pass them on the way to class. 
While this minor inconvenience is not a huge issue, it discourages students from being receptive or active listeners. If a student is running late to class, stopping to talk to a person with a flyer can seem trivial and irrelevant.
The other major problem with the activists’ campaign is the actual content of their flyers. The content borders on sensationalism in its attempt to raise awareness. For example, the front page of the organ harvesting protesters’ handout depicts a little girl in the rain holding a sign that reads “Killed for their belief.”
Furthermore, the content of the flyer — specifically the explanation of Falun Gong — serves as an attempt to sway religious beliefs.
Page six of the packet has an in-depth description of the faith, as well as several charts depicting health benefits for practitioners, as “many people just like you take up the practice of Falun Gong and experience health benefits.” This attempt at conversion is so obviously partisan that it detracts from the overall issue at hand.
Public activism always has its issues — people are often too busy to connect with activists, even for extremely important causes. Because of these difficulties, organizations choosing to promote their causes on campus must strike a balance between enthusiasm for their cause and respect for the busy schedules and various beliefs of students who pass them on their way to classes.

In 2011, Spring Carnival Committee erected a tent known as Midway Market on Carnival’s Midway in Morewood parking lot. As part of a two-year experiment, Midway Market served as a location where organizations without booths could interact with students, alumni, and other guests.
However, Midway Market will be absent from this year’s Carnival celebration.
While the Midway Market tent lacks the flair of the booths, an option for promotion should be made available to smaller organizations that are unable to participate in booth building.
Spring Carnival embraces every aspect of Carnegie Mellon’s unique campus culture, and the event must continue to represent every part of this culture by remaining inclusive to all parties involved. While most large organizations on campus — particularly Greek chapters — have the manpower and resources to build booths, smaller organizations are unable to do so, largely due to the limited membership. Midway Market provides a way for smaller organizations to promote themselves during Carnegie Mellon’s annual celebration.
Spring Carnival is also a celebration of students’ accomplishments. From booth to buggy to Mobot, Carnival has always been a way for students to show off to those both within and outside the campus community. This opportunity must remain extended to all organizations and individuals hoping to show off their accomplishments.
The Spring Carnival Committee must work with organizations to create an alternative resource or location for the Midway Market tent. Although Spring Carnival Committee deemed Midway Market a two-year experiment, the committee should make an efforts to reach out to organizations affected by the loss of their Carnival venue.
The committee has made clear efforts in the past to represent all organizations, as is apparent by their decision to create Midway Market in the first place.
While these efforts are commendable, it is imperative that they are continued, not abandoned, in the coming years.

This year’s student body election for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) features a 100 percent increase in candidates: from one to two.
In the last election, senior lighting design major Jon Mark ran unopposed, and while he has done a commendable job as the SBVPF, it is clearly in the campus’ best interest that more than one or two candidates run for these important student body positions.
As the official student government website describes, the student body vice president for finance is “the financial representative for the entire undergraduate and graduate student population at Carnegie Mellon.” The SBVPF has extremely important duties that dictate the operation of many crucial student organizations and activities —  duties that are too important for a candidate to win by default. This apathy toward crucial student positions also applies to more than just the student body vice president for finance; the competition for student body president is just two tickets this year.
The key to fixing this problem lies with discernible incentives. The heads of student organizations put an extraordinary amount of time to ensure that our campus functions as it should, and this monumental time commitment likely deters many potential candidates.
A system of incentives could attract qualified and dedicated candidates to help run our campus organizations and government, and keep our campus community performing at its best. 
While options for incentives are plentiful, one incentive could be payment for serving in positions of leadership. After all, the SBVPF’s assistant is paid while the SBVPF goes unpaid. Payment could motivate students currently compensated for a position to move to higher positions that are currently unpaid.
Another incentive could be units. After all, many of the skills that students learn through leadership positions are also taught in the classroom, including handling finances, drafting proposals, and presenting plans of action to others on campus.
Many qualified candidates hesitate to run for important positions around campus, due to the time commitment of the job.
A system of incentives alone would not remedy this problem, but it could help motivate many of these individuals to take a greater role in our campus community, and reward those who are already devoting a great deal of their time toward campus activities.
