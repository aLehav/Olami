It was an all-around rough weekend for the Tartan basketball teams, going a combined 1—3 in their two doubleheaders against Emory University on Friday night and University of Rochester Sunday afternoon.
“In a nonconference game, we have more confidence and we play a lot better,” said first-year shooting guard Sade Idera. “During the University Athletic Association [UAA] games, the fact that we play conferences teams makes people nervous and that really changes the way that we play. We need to get back to the way we play nonconference games.”
The women’s team has a much better record in nonconference games than UAA games. Idera said that the team is challenged in UAA games because of the players they face: “You know that the person on the other team is just as good and works just as hard as you,” Idera said. “But you have to remember that you need to win because you’ve worked so hard for it. Sometimes, players don’t remember that and that’s what causes us to mess up.”
Both UAA games for the Carnegie Mellon women started with first half leads. Against Emory, the Tartans took the lead with senior guard Jacquie Shaw giving them a quick 6—2 lead. Carnegie Mellon was dominant inside, collecting several offensive rebounds in the first few minutes. First-year forward-center Lisa Murphy was destroying Emory in the paint, recording a double-double and leading the team with 28 points and 13 rebounds.
The Tartans took a slim one point lead into halftime given by sophomore guard Lindsay Poss’s two free throws with just under a minute remaining. Through the first nine minutes of the second half the teams remained close, alternating leads and ties.
Slowly Emory established a small lead based on several Tartan turnovers forced by the Eagles’ quick hands, recording a steal for each of their turnovers, and a bombardment of three-pointers. Down the stretch, Emory made its free throws and put the game away, cruising to a 87—76 win.
Sunday was a different story against Rochester, but the same ending for the women. Starting off slow, the Tartans didn’t grab a lead until junior guard Chandler Caufield hit a three pointer with just under 10 minutes remaining in the half.
From there, Carnegie Mellon took control grabbing a nine-point lead at half time, and stretching out to a 42—28 advantage just over two minutes into the second half. The Yellowjackets came back strong, eventually tying the score at 49.
“We started off really well, but we just didn’t finish the game well,” Idera said. “We began with so much energy, and it just dwindled as the game went on. If we had kept up our energy, I think we would’ve won.”
Shaw gave the Tartans the lead again late in the half, but Rochester took the lead for good with just of three minutes to play. Unlike Emory, the Yellowjackets missed several free throws down the stretch to give the Tartans a chance, but they were just unable to convert.
“It takes a lot of concentration and a lot of great leadership. We have all of those things, it’s just a matter of making sure that we know how to use them,” Idera said.
After the game Shaw said, “While this season has been tough, we are building a strong foundation for us to build on going into next year.”
Idera agreed, saying that for the Carnegie Mellon men, it was the tale of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde between Friday and Sunday. Against Emory, the Tartans started off slow, falling behind by double digits with less than eight minutes to go in the half, but quickly tied it back up with four straight three pointers by first-year guard Matt Hillman, senior guard Asad Meghani, and junior guard Seth Cordts.
It still took another two minutes for Carnegie Mellon to take its first lead of the game on another Meghani three-pointer. Emory retook the lead with under a minute left, but a jump shot by Hillman with just over 30 seconds to play gave the Tartans a 44—43 lead at half.
The Tartans kept it close to open the second half before the Eagles began to pull away. Emory had their largest lead at 16 points with four minutes to play, but Carnegie Mellon had one last burst to try and win.
Going a 9—0 run, the Tartans cut the lead to seven, but the Eagles killed their momentum.
Overall, the Tartans kept trying to fight back, but a blistering 50.7 percent shooting from Emory for the game was too much to handle as Carnegie Mellon fell 100—86.
On Sunday, the Tartans made their presence known early and often. Senior guard-forward Christian Manoli scored the team’s first five points, giving them a 5—2 lead they would never relinquish.
First-year forward Jack Serbin pushed out the lead with a set of three-pointers, giving Carnegie Mellon a 10-point lead.
Rochester got back to within five with just under seven minutes to go in the half, but 10 quick Tartan points, including two three-pointers by senior guard Rashaun Riley pushed the lead back to 11.
In the second half, the Yellowjackets pulled within seven points with under two minutes to play. They repeatedly fouled senior guard-forward Sean Brophy in an attempt to make a comeback. Brophy went 3—6 at the line, but his stifling defense helped keep the game out of reach for Rochester.
Aside from that slight scare at the end, the Tartans cruised to a relatively easy 73—62 win behind 19 points from Cordts to lead the team. Serbin finished with a double-double while leading the team with 11 rebounds.
For the season, both men’s and women’s teams are 11—11, with the women 2—9 in UAA games, compared to the men’s 4—7 conference record.

Returning from Emory University at the end of the weekend, the Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams were anticipating NCAA-qualifying cut times in nine events at the University Athletic Association Swimming and Diving Championships.
Bad weather in Atlanta this week forced some unusual scheduling changes and delayed the final results. The three-day championship meet, which was supposed to have begun on Wednesday, was shortened to a two-day meet running Friday and Saturday. Three teams that could not make it to Atlanta — Case Western Reserve University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Rochester — competed instead Saturday and Sunday at a satellite event at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland.
Carnegie Mellon’s teams joined the Atlanta event with Brandeis University, Emory University, New York University, and Washington University in St. Louis.
The following Tartan swimmers recorded provisional cut times: first-year Gillian Crews, sophomore Alex Dintino, sophomore Philip Farr, first-year Dustin Ferzacca, first-year Amanda Kuhn, junior Josh Lucheon, senior Soleil Phan, senior Eddie Sears, sophomore Carter Sharer, sophomore Kira Singhaus, and sophomore Felicia Wang.
Final UAA Championships results are expected to be available today, after times and standings from the two separate events can be merged.  Qualifying swimmers will compete in the NCAA Division III Championships March 19–22.

Last Sunday, recent University of Missouri graduate Michael Sam openly admitted he was gay. Sam hadn’t really tried to hide his sexuality, coming out to many of his close friends last August. They had respected his privacy and let Sam come out in his own time.
Stories similar to Sam’s are happening all across the nation, as individuals gain the confidence to fully admit their sexuality and gender 
preferences. 
Given the rising acceptance of the LGBTQ community, these moments, while incredibly meaningful to the individual, barely make a ripple for society as a whole. 
But one thing makes Sam’s story different. Sam is a prospect for the NFL.
Sam played defensive end for the Missouri Tigers until his graduation in December 2013. Before his coming-out announcement, he was projected to be a third- to fifth-round draft pick after being named top SEC Defensive Player of the Year and an All-American for his senior season with the Tigers. 
Now Sam is the owner of a more lofty title — the first openly gay NFL prospect and, assuming he isn’t completely shut out, the first openly gay NFL player. 
Sam’s announcement took the media by storm, taking over sports coverage for the NFL in what was supposed to be one of its few media dead periods of the year.
Much of the discussion surrounded the idea that many teams would not draft Sam because of his sexuality, and the media circus that would surround the controversy.
Longtime NFL reporter Peter King interviewed four NFL front-office members anonymously to try and get a non-sugar-coated version of their thoughts for his website, The MMQB with Peter King. One of the general managers, when asked explicitly if he though Sam would get drafted, said “No.” He believed that the impact on the locker room would be far too great for a middling talent like Sam. 
The very clear counter-argument to the manager’s argument is, why did the Tigers — with Sam openly coming out to the team before the start of this season — have debatably their best year in school history? 
I’m not saying there might not be some rough patches in the NFL, but I find it comical to believe a team will have its entire season derailed because of one openly gay teammate in the locker room. 
The real story here is the fact that there is a story. Sports is unequivocally tied to society, although previously it was seen as progressive. 
The integration of baseball with Jackie Robinson back in 1947 is pointed to as one of the defining moments in the march to civil rights. But here we are, in 2014: New states are ratifying gay marriage and rights, and the Supreme Court overturned Proposition 8 to further push the LGBTQ community to equal rights and status. Meanwhile, the NFL — and sports in general — is holding us back.
I would like to think we have come far enough as a society for the sexual preferences of a sports figure to not define our level of acceptance as a community. Professional sports is supposedly one of the last arenas where success is based solely on talent, skill, and merit. 
The NFL has shown an amazing ability to overlook a player’s past if he can still contribute on the field. 
Michael Vick was welcomed back to the league with open arms after spending time in jail for dog fighting charges because he could still fool defenders with both his arm and his legs. Baltimore Ravens’ great Ray Lewis was celebrated by his team even after he was implicated in murder charges at the start of his career following Baltimore’s Super Bowl win back in 2001. 
The fact that Sam — or his counterpart in the NBA, previous Washington Wizards center Jason Collins — might not get to play the sport he has dedicated his life to just because of who he chooses to love is abhorrent. Sam’s sexuality shouldn’t be a story, maybe a news blurb at most. Instead, hours of media coverage are being devoted to what should be a non-issue. 
Change is hard. Societal inertia is one of the most powerful forces we face as a community. But this level of coverage and discussion is completely unwarranted. 
Sam should be applauded for being the first, because he has chosen to challenge the system. He took the first step to making this a non-issue, but clearly the media and the NFL have shown us we have a long way to go.

In one of the most competitive Premier League seasons in recent memory, Liverpool made a season-defining statement last weekend with a 5—1 thrashing of league leaders Arsenal. Over recent seasons, Liverpool has been much maligned for its thin squad, mid-table talent, and inability to finish higher than Merseyside neighbors Everton, let alone in the top four. Even though Liverpool finished in seventh place last season, the team’s progress to fourth and potential title contenders is not as abrupt as it seems. This seamless transition to a top-level team must be credited to one man only — manager Brendan Rodgers.
Rodgers started out at as the youth team manager at Chelsea under then-manager Jose Mourinho, staying in that position under Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari. He moved on to coach Watford in the championship; after an impressive stint there, he attracted the attention of promotion hopefuls Reading. However, he was sacked from the club after a poor run of form and took over at Swansea City.
It was at Swansea City that he gained countrywide fame as he guided the Welsh club to their first ever promotion to the Premier League, finishing a solid 11th in his first full season in the top flight. Swansea City’s slick passing style was compared to the Spanish tiki-taka and won over neutrals. Top clubs were circling, and when Kenny Dalglish was sacked from Liverpool, Rodgers was chosen as the new manager.
He was handed a Liverpool team with Andy Carroll and Luis Suárez as the only reliable strikers, a barren midfield, and an underwhelming defense. Rodgers attempted to make some changes in the transfer market by bringing in familiar faces — striker Fabio Borini, who played under him at Chelsea and Swansea City, as well as Joe Allen, Swansea City’s standout midfielder from the previous season. Rodgers was also essential in the development of the club’s then 17-year-old talented winger, Raheem Sterling, who is now a regular in the side.
The first season under Rodgers was a disappointment, however; a lack of firepower meant Liverpool was slow out of the blocks and stuck in the lower end of the table for the majority of the first half of the season. The January signings of midfielder Philippe Coutinho and striker Daniel Sturridge reinvigorated Liverpool. The team finished in a respectable seventh position — an improvement over the previous season — and played some wonderful soccer in the second half of the season. The targets for the next season were to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and keep Suárez at the club.
It’s not the mere fact that Liverpool has kept up with its targets; it’s the way the team did it that is impressive. Carroll was sold in the summer, and forwards Iago Aspas and Luis Alberto were purchased to provide backup for Sturridge and Suárez. Underperforming winger Stewart Downing was sold to West Ham United, and Sterling was given a more prominent and regular role in the side. Club legend and defender Jaime Carragher, an important part of the first team, retired and new center backs Mamadou Sakho, Tiago Ilori, and Kolo Touré were brought in. The inconsistent goalkeeper Pepe Reina was loaned out to Napoli, with Simon Mignolet brought in to replace him. Fullback Aly Cissokho and forward Victor Moses were brought in on loan from Valencia and Chelsea, respectively, to provide much-needed squad depth.
Rodgers had identified his targets, done his business early, and made sure integral new players had a preseason to settle in. The Suárez transfer saga was handled admirably well, as Rodgers refused to sell his star man despite a bid of 40 million pounds ($67 million) from Arsenal. Suárez’s antics and damaging comments to the media about the club were taken seriously, and he was asked to train alone unless there was a public apology, a request to which Suárez obliged. It showed an impressive increase in maturity from a manager who two years earlier was staving off relegation from the Championship. Rodgers had clearly rectified his previous mistakes and learned from them.
Injuries have also not ravaged the squad this year like last season. Rodgers has seemingly always had a backup plan in case one of his men went down. Midfielder Jordan Henderson has finally emerged and is beginning to justify the hefty 20 million pounds ($33 million) paid for him. With a capable strike partner, Suárez has been on a tear this season and is currently the highest scorer in any of Europe’s top leagues this season. Together, Suárez and Sturridge have scored a combined 39 goals and are the league’s top two scorers. Liverpool’s offense has been phenomenal, with Coutinho and Sterling showing impressive form and midfielder Steven Gerrard showing no signs of aging. The club has scored 66 goals this season, only two behind league leader Manchester City. Rodgers has made Liverpool reach new heights in a style all his own.
However, what’s most striking about Rodgers this season is not his transfer acumen or his playing style: Rodgers’s tactical innovation has never been more apparent. With Suárez suspended and Coutinho injured early in the season, Rodgers was able to play a simple 4—3—3 with Sterling and Aspas on the wings led by Sturridge and Gerrard, defensive midfielder Lucas Leiva, and Henderson in midfield. The play was promising, but the offense was struggling. There was also the issue of providing five center backs enough playing time to judge them and their potential partnerships with only two places up for grabs. The return of Suárez and Coutinho caused more tactical conundrums in the forward positions.
The solution from Rodgers was unique and impressive. In response, Rodgers deployed a 3—4—1—2 formation with three center backs from the aforementioned three, center backs Martin Škrtel and Daniel Agger, a midfield of Gerrard and Lucas, two fullbacks doubling as wing backs, and Coutinho playing in the No. 10 role behind Suárez and Sturridge. 
The results were phenomenal, as Liverpool absolutely decimated opponents. Suárez had a goal-scoring streak of two or more goals for three consecutive games.
The system had its flaws, and Rodgers was quick to realize them. In a loss against Arsenal in November, the midfield duo was outnumbered and overrun, which resulted in Arsenal dominating possession and dictating the game. The 3—4—1—2 formation was abandoned, but the ideology behind it remained. To play Coutinho, Suárez, and Sturridge at the same time would require having energetic midfielders to cover more ground and make up for the lack of defensive pressure exerted by the trio. Forced by an injury to Lucas, Rodgers decided to revert to a 4—4—2 and play Gerrard and Henderson in the middle while playing Coutinho and Sterling on the flanks. This combination has proved to be admirably successful for Liverpool as their attack continues to rack up goals.
Liverpool’s defense remains a major liability, though that is mainly because of injuries and a lack of discipline at both fullback positions. The return of the injured players should provide the team a major defensive boost. In the 5—1 win over Arsenal, Liverpool’s lightning-fast attacks, using the pace of all the attackers, caused havoc in the opposition defense and led to four goals in the opening 20 minutes. It was the most exhilarating play by any team this season — the result of well-rehearsed set pieces and team play.
It’s a testament to Rodgers’s ability as a manager that Liverpool has still won all of them and is now only four points off the top of the table.
Rodgers has displayed great tactical awareness, a deep transfer insight, and exemplary man management in his short career. He has also developed a sort of resilience in this Liverpool team that champions tend to have; the club recently came back from behind twice in a game at Fulham to score a goal in the 90th minute and win 3—2.
His team is adventurous, fearless and raring to go against any team in the league. Liverpool is on the rise again, and it has the Rodgers stamp all over it.

As recently as November, Oklahoma State Cowboys guard Marcus Smart was the king of college basketball. As one of the few who denied the allure of the NBA to come back and play more college basketball, Smart was a sure-fire top-three pick at the end of last season, but he decided to stay in college for a number of reasons.
In an era where NBA players are only required to attend one year of college, stars staying multiple years is a rarity. The money and glamour the NBA provides is often enough to get many players to leave after just one year, especially a player with Smart’s talent.
At the beginning of the year, Smart played excellently, surpassing the hype surrounding incoming first-years like Kansas Jayhawks forward Andrew Wiggins and Duke Blue Devils forward Jabari Parker. There was talk that the player who decided to stay an extra year in college could go first in the draft.
As the season progressed, however, and as college coaches did everything they could to stop Smart, they slowed his play. He turned from an unknown quantity with no ceiling to a player of measurable talent.
This quantity is not an indictment of the level of basketball he plays. A known quantity, however, always seems less valuable than the shiny new stars no one really knows much about. Smart has struggled lately as the season comes to a close, and the player who was a potential top-three pick a season ago has been in danger of falling outside of the top 10.
Now he’s in danger of falling out of the first round.
​Smart just received a three-game suspension for shoving Texas Tech fan Jeff Orr as a game drew to a close. Two different versions of the story exist. Orr claims he called Smart a “piece of crap.” Smart claims Orr uttered a racial slur.
The truth is probably somewhere in between, but no one seems to care. Many writers have come down hard on Smart, saying the suspension is not enough. Some even say he should be banned from the NCAA or forbidden from entering the NBA draft. He has been painted as a picture of the entitlement of college basketball players and young athletes in general.
These people are missing the point. What we do know is that someone said something unsavory to Smart, who then got frustrated and pushed the fan. There are two people involved in this story, and most people have been focusing on the wrong one.
​I’m not going to go into detail on Smart’s life story because it’s not my story to tell. What I do know about Smart is that he’s 19. I’m also 19. I get frustrated and yell when I play pick-up games in Wiegand Gymnasium. I can’t tell how well I would restrain myself if my future depended on every one of these games.
To put this situation into context, a 50-year-old man cursed or — if one were to believe Smart’s version of the story — directed much worse language at Smart. The general consensus has somehow been that Smart did something horrible and deserves punishment. Smart shoving a fan looks bad for the game, and a small suspension seems about right, but why is the focus on Smart? The absolute lack of maturity shown by a 50-year-old man is a much worse transgression than a fit of anger from a 19-year-old. There needs to be some recourse against someone who decides it is okay to walk into an arena where college students are competing in an extracurricular activity and utter a racial slur. Many reports have said Orr told Smart to “go back to Africa,” a sentence far more harmful than any shove. Language like that simply cannot be tolerated, and those who react should not be scapegoated.
To Orr’s credit, he has “suspended” himself for the remainder of the season by saying that he will not go to any more Texas Tech games. However, something should be done about crowd conduct near the court. Racist language near the court has been an issue in basketball in the past, and jawing between players and fans is a common occurrence. If athletes — especially college athletes — are held to such high standards of professionalism, fans should be too. Ejections should be immediate if officials hear discriminatory language based on someone’s race, sexual orientation, or other aspects of their identity. 
Smart shoving Orr should not be seen as a product of the entitlement and selfishness of young athletes. It should show that athletes are humans, ones who go through the same emotional trials and tribulations as everyone else as they grow. 
The added pressure of being nationally visible just adds another obstacle, and people should be more understanding of incidents like this one. If Orr was hurt, I could understand the backlash. But the shove was benign: No one was injured. Much of the backlash feels like it has a racist undertone, and there needs to be far more acceptance and sympathy shown in similar situations.

Recent studies shockingly show that only about 54 percent of physician diagnoses are usually correct, according to Sameer Badlani, chief medical information officer for the University of Chicago department of medicine. 
Those involved in the healthcare industry find this fact unacceptable and hope to use technology to revolutionize patient care. 
However, William Bria — the chief medical information officer of the Shriners Hospital for Children — stated that this time of innovation is also a time of disruption. To tackle many of the challenges of incorporating technology into a scrambled healthcare system, Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College and Tepper School of Business hosted the 3rd Annual Innovation in Healthcare Technology Conference on Friday.
The conference was not just for health professionals — it brought together individuals from many different fields of study, including business and information technologies. The venue, the Omni William Penn Hotel in Downtown, provided a professional atmosphere for important discussions regarding the future of healthcare in our country.
Bria, the conference’s keynote speaker, emphasized that American healthcare was built on the intimate doctor-patient relationship. In the past few years, different health systems around the country have tried incorporating technology, which has led to a fragmented system that has lost some of the genuineness of the relationship that originally brought the United States to its place as the world’s leader in healthcare. 
He pointed out symptoms of the challenge of incorporating technology in medicine. Through discussions among leaders in the industry, he hopes to promote innovative solutions to the multitude of problems in medicine, as well as to integrate advances in technology into the field while maintaining that the “heart of the doctor remains the soul of medicine.”
The conference highlighted Carnegie Mellon’s well-known interdisciplinary atmosphere by featuring a poster session that included students and faculty from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College, and the Mellon College of Science.
Joseph Samosky, director of the Simulation and Medical Technology R&D Center at the University of Pittsburgh, showed a live demonstration of the BodyExplorer, a simulation of medical procedures involving a mannequin with embedded sensors and a projector displaying human anatomy on the mannequin.
The project can be used to improve training by allowing medical students to practice performing procedures while providing immediate results of their mistakes through realistic alarms and patient responses.
Carnegie Mellon department of biological sciences research biologist Cheryl Telmer was in attendance to highlight the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team’s project, which embodies the interdisciplinary nature of projects on campus by bringing together undergraduate engineers, computer scientists, and biologists to work on a unique project. She shared her passion for the project, which addressed the problem of antibiotic resistance with phage therapy, saying that “every project is an invention” and that she found the conference to be the perfect place to showcase her students’ hard work.Throughout the day, multiple panels of experts in a variety of fields from the technological and pharmaceutical industries, as well as distinguished physicians, held interactive forums tackling some of the biggest challenges facing technology and healthcare.
Discussions involved the rise of social medicine by creating patient and doctor online communities where patients can become more empowered by sharing their experiences, and doctors can collaborate to correctly diagnose patients. The idea was that health and medicine could only improve through the collaboration of individuals, rather than through the efforts of individuals alone.
The recent National Security Agency (NSA) scandal has brought to light many issues involving the legality of collecting large amounts of data regarding patient care. What types of information should be allowed to be acquired? Who is responsible for the security of the data?
Modern technological advances like smart watches are pushing people toward an age where one can monitor a wide variety of bodily functions and natural patterns of stress and sleep. In some cases, patients can be monitored by sensors at all times while at home. If the data shows a medical issue while the patient is at home and no action is taken, who should be liable for the failure to act? Unfortunately, physicians are scared of implementing this revolutionary technology because they fear possible litigation from lawyers who attack those with larger pockets.
Badlani, who was a panelist at the conference, believes that the gold mine lies “in developing statistical and analytical techniques to detect signals in the data that action needs to be taken to ensure that people receive the appropriate care in a timely manner.”
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated 23andMe, a genetic testing company, preventing them from releasing genetic test results that could examine DNA and reveal information like a 5 percent increased risk of Alzheimer’s Disease. All the physicians in the panel fully supported the FDA ruling and agreed that genetic testing will lead to revolutions in healthcare, but that it is too early to allow this testing without fully understanding how genes can be influenced by the environment.
To close, Heinz College Dean Ramayya Krishnan shared his vision for calculating risk in healthcare by using statistics to improve patient care, as well as for making risk and cost comparisons. These panelists hope that these ideas and discussions will enable leaders in healthcare to incorporate technology that improves the system for the American people.

Nature at the molecular level can be described as having beautiful complexity. In the fabric of space and time, molecules come together to form structures and chemical interactions that are fundamental for life. Understanding and recreating this complexity has baffled scientists for decades. To tackle this problem, a team at Carnegie Mellon University has created EteRNA, a computer game that enables players around the world to construct novel and robust RNA sequences that could potentially be utilized in biological experiments.
RNA is a mysterious molecule, and has more secrets than its better known counterpart, DNA. Unlike DNA, which has a rigid double helix structure, RNA can be very variable in shape and size. It has the ability to store information in its bases, as well as to fold into specific shapes that allow it to carry out a multitude of functions at the molecular level. This variability can make it very complicated for scientists to simulate and mimic nature’s complicated RNA designs.
EteRNA, which launched in January 2011, is an online computer game that aims to build new sequences of RNA. Developed by a team of students and faculty at Carnegie Mellon and led by professor of computer science and robotics Adrien Treuille and doctoral student in computer science Jeehyung Lee, EteRNA has come to life with a current community of over 130,000 members.
Lee explained that the RNA design problem is “not just computationally hard,” but that “the simulation model is incomplete and there is just no current way to simulate RNA design.” Before EteRNA, RNA design had been left to researchers repeatedly trying various designs in the lab.
Certain sequences are more robust or stable at the molecular level. The challenge lies in determining what guidelines or rules can be followed to contribute to this stability while also performing the desired function.
In the game, players start with a basic foundation for an RNA molecule and then make a series of decisions and additions to build a molecule. Players can challenge each other to build more stable structures. When asked how much biological experience players needed to play EteRNA, Lee replied, “none.”
“Over 90 percent of our top players don’t have any previous biological background,” Lee said.
When the game first launched, Lee and Treullie recruited about 100–200 players. Lee shared that the players initially struggled with building good RNA designs. However, improvements in the game and players’ intuition lead to the design of robot RNAs. After it was discussed in The New York Times, the game gained over 30,000 members in the following month.
Lee exclaimed that they are actively “turning players into RNA scientists.” He added that players find the game to be “an entertaining environment and enjoyable experience.”
RNA sequences that are designed through the game are then sent to Dr. Rhiju Das, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Stanford University who builds these RNAs in the lab and preforms tests to determine their stability.
Initially, the project’s main goal was simply to build robust RNA molecules. Then the team increased their focus to figuring out what general design rules they could determine from stable RNA designs. Lee believes that, maybe one day in the distant future, we will be able to use these rules to create computer simulations that can create RNA structures. However, the ability to create these structures remains a challenge since it is hard to document all of a player’s decisions in creating these molecules.
The current goal is to evolve the project into an online community where RNA scientists from around the world can post their research problems and desired goals for a potential RNA. 
Then, if players deem the project worthy, they can work with the researcher to design RNAs that fit the requirements. The structures that players determine will actually be synthesized at Stanford University.
This type of collaboration can foster advancement in RNA research. RNA has potential medical implications where scientists can design RNAs to carry out specific function-altering molecular interactions that play important roles in disease.
Lee hopes that they will move from a 2-D to a 3-D interface to improve the user experience.

Hands and fingers are some of the most useful and complicated tools on the planet. But what can we learn from studying them? A great deal, according to Vincent Hayward, a professor at the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique and the Université Pierre et Marie Curie, both of which are located in Paris, France. Hayward presented a talk at Carnegie Mellon on Friday titled “How the mechanics of the fingertip impact the tactile and gripping function of the hand,” as part of the Robotics Institute lecture series.
Hayward’s work deals primarily with haptics, which he described as “the phenomenon of hand guidance by touch.” The scope of haptics technology can range from small molecules to macroscopic systems, the most familiar being touch screens. Hayward began his talk by introducing the complexities, mysteries, and abilities of human fingertips. He noted that fingertips have unique skin compared to other regions of the body and that this skin is connected to the bone by a network of collagen fibers — the main component of connective tissue. He also noted that the bottom of the skin is made of keratin, a tough structural tissue that is the primary material in skin, hair, and nails.
The mechanics behind fingers and hands are also especially interesting. A hand is able to have a very good grip by simply being there. Placed on a flat surface, the contact made by a finger is very close to a circle. Fingers also have the ability to stiffen, and are able to grab objects of different weight between five orders of magnitude — from a fine feather to a coarse heavy weight. All of these abilities make the finger a fascinating subject. In working with fingers, Hayward had multiple questions, the key question being: How does the hand discriminate between all these different surfaces? Hayward hopes to learn more about the interaction between fingers and surfaces to improve technologies which utilize tactile feedback.
Hayward mentioned many previous studies and experiments that dealt with understanding the mechanics of finger movement and texture perception. These experiments involved a participant placing their finger in a sort of groove. Researchers then applied different tactile surfaces, which forced the fingertip to attempt to measure what was happening on the surface. Overall, it was found that friction between the minuscule ridges of the finger and the surface played a great deal in perception of different textures.
Hayward looked at research regarding the contact between fingers and surfaces used in technology. He focused on the slipping that sometimes occurs when one is using a touch pad or screen. One of the main causes of slipping is the secretion from the relatively large number of sweat glands under fingertips. He also discussed how the sliding velocity of a fingertip will vary with different surface materials. When one moves a finger along a touch screen, the increase in secretion from the sweat glands changes the conformation of the finger ridges and results in a wider contact area between the finger and the surface, resulting in increased friction. This effect works the opposite way on a porous surface like paper, which will absorb fluid and decrease friction over long periods of contact. Consequently, contrary to what one might expect, the coefficient of friction between a fingertip and a surface will increase if that surface is smooth, like glass, and decrease if that surface is coarse, like paper.
Hayward ultimately hopes that further research into the precise mechanisms of touch will help develop better technology like pads, as well as robots. In his review article on the subject, “Finger pad friction and its role in grip and touch,” Hayward mentions the importance of touch technology in robotics and prosthetics. New materials that more closely mimic the real experience of human touch will ultimately lead to greatly enhanced functions.

23andMe — a privately held personal genomics company — has dominated the market for genetic testing since it began its direct-to-consumer DNA testing service in 2007. For $99, a consumer could send a sample of their saliva in for testing and receive an interpreted report of their sequenced genome, which includes information such as inherited traits, genealogy, and risk of congenital diseases. However, there has been some controversy over the ethics of the services that 23andMe and other direct-to-consumer testing companies offer. For example, 23andMe was close to being banned from producing this kind of testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last December. In its announcement, the FDA claimed that its concerns with the product rose from the questionable accuracy and interpretation of its genetic reports.
How accurate are these test results? ScienceNow reports that 23andMe provides customers with a 70–75 percent confidence that a gene in a result is present. As part of their genetic report, 23andMe also reports a confidence interval from the database of the J. Craig Venter Institute — a genomics research organization — on how accurately the gene is linked with a disease and another confidence interval on how likely it is that the gene will develop into a disease. A way to further verify these intervals is still under development. The accuracy of these tests is crucial because a false positive could cause an individual to seek treatment for a disease they do not have, while a false negative could cause a disease to go unnoticed.
Perhaps just as important as the accuracy of the tests is the way the resulting report is interpreted. Genetic test results are intended to be taken to a doctor after their release. When 23andMe first took off, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published their views on the up-and-coming industry, claiming that as of that day, doctors were not skilled in statistics, but would have to be in years to come. The NIH defended the premise as a market force on the training of medical professionals to learn more about statistics and data mining. Since then — seeing as nothing has been done to increase the statistical training received by doctors — a sheet of raw-data-style genetic tests could prove problematic for a patient who brings it to their doctor.
There is also a question of FDA jurisdiction. As the regulatory body, the FDA is automatically given permission to regulate any and all things deemed “healthcare” by the government. Officially, the NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF) should have dealt with 23andMe, but neither agency had the power to do anything as drastic as shutting the product down completely. The FDA has the power to regulate food and drugs, but whether they also have the power to prevent patients from seeking out specific information that could lead to them taking different drugs or eating different foods is unclear in the powers of the administration.
23andMe is still in business and is still publishing some of the cheapest genetic testing results in the healthcare industry. However, they now distribute the test results with a book of genes and their links instead of with a sheet of the diseases directly linked to the genes. 
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that meets on a weekly basis to discuss the implications of science, technology, and medicine in society. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on how genetic information is used.

Have you ever seen puddles on the road while driving only to see them disappear moments later? Have you ever seen a sun on the horizon that looked like it was both rising and setting? These seemingly impossible occurrences are actually the result of a phenomenon known as a mirage. Mirages are caused by atmospheric conditions and contain at least one inverted image of an object.
Generally, mirages are the result of refraction. Refraction occurs when a light wave crosses the boundary between two mediums at an angle. Part of the light wave will speed up or slow down before the rest of the wave. This change in speed causes the light wave to change direction or bend.
In the case of mirages, two different mediums are formed by a distinct, sudden change in air density in the atmosphere, according to howstuffworks.com. The most common cause of varying air density is varying air temperature, since hot air is less dense than cold air. One example of this temperature difference involves an asphalt road on a hot day. The asphalt, after sitting in the sun for an extended period of time, heats the air directly above it to a higher temperature than the rest of the air in the atmosphere. The change in density between the hot air near the road and the cooler air higher in the atmosphere causes light rays to bend as they move between the mediums.
This bending of light causes mirages by affecting the way in which our eyes perceive the light reflecting off an object. 
Normally, light only travels in a straight line. The light bouncing off an object reflects in all directions. Your eyes perceive the light that bounces off the object straight toward you, and you see the object. When light wave bending occurs, however, your eyes detect additional light waves. Light still bounces off the object in all directions, so you still detect light waves that reflect straight toward you, and you still see the object. However, your eyes can also detect bent light waves, which cause you to see a mirror image of the object. 
In the instance of a mirror image of a car on a highway, the light waves that would normally simply reflect toward the ground hit the hot layer of air near the asphalt and are bent upward toward your eyes. According to howstuffworks.com, the light waves reflected by the bottom of the car hit the hot air first, speed up, and are bent farther upward than the light waves reflected from the top of the car. Because the lower light waves are bent farther upward, your eyes perceive the lower part of the car to be above the top of the car. This phenomenon causes your eyes to see both the original car and a mirror reflection of the car below the original. To a viewer, this type of mirage often looks like a puddle of water, since it reflects everything located above it.
Since the mirror image in the previous example is below the horizon, the mirage is labeled as an inferior mirage. Mirages can also be superior mirages, which form above the horizon. Superior mirages typically occur when there is cold air underneath warm air. Superior mirages occur in the same way as inferior mirages, except that the light is bent in the opposite direction, which causes the flipped image to appear on top of the original image, instead of underneath.
Mirages, despite their reputation as highly irrational visions, are the result of the simple, physical concept of light refraction and can lead to a variety of different illusions and produce complex reflections apparent in everyday life.

Elongated skulls could belong to new species
A graveyard of 3,000-year-old skeletons with elongated skulls was discovered on the Paracus Peninsula in Peru by archaeologist Julio Tello in 1928. A recent announcement made by Paracas Museum assistant director, researcher, and author Brien Foerster regarding these skulls has resulted in scientific controversy. 
While it has previously been speculated that the elongated skulls were the result of cranial deformation, recent studies have shown that these skeletons may belong to an entirely new species. One way to tell that a skull is human is whether or not the skull in question has retained the original volume of a human skull. The first indication that these skulls from Peru may belong to a new species is the fact that the Paracas skulls are 2.5 times the volume of the average human skull. 
In addition, DNA testing of hair, teeth, and bone from five of the skulls has revealed DNA mutations that have never been seen in humans, primates, or any other animal; some have even entertained the idea that the skulls may be an extraterrestrial species. The implications of this discovery are enormous, although further studies will need to be conducted before the origin of this species can be verified.

Nye and Ham debate evolution versus creationism
In a highly watched event, the well-known scientist Bill Nye faced off with the creationist CEO and founder of Answers in Genesis-U.S. and the Creation Museum Ken Ham in a debate pitting science against religion. The debate happened in Ham’s museum in Petersburg, Kentucky and included serious debate on the topic of evolution versus creationism. 
Nye brought evidence in the form of fossils, pictures of glaciers, and even rock from underneath the museum to argue his case for why the Earth is actually billions of years old. Nye emphasized that science depends on predictions and evidence.
Ham, on the other hand, used his interpretation of the Bible to argue for his case that the Earth was formed a few thousand years ago and that all life forms descended from an initial 10,000 different species. Ham’s point — which might seem absurd to those that are part of the scientific community — has validity because the crux of the creationism argument lies on the fundamental idea that historical science, or science about the past, can never be proven and is always up to interpretation.

Saturday night was the premiere and only night of Carnegie Mellon’s biggest annual fashion show, Lunar Gala, featuring dazzling designs created and modeled entirely by students. The theme this year was “Hypnôse,” with the tagline: “The Illusion is Beautiful.” The title and description fit the replaying eerie video that began with a girl standing alone in a wintry forest staring curiously at what appeared to be a multicolored hologram. Only with the culmination of the show did the audience discover what happened to the girl when she stepped into the hologram: her image became a series of hallucinations and warped images, meant to represent the inspiration for this year’s Lunar Gala. The show itself was grand, complete with high-energy dance performances from Carnegie Mellon’s very own Infra Dance Company and SoulStylz, as well as a catalog with descriptions of each line.
The show began with a DJ playing energetic music, after which the video flashed on the screen and the crowd erupted into applause and shouts. The first line displayed was titled “Cocoon” and was designed by sophomore design major Miriam Buchwald, who explains in the show’s magazine how the inspiration for her looks came from the unraveling of a cocoon. The series of delicate white dresses and gowns appeared angelic on stage, and seemed to include many different textures. It was most shocking, then, that each beautiful dress had been crafted completely from hot glue. The designer’s talent was apparent in the intricacies of each design, and how each look was unique, despite having been made from the same material.
Once “Cocoon” ended, there was a quick transition to the next line, “Saint Knox,” signaled by a change in music and pattern of lights on the light-board from which the models emerged.
The looks featured in “Saint Knox,” designed by junior design majors Keith Joseph and Hayden Smith, were more casual and edgy than the first line. In stark contrast to the delicate white dresses of the first line, the simple black or grey outfits were unique, often with sheer or entirely removed sleeves. The designers definitely achieved their goal of creating “an easy-going line of modern street wear,” as described in the magazine.
From the next line “Fjortis,” the most memorable aspect was the light display on the board under which the models entered. Setting the scene for designer senior decision science major Anna Cederquist’s vision, as described in the program, of combining “what is considered mature and childish” was a light design with bright colors and images that danced along the light board in tune to the fun, upbeat music. The designs themselves matched the theme, with silhouettes that appeared adult-like and accented with small, unexpected bursts of neon and childlike patterns.
Junior design major Liana Kong’s “Heteroptera” was next on stage. Citing her inspiration as the book Heteroptera by Cornelia Hesse-Honegger, Kong created an alternate environment through her use of geometric shapes and mixes of textures such as leather and tulle. Purposeful cutouts and rips accentuated her theme of human destruction. This line was followed by “Biome,” created by fifth-year architecture major Ying Lin, junior mechanical engineering major Josh Lopez-Binder, and fifth-year architecture major Paulina Reyes. Intricate patterns representative of the computational design involved in the creation of this line were juxtaposed against soft, wispy dresses.
Like its mysterious name, “Senhua” was intriguing with three-dimensional shapes, laser cut designs, and eccentric materials such as plastic. The designers — sophomore design major Chloe Chia, junior design major Alex Kane, and sophomore Bachelors of Computer Science and Arts student in computer science and design Jessica Shen — emphasized the importance of balance in their line. The product of a trio majoring in varying disciplines, “Senhua” was a combination of various techniques and styles, tied together by a playful-yet-serious vibe. The differences and similarities in design worked to make the looks that were displayed visually appealing.
Everything in Lunar Gala was the result of careful planning and consideration, including the order in which the different lines were displayed. Though it was obvious that each fashion line tied into the Hypnôse theme by playing with texture and pattern, it was also noticeable that each line seamlessly transitioned into the next. While three-dimensional shapes characterized “Senhua,” the next line, “Dilate,” placed emphasis on light. The line’s designers — sophomore industrial design major Gina Huang, sophomore communication design major Irene Joung, and sophomore fine arts major Angelina Namkung — achieved this emphasis through 3-D elements such as a string of light bulbs hanging around the model’s neck, or a few light bulbs dangling off a pyramid-shaped hat.
From one line based on light came another called “Lumi,” though this type of light came in the form of small LED bulbs that the models could control with Bluetooth technology. Through this line, designers sophomore art major Christin Bongiorni and senior business administration major Mia Skinner achieved their goal of fusing technology with fashion. This line was indescribably enjoyable to watch, due to the interplay between the lights and music.
Third-year architecture majors Shivani Jain and Jacqueline Yeung’s line, “Mureaux,” focused on what they described in the program as “extrusions of the body.” Most memorable from this line were the peculiar shapes in mostly neutral colors, accented by pieces in gold. This line easily transitioned to third-year architecture major Colleen Clifford’s “Capsaicin,” which was simultaneously simple and modern, marked by reusability of different fabrics.
Then came the futuristic neon plastics with junior design majors Samantha Chiu and Antonio Ono’s “UV,” followed by first-year design major Eileen Huang’s “Youth.” While “UV” was more futuristic and revealing, “Youth” was, as its name indicates, more childish with items such as a pair of neon pink overalls.
Like many of the lines that incorporated technology with fashion, the next line, “Errorz” was inspired by a type of music, as described by designers junior human-computer interaction and design double major Aya Demler and junior mechanical engineering and robotics double major Rick Shanor. They explained that they utilized inspiration from the stages of electronic dance music, concerts to create their looks. The models strode onto the stage wearing designs reminiscent of Transformers, featuring geometric shapes that lit up to the beat of the music. Fourth-year architecture major Vishaal Dokras’s line “Vagoba” followed. The line was a modern take on the British invasion of India. Junior design majors Susan Park and Jane Yoon’s “Avalokita” came next. This line was inspired by a Buddhist god. The repetition in patterns and contrast in layers made “Avalokita” visually appealing. Most memorable was the moment when the models all stood at the edge of the stage and bowed to the audience.
The show ended with “Spectral Discord,” another line that focused on pattern repetition, though in this case the designer, junior design major Rachel Ciavarella, stated in the magzine that she drew her inspiration from “excessive media exposure.” There was then an atmosphere of celebration as all the people involved in Lunar Gala strode out onto the stage and were greeted by wild applause from the audience for their hard work and dedication to the show. Lunar Gala is a spectacle that every Carnegie Mellon student must experience at least once in his or her years here.

Who remembers Florence and the Machine’s sophomore album, Ceremonials? Hardly any of you? Well, to recap, it was okay, but it didn’t come anywhere close to matching her spine-tingling debut Lungs. Like all artists, Florence wanted to better herself, so for Ceremonials, she took what her fans and producers liked best — loud, theatrical, gut-wrenching anthems — and made an album chock-full of them. And though the album didn’t flop, only the hit single, “Shake It Out,” lives to tell the tale.
The Glitch Mob — made up of Los Angeles EDM veterans edIT, Boreta, and Ooah — tried the same thing for Love Death Immortality, but with even less success. They took their most crafty and powerful moments from their glorious first album, Drink the Sea, and beat the listener over the head with them. Some tracks are pretty damn fun on their own, but after the third or fourth, the album is all climax and no sexual tension.
As anyone can glean from the laughably ambitious title and sick cover art, The Glitch Mob took the adage “go big or go home” quite literally with Love Death Immortality. Like Beyoncé, every track has a music video to match, but it looks like they didn’t have Queen B’s budget: Each video finds some mix between a bizarre iTunes Visualizer mod and a Rorschach test. They even provided a second version of the album with commentary before each track elucidating how and where and why it was made, probably thinking that it would be beneficial to their given audience or that we would care. It’s not, and we don’t.
Again like Ceremonials, the single The Glitch Mob released a month before Love Death Immortality came out is by far the most redeeming track. Like everything on the album, “Can’t Kill Us” sounds overblown and raucous, but it actually succeeds in being an improvement from most selections on the previous album, vying for the “most epic” award with Drink the Sea’s big hit “Animus Vox.”
On the opposite end of the spectrum, “Skytoucher” is six minutes of aimless synth melody over a headache-inducing pad. Also, apparently, its proper genre descriptor is “brostep.” Why would anyone want to listen to anything called “brostep?”
“Our Demons” is pretty great too; it doesn’t give everything away near the beginning, which most of their tracks seem to do, and it has some more organic-sounding loops, adding some contrast to the drum-and-bass-laden rest of the album. Aja Volkman’s guest vocals work well here, but not so much in her other appearance, “I Need Your Memory Back,” another arc-less effort: Her opening vocals lead up to a rather disappointing synth lick that belongs in a game of Tetris, and it goes downhill from there.
The Tetris synth makes a return in the harmonically uninteresting and reverb-heavy “Fly By Night Only,” but Yaarrohs’s smooth guest vocals work really well with The Glitch Mob. Hopefully, they take her back on their next album.
The music on Love Death Immortality is obviously geared toward the crowd at the club, and while fans of Drink the Sea might pout, they can’t be too upset about that. The money’s not in the album sales, but in the live shows; Love Death Immortality basically functions as an advert for filling a venue. But the crowd that responds to the ad will probably show up for “Can’t Kill Us,” get bored, and leave.

Warning: this article contains spoilers for the House of Cards season two premiere, "Happy Birthday Mr. (Vice) President".
“You didn’t think I’d forgotten about you, did you? Welcome back,” drawls former House Majority Whip Frank Underwood of Netflix’s Warning: This article contains spoilers for the House of Cards season two premiere, “Happy Birthday Mr. (Vice) President.”
“You didn’t think I’d forgotten about you, did you? Welcome back,” drawls former House Majority Whip Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) of Netflix’s House of Cards. With that, the first episode of season two comes to a close and the race to the end of the season is on once again.
House of Cards’s wildly successful first season set a precedent for Netflix-exclusive TV series, proving that it was possible to captivate even a limited viewership given the right ingredients. It is indisputable that Netflix and House of Cards creator Beau Willimon have concocted the perfect recipe: complicated plotlines, a brilliant cast, and a slew of talented directors. After the whirlwind that was the first season, the cast and crew of the series had quite a lot to measure up to. But even in the first episode of the second season, it’s clear that the next 13 chapters that await viewers will leave them on the edge of their seats.
The first episode, titled “Happy Birthday Mr. (Vice) President,” picks up minutes after season one ended. Without missing a beat, viewers are tossed back into the thick of things.
Reporters Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer), and Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) are still in the midst of their frantic investigation into the death of Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). They’re getting closer to connecting the dots, realizing that there is a wealth of evidence that implicates Frank, despite the police report that claims that Peter committed suicide.
Meanwhile, Frank is in the middle of ascending to the vice presidency and finding a replacement for his now vacant Whip position, all the while keeping his allies close and his enemies closer. His wife, Claire (Robin Wright), decisively resolves the lawsuit that former employee and expectant mother Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt) is bringing against Claire’s nonprofit for wrongful termination. Using Gillian’s pregnancy to blackmail her into taking over for Claire at the nonprofit, Claire coldly ends that chapter of her life in order to pour more effort into dealing with the media fallout that often accompanies Frank’s brutal scheming and politicking.
Frank’s chief of staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) continues to run around and take care of all of Frank’s dirty work, which includes making sure that Rachel Posner (Rachel Brosnahan), ex-prostitute and pawn in Peter’s death, stays quiet and out of sight.
The episode is equal parts set-up material for the second season and standalone action. Instead of easing viewers into season two with a buffer episode, the show takes off almost immediately, making watchers feel as though they never left this fast-paced political thriller. This pace was a good decision since it’s been a year since season one was released,which means it could have been a full year since Netflix users saw it.
House of Cards is not for the faint of heart, and Willimon issues a reminder that the series is a force to be reckoned with when, near the end of the season premiere, Frank kills Zoe when he finds out that she is close to finding out the truth behind Peter’s murder. Such a strong start indicates that this season will be filled with even more shadowy secrets and dark deeds than the last.
Netflix announced on Feb. 4 that House of Cards was renewed for a third season to be released in 2015. Considering that Time magazine reported nearly 15 percent of Netflix’s 40.4 million viewers watched the second season premiere within six hours of its release, it’s clear that by renewing this gem of a show, they’re not taking a gamble.

This past weekend the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre Orchestra, put on the classical ballet favorite Swan Lake, staged by artistic director Terrence S. Orr.
The production was a visual splendor of white tulle that would make any aspiring dancer, elementary-aged and beyond, gasp with envy. The ballet immersed the audience in the fairytale world with rich orchestral accompaniment, magical set pieces, and even a few tastefully dramatic lightning flashes for effect. The stage was transformed from palace courtyard to dreamlike forest, juxtaposing the world of people with the wonders of nature. The dancers brought not only precision and poise, but an emotional energy that transformed the ballet from a showcase of remarkable skill into an emotional performance.
One of the few ballets to have entered popular culture and knowledge, Swan Lake encapsulates everything that one could want from a tragic love story. A discontent Prince Siegfried falls in love with beautiful maiden Odette, only to discover that she has been cursed by an evil sorcerer to transform into a swan in daylight. Only the prince’s true love and betrothal to her can remove the curse. Prince Siegfried returns home but is desperate to see his lover. 
Meanwhile, the evil sorcerer devises a plan to make sure Odette remains in his power. The clever villain deceives Prince Siegfried into thinking that his own daughter, Odile, is the prince’s love, leading to inevitable emotional turmoil for the lovers who jump off a cliff, one and then the other, only to finally be together in heaven. Within this simple story is a number of interpretations and reflections, with themes of forbidden love, entrapment, and psychosis.
Originally choreographed by Marius Petipa in the latter half of the 19th century, the ballet’s most iconic scenes are those with the identical white swans in perfect harmony — symbols of pure naturalistic beauty. Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre made these moments highlights. The dancers felt unified as they worked to create visual illusions and compositions, moving as one body to pull the audience from their own lives into the magic of the ballet.
The role of Odette was danced to perfection by the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s principal dancer, Julia Erickson, during the Thursday opening. The ability of the ballerina to express such complex emotions within the limits of the choreography requires tremendous physical and mental capacity, as well as the careful control of every part of the body, to communicate the psychological journey.
The lead role of Odette must also play the deceitful sorcerer’s daughter Odile, thus requiring a dancer able to express the personality of two characters within the same ballet. Erickson embodied both the ethereal character of Odette and the seductive personality of Odile with expressive yet economic movements.
Though the dancing took center stage, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre Orchestra’s interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s score was equally masterful. Between the music and dancing, the performance was fully immersive.
Though Swan Lake is certainly nothing new, it speaks to complex human struggles that are consistently relevant across time and culture. The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s performance of the classic is a reminder that perhaps the reason such works of art have withstood the test of time is because they speak to a deep human desire for magic, love, and an escape from reality.

The School of Drama premiered an original, student-written play on Wednesday. The Last Page: A Nuclear Folktale, written and directed by senior directing major Samuel French, tells the story of the pursuit of the American dream in a post-apocalyptic world. 
Junior acting major David Patterson played Soldier — circa the Revolutionary War — who, when in search of water, meets Little Girl, played by junior musical theatre major Alexis Floyd, looking for her mother. The two become friends when Little Girl shows Soldier that her veins are filled with water because her heart is a storm cloud. In their search for her mother, they come across Fox, played by junior acting major Mitchell Edwards, and Crow, played by junior acting major Olivia Brown, who are in search of water. Fox and Crow steal the little girl’s heart while she sleeps. 
Meanwhile, two destructive boy gods, Plutonium, played by junior musical theatre major Phillippe Arroyo, and Uranium, played by junior acting major Jeremy Hois, steal the crown of a riddle-solving Statue, who is also played by Brown. Without the crown, Little Girl can’t solve the riddle that would start the earth spinning again after the apocalypse, so Soldier and Little Girl go looking for it.
After the show, the cast and crew sat down with audience members for a talkback to get viewers’ reactions to the play and explain some of the behind-the-scenes processes of making the play.
“It’s a very Americana play,” French said. “As we discussed this idea more and more, we realized that American ideas are actually a gateway to global ideas. How the Fox and the Crow interact with the American dream is the idea of ‘go out and grab what you want for yourself’ and ‘do whatever it takes to survive’ mentality, and how the Little Girl and the Soldier interact with the American dream juxtaposes that.”
The scenery was meant to reflect the idea of the American dream. Sections of chipped white picket fences were the only scenery on the stage. The black floor also had flecks of colors on it meant to make it resemble a galaxy. “I was trying to find some symbol of Americana, so we used the white picket fence, and the floor was meant to reflect the cosmic relativity of the play,” said junior scenic design major and the play’s scenic designer Pia Marchetti. “But when I saw the lighting, that’s when I started to see everything come together. It gave the feel of an abyss or a haze.”
The lighting significantly added to the tone of the play, and changes in the lighting helped the audience to recognize breaks in the story and movement through scenes. A smoky haze filled the theater when the audience first arrived, adding a mysterious aura before 
the play started. “I was hesitant when I first read the 
script because one scene took place in the stars; the next was in the desert,” said junior lighting design major and the play’s lighting designer Rane Renshaw. “The set allowed me to create room and have you float at times, be dehydrated at times, be in a kingdom at times. Behind you extended forever, which added to that idea of infinite time, infinite space. When they were wandering through the desert, the lighting felt dehydrated, and gave me the opportunity to emphasize that, and allow you to connect the dots.”
In addition to the aesthetic features of the play, the actors brought the otherwise confusing story to life. Especially delightful was Floyd’s portrayal of Little Girl. Comical at times, tear-jerking at others, and always vibrant, Floyd’s animated performance was captivating and was sure to make each member of the audience invested in her journey to find her heart, her mother, and Statue’s crown.
“When I first read it, I actually didn’t immediately get the sense of the American dream,” Floyd said. “What resonated with me were the characters. As we started to work on the play, I realized the Girl represented being attached to the American dream and to have the resources to go after what you want. She has faith in her that anything is possible.”
During the talkback session, some audience members expressed that they thought of Little Girl as a representation of an angel. “I have personal feelings 
about this, but at times she is an angel, whatever that means,” French said. “Her costume changed how I started to think of Little Girl. Eunjin Lee came to me with the idea of her costume looking like a quilt. It’s something that is handed down from generation to generation. What she could be and what she was is something I’m not going to disclose.” Lee is the show’s costume designer and is pursuing a masters in costume design. 
While Little Girl seemed to be a very universal character whose time period would be difficult to pinpoint, Soldier belonged to a very definite time period — the Revolutionary War. French said he chose to make him a soldier from that particular war because, “That was the start of America, when the American ideals originated that have been twisted, distorted, changed. That was when the ideal was most powerful. I chose a Revolutionary War soldier because he was a soldier that started there and saw how the country changed.”
Though the story was certainly creative and engaging, it was also very confusing at times. Because the characters were from such different worlds, time periods, and levels of believability, the story was often difficult to follow. The actors and lighting definitely helped, but did not eliminate all confusion. Overall, the play was an intriguing story and a unique experience.

“You broke me unfixable,” states the titular Judas Iscariot in The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, Scotch’n’Soda’s latest production. This play is an irreverent play about religion, guilt, and forgiveness, written by Stephen Adly Guirgis and directed by junior history and English double major Razghiem Golden with assistance from junior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in architecture and ethics, history, and public policy Anna Failla.
The play starts as a stereotypical courtroom drama in purgatory at the appeal trial of Judas Iscariot, played by senior psychology major Wyatt D’Emilia. Plucky lawyer Fabiana Aziza Cunningham (junior Drama major Jackie Mishol), rises to the challenge to defend the traitor apostle. However, she and the entire courtroom get more than they bargained for as the play develops into a genre of its own.
The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, which is set in purgatory, depicts an interesting version of the afterlife. According to the play, purgatory changes its appearance according to the times. In this case, the afterlife is Americanized. There are biblical characters speaking with New York accents and historical figures who dress like Al Pacino.
A few of the play’s many memorable characters include Fabiana, purgatory’s Perry Mason whose dark past is gradually revealed. The Judge, as played by senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in music and creative writing James Alexander, is a former Civil War soldier with a southern drawl and a cynical, inflexible worldview. Sophomore materials science and engineering major Yeshar Hadi puts on plenty of hammy and smarmy as he portrays prosecutor Yusef El-Fayoumy. Satan, as played by senior Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts student Andrew Bueno, is a wildcard character who can be as suave as he can be sadistic. And, of course, there is the infamous Judas Iscariot.
Along with the colorful cast, there is plenty of colorful language. In fact, there is very colorful language, as well as a few offensive jokes; this is not a play to show in Sunday school.
The Last Days of Judas Iscariot is also interspersed with monologues taken from various Biblical characters, including Mary Magdalene (first-year architecture major Victoria Yong), Saint Monica (first-year undeclared Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences student Maggie Davis), and Saint Thomas (first-year chemistry major Ryan LaPré). For the most part, these monologues serve to segue between portions of the play and re-emphasize its themes. However, these sequences can seem out of place at times, especially since most of these characters do not appear in any other instances.
The play becomes more interesting as it progresses. The beginning doesn’t seem to take itself very seriously; it acts as a parody of the legal system and the Bible as caricatures of historical figures come and go. However, the play hits its stride in the latter parts. Characters’ motivations are more developed, more serious philosophical ideas are discussed, and some of the more unique concepts come into the foreground.
For the majority of the play, Judas sits alone in his personal, chilly hell at one end of the stage, and only comes out of it in flashbacks — once when he is a child and once when he is drunk. The only information the audience gains about him is what has been said by other characters. But at the very end there is a glimpse of the real Judas and why he is truly stuck in hell, as Jesus tries to comfort him. One of the most interesting features of the play is the dual casting of the same character as Satan and Jesus. It adds much more weight and thought to the final scenes.
Susanna Seltzer, a sophomore international relations and politics major, said of the play, “I thought it was a great play, expertly done, and it balanced comedy and tragedy beautifully.”
“I loved it. I thought what was most impressive was the actor who played Satan/Jesus, especially the transition between the really funny and really serious parts,” said Kabir Mantha, a first-year math major. “Judas was also amazing, as well as the Judge, and Fabiana. I was really surprised by how good it was. The last Scotch’n’Soda production I saw was Batboy, but this could easily be confused as a School of Drama production.”
There were also many other features unique to this production. The set design was innovative; the stage was open from all sides, and actors could enter or exit from almost anywhere. The set itself was a courtroom in purgatory, and featured an interesting clash between symbols of heaven and hell. Unfortunately the seating and venue did not accommodate the set well. The venue, Rangos 3, was completely filled by the stage and seats, and if you were unlucky enough to get a seat in the second or third rows, many times you saw more of the person sitting in front of you than the set or the actors. A larger room could have gone a long way in resolving these issues.
When the production was finished, there was also a special talkback session, in which the production staff, actors, and faculty who did work relating to the subject matter of the play held a panel discussion on some of the themes, history, and ideas behind it.
Although Nietzsche famously declared “God is dead” more than 100 years ago, plays such as The Last Days of Judas Iscariot show that God, religion, and Christianity are still subjects of lively discussion in society. What this play brings to the table is an attempt to reconcile the many interpretations of religious scripture and come up with one solid answer to how people can best improve themselves. The Scotch’n’Soda production does an excellent job of picking at all the ideas behind the play while providing sharp comedy and intense drama.

Dallas Buyers Club
Thursday, Feb. 20 — 10
Friday, Feb. 21 — 7:30, 10
In the midst of the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, cowboy Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) is living the high life: lots of drugs, sex, and booze. Wanting to be the manly rodeo cowboy that he is, Ron is strongly homophobic and is therefore shocked when he contracts the HIV virus. In a desperate struggle of survival, Ron begins smuggling unapproved drugs and selling them to other AIDS victims. In a sudden career twist, McConaughey sheds his beach-boy persona and gives one of the best performances of his career. He carries the film with the support of the amazing Jared Leto, who plays a HIV-positive transsexual woman (and a shoo-in for an Oscar). This is not a fairytale film with happy endings; but it’s full of uplifting courage and strength that will send jitters down your spine.
12 Years a Slave
Saturday, Feb. 22 — 11
Sunday, Feb. 23 — 8
In one of the best films of the year, director Steve McQueen ruthlessly captures the true story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man in New York in the 1840s who is a gifted musician and carpenter with a family by his side. However, in a cruel twist of fate, he is captured and forced to work as a slave on a plantation in New Orleans. Depicting a true test of survival, 12 Years a Slave shows the cruel beginnings of American history and humanity. McQueen’s visceral style creates a documentary-like feel, making it hard to watch at times, but it’s a courageous and truthful account of one man’s journey during a devastating time in history.

Dear Ryan and Matt,
I came back to my apartment on Valentine’s Day to hear “Lady Marmalade” by Patti LaBelle on repeat blasting on my stereo. I live alone, and I don’t have a girlfriend, nor does anyone I know have a key. I have no idea what was going on. I’m as much a fan of asking girls to sleep with me in French as the next guy, but the whole experience really freaked me out. I thought ghosts were only supposed to show up on Halloween.
Help,
Reeling Over Manic Announcement, Never Convinced of Earthbound Demons
Dear ROMANCED,
Seriously dude, you still have a stereo system? Was the song playing off a cassette tape? Questions aside, our only theory is close to yours: You might have a spurned ex-lover looking for revenge. By ex-lover, we mean — how to put this — an expired lover. You might want to contact the friends of all of your girls in the past to make sure they are okay. It might be a little awkward checking in with them so soon after Valentine’s Day, but you never know, at least one of their new boyfriends is bound to have screwed up, and they could be in a nostalgic kind of mood.
Blast the Ghostbusters theme when you leave the house just to be safe,
Matt & Ryan
Hey Matt and Ryan,
I met up with some friends for an anti-Valentine’s Day party on Friday night, and I had a great time. It started with the ice cream-eating contest, and the night quickly moved on to Mario Kart. After the video games, we went exploring, and got in deep trouble with scary guys stealing cars. At first, they took us under their wing, but then they betrayed us to the mob and left us all for dead. Ultimately, we worked our way up the criminal hierarchy, and now I want out.
Any advice?
Criminal Actor Robbing Jeeps, Advice Caused Kingpin
Uh, CAR-JACK,
Are you sure you all weren’t so tired, dehydrated, and in such a sugar coma that you mistook the plot of Grand Theft Auto for real life? The story sounds a little too familiar — and unbelievable. Do we even have a mob in Pittsburgh? If you worked your way to the top of the food chain in a weekend, why hasn’t the news reported on the crime spree and the violence? We think if you want to get out of this life of crime, you should turn the console off, take a shower, and go to class.
If your story is true, it would make for a great Campus Crime and Incident report next week,
Ryan and Matt

Carnegie Mellon and Yahoo, Inc. recently announced a five-year partnership worth $10 million. The partnership, named Project InMind, will allow researchers at Carnegie Mellon to use Yahoo’s data services collection, giving them an opportunity to “test new ways that machine learning and interface technologies can improve personalized user experiences,” according to the official press release.
Project InMind will allow Yahoo and Carnegie Mellon researchers and students to develop new methods that will improve machine intelligence and the personalization of smartphone applications, among other things. It will allow researchers to use algorithms and analyze them to determine what consumers need and want. Carnegie Mellon students and community members will even be able to use some of the company’s experimental mobile software, which will allow researchers to access more data and make swift improvements to existing technolgies.
“We’re thrilled to be partnering with the exceptional faculty and students at Carnegie Mellon, which has established itself as a premier institution for machine learning and user interface technologies,” said Ron Brachman, chief scientist of Yahoo and head of Yahoo labs, in a press release.
“By creating a way for Carnegie Mellon University researchers to work directly with Yahoo software and infrastructure, we hope to speed up the pace of mobile and personalization research and create a better user experience,” Brachman continued. 
Project InMind will also include a fellowship program — funded by Yahoo — at Carnegie Mellon that will provide both monetary and research support to members of the university’s computer science community. Individuals in the fellowship program will be given the opportunity to research fields like “machine learning, mobile technologies, human-computer interaction, personalization, novel interaction techniques, and natural language processing,” according to the press release. 
Under the terms of the partnership, the university will have ownership over all intellectual property created through it, but Yahoo will be given ownership of anything developed with the company and will be able to license property owned by Carnegie Mellon.
“This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for our students and faculty to work directly with a team of leading-edge researchers from Yahoo Labs on technologies that could benefit hundreds of millions of mobile users,” said Randall E. Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science, in the press release. “The overall commitment in this new partnership is a testament to our shared desire to advance the science of machine learning, user interfaces, and mobile technologies.”
Student reaction to the partnership is mixed. Alex Tsai, a first-year information systems major, said, “Despite being overshadowed by companies like Google, Yahoo is still a big player in the tech industry. For example, they just acquired Tumblr. The areas they propose to collaborate with CMU on, such as personalized user experience and machine learning, are both trending and have a lot of potential. My only concern is that project InMind seems to be only for [computer science] majors, and CMU is too interdisciplinary for that.”
Steven Wang, a sophomore economics and statistics major, said, “it will be interesting to see what Yahoo hopes to gain from this partnership. How do they hope to benefit from the findings of CMU professors and students, as well as the increased exposure of the company at CMU? The partnership obviously has great implications for research here but I would love to hear more about Yahoo’s motivations.”

A Facebook group called “To Dining, With Love” that allows Carnegie Mellon students to voice concerns or complaints to CulinArt has gained ground, especially among first-year students. The group, hosted by Student Dormitory Council’s Housing and Dining Committee now has 803 members.
The group advertises itself on the page as a place to “talk about what dining does right and what it does wrong” and a place to “pitch ideas you think [dining services] should try out.”
Dan Evans, Student Dormitory Council Housing and Dining Services representative and first-year biology major, answers many of the concerns voiced by students. According to Evans, the idea for the Facebook page came from president of the Housing and Dining Services Committee and senior computer science major Milan Desai. Knowing that many students have strong opinions about the dining system, the Committee wanted to facilitate conversation between vendors and students. As Evans explained, the committee “trusted the student body to post reasonable requests, and for the most part that has been the case.”
Housing and Dining Services hosts a meeting at the Residence on Fifth once a month during which representatives from the Housing and Dining Services Committee have the opportunity to learn about new dining initiatives and receive student feedback. Suggestions posted on the Facebook group are now brought to these dinners as well.
Although the Facebook group is still less than a month old, changes suggested in the group have already been instituted. After students requested that napkins be more readily available in the Schatz Dining Room, the changes were implemented, and there are now napkins on every table.
Larger issues, like that of the block system, which many students consider to be expensive and inconvenient, will take longer to address. “The problem with some of these requests is that it takes time,” Evans said. “We are not going to be able to change the meal plan in two weeks … it could take a semester, it could take two.”
Evans noted that he too has done the math on the block system. A block purchased on a meal plan costs about $11. Evans agreed with students: “A block does end up being more expensive than the sum of its parts.”
Under the block system, a salad from Spinning Salad with edamame costs a student just as much as the all-you-can-eat buffet in the Schatz Dining Room. Blocks are a profitable system for vendors. As Evans points out, “Vendors make more money off blocks than when students use Dinex or cash. That’s where they are really bringing home the bacon. No pun intended.”
Other students are less critical. Fine arts first-year Kira Melville said, “The block system does have its merits. It’s helpful for students who don’t know how to manage money. It works for students who don’t care about eating healthy.”
First-year electrical and computer engineering major Maya Lassiter takes issue with the block system’s incompatibility with allergies. “It’s ridiculous that dining services requires students with specific dietary needs to pay more for food substitutions on a block,” Lassiter said. “I hope that the Facebook group gives students with special dietary needs a larger voice on campus.”
As for the complaints from students regarding excessive CulinArt advertising on the page itself, Evans says the issue has been resolved. There was a “misunderstanding between CulinArt and what they though was an appropriate amount of advertising and what the Housing and Dining Committee had envisioned.” CulinArt will now only respond directly to students’ comments and questions.
Evans and the Housing and Dining Committee hope that the group will eventually run itself with direct participation from CulinArt and other vendors on campus. Evans said, “We want to get [the] number [of members] up. We want to get as many people involved as possible. We want to get as many opinions as possible.”
Upon first receiving the invite, many students, including first-year electrical and computing engineering student Aaron Perley, thought the Facebook group was “just a place to complain unproductively about the dining system.” 
Still other students in the group took offense at the onslaught of promotional material from CulinArt. As first-year mechanical engineering major Sebastian Murati, explained, “It was irritating to see CulinArt monopolize the page and make what should have been a helpful conversation into another forum for advertising.”

Last Wedensday, University President Subra Suresh announced the creation of the ProSEED program by email.
The email described ProSEED as “intended to create new mechanisms for connecting and coordinating other seed-funding programs available at CMU, so that our community can be better positioned to apply for sustained support for their ideas.”
Seed funding is the money provided by an organization to a group working to develop a novel product for future use or commercialization, to help with product development, prototyping, testing, and marketing.
ProSEED addresses one of President Suresh’s five theme areas that he identified earlier in the academic year as part of his listening tour of campus. 
ProSEED responds to Suresh’s identified need to increase the seed funding for new ideas, which according to Carnegie Mellon’s leadership webpage, “is especially critical in light of the budget uncertainties and attendant delays associated with government funding.”
The webpage states from Oct. 1, “[Suresh] will soon be announcing new models and mechanisms for seed funding that will leverage resources from a number of on-campus stakeholders and external sources,” the culmination of which is the ProSEED program.
Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert characterized ProSEED as an umbrella containing seed funding programs such as the Simon Initiative Seed Grants and Crosswalk, and others in the future.
Burkert said that ProSEED is “meant to seed new ideas, new initiatives, to bring together various parts of campus, various opportunities to really be synergistic.”
The Simon Initiative is providing seed money for “faculty to develop technology-enhanced courses or course modules, or other research projects that use data-driven learning technologies,” according to President Suresh’s email. 
The administration of this program will be conducted through The Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation. Burkert clarified that the program has two key focuses of learning and application-based developments and more research-oriented ones.
According to the email, Crosswalk will provide funding to “empower ideas for new connections and collaborations across campus, on any number of dimensions.” Crosswalk money will be used to improve the student and campus experience and will focus on the domains of student research, quality of life, courses, student competitions, community service learning, and symposiums and strategic workshops.
Assistant Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Stephanie Wallach said, “what President Suresh has discovered is there’s a tremendous amount of interest from undergraduates in terms of more opportunities for interdisciplinary research. More ways to find different avenues into the same question.”
Crosswalk will be run parallel to the existing Small Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG) program offered by the Undergraduate Research Office (URO), where students engaging in interdisciplinary research can fill out an extra application portion to apply for Crosswalk. 
In this way, the URO hopes, as Wallach described, “to strengthen an already robust program and highlight even more directly the interdisciplinary nature of the work we do here, and also provide some additional resources to students who find that the funding may not be adequate.”
Crosswalk will also be integrated into the Meeting of the Minds presentations currently linked with the SURG program.
“There will be a lot of interplay between these programs as they develop,” Burkert explained.
There are also plans for the ProSEED webpage to become a resource.
“If you look at the ProSEED website, there are also other types of seed funding available across campus,” Burkert explained, saying that there are plans to turn the website into a “collecting site” for seed opportunities across campus with a denotation if the opportunity is for students, alumni, or faculty.
Justine Cassell, one of the co-directors of The Simon Initiative, spoke about the role that the initiative will play in ProSEED.
“Our goal is to ensure that technology is used in places where it can improve learning gains,” Cassell described, noting The Simon Initiative’s funding for both the use of existing technology in the classroom, but also for researching technology for classroom use. “This can be technology of any kind,” she added.
Cassell spoke of the necessity of using technology in classrooms in a way that best promotes learning, and not just integrating technology because it is available. 
“This is a way of helping faculty and students focus on how technology can best help students to learn,” Cassell said.
In regard to ProSEED’s overall success, Burkert said, “I think a measure of success will be seeing whether this is effective in cross-fertilization.”
Wallach added, “I also think that you would have a much broader base of students who would have this opportunity [for undergraduate research] before they graduate. It would be a more natural and accepted way that you engage when you’re an undergraduate here.”

“Don’t drink the yellow vodka” was one of many lessons distilled during “The Moral of the Story: Life Lessons from Professors,” a lecture presented by the senior honor society Mortar Board, last Thursday.
The lecture, which filled McConomy Auditorium to capacity, consisted of talks by four professors, including Rebecca Nugent, associate teaching professor in the department of statistics; David Kosbie, assistant teaching professor in the School of Computer Science; John Mackey, teaching professor and associate department head of the department of mathematical sciences; and Robert F. Culbertson, adjunct assistant professor of entrepreneurship in the Tepper School of Business.
Each professor talked about the lessons they learned throughout their life that they thought would be most valuable to Carnegie Mellon students. Nugent, who won the 2012–13 Elliott Dunlap Smith Award for Teaching and Educational Service, presented by the Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences, called her talk “Life Advice and Wisdom ... Or, Don’t Do What I Did.” Nugent broke her life up into discrete lessons, like “don’t drink the yellow vodka,” an adage Nugent drew from a trip to Antarctica.
In Antarctica, Nugent said, the researchers they visited had distilled their own dubious, yellow-colored vodka after running out of what they had brought with them. “He took the shot, as I watched his brain cells melt out of his ears, I realized ‘don’t drink the yellow vodka.’ ”
“For two to three weeks we knew nothing of what happened in the world,” Nugent said. “You realized how much noise there is all the time, and you’re just quiet for a few weeks,” she added. “If you let yourself be overloaded, just go be silent. That’s what I learned on the Antarctica trip.”
Vaasavi Unnava, a first-year economics and statistics major, said that Nugent’s proclamation that the decisions students make now don’t have as much clout as they think they will struck her the hardest. “I really took that away because I think that a lot of the time, especially students at CMU tend to make decisions thinking, ‘Oh how will this impact my future? This will be so crazy. I’m going to end up completely in the wrong place because of this,’ ” Unnava said. “But making decisions for just yourself right now is a really amazing thing.”
The next speaker, Kosbie, winner of the 2012 Herbert A. Simon Award for Teaching Excellence in Computer Science, presented by the School of Computer Science, similarly broke his life into chunks that demonstrated times when he learned lessons that he wanted to pass on to Carnegie Mellon students.
Kosbie began with the story of a student who completed his class, 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, while undergoing treatment for cancer.
After the student passed away from cancer, Kosbie was torn about whether or not to take time from his busy schedule to attend the funeral in Baltimore. 
Kosbie made the drive, however, and was the only Carnegie Mellon staff member there.
“When you know — when your gut is telling you — what to do, just do it,” Kosbie said regarding the experience.
Kosbie also made points similar to Nugent’s about the choices students make impacting their future.
“You really don’t know at this stage of life where you’re going,” said Kosbie, who originally began his career at Harvard University as a pre-med student, but now teaches computer science.
Nkindé Ambalo, a first year electrical and computer engineering major, said that he was struck by how much one’s life can change during and after college. 
“We are pretty much all on this crazy path, so you don’t know what you’re going to do — none of [the speakers] knew what they were going to do,” Ambalo said. “Most of them started out doing something that was completely unrelated to what they do now — not even just teaching but their field itself.... It was really interesting to see how they started out doing one thing, then had these enormous changes, before and after college.”
The next speaker, Mackey, told what was essentially the story of his life — how he ended up earning his Ph.D. at the University of Hawaii, and how, as a white male, he experienced the other side of prejudice at the hands of Hawaiian natives.
According to Mackey, this experience gave him valuable perspective.
“When you vary your experiences, you will go through different stages and you will find yourself,” Mackey said, linking this point to Carnegie Mellon student life by saying that students too often break into cliques and factions rather than forming a cohesive body.
The last speaker was Culbertson (CIT ‘73, GSIA ‘74 , CIT ‘75), who received his bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees from Carnegie Mellon.
Culbertson’s lecture focused on what he considered the most important lesson he had learned throughout life, “Do something even if it’s wrong.”
Culbertson also focused on some of the important mentors he had throughout his life, especially at Carnegie Mellon. “Great teachers cause you to have conversations you never wanted to have, make you do things you never wanted to do, and bring you to places you never thought you would go,” Culbertson said.
“The Moral of the Story: Life Lessons from Professors,” was presented by the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board, a branch of the National College Senior Honor Society. 
According to Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board’s website, “Mortar Board members are not only recognized as the top scholars and leaders on their campuses, but are selected based on dedication to scholarship, leadership, and service to the campus and Pittsburgh community.”

Committee Reports: Communications Committee
Communications Committee chair and sophomore information systems chair Evan Wineland gave a presentation on the current initiatives of the Communications Committee. The Committee is currently promoting its upcoming First Lecture series, in which senior students who were nominated by other students will talk about their Carnegie Mellon experience. The Communications Committee is also working with the Academic Affairs Committee to promote Student Senate’s Faculty Course Evaluation town hall event.
The Committee is also hiring a new poster policy coordinator, who will help the current three Student Senate members to take down posters that violate the poster policy and administer fines to offending student organizations.
Vacancy Elections
Student Senate held vacancy elections, during which four new senators were elected. Andrew Brock, a senior electrical and computer engineering major, and Ian Einhorn, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, were elected as senators to the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Ryan LaPré, a first-year chemistry major, was elected as a senator for the Mellon College of Science. Naomie Laguerre, a third-year architecture major, was elected as a senator for the College of Fine Arts.
Student Government Executive Bylaw Changes
Student Senate voted on whether or not to approve all of the bylaw changes presented by Student Body President and senior biology major Lindsay MacGillivray the previous week. Student Senate voted to approve every change except for one concerning the postering and graffiti policy, due to ambiguous language and confusion over whether or not the Fence included the gravel pit surrounding the actual Fence.
Student Senate tabled the discussion on the changes to the graffiti and postering policy until next week’s meeting.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives did something it hasn’t done in over two years: it increased the debt ceiling without a crisis. While this is a major success in and of itself, what it says about the state of the Tea Party is even more remarkable.
For the last few years, the die-hard conservative Tea Party movement has stymied the American legislative process with its love for filibusters and hatred for an efficient federal government. 
However, the successful passage of a “clean” debt ceiling bill — one that raises the debt ceiling without any further conditions — despite opposition from the Tea Party, represents a tipping point for the Tea Party’s success. In fact, the passage of this bill may be the start of the end for the Tea Party, considering a number of larger forces behind its decline.
For one thing, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is going into effect. Although the Tea Party dedicated a major part of its platform to repealing it, Obamacare is becoming more of a reality by the day. States have already set up exchanges, millions of people have already signed up, and major businesses have adapted to the new rules. Repealing it at this point would do more harm than good, adding $109 billion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Furthermore, people are getting tired of the Tea Party’s obstructive politics, especially from within the Republican Party. Prominent Republicans, including former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove and U.S. Senator John McCain (R–Ariz), have publicly criticized the Tea Party’s tactics. According to The Wall Street Journal, House Republican leaders and various conservative groups have been aiming to weaken the power of the Tea Party caucus.
Some Republicans are working with allies outside the GOP establishment to fight Tea Party Republicans. More moderate Republicans have even teamed up with labor unions, according to The Daily Caller.
Finally, new political concerns, beyond the scope of Tea Party demands, are now being addressed. The Tea Party came into prominence 2008–2012, during the post-President George W. Bush crises. This era was one of economic downturn, bank bailouts, continued war in the Middle East, and increased government deficits and debt that spurred popular anger against the establishment.
However, in 2014, six years after the recession began in 2008, much of the hysteria about national debt and high taxes has settled down. Now, issues such as long-term unemployment and income inequality have begun to capture the national consciousness. While there remains a powerful sentiment against increased government power, the government shutdown last year proved that the Tea Party’s vision of lax governance was not a viable alternative.
Although the Tea Party will likely still be around for the next few years, it is unlikely that it will ever have the amount of influence it did prior to 2013.

Last Thursday, I had the honor of hearing one of the best lectures of my life. Titled “The Moral of the Story,” held by senior honor society Mortar Board in McConomy Auditorium, the event featured four prominent Carnegie Mellon professors, who shared their personal experiences in hopes that students could use them to better their lives. Overall, they gave great advice over a wide array of life topics, coupled with many exciting and almost unbelievable stories.
First to take the stage was associate teaching professor in the department of statistics, Rebecca Nugent. She centered her presentation on the best and worst decisions that she made throughout her life. 
While she filled her presentation with much humor, such as not drinking the “yellow vodka” of Ukrainians in Antarctica, she presented a well-thought-out thesis to her presentation: Follow your gut. 
She exemplified this lesson through her own personal experiences, such as her mistake of continuing to date her boyfriend simply because she was caught up in the momentum of life and found it simpler to keep riding than change. 
Advice like this applies to nearly everyone. Whether you find yourself with the wrong person, in the wrong major, or simply making one wrong decision because it is easier to ride the momentum, Nugent’s words have significant value.
The next speaker was School of Computer Science teaching professor David Kosbie, who brought forth a roller coaster of emotions. 
The most heart-rending part of the event was his story about a former student who was diagnosed with cancer and spent his final days working on his 15-112 term project. Kosbie described almost failing to make the decision to drive nine-and-a-half hours to attend the student’s funeral. 
As he stated, people always try to make excuses for why they should not do things. However, we should follow our intuitions and do what we know is right. There were great similarities between Kosbie’s words of inspiration and those of the late Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and famed author of The Last Lecture, Randy Pausch.
Teaching professor and associate department head of the department of mathematical sciences John Mackey, then took the stage, with his signature two-liter of Diet Coke in hand, and spoke poignantly.
Mackey described his hard life growing up in rural Ohio and being beaten up for defending his gay brother. Instead of simply being stepped on, he was inspired to work out and grow stronger. He focused much of his presentation on doing things that make you uncomfortable and standing up for yourself. 
The perspectives he gained from his life experiences were quite interesting. Perhaps one of his most interesting learning experiences was being a victim of racial prejudice first-hand in Hawaii. Instead of being upset by the incident, he enthusiastically turned it into a learning experience.
Last but not least was Robert F. Culbertson, adjunct assistant professor of entrepreneurship in the Tepper School of Business. Culbertson brought the event to a close with his experiences in entrepreneurship. He too stressed following your gut feeling and expressed deep regret about the fact that he turned down a dinner with Steve Jobs when a friend from college contacted him. 
The sincerity on his face was apparent as he stated that some decisions could not be undone. He then showed his poetic side and finished his speech by having everyone in the audience clap while he rapped about all that the speakers said. He was a great choice for a concluding speaker, as he had many shocking and exciting stories to tell, and his rap brought everything together humorously.
The entire presentation was powerful and moving — a reminder that perhaps a failed test or the girl who got away is not the end of the world. We tend to make such a big deal out of small things, which causes us to forget that which is important: the people around us. 
We become so engulfed in our work that we cause ourselves to turn down opportunities, such as meeting Steve Jobs or attending the funeral of someone who touched us deeply.
“The Moral of the Story” was a good reminder that we cannot fully control our fate, and the only way that we will enjoy our lives is if we enjoy the journey along the way and make time for what really matters. Ironically, my decision to attend this event was a spontaneous one, but I am glad that I followed my gut feeling and heard all that these speakers had to say. This event was inspiring, and I hope to see more like it in the future.

After six years of gridlock, it’s no surprise that Congress is one of the most unpopular institutions in America. With an approval rating of 13 percent, according to a January 2014 Gallup Poll, the United States legislature has now been less popular than cockroaches and colonoscopies consistently since 2012.
More and more hands point to party polarization as the root cause of the U.S. Congress’s unpopularity. As the Republicans and Democrats drift solidly to the right and left, respectively, it’s not hard to see why the word “compromise” has become a form of political suicide.
Yet, growing divisions within each party seem to be changing the status quo. Cracks, which began Edward Snowden’s leak of classified documents belonging to the National Security Agency (NSA) last year, may be growing in the dam of congressional fundamentalism.
On Wednesday, Senator Rand Paul (R–Ky.) filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration for the NSA’s collection of bulk phone data records. According to The New York Times, Paul stated, “Can a single warrant allow the government to collect all your records, all the time? I don’t think so.”
This announcement likely incited the celebration of the millions of libertarian voters that comprise a majority of Paul’s base of support. It’s no surprise that the NSA’s wiretapping ways yield comparisons to Orwell’s “Big Brother,” the ideological enemy of libertarians worldwide.
Although Paul’s objections have largely been dismissed by his own party, he is far from alone in his crusade. The NSA leaks and the subsequent protests regarding Internet freedom and privacy have mobilized an army of angry voters from college-age youth — a traditionally liberal voting bloc, according to The Huffington Post. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has also filed against the NSA’s programs, intending to question, or even overthrow, the NSA’s legal status.
The ACLU and Paul are more than unlikely bedfellows, but this partnership is not quite without precedent. Last March, Paul led a 13-hour filibuster over drone strikes, attacking the administration’s defense of targeted killings. 
More recently, the ACLU has brought its own lawsuit against the Obama administration for using drone strikes outside the context of armed conflict and basing its attacks on vague legal standards, a closed executive process, and evidence withheld from the courts.
Both the NSA’s potential abuse of power and the Obama administration’s expansion of drone strikes seem to strike a common nerve between Big Brother-fearing libertarians and “hippie” liberals. But what might this reaction mean as part of a larger, political trend?
It’s easy to forget that the 2014 midterm elections are nearly upon us, and in the not-quite-distant future, the 2016 presidential election lurks like a shadow on the horizon. Already, potential candidates are gearing up for war, staging fundraisers and publicity stunts left and right while they do their best to shore up their respective power bases.
A new axis seems to be emerging on the political scene. While once politicians debated primarily economics and religion, personal freedom has now become a rallying cry for future generations of voters. The Republican Party is finding its foundations shaken after discovering that years of extreme right beliefs have driven away a bounty of young voters with new ideas and full pockets. The Southern strategy is all but guaranteed to die off with the Baby Boomers, and the Tea Party has been dismissed to the highlands of Appalachia and the empty plains of Alaska.
Where do we go from here? It’s clear that the two-party system is on shaky ground, but without the removal of first-past-the-post voting, the donkey and elephant are likely here to stay. The European model of coalitions and multitudes of parties is unlikely to transfer to the United States, where third parties like the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have little chance of getting their voices heard in any serious national vote.
Yet the political scene is shifting beneath our feet, and it’s liable to turn inside-out at any moment. It’s impossible to tell the future, but forecasting it is within reach. Yes, the 2014 midterm elections are approaching, bringing with them the potential of new policies and new directions. And soon afterward, the campaign for the 2016 White House will begin in earnest, and our country’s changes will shift into full focus.
For now, however, we can only watch and wait as our horses gallop toward the finish line. The 2014 and 2016 storms will come in their own due time. Beyond that, who knows? One thing is clear, though: It’s shaping up to be one hell of a decade.

Income inequality has become an increasingly common term in the last three years. 
Occupy Wall Street’s emergence in 2011, with its rhetoric of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent, suggested the potency of income inequality as a political issue. 
Elizabeth Warren’s (D–Mass.) skyrocketing national appeal, fueled by her pointed advocacy for the American middle class, hinted at the reservoir of support available for a savvy candidate willing to give voice to many Americans’ sense of unfair economic treatment. 
Bill de Blasio expertly tapped into this sentiment throughout his successful campaign for mayor of New York City, trumpeting that New York told a “tale of two cities” — rich and poor — that needed to be reconciled. 
Finally, President Barack Obama carried the baton into 2014 during his State of the Union Address: “Today, after four years of economic growth, those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled.”
What facts support this rhetoric? The disappearance of well-paying manufacturing jobs, which historically ushered a broad swath of Americans into the middle class, is blamed for this rise in income inequality. 
The American middle class today can handily be described as an hourglass — wide at the top and bottom, where it is populated by the rich and the poor respectively, and narrow in the middle, due to a shrinking middle class.
Even more compelling is the available data. The single most arresting statistic, drawn from the 2012 Economic Report of the President, states that between 1979 and 2007, real after-tax income grew roughly 38 percent for 99 percent of Americans and 278 percent for the top one percent. Americans in the 81st to 99th percentiles saw a real income growth of 65 percent in those three decades. 
Meanwhile, the top one percent in that quintile enjoyed more than four times as much income growth as the rest of this wealthiest group of Americans. Truly, Occupy Wall Street’s slogan — “We are the 99 percent!” — was empirical gold.
How do our political parties respond to these statistics? Republicans argue that income inequality is the natural consequence of differently talented individuals competing in a free marketplace. 
The promise of high incomes motivates some individuals to work hard and take entrepreneurial and innovative risks that may create both great personal wealth and whole new industries. Capitalism, governed by the invisible hand of economics, rewards each individual according to his talent and his work ethic, and differing incomes merely represent the differing value of each individual in the marketplace. Therefore, while income inequality may be disquieting in the short run, it produces such goods and services in the long run as to make the daily life of a poor person today more convenient than that of a rich person decades ago.
This argument is sound, but it does not address the recent spike in income inequality. The post-WWII era, a halcyon ideal of the American conservative, was marked by historically low income inequality. How can the American conservative then, with a straight face, dismiss spiking income inequality today as a minor byproduct of the machinery of capitalism? 
After all, the conservative vision seeks order at nearly all costs. A democracy driven by great disparity in wealth is vulnerable to angry populism, in addition to mob rule and its attendant chaos.
Journalist for The New Yorker George Packer eloquently observed that inequality, by dividing us from one another, “makes it harder to imagine the lives of others.” Such failure of imagination is the death knell of a democracy, for democracy demands us to intelligently select the best possible course of action for our country and all our fellow citizens and trust that they can and will do the same.
Though Democrats brought income inequality to the forefront of the national political conversation, their solutions are short-sighted. 
No sane liberal would propose a scheme of perfect egalitarianism, but while equality of income may be utopian, equality of opportunity is not. 
Liberal solutions too often seek to raise taxes on the rich, but this redistribution of wealth — after incomes have already been established in the marketplace — chases a problem rather than confronting it. 
Smarter solutions, including public investments in education, infrastructure, and sustainable energy, would create numerous middle-class jobs and lessen widespread income inequality. By driving middle-class growth, the hourglass could be filled out for decades to come, rather than moving wealth by state fiat from the rich to the poor.

Last Sunday, Copenhagen Zoo euthanized an 18-month-old giraffe named Marius via bolt gun to the head. Afterward, the giraffe was dissected in front of a crowd of zoo-goers and fed to the lions, according to CNN. 
The death of Marius has been met with public outcry, especially given that a petition to save the healthy young giraffe’s life circulated the Internet and failed. While the death of the giraffe was tragic, the zoo was well within its rights to kill the animal. Copenhagen Zoo supporters claim that the giraffe was euthanized to conserve space and resources, as well as to avoid inbreeding. The zoo also claimed that Marius’s genetic makeup was already well represented in his breeding program, according to NPR. 
Copenhagen Zoo critics claim that the zoo killed Marius because it was no longer cost effective to keep him; he was no longer a baby animal that brought in crowds. Some have suggested that Marius could have been sent to a different zoo, or released, or simply kept near Copenhagen. But none of these solutions are as easy as they seem, and all cost money.
This debate brings up important questions about the role and purpose of zoos. Our cultural image of zoos is that of a place where endangered animals are conserved, but this view is overly simplistic. Zoos serve as conservation centers for endangered animals, but they are also institutions with limited resources, and keeping animals — especially long-living animals — is not cheap. The zoo does not have endless resources to funnel into the preservation of all of their animals, especially ones that are not genetically rare and, therefore, in need of special preservation effort.
This reality is neither clean nor pretty, but that does not change the circumstances and problems that these zoos face.
Admittedly, perhaps the zoo should not have performed a public autopsy on the animal, but even that was a rare, voluntary opportunity for any zoo-goers who wished to learn about giraffe anatomy. As for feeding the body to the lions, while again the zoo could have been more sensitive about the public nature of the disposal of Marius’s remains, feeding the meat to other animals that require it to live is not something shameful.
Marius’s death was certainly tragic and unfortunate because he was a unique living thing, but each of the 10.2 million land animals killed for food in the United States in 2011 was a special living thing as well. The Copenhagen Zoo merely made the mistake of putting the manner and aftermath of the animal’s death within the sphere of public knowledge.

Last Monday, President Subra Suresh announced ProSEED to the campus community via email. ProSEED is a program created to provide Carnegie Mellon students and affiliates with funding to facilitate the growth of early-stage seed projects. President Suresh announced that the program will be launched immediately and that it will serve as a support network for various seed-funding initiatives to assist various members of the campus community.
The Tartan commends President Suresh for enacting ProSEED quickly in response to student and faculty suggestions for improvement that he received during his campus-wide listening tours. 
The initiative arrives just under eight months after President Suresh was inaugurated on July 1. President Suresh enacted this new program as part of the category “Seed Funding of New Ideas,” which he identified as one of five areas of continued dialogue between himself and campus members.
It is promising to see that President Suresh has taken into consideration what he has heard on his listening tours and is beginning to provide tangible programs in response to the concerns that many people have brought to light. The speed with which President Suresh announced this program, as well as the clear intentions and identifiable benefits of the program, are impressive.
ProSEED funds projects to enhance the campus community and campus culture. One application available through ProSEED is Crosswalk. According to President Suresh’s email, grants given through this application can be used to fund projects across multiple departments, more sections of popular courses for non-majors, and various campus life enhancements. Another application, Simon Initiative Seed Grants, can be used for projects that “use data-driven learning technologies,” according to the email.
These grants are clearly intended to enhance student, faculty, and staff life, and President Suresh has provided a clear way for community members to secure them for their projects.
As President Suresh continues his listening tour throughout the academic year, The Tartan hopes that he will provide further specific ways in which he is addressing the five categories of interest that he identified in October toward the start of his presidency. The announcement of ProSEED is promising; it is looking hopeful that the remaining four categories will be addressed in the same fashion.

Tensions are high between technology companies, like Google and Facebook, in Silicon Valley and the residents of San Francisco.
The cause of the ruckus is the presence of mammoth shuttle buses employed to ferry around technology company employees that have been illegally using city bus stops as their own private pick up points, The New York Times reports.
Residents are upset not only by the lack of consequences the companies face — as stopping in a public bus stop should carry a fine of $279 — but also the wealth divide and domination of previously low-income neighborhoods by the wealthy “techies.” One only has to look around at the number of Google backpacks or Dropbox t-shirts on campus to see the number of Carnegie Mellon students getting involved in the technology world of the Silicon Valley and who may soon be thrown into this arising conflict.
Obviously, companies who are paying up to six-figure salaries to its mid-level employees, according to The New York Times, have no excuse for not at least paying a reasonable rate to the city of San Francisco for use of their bus stops. 
These companies wrongfully act as if giving the honor of their presence to the city makes this bad behavior excusable when it is clearly not. There is no excuse for these companies to not be good corporate citizens.
On the opposite side of the coin, the tactics being used by San Francisco residents in this class struggle are unacceptable as well. The New York Times reports that public campaigns targeting lone employees in their neighborhood and breaking windows of the contested buses are some of the methods being used by protesters.
Are complaints against the current busing system valid? Yes, of course protesting illegal behavior is valid, but isolation tactics and violence are not solutions to either the bus issue or the broader class struggles. Income inequality is a huge problem in this country but one that must be dealt with through legislation, not public shaming.
