I’m proud to announce that the champion of the Tartan Fantasy Football League is former Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team, GOAT but Ironically!
After the regular season, our league of eight was cut in half, with Editor-in-Chief Nora Mattson’s team newz, News Editor Adam Tunnard’s team Slugs, former Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123, and my team Gin and Bear It out of the competition. The remaining  teams battled it out in two semifinal matchups, and obviously, the finals to establish bragging rights.
Semifinal 1: GOAT but Ironically over futbol, 101.82 to 84.18
Though Sio’s GOAT but Ironically was trailing earlier in the week, it pulled past Le’s futbol with a trio of solid performances: this season’s breakout star Patrick Mahomes, quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, put up 18.02 points from 243 passing yards and two touchdowns; Los Angeles Rams star running back Todd Gurley scored 24.40 points with two touchdowns, and Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Carson added 20.80 points with 119 yards on the ground and a touchdown. It was enough to overcome some lower starters, including Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen, who scored zero points.
For Le’s futbol, Arizona Cardinals running back David Johnson led the way with 16.10 points, but she left a lot of points on the table. Her bench quarterback Matt Ryan, of the Atlanta Falcons, scored 25.04 points, while her starting quarterback, Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts, scored a paltry 9.68 points. With the loss, Le went to the third-place matchup, while Sio punched her ticket to the championship.
Semifinal 2: TARTAN FANTASY over Last Manning Standing, 109.46 to 55.28
Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY demolished Miller’s Last Manning Standing in this semifinal matchup. Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson had a 22.36-point performance, from 294 yards through the air and two touchdowns. Several other starters contributed, including Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCafferty and Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin. After a mediocre regular season with many ups and downs, Qian found herself in the championship, almost like a 9-7 team sneaking into the sixth-seed wild card spot and going to the Super Bowl.
After leading the Tartan League for several weeks earlier in the season, Miller’s Last Manning Standing found itself sitting on the outside looking in. Barely scoring half as many points as TARTAN FANTASY, Miller only had two starters who scored in double digits: New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara with 16.30 points, and Denver Broncos kicker Brandon McManus with 10 points. Miller went on to face off against Le in the consolation game, while Qian took on Sio.
Third Place Game: futbol over Last Manning Standing, 84.88 to 79.64
This consolation game proved to be an improvement for both team, especially Miller’s Last Manning Standing, but Le’s futbol still came out on top. For Le, Luck rebounded from the previous week and scored 21.58 points with a 357-yard and two-touchdown performance. While New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski didn’t score any points, her other starters made up for the deficit.
For Miller, Kamara came through yet again, leading Last Manning Standing with 22.50 points, while Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston added 14.84 points. Still, it wasn’t enough, ending a season that began with high hopes for a championship. On the flip side, Le went into the season with no fantasy football knowledge, and she’s now one of the most experienced of the Tartan League.
The Championship: GOAT but Ironically over TARTAN FANTASY, 132.22 to 129.06
In this high-scoring championship game, Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY came close to pulling off the upset, but Sio’s GOAT but Ironically came back late to snatch the Tartan League Crown. Again, Mahomes led GOAT but Ironically, this time with 28.22 points from 273 passing yards and three touchdowns. Three other starters scored over 20 points, Carson with 23.60 points, Rams wide receiver Robert Woods with 22.40 points, and the Baltimore Ravens Defense with a stellar 20 points.
TARTAN FANTASY boasted the Championship-high 36.46 points from Watson, as well as consistent performances from McCafferty and Baldwin. But while most of Qian’s team showed up, Green Bay Packers tight end Jimmy Graham was the difference, posting just 3.40 points, and allowing Sio to pull ahead for the victory.
And that is it for this season of Tartan fantasy football.

Friday afternoon’s FA Cup fourth round drew together the red of north London and the red of Manchester as its standout tie. Arsenal found themselves newly rejuvenated this season under new management in the form of Unai Emery, achieving a whopping twenty game unbeaten streak, all while Manchester United were having their worst ever start to a Premier League season, as Jose Mourinho began to crumble in his third season at the helm. Their 44 points and sixth place standing have all but confirmed people’s suspicions of Mourinho’s inability to perform in his third season with a team.
As for Arsenal, the end of 2018 and the halfway point of the English soccer season saw a mild drop in form and a change of management for a finally fed up Manchester United. But the most dramatic point of the season was when Mourinho was fired on the Dec. 13. Then, on Dec. 19, Gunnar Solskjær, The Baby-Faced Assassin, took over. About a month later and the two titans of English football stepped onto Arsenal’s home pitch to fight it out for a place in the FA Cup Round of 16.
The importance of the game couldn’t be understated, with both teams fielding what were primarily their first teams, when second squads often find their way into FA cup games. To start the game, however, Solskjær replaced in form forwards Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford with out of favour Romelu Lukaku and ex-Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez. 31 minutes into the game, the latter two combined for a strike into the back of the net by Sanchez putting Manchester United 1-0 against his old club.
Two minutes later and Jessie Lingard made it 2-0, before Arsenal’s mercurial striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang halved the deficit right before the break. A vicious second half saw Arsenal attempt to work their way back into the game with David De Gea making a few brilliant saves before Anthony Martial came off the bench to seal the game with a goal less than 10 minutes from full time. The final was United 3 and Arsenal 1.
Aside from still being eligible to win the trophy and the prestige that winning a game of this caliber brings, the implications for Manchester United are huge. Having endured for too long Jose Mourinho’s negative style of play, paired with his widely detested off the pitch antics, the arrival of Solskjær has brought new faith to United fans.
Solskjær won his first game in charge 5-1 against Cardiff city, making him the first manager of a United team to score five goals since the retirement of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson way back in 2013. Certainly, against out of form Cardiff a win was expected, but five goals never are. After handily defeating weaker competition for a few consecutive games, United had big wins against both North London giants, Tottenham and Arsenal, in the span of a couple of weeks. Solskjær made his presence known.
In his 37 days in charge so far, Man United has played and won each of their eight games, scoring a total of 22 goals and conceding only five. The ex-Man United player has spoken widely of his appreciation of the clubs historically famous open and attacking style of play and has adopted this to great effect. His player management has also been fantastic, unleashing the best out of players like Matic, Lindelof, Martial, and Lingard who underperformed under Mourinho. This change has been seen especially in Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba, with the former contributing directly to a goal every 88 minutes under Solskjær, a 40-minute improvement from his stats under Mourinho. Pogba too has scored five and assisted four in seven games under Solskjær, up from five goals and four assists in 20 games under Mourinho.
Manchester United have a new lease on life and they are having a better run of form than they have had in a long while. Less than a month and a half ago Manchester United sat in sixth place far off from even the next highest team, seemingly doomed for mid table obscurity. Now they have equal points with Arsenal in the league and only three behind fourth place Chelsea means a shout for the top four is realistic and reentry into the Champions League by that means seems possible. Fans have begun to dream again. Only one question remains, who will stop the Baby-Faced Assassin’s United team?
Up next for United is a series of league matches, followed by their Champions League matchup against Paris Saint-Germain in the quarterfinal round. The last time Manchester United won the Champions League was under the reign of Christiano Ronaldo.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind of New Orleans Saints’ fans to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous non-calls or to take arms against a sea of referees and by opposing do nothing.
It’s a rough week to be a Saints fan, and frankly, a rough life to be a Saints fan. The NFC Championship against the Los Angeles Rams last week exemplified that. After the should have been pass interference call in the red zone, the Saints settled for a field goal, which allowed the Rams to get back downfield to tie the game and send it to overtime. If the Saints converted on third down, they would keep the ball inside the 10-yard line. They’d run down the clock. They’d hit a last-second field goal, or score a touchdown, to put the game out of reach, sending them to the Super Bowl. Instead, the Rams won in overtime.
After the game, the league called Saints head coach Gary Payton to say, “yeah, the officiating crew actually missed two penalties on that play.” Sometimes, fact is a lot funnier than fiction. The ineptitude of the officiating crew aside, the NFL keeps shooting itself in the foot, and some fans are starting to catch onto the officials’ gambling habits. Brad Puskar, resident of Pittsburgh and professional home football commentator says, “The NFL is the most rigged sport there is.” I asked him about basketball, and he told me that he doesn’t believe basketball is actually a sport. Maybe someday the NFL will realize that it is losing its most important fan, Puskar, to the league’s inability to control the vices of the least important people on the field: the referees.
Hopefully, the NFL learns a lesson from this and allows every single play to be reviewed, actually forcing every single play to be reviewed. It only makes sense. There will never be a mistake from a referee again, and the people, like Brad Puskar, will be able to tell the referees the exact right call on Twitter. Our favorite game will be even more interactive and responsive to the desires of the people, and someday, we won’t even need to have referees on the field. We’ll be able to vote on our smart devices for the right call. It will be a true democracy.
Hopefully, the referees don’t ‘blow’ a call against the Patriots, or there will be a riot of Bostonians, a truly terrifying bunch, against the league offices. Their accents will scare anybody, Roger Goodell included.

We’ve reached the end of football season, and the New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl again. It’s old hat at this point to have Bill Belichek and Tom Brady face off against a team that, historically, has struggled to find themselves in the ultimate game of the season. The script was written 10 years ago and hasn’t changed much since, but maybe the Los Angeles Rams, led by Jared Goff and Todd Gurley, could break out to drive the Patriots dynasty into a new era. If the Patriots win another Super Bowl ring, Belichek will become the oldest coach ever to win a Super Bowl. Tom Coughlin is currently the oldest coach, after their second destruction of the Patriots. If the Rams win, Sean McVay will become the youngest coach to ever win. There’s a lot at stake in the game, and the editors of The Tartan are making predictions about it.
Matt Benusa
Sports Editor
A friend told me that the Rams are going to lose, just because they’re not in the NFC East. Tom Brady is 1-3 against the NFC East in Super Bowls, and I’m inclined to agree. As an Eagles fan, the season was a real trip as they won game after game in the last half of the season, and then Nick Foles dominated the Saints in the first half of the Divisional playoff game. Then the Saints defense finally stepped up, Foles completed, like, two passes in the second half, and all the dreaming of another Super Bowl ring was brought back down to Earth. It’s just another season. There’s going to be no wild last-minute field goal attempts or Hail Marys, and the game is going to be tepid, at best. Tom Brady is going to be Tom Brady and sail into retirement. There’s no hope for the Rams, or anybody else. Final score: 34-24 Patriots.
Marika Yang
Publisher
Brady will drive the Patriots downfield with less than two minutes left in regulation to score a game-winning field goal. The game is a great juxtaposition of the old dynasty and the new upstart, but the Patriots aren’t going anywhere. Probably never at this rate. Final score: 38-35 Patriots.
Sujay Uktarsh
Pillbox Editor
Sujay told me “As a Patriots fan, the Patriots are, unabashedly, the best team in the league. I have a feeling that Brady wasn’t playing as well as he could have throughout the season so he could save his energy for the Super Bowl. So based on the previous fact and theory, my prediction is that the first half, the Patriots will play terribly, but the second half, we’ll see classic Tom Brady throw amazing passes. He’ll win the game with a clutch last-minute victory.” Final score: 31-28 Patriots.
Jacob Paul and Adam Tunnard
Layout Manager and News Editor
Adam says that he played football in high school, therefore his prediction is entirely accurate. In spite of not paying attention to football at all this year, he believes the Rams will win because he believes in everything the underdog Rams represent; specifically, a shared hatred of Tom Brady. Who doesn’t hate Tom Brady? All that Jacob says is that the Rams are going to win. It probably has something to do with the nature of the hatred towards the Patriots. No one wants a team that has been consistently great for 15 years to continue to be consistently great. Final score: 17-14 Rams.
Tracy Le, Rebecca Enright, and Anna Boyle
Visual Team
The trio of Rebecca, Tracy, and Anna believe the Rams will win. Tom Brady will feel bad after losing the Super Bowl last year, and he’s going to try something insane that won’t work out. It will be something similar to the Philly Special last year, but the ball is going to get picked off and returned for a Rams touchdown with no time left to win the game. Everyone will be shocked at the poor passing by Tom Brady, as he only completes five passes and three attempts are picked off. But James White keeps the Patriots in it. Final Score: 31-24 Rams.
Wilson Ekern and Frank Hu 
Copy Editor and Operations Manager
Wilson says that the Patriots are fascists: “Bill Belichek and Tom Brady are all Nazis, and they have to lose.” Frank laughed at that, so he obviously agreed. Wilson asked me the point spread for the game, which has the Patriots by 2.5 points, and then immediately said, “Rams by 5.” Frank laughed again, so he obviously agreed, again. This Rams machine kills fascists. Final score: 5-0 Rams.

For some time, scientists have worried about the rapidly rising sea level of the world’s oceans. It was believed that the main contributor to this increase was glaciers in southeast and northwest Greenland releasing large chunks of ice into the Atlantic Ocean. Now, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found that the greatest quantity of ice lost since 2003 was from southwest Greenland, which does not have many glaciers and was not previously considered a threat to sea levels.
Michael Bevis, professor of geodynamics at The Ohio State University and lead author of the study, said, “Whatever this was, it couldn’t be explained by glaciers, because there aren’t many there. It had to be the surface mass — the ice was melting inland from the coastline.”
For 17 years, NASA and Germany have jointly operated the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which uses twin satellites to measure ice loss in Greenland. The data from GRACE has been invaluable to glaciologists, who estimate that Greenland lost 280 gigatons of ice every year between 2002 and 2016 — that equates to 0.03 inches of sea level rise per year. Bevis and his team analyzed data from GRACE and GPS stations on the coasts of Greenland to calculate changes in the overall ice mass of the island. They found that by 2012, the rate of ice loss was four times that just nine years prior. The increase originated from Greenland’s southwest region, which had not been known to be losing ice so quickly.
Bevis believes that the accelerated melting is caused largely by global warming, resulting in inland water streaming into the ocean during the summer. “We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” he said. “But now we recognize a second serious problem: Increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.”
The paper theorizes that the North Atlantic Oscillation, a natural weather phenomenon which brings warmer air to West Greenland, in addition to the naturally clearer skies of the summer season, combines with the effects of human-caused climate change to melt an unprecedented amount of ice every year. While the North Atlantic Oscillation always has the potential to produce runoff from melted ice, its effects would not be so drastic without man-made global warming.
According to Bevis, “These oscillations have been happening forever. So why only now are they causing this massive melt? It’s because the atmosphere is, at its baseline, warmer. The transient warming driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation was riding on top of more sustained, global warming.”
While GPS systems are already in place to monitor Greenland’s ice conditions in the future, there are few resources available specifically to study the southwest region. Following his study’s findings, Bevis hopes that additional instruments will be added.
The findings also have a serious impact on the U.S. Rising sea levels put islands and coastal cities at risk of flooding and severe weather events. Bevis said, “The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming — it’s too late for there to be no effect…the only question is: How severe does it get?”

“Data is more like sunlight than oil,” proclaimed Google CFO Ruth Porat this week at the World Economic Forum. “It is like sunshine, we keep using it and it keeps regenerating."
The data-as-sunshine idea is quickly replacing the old motto of the information age:  “data is the new oil.” Though the sunshine simile isn’t new and Google isn’t the only corporation to push it, Porat’s remark raised eyebrows around the tech industry, as it came a day after Google was fined €50 million ($57 million) in France for failing to provide adequate transparency and obtain necessary consent for gathering user data under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.
Google, like almost all companies offering free services, collects staggering amounts of user data in order to create “smarter” advertisements — and it works. Google made $27.77 billion revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone, with $24 billion of that from ads.
The GDPR rules, which went into effect this summer, require informed user consent to data collection. The GDPR is why many websites now give visitors a long list of checkboxes to opt in or out of various types of data collection. American companies and websites are required to comply with user consent rules if they handle personal data from European users — including names, email address, and IP address. The companies whose business models depend on collecting user data aren’t thrilled.
“A lot of U.S. companies have dumped everything they do in a consent box and have people waive their rights,” said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate, to the New York Times. Schrems, a lawyer, founded one of the privacy groups that brought the case against Google.
“We’re deeply committed to... the consent requirements of the GDPR,” said a Google spokesperson in reference to this week’s ruling on the fine.
It’s understandable why Google, increasingly cast as a data-monopolizing villain in privacy controversies, would want consumers to think of data like sunlight — free, clean, available for universal use, and ultimately harmless — instead of oil. Creating this new conceptual framework works in favor of companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft because it avoids a direct comparison between tech industry leaders and greedy oil barons.
The original comparison of data to oil is attributed to English mathematician Clive Humby, who drew the analogy in 2006. Michael Palmer of Britain’s Association of National Advertisers elaborated in a 2013 Guardian article: “Data is just like crude. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value.” As data analytics has become centered in the tech economy, those who have the biggest datasets and the capacity to analyze them have the most power.
No analogy is perfect. But describing data as sunshine portrays companies like Google as cheerfully benign gatherers of a limitless natural resource, when privacy advocates see them as playing a more insidious role.
Data doesn’t come from the sky: it comes from users. While it’s still unclear if a person’s data can really ‘belong’ to them, tech companies take advantage of practical and ethical ambiguities to gather as much data as they can in the name of creating more targeted advertisements.

The Gallery Crawl in the Cultural District took place on Jan. 25, the last Friday night of the month. From 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m., the entire district was a collective art feast filled with live jazz jam sessions, local artist pop-up shops, and different galleries’ fascinating exhibitions.
Start the night with tapas and drink at the Backstage Bar. Let the drum, the organ, and the guitar loosen your nerves and refresh your senses for a night of aesthetic adventure. Begin your gallery trip with some local artists’ work on the fourth floor of Radiant Hall Studio, a non-profit organization dedicated to “create and preserve studio environments for working artists.” Then follow the sound of music downstairs to the first floor, where high schoolers across Allegheny County perform all your favorite songs from High School Musical. It's time to put on a lip-sync show with your best friends in the midst of the crowd!
If jazz and a musical still can’t satisfy your ears, make sure to stop by the Trust Arts Education Glow Gallery where DJ Arie Cole puts on some chill electro house EDM and see your world glow in neon colors.
At 9 p.m., it’s time for the highlight of the night: the new exhibition of Refik Anadol at Wood Street Galleries. However, before you get a chance to enjoy the exhibition, you find yourself in line outside the gallery, shivering in 20°F, with voices in your head repeatedly questioning your devotion for art. But soon, you realize that even though the art is inside, you are surrounded by all kinds of interesting artists and art fanatics. With a curse on the weather, you break the ice. The graphic designers in front of you and rock enthusiasts behind you share insights on all the things about the local art scene that you’ve never heard of including their favorite shops, restaurants, and bars. The cold night and long line become less unbearable. You no longer long for the Infinity Room — the main attraction of the gallery — as the local artists have already overwhelmed you with all the passionate conversation. 
“I really love the community vibe in the Pittsburgh art scene,” somebody behind you comments, and you nod wholeheartedly while letting the warm glow of local pride shelter you from the brutal late-night wind. As you step into the Infinity Room, light beams travel past you in the perfect precision of a carefully calculated algorithm. The mirrors above and below stretch your boxed reality into infinity. You are astonished by the magical creation of art and science, reluctant to even blink your eyes. At 10 p.m., you end your fulfilling night with a three-minute experience of infinite beauty.

Cut to a pink spray-painted car with a “7” graffitied on its window. A crew of women in street-style fashion chill on the porch of a pink house drenched in bright neon purple and pink light. In the midst of it all is Ariana Grande, her frosty purple lipstick shining as bright as the diamonds on her neck.
A little over a month after her last release, “imagine,” pop princess Ariana Grande dropped her latest single and music video, “7 Rings.” Where “imagine” was a steamy song of wistful denial, “7 Rings” is a trap-based reworking of “My Favorite Things” from The Sound of Music. Reminiscent of countless rappers, Grande flaunts her riches and a bad bitch energy.
But, like “imagine,” Grande has “borrowed” from Japanese culture and language for “7 Rings.” In the video, Japanese appears underneath the song title a few seconds into the video. The set is decorated with Japanese anime-like characters and bottles of sake, and blurred katakana flashes onto the screen at seemingly random intervals. The marketing for both songs utilized Japanese and a kind of Harajuku aesthetic, plastering Grande’s Instagram with captions in Japanese and the words “7 Rings” spelled out in katakana-looking English.
At first, with “imagine,” it seemed like Grande was simply taking inspiration from the neon, eccentric Harajuku culture, having taken lessons to learn Japanese for some time. While the song has nothing to do with Japanese culture (and the lyric video merely adopted a kind of glitchy vaporwave feel), my initial thought was, “How cool! A mainstream artist is using Japanese culture, this’ll help break down the idea that only weeaboos speak Japanese!”
But “7 Rings” is a whole different creature, essentially toeing the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation. Rather than feeling like a respectful appreciation for the culture, the marketing for “7 Rings” and the song itself felt like a blatant use of Japanese culture as a purely aesthetic accessory. The language was shaped to spell English words just to look cool, meant to project an anime-like kawaii (“cute” in Japanese) image. Grande has found immense success in cherry-picking the elements of Harajuku culture for her song — but this isn’t the first time she’s done this.
This is part of a bigger problem — one more to add to Grande’s growing list of cultural misdemeanors. From the blatant darkness of her tan to her adoption of AAVE and a mimicry of a “blaccent,” Grande’s appropriation of black culture is consistent and unaddressed. She sings an old song: one of appropriating black culture to appear “edgy” or mature without any of the associated stereotypes or difficulties. We’ve seen it before with Iggy Azalea and Miley Cyrus; utilizing the style of black artists is a common trademark of white pop musicians seeking to project an image of maturity and growth — a movement away from sweet, innocent pop to something more raunchy and tough and “mature.” There is something inherently problematic with taking black stereotypes and using them to project an image of toughness, adultness, and sexual deviance, especially on such an enormous and visible platform. In the case of “7 Rings,” Grande has been accused of copying three black artists: 2 Chainz and his pink trap house aesthetic; Princess Nokia’s song “Mine,” a song that celebrates women of color and their relationship with their hair; and Soulja Boy’s flow from “Pretty Boy Swag,” a rap song with a chipped flow and choppy lyrics. The line “You like my hair, gee thanks, just bought it” in particular takes the complicated relationship between women of color and their hair and puts in the context of “flexing,” and Grande is praised for it whereas women of color are not. To be frank, this is a clear example of white privilege. White privilege is using Japanese culture as an accessory for the aesthetic and being praised for being “original.” White privilege is using black culture and sound without any actual repercussions of being black.
Now, all this isn’t to say we should “cancel” Ariana Grande or publicly shame her. For her, this past year was about as painful and sad as it can get, and piling on harsh critique is not kind nor is it right. As a longtime fan, I’ve found power in her transformation and marveled at her ability to emerge empathetic, loving, and kind. I’ve appreciated seeing her relate to and take inspiration from my culture — to be entirely honest, I was excited and happy. But this is not an excuse to continue appropriating people of color. As more of the public becomes more aware of Ariana Grande’s actions, I can only hope that, on the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation, that she leans more onto the former.

Deciem founder Brandon Truaxe was found dead in Toronto, Canada on Jan. 21, 2019. The National Post reported that "it is understood he fell from a condominium building near Toronto’s downtown." Truaxe's boyfriend and current Deciem employee Riyadh Sweedan confirmed, stating "I don’t think he jumped. I think he fell." He was 40 years old.
The Ordinary's approach to skincare was just as the name implied. By dedicating its budget to research and development instead of traditional marketing, the low price tag and the simple, almost pharmaceutical-looking packaging that houses the product don't appear to be much. However, The Ordinary had been able to pump out inexpensive products that got both everyday skincare fanatics and online influencers singing praises.
The Ordinary is a brand owned by skincare company Deciem, both founded by former CEO Brandon Truaxe, who was born Ali Roshan. Although Deciem has been successful holistically, The Ordinary has earned the most critical acclaim. The company prides itself in being "the abnormal beauty company." Deciem sells their products at a mere fraction of its competitor's prices, baffling both everyday skincare aficionados and online beauty gurus alike. Seemingly every review online expresses disbelief that a product could blow drugstore prices out of the water yet perform on-par with luxury brands. "If we have one goal as a group, it's to add accountability to the beauty business. People assume it's a scam, but the world evolves and things get better and better," Truaxe is quoted on the front page.
However, things quickly took a turn. Throughout 2018, founder and then-CEO Brandon Truaxe had an unnerving presence on The Ordinary's Instagram profile, so much so that his usage of Instagram had been likened to President Donald Trump's erratic usage of Twitter. Controversies ranged from disrespecting users in Instagram comments to allegedly insinuating a dark-skinned customer bleach her skin to posting troubling videos on Instagram saying "almost everyone at Deciem has been involved in a major criminal activity, which includes financial crimes and much others... it's all ending now."
In response to the spiraling series of controversies, the Internet did what it appears to do best: publicly boycott the brand. "Anti-haul" videos, those where certain influencers and consumers explain what and why they will not be purchasing certain products or products from certain brands, added Deciem's brand to their list. Some former consumers posted videos of them burning their Deciem products in protest. In May, Sephora, which had previously carried The Ordinary's products, silently pulled the products off their online shelves despite the products' wild success. Ultimately, Truaxe was cut off from Deciem on Oct. 12, 2018. The website and stores were closed down until Oct. 15. Since then, the company picked up where it left off. Both online and brick-and-mortar stores have been running since, and Sephora started phasing The Ordinary back in stock starting December.
However, removing Truaxe from Deciem was not enough to remove him as a controversial figure. On Oct. 20, he posted screenshots of graphic and threatening emails he had sent to one of Deciem's earliest shareholders, Estee Lauder. "I'll be in your hometown in a few hours," the email read. "Please advise if you prefer silicone-based or water-based lubricants for my approach into your criminal, destructive c***s, for the most politically-correct wording. You have now illegally removed access to my phone, email, and social channels. I’m confident that you know the world will have never seen a downfall greater than that of the fraudulent empire ELC, the Lauder family, and those related have built." Consequently, the brand filed a restraining order against Truaxe, which was successful. Truaxe later admitted that the email sent was "admittedly very impolite" and that he was "very angry and confused."
Even while the series of events were unraveling, it was clear that Truaxe was a troubled man. Although he denied having problems with his mental health, the Financial Post shared Truaxe's history of psychiatric hospitalization and diagnosis as psychotic and presumptive bipolar disorder. Additionally, doctors in London revealed that Truaxe was receiving treatment for abuse of crystal meth and magic mushrooms. The eccentricity that once created Deciem's success ultimately led to his partners considering him "a liability."
After a tumultuous 2018, it appears Deciem will spend 2019 recovering. Although I watched Truaxe's mental health deteriorate from afar, seeing the news pop up on my beauty chatter forums came as a massive shock. However, the company did themselves and him a disservice by trying to treat the consequences of Truaxe's mental illnesses as a general PR crisis. Furthermore, the online realm of beauty seemed to gorge in what was considered "drama." Drama channels would "spill the tea" on the issue, laughing at Truaxe's mental instability. Watching the responses without context, an outsider might be left to believe that they were watching gossip spread in a high school movie. Although Truaxe was receiving help, the worldwide lack of mental health resources and awareness failed him. That all being said, Truaxe's behavior was inexcusable on various instances and should not be condoned. However, I hope that this can serve as a reminder of how much work needs to be done in understanding the human mind, both in the medical and humanitarian sense.

Glitter. Glamour. Confidence.
Carnegie Mellon’s second annual Drag Bingo in McConomy Auditorium was nothing less than impressive. The event, hosted by SLICE and ALLIES, was fantastic. The line for the event went straight out the door, along the hallway and up the stairs to the second floor, and for good reason!
Upon entrance to the event, each audience member received two bingo cards that they would use to participate in the games. Double the fun and double the chance to win some prizes, with the small exception of a few lucky audience members, who got a lucky third card under their seats (shh)! Additionally, some yummy treats for snacking were provided by the hosts.
After taking a seat, the show proceeded, beginning with an introduction from senior business student Leo Galvan. Following the introduction, the moment everyone in the audience had been waiting for arrived: seeing Lola LeCroix, a Pittsburgh favorite, and Sharon Needles, winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 4. Lola LeCroix took the stage fiercely, with attitude and a phenomenal stage presence, dancing and having a great time entertaining the audience. Sharon Needles followed her. Both were equally incredible performances, with the crowd frequently erupted in cheers and clapping.
Keeping the night light and fun, Lola and Sharon recounted stories of their past performances and life experiences, roasted some special audience members and laughed along with everyone.
Games were played throughout the night with exciting prizes such as a coffee machine, travel voucher, Amazon gift card, restaurant gift cards, Carnegie Mellon School of Drama tickets, a mini speaker, and a Carnegie Mellon blanket!
Overall, it was a fantastic experience and night, and truly a wonderful time and an exciting event to take part in. Thank you to SLICE and ALLIES for hosting and inviting Lola and Sharon to perform!
It was FABULOUS!

Black Panther, one of Marvel’s three movies released in 2018, earned over $1 billion at the box office, making it the world’s ninth highest grossing film of all time. Now, it’s up for seven Oscar nominations, a new high for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and superhero movies alike. It’s the first superhero movie to get a Best Picture nod from the Academy, but is it well deserved? Could Black Panther actually win Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards? Here are a few reasons why it should.
Unlike the other superhero movies of the franchise, Black Panther is representation that’s been long overdue. The movie isn’t just a CGI driven pummel fest; it provokes conversations about race, gender equality, and prejudice without taking itself too seriously. The powerful women the film portrayed shatter gender norms Marvel still hadn’t quite breached through until that point. Nakia, a fiery woman so much more than T’Challa’s companion, Shuri, the genius behind the suit, and the Dora Milaje, the king’s guard, are some of the strongest female roles Marvel has ever produced. These women held their own in battle and put work and ambition before men and love, and it was empowering to watch.
As for the racial connotations of the film, it provides an interesting outlook on dealing with racism in today’s world with its excellent characterization of both T’Challa and Killmonger, a fan favorite villain. Killmonger carries the sentiment of empowering all developing nations by providing them with the unlimited weapons Wakanda possesses. Hardened by his years in the war and his father’s early death, he sees the solution to racial inequality as more destruction. It’s what made him an incredible villain. He is a complete contrast to T’Challa, who puts Wakanda above all and refuses to believe violence is the answer. They’re both flawed in their approach to dealing with racial inequality in the world. Despite the fact that the movie ends with Killmonger’s death, T’Challa learns from Killmonger and opens Wakanda to the world, ultimately making T’Challa a superhero
completely worth looking up to. The fact that the movie captured this character development brilliantly, without sacrificing its heroics and stunts, makes it a masterpiece well deserving of its Oscar nomination.
Black Panther is by no means a flawless movie, but it meant something for many people who watched it, breaking ground simply for what it tried to do. The execution wasn’t perfect; the film lost its humor here and there, and it killed one of Marvel’s best villains since Loki. Despite that, it’s enough to be deserving of its nomination even without the “Popular Film” category the Academy tried to introduce and promptly postponed. What does this mean for future superhero movies, or in more general terms, commercial blockbusters? Black Panther paves the way for more popcorn films to get prestigious awards recognition, and the repercussions of this are something only time will tell.
Black Panther made millions through its popularity, but its seven Academy Award nominations aren’t just about that. It’s about what this movie meant to people. If other commercial blockbusters in the future can carry a message as important as this movie, a nod from the Academy for them would be befitting.

Top 5 of 2018:
Roma, directed by Alfonso Cuaron - 10/10
This film is one of the best films I’ve seen in a long time. It’s a beautiful, neorealist masterpiece. Set in Mexico during the 1970s, it follows the life of a maid in a middle-class family over the course of the year. Cuaron’s style is perfect for the simple, “slice of life” style of story. He communicates the character’s struggles through the environment, with the camera keenly observing every detail in the frame. Practically every detail, performance, and technical aspect are on point. There is so much effort put in everything, right down to the fully immersive sound design. This is clearly a passion project for Cuaron and it shows. It is easily the best film of the year, and it’s also on Netflix, so there is zero reason to not check it out. 
First Reformed, directed by Paul Schrader - 10/10
From the writer of Taxi Driver comes another carefully paced, methodical, dark character study about a religious man slowly going down the path of extremism. The film barely has any camera movement. It presents itself with a 4:3 aspect ratio and it is filmed with mostly still shots to create a sense of how trapped the main character feels. Ethan Hawke gives his best performances ever, and it’s extremely subtle and makes you feel for his character. If you like dark character dramas that tackle heady themes like religious and political corruption, then check this film out. 
Hereditary, directed by Ari Aster - 10/10
This film is messed up. If you cannot stomach psychological horror or disturbing films, don’t watch this film. For anyone else who is interested in that, this is a really effective horror film about a family slowly going insane after a few tragedies. It is an excellent exploration of the toll grief and mental illness have on a family. There are zero jump scares, and all the horror is derived from atmosphere, tension, and dread. This is one of the best horror films in a long time, and if you’re a fan of the genre, watch this as soon as possible. 
The Favourite, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos - 9/10
Yorgos Lanthimos is now one of the best new directors working today, with his previous films The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer making my top ten in their respective years. His latest film is the best of the bunch. It’s a historical comedy about two women playing mind games with the Queen to win her favor. The comedy is unconventional, filled with pans, fisheye lens shots, snappy dialogue, and quirky performances. This was a highly entertaining, beautiful, and fascinating film, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants an interesting period piece to watch. 
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman - 9/10
Now here is a film I didn’t expect to even crack my top ten, let alone my top five. But yet, Into the Spider-verse blew my expectations and hype out of the water with one of the best animated films of recent memory. It’s easily the best Spider-Man film that has been made, with an unparalleled understanding of the character that does so in an original and interesting way. Pretty much all the visual humor and dialogue had me in stitches. The story had a lot of stakes and danger to it, with the villains having a very threatening presence. The multiple Spider-people were all fantastic, and their dynamic was really fun to watch. Aside from two musical choices during some sad scenes, the music choices were all fantastic. It’s just a fun, entertaining, and well-rounded film overall that can be enjoyed by anyone. 
Honorable mentions: Annihilation, Eighth Grade, If Beale Street Could Talk, Shoplifters, Suspiria, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, The Death of Stalin, Sorry to Bother You, Paddington 2, Free Solo
Bottom 5 of 2018
A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava Duvernay - 1/10
Good god. This film was like watching money burn. It’s an embarrassing contribution to the U.S. GDP, and I can’t believe I paid money to watch this in a theater. Did Disney just think that they could hire someone who hasn’t read a beloved book and never made an adventure/sci-fi film before to churn out this piece of garbage? Everything about this was wrong. The child actors made me want to gouge my eyes out. The visual effects were cheap. The film just felt lazy, like there was no effort put into it. This is one of the worst big budget films I’ve ever seen, and I’d recommend this to film teachers to show their students how not to make a film. 
Robin Hood, directed by Otto Bathurst - 1/10
I mentioned this in a previous review already. I had snuck into this film after watching Creed II, and left after half an hour because it was so gloriously awful. This was one of those films that makes me question Hollywood and the executives who greenlight these productions. The industry is already making less money than normal. How about they greenlight something good and original that people would actually want to watch instead of these half-baked remakes?
Insidious: The Last Key, directed by Adam Robitel - 1/10
Anyone who found this film scary must also find paint drying to be a visceral experience. There isn’t much to say about this film. It’s not scary. It’s not funny. It’s not tense. It’s not disturbing. It’s just not horror. I hope this is the last film in this lame franchise. 
Death Wish, directed by Eli Roth - 1/10
Eli Roth is a hack, and he is only good when Tarantino is directing him. He tries to emulate Tarantino’s style to a certain degree, but it never works because he has zero talent. Also, has Bruce Willis given up on trying to act? It seems like he just does movies nowadays to show that he still exists. Gone are the days of Die Hard, Pulp Fiction, and Unbreakable, where he used to actually emote and care about the films he did. On top of that, the film is so tone deaf. It doesn’t know whether it wants to be an homage to pulpy thrillers from the 70s or whether it wants to be a social statement about modern violence. Normally this wouldn’t matter, but it tries, for some odd reason, to be both and it fails completely. I’m ashamed that I watched this. 
Fifty Shades Freed, directed by James Foley - 1/10
While we are on the subject of being ashamed, I watched this piece of garbage too. This is the antithesis of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. While that trilogy is pretty much perfect and will be remembered for how amazing it is, this trilogy is the exact opposite, where every entry is a disaster. Each sequel is 100 times worse than the previous one, which makes Fifty Shades Freed 10000 times worse than the first one. This is not an exaggeration. Nothing happens in this film. The characters fight. They engage in bland intercourse. Then they go to another location. There is some kidnapping subplot in there somewhere. There’s a car chase that’s basically Audi product placement. Worst of all, this film portrays a really dangerous and unhealthy relationship with no redeemable characters. It actually angers me how badly the relationship is portrayed. It’s not just that the characters have no chemistry. It's an abusive relationship and the film portrays it like a fairy tale, and it's unhealthy and insulting. Anyone who finds that stimulating frankly needs to see a therapist. Thank god this trilogy is over, and we all should celebrate its end. 
Dishonorable mentions: 15:17 to Paris, Unfriended: Dark Web, Skyscraper, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, The Meg, Pacific Rim: Uprising, Cloverfield Paradox, Mute, Truth or Dare, Venom

On the title track of James Blake’s fourth album Assume Form, the British producer and auteur sings, “I can already see that this goes deeper.” Blake asks a series of questions on the opener that structure an album filled to the brim with interesting ideas, while exhibiting a degree of restraint that sets the project apart from his previous work. Blake’s heightened influence over hip-hop production has made its way back to his solo work, as contributions from Travis Scott, Metro Boomin, and the elusive André 3000 feel unique to both genres. If 2016’s The Colour in Anything was the last you heard from James Blake, Assume Form will come across as a substantial left turn. Even if you followed his misadventures in pop-rap projects since, there is no shortage of surprises here, in production and lyrics alike. For all that novelty, the listener is left wondering whether Blake understands exactly how deep his feelings go, or if his lack of understanding is the point.
Across numerous tracks, how Blake explores being in love seems to exist on a surface level. Assume Form, though, is selfish in the way a recluse can be in sharing so much of themselves in a relationship. Blake captures a self-indulgent, self-centered perspective of love that many will roll their eyes at. To debate the merits of that mindset deserves its own article, and numerous think-pieces have already tackled the matter. Even if Blake’s ego is unoriginal, his music maintains singularity.
The most notable disappointments on the record are the collaborations with Metro Boomin and Travis Scott. They are far from unlistenable, and certainly could crack the charts given the superstar appeal of Blake’s collaborators, but they feel especially stagnant on so varied a tracklist. Even Moses Sumney — whose voice and style match Blake’s perfectly on paper — can’t save this leg of the album. In the context of this album, they seem out of place. They bring an upbeat core to the first leg but have little impact on the entirety of the project.
Even if Assume Form is far from the intense darkness of Colour, Blake still crafts a cerebral atmosphere. At points, it feels almost sarcastic. On “Where’s the Catch,” Blake sings “everything’s roses” over a droning, march-like beat. Even so, the track is vibrant and punchy in a way similar to “Timeless” off Colour. André 3000’s appearance is brilliant, as usual. It feels like the perfect emcee feature for a James Blake record. Towards the end of the track, André and Blake’s voices mesh in a mesmerizing, glitchy maze. It is some of Blake’s best production.
Blake casts a wry image of self-doubt on “Where’s the Catch,” a feeling which surfaces a few times on the record, most notably on “Are You in Love.” That track captures a more typical James Blake sound. Part cascading electronica and part love-sick anthem, it is squarely in Blake’s wheelhouse while maintaining the thematic departure. He sings: “I promise you your place is safe. Now what about mine?” The listener — and Blake’s partner — could easily be frustrated by so demanding an ask. In the context of the album, though, the intentions of “Are You in Love” seem deliberate.
That frustration, though, is part of what makes Assume Form work. It would be jarring and disingenuous for Blake to portray his relationship as impervious, or to imply his struggles with mental health were washed away because of a profound connection. This album is Blake pushing himself to accept the truth of his present situation. The darkest corners of his mind were not erased overnight on some given day between 2016 and now. Blake — and, presumably, his partner — are casting light into those corners, together.
Most the project seems to be wrapped in self-critique. It is equal parts cynical and tongue-in-cheek. Blake’s self-loathing washes away on “I’ll Come Too” and “Power On,” with the former tinged in sarcasm and the latter blunt self-indictment. On “I’ll Come Too,” Blake inhabits the most possessive recesses of his mind. He follows his partner around the world, using his success to change plans on a whim. It comes across as creepy, but “Power On” serves to explicitly clarify his nature. Admittedly, the straightforward lyricism makes the listener long for a more mysterious Blake. “Don’t Miss It” is similarly transparent to a fault, but more successful in conveying Blake’s regrets for his behavior, and how he affected those around him. While imperfect, the track feels like a natural conclusion to the British crooner’s arc.
Album closer “Lullaby for My Insomniac” is an ethereal epilogue. Blake speaks directly to his sleepless partner and embodies whatever new version of himself he has wrestled with on the album. It is rather fitting that James Blake’s happy ending is impossibly melancholy, as his voice rings alone, and he drifts off, content.

Netflix Movie Picks of the Week:
Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened 
This is a great Netflix-produced documentary about the failed Fyre Festival, which in 2017 resulted in several lawsuits and endless mockery on the internet. It’s a fascinating and highly entertaining look at the event that is one part shocking and two parts hilarious. It’s amazing that the crew managed to capture all of this footage at the failed event, and the timeliness of the documentary's release only makes it more jaw-dropping. Definitely check this out if you want to see something simultaneously informative and entertaining. 
The Raid: Redemption 
This is simply one of the best action films ever. A group of cops get stuck in a building after they are set up by a crime lord, and it turns into a fight for their survival as they try to make their way out. It is brutal, breathtaking, and relentless. The action is clearly shot, with the handheld aesthetic adding to the grittiness and grime of the setting without being too shaky. It has some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences put to film, with creative choreography, stunts, and kills. Sure, there isn’t much character development, but the film is about the action and doesn’t pretend to be about anything else. It’s an astounding film, and would be great to watch with friends. 
Netflix TV Show Picks of the Week:
Black Mirror: Bandersnatch
This is technically a film, but it is a TV film and an extended Black Mirror special. The newest Black Mirror special is a choose your own adventure story. Viewers are presented with choices through the storyline they can make for the character. This leads to a twisted viewing experience that explores the ideas of free will and control. It is very well done and innovative, and the choices don’t feel cheap. Every small choice gets some sort of pay off. Be sure to go through the different choices for the multiple endings, as that really hammers home the themes of the episode. 
Sacred Games
This is Netflix’s first Indian TV series, but it is nothing at all like the flowery and sanitized Bollywood films that India is famous for. This series is dark and gritty, showing the seedy underbelly of India and the corruption, crime, and raw, real drama that exists within it. The first minute of the first episode features a dog being thrown off a roof with a voiceover deriding God. If that sounds like something you’re interested in, then check this show out. It’s an excellent, well-acted drama that shows the peak of what Indian entertainment can be.

This week, there are two tense dramas being screened in McConomy. 
Boy Erased
This film is about a gay son of a Baptist preacher who is forced to go to a conversion therapy camp after being outed. It’s a very tense, well-acted drama that is unfortunately relevant. The claim can be made that the film is a little manipulative, but given the premise, it is handled in a way that isn’t too cheesy or overdramatic. The film is fairly grounded, even if the story is admittedly predictable. Check this one out on Saturday, but don’t go in expecting an uplifting experience. 
Widows
This film was reviewed in the November movies wrap-up in a previous edition, but this is a very unconventional heist drama. The film follows four widows who have to repay a debt left behind by their husbands by pulling off the last heist. With a story as dense and expansive as this, there is always the threat of the film feeling unfocused and lost. However, this is one of the tightest scripts from last year, with each subplot and element connecting back to the main plot in some way. The twists felt organic and unpredictable, and the character drama and dynamics were really interesting to watch. Every performance was great. The final heist, while short, was satisfying. It’s just an entertaining character piece, and check this one out on Friday or Sunday.

This past December, Carnegie Mellon University acquired the former Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ building in Oakland for 3.75 million dollars.
It has been announced that the College of Fine Arts will utilize the space. Plans have not been specified, but Pam Wigley, Assistant Dean for Communications at the College of Fine Arts, told the Pittsburgh City Paper that the space may be used “for media and performance work, as well as for film screenings by the Miller Institute.” Another option under consideration, reported by the  Pittsburgh Post Gazette, is building one or two stages, presumably for the drama program. Some College of Fine Arts students suspect that the school aims to expand their film and photography programs.
In a statement released at the time of the sale, Dan Martin, Dean of Carnegie Mellon’s College of Fine Arts, explained that “for several years now, the School of Art has sought additional space for expanding education and creative efforts around time-based art (performance art, media, etc.). Additionally, the School of Drama has been enriching its media design and film/production curricula significantly with the addition of new faculty, staff and course offerings.” Dean Martin could not be reached for this story, but The Tartan intends to speak with him about the future of the College of Fine Arts.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, the former residents of the building, have been teaching generations of students the fundamentals of producing, directing, shooting and editing since it was founded in 1971. Film screenings were regularly held in the Melwood Screening Room. A range of photography courses, including black-and-white film development, were offered to students.
The non-profit, which merged with Pittsburgh Center for the Arts in 2006, had been experiencing financial troubles for years. By the time the sale of the building was announced, Pittsburgh Filmmakers and Center for the Arts had fallen into $500,000 of debt, stopped offering classes, and made major staff cuts.
Though this does mean an end for Pittsburgh Filmmakers, many see it as a new chapter for the organization. They have moved into the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts location and recently began offering classes again. A very forward-looking article about the nonprofit was published in the Pittsburgh City Paper’s Jan. 9 issue. Christine Holtz, President of the PF/PCA Board of Directors, told the City Paper that “Filmmakers started as a way for the community to have access to expensive analog filmmaking and photography equipment. We’re returning to those roots, where we’re going to be offering artists services and short-term classes. We’re just not going to be servicing universities anymore.”
Located at 377 Melwood Ave, Carnegie Mellon’s purchase comes amidst a continued effort to expand into the Oakland area. In Nov. 2018, Carnegie Mellon’s housing department acquired the Fifth and Neville apartment building on Forbes Avenue. Both of the recently acquired properties are of further proximity to campus than Webster apartments, Fairfax apartments, and Residence on Fifth.

CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University’s institute dedicated to security and privacy, has a new director: Dr. Lorrie Cranor, the FORE Systems Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Public Policy. Cranor also directs the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory (CUPS) and the University’s Privacy Engineering Masters program — the only masters program of its kind in the world. Outside of her career at Carnegie Mellon, Cranor served as the Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission in 2016, and was chosen as director after what was described in a university press release, distributed by PRNewswire, as a “rigorous international search.”
In a university press release, Cranor described herself as “honored and thrilled” about her new position. “I look forward to supporting CyLab’s ongoing success and bolstering research aimed at making our increasingly digital world safe and trustworthy.”
Starting out, Cranor wants to learn more about the interests of students, staff, and faculty within CyLab, and create a research and logistics roadmap for the next few years, which could include aspects such as what areas need more researchers, which on-campus researchers in similar areas should be brought under the umbrella of Cylab, and expanding corporate partnerships and community outreach.
“[Carnegie Mellon] is somewhat unique in our interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to security and privacy and I’m hoping we can find ways to better leverage that,” Cranor said in an interview with The Tartan.
Outreach was also very much on her mind, especially to women, a demographic lacking in the security field. “At [Carnegie Mellon] we are involved in a number of efforts to promote diversity in general, but in the scurity area in particular,” Cranor told The Tartan. Cranor cited the fact that Carnegie Mellon is due to host the Facebook and Lockheed Martin sponsored Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS 2019) conference in March, stating, “We’re [excited] about being a sponsor of this event and bringing women security professionals and students to Pittsburgh.”
From the unsettling revelations about how Facebook compiled and misused user data to Russian interference in the 2016 election, cybersecurity has been a hot topic in national news. When asked for commentary on these events through the lens of a researcher actively working in that field, Cranor first pointed out that many privacy experts actually found these headlines unsurprising, but she did note that “they have been somewhat of a wake-up call for the general public.”
“People are starting to realize how little control they have over their personal data and how their data might be used against them,” she reflected. “It remains to be seen whether this elevated level of concern results in long term behavior changes or new privacy laws.”
The concerns within the cybersecurity field are diverse and complex — Cranor says that “[i]t’s hard to point to just one big [one]” as the overarching concern in the field. Besides the traditional threats the field handles, Cranor gives the examples of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) devices as potential new cybersecurity concerns. However, she points out that artificial intelligence could also be part of the solution to combat cyber threats.
All these concerns make the public understandably pessimistic about the fate of privacy and security in the digital world. Cranor rebukes this cynicism, saying that “[if she] didn’t think there was any hope, [she] wouldn’t be working in this field.” She does share the concerns about fading privacy in the digital age but believes that “it is not too late to reverse this trend.” Cranor says that “security is somewhat of an arms race, but it is something that I think we can keep up with.” She maintains that, while it is nearly impossible to achieve 100 percent trustworthiness or 100 percent security, 100 percent “is usually not the bar [researchers in the field] are going for.”
With so much of our lives stored online, and with digital trends changing as fast as the weather, one sure thing in our uncertain future is the growing importance of cybersecurity. For Cranor, that’s why cybersecurity “is such an exciting area to work in.”

Fans of Carnegie Mellon’s ever-mythologized 15-112 class, titled “Fundamentals of Programming,” will be happy to know that its creators, Professor David Kosbie and Professor Mark Stehlik have turned their eyes to another project: the creation of the website CS Academy, a free computer science educational tool aimed at high schoolers.
The project, now generally available for the fall on their website, https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/, hopes to become the link between widely available programming courses aimed at younger kids and the harder computer science courses that start late teens on a track towards programming in a professional capacity. Erin Cawley, the program director for CS Academy, told WESA that while there are resources available to students from K-8, they tend to “drop off” before exposing students to more challenging programming problems.
CS Academy hopes to engage students using graphic and visual based Python programming. In a Carnegie Mellon University press release, Kosbie cited the fact that students often have trouble debugging programs, and that lessons dealing with graphics make it easy for students to see what is going wrong with their code.
The project was piloted in schools over the past couple of semesters, mostly in Western Pennsylvania, a relationship no doubt benefiting from the program direction of Erin Cawley, the founder of the Computer Science Teachers Association of Pittsburgh. Over winter break, CS Academy officially launched, now offering teachers a chance to request a demo on their website.
The gap between beginner and advanced programming instruction is not news to those that study computer science education, and many have tried to address it as part of an attempt to diversify the field of computer science. A 2001 paper by former professor Lenore Blum titled “Women in Computer Science: the Carnegie Mellon Experience” cited an “experience gap” as one of the reasons women drop out of computer science programs.
“Many of the courses either assume students already know the requisite programming language or that they can pick it up on their own,” wrote Blum, noting that this often led women to feel discouraged in the program, since they may not have had the same chances to get exposed to the topic. Findings like this were part of the reason that introductory courses like 15-110 and 15-112 were developed, in the hopes of leveling the playing field. CS Academy, sometimes tacitly and sometimes explicitly, hopes to address the same problem, not just for women but also for students that go to under-resourced schools.
Introducing a wider base of students to computer science is one goal of computer science educators who hope to expand the body of students seeking degrees, and CS Academy looks to accomplish that by allowing a means for students to explore harder topics before they might be intimidated out of taking AP or hard intro courses. But pipeline issues are only one part of the problem facing those that want to diversify computer science circles. The other challenge to tackle is the culture that these students face once they have decided to pursue this path.

Since Carnegie Mellon Dining switched food service providers back in June 2018, business has been slower than expected. Locations such as the Tartan Pavilion and Resnik House Servery, previously bustling around lunch time, are now quiet as students flock to other places to eat. 
About half of the 34 dining locations across campus are managed by Chartwells Higher Education, which replaced Culinart Group last year. Both are subsidiaries of Compass Group, the world’s largest contract food service company, which turned out roughly $2.3 billion in profits in 2018. “Is it embarrassing for us?” asked Resnik cook Cleveland, referring to the food he has to prepare. “Honestly, yes. Yes it is.”
It’s also bad for job prospects: since January 7th, five full-time union dining workers have been laid off by the company while it continues to hire part-time help, in violation of its contract with the union. 
Though the management changed when Dining Services’ contract with Culinart ended last year, the employees, who are represented by the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ (SEIU 32BJ), stayed. Layoffs like this are unprecedented in the past decade, according to one employee who works in the Cohen University Center, and the communication about them to workers was almost nonexistent. “They were having a meeting that Monday,” she said, “and they didn’t even call to let us know.”
The Monday she’s referring to is January 7th, the date of the poorly-communicated bidding meeting where Chartwells notified its employees of the layoffs. Bidding meetings are mandatory talks between Carnegie Mellon’s primary dining vendor and the SEIU where the vendor announces job openings and union employees get to “bid” on desired jobs based on their seniority (number of years in) the union. In the past, these meetings have occurred once or twice a year with plenty of notice from the company.
While laying off employees to cut costs during periods of low revenue is standard practice for many businesses, Chartwells is obligated through Article 8 of its contract with SEIU to give job priority to full-time union employees over part-time employees. The five people laid off, without wages and benefits like health insurance, were all full time workers and union members. Chartwells has hired several part time employees since the bidding meeting, and bumped many full-time workers down to part-time hours. 
The reason? One Dining Services worker, who wished to remain anonymous, explained in an interview with The Tartan that “when you’re full time you have full benefits: health insurance, 401K, pension, holiday pay, disability. You don’t get any of that part-time.” Previously, he had to work 180 hours part-time to become a full-time employee with union benefits, and remembers feeling relief after qualifying just a few months ago. This employee, who has a two-year-old daughter at home, has been working part-time for three weeks now after being bumped down from full-time status. 
The lack of revenue, say many of the workers, is due to an unwillingness to listen to the experience of the people who have been cooking and serving food at Carnegie Mellon for years. “We know what students like to eat, and they don’t listen to our ideas,” said another employee. Cleveland, who is entering his eleventh season here, said that under Chartwells’ management, he has less autonomy over what he cooks. 
“I was making my own menu at Chef’s Table,” he said, “they won’t let me do my thing.” He reminisced about cooking under different management, where he made homemade mac n’ cheese, alligator gumbo, and even turned a corned-beef Rueben into a sausage. Now, he cooks what the head chefs give him, as determined by Chartwells.
Whether or not the layoffs were Chartwells’ or Carnegie Mellon Dining’s decision is unclear. Director of Dining Pascal Peter said that while Dining “collaborates with all on-campus dining partners, including Chartwells, with the goal of enhancing the overall dining experience,” since Chartwells employees aren’t Carnegie Mellon employees, “Chartwells does not defer to Carnegie Mellon regarding employment decisions.”
According to a union spokesperson, at the end of last semester there were 118 full-time (union) employees and around 35 part-time (non-union) employees. At the meeting on January 7th, Chartwells initially proposed cutting 18 full-time jobs. SEIU workers responded quickly with demonstrations and meetings with Chartwells’ site manager Jeff Sinciline, and negotiated down to five layoffs. 
Their goal, however, is to return all of their employees to work and to ensure that full-time employees are given priority over part-time employees. The union wrote a proposal for Chartwells that would accomplish those goals by merging some positions and rehiring the laid off workers, but Chartwells has not accepted the proposal.
In response to inquiries from The Tartan, Chartwells, through its parent company Compass, said that it values its relationship with Carnegie Mellon and “will continue to work with the union to minimize the impact of staffing changes.”
Awareness of these issues spread into the student community with a flyer campaign organized by SEIU members and a subsequent informational meeting. Last week, students started a petition for Compass to accept the union’s proposal, which had gathered over 250 signatures by Saturday. The petition informs signers that Carnegie Mellon dining vendors “play a significant role in our relationship with the Pittsburgh Community, as their employees come directly from the city our school calls home.” Students have also started a Facebook group titled “Support CMU Food Service Workers,” which features a link to the petition and more information. For more information visit the “Support CMU Food Service Workers” Facebook page.
As of the original printing of this article, there are 5 Chartwells employees who are without pay and benefits.

After enduring 35 days under the longest government shutdown to date, the U.S. now has a plan to open the government until Feb. 15. President Donald Trump hopes that he can fulfill his promise for a southern border wall in the next three weeks, whereas the House will continue to block his demands. There is still a chance that the President will declare a border emergency or prevent a new continuing resolution from passing.
Countless headlines have shown the effects of a prolonged government shutdown. Federal workers have missed two paychecks, food went uninspected by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and federal employees were rationing their insulin. Most recently, the LaGuardia airport in New York issued a ground stop just this past Friday due to a mass of unpaid workers calling in sick. Although there is a temporary plan to reopen the government, we have seen another example of the consequences of having an erratic and hyperpartisan leader.
Before getting into the ethical violations of the extended government shutdown, it is important to discuss the efficacy of a border wall. The most obvious argument against the wall is the cost. The President's own estimates over the years have fluctuated wildly. Now, he demands $5.7 billion. In reality, however, estimates go far beyond, and this isn't even considering additional expenses such as maintenance costs nor possible undermining of costs that were used to calculate these estimates.
Additionally, the border wall would obstruct water. Even a fence, despite having holes that allow some water to flow, built along bodies of water on the border can build up debris that ultimately obstructs water flow. A treaty made in 1970 requires that the Rio Grande river, which separates the U.S. and Mexico, remains open on both sides of the border. To accommodate the treaty, the Obama administration built the border fences so that it caved inward along the U.S. border, cutting into residents' private property. Currently, the border fence allows the people to go through their property, but a border wall would interfere with free movement.
Obstructing water is not the only natural consequence of a border wall. Over 2,000 miles, the border hosts more than 1,500 native animal and plant species. A study shows that almost a hundred endangered species would be on the brink of extinction should the wall be built. Consequently, the threat to biodiversity also affects industries such as ecotourism. Texas A&M University estimates that the Rio Grande ecotourism industry alone is worth around $463 million. The border wall would damage the ecosystems of some of North America's most biologically diverse regions.
The wall's efficacy is also questionable. Just a few weeks ago, a prototype of the steel slat that would be used for the border wall was cut with something you probably have in your shed: a saw. This contradicts the  President's promise to build an "impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful" wall. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) agrees that there is "nothing special" about Trump's wall. "President Trump likes to pretend a wall will solve all our problems, but it's been clear for some time that it is little more than a very expensive vanity project... there is nothing special about his wall and it will not secure our borders." Furthermore, the wall's vulnerabilities are not limited to just saws; underground tunnels are still viable for smugglers and, of course, ladders and ropes do the trick, too.
The party of rationality and economics seems to have forgotten the basic concept of supply and demand. This principle can be found in various instances regarding the illegal crossing of the border in general. Marijuana legalization, for example, resulted in a 78 percent decrease in border marijuana seizures. The lowered reward for smuggling drugs attacked the supply end of the model, disincentivizing suppliers. A border fence, on the other hand, had no effect. Another area in which this principle plays a role is the general elasticity of demand for immigration. The president claimed that thousands of gang members were flooding into the country, but not even 1,000 of the total border crossers had violent crime convictions, making up a mere 0.2 percent. This confirms that the vast majority of migrants are people who want to come here for a better life. To model the supply and demand curve, the supply curve would be relatively inelastic, meaning that since the demand to cross the border is not as affected by extrinsic obstacles like heightened security, the demand would not be as affected by the introduction of new obstacles. A more effective way to decrease the demands would be to reduce incentives to cross the border. By supporting coups in Honduras and other nations in the global south, the U.S. directly destabilizes those countries forcing many people to flee north. Instead, creating policies that would help those countries would reduce the incentive for people to cross over the border illegally.
Finally, even if the border wall was 100 percent effective in preventing migrants from crossing the border, federal data shows that a significant portion of America's undocumented immigrants entered legally and just overstayed their visas. Furthermore, illegal immigration has been declining for years, directly contradicting the "national emergency" narrative that has been pushing through. Erecting a wall would not be an effective measure, as it does not address the leading reason for undocumented immigrants. Instead, a more proactive way to enforce border security would be to make the immigration process more straightforward and transparent.
Perhaps Trump should recall his 2004 commencement speech at Wagner College the next time he thinks about erecting a border wall. When migrants are faced with a wall, perhaps they will choose to walk away. But, on the flipside, perhaps they'll decide to "go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall.”

It has been over a month since the U.S. government announced the shutdown and only a few days since it ended. The over 800,000 federal employees who missed two paychecks are definitely the primary hostages of the current impasse on the border security issue. Travelers to National Parks and residents in D.C. are suffering from collateral damage. In theory, the shutdown should not have affected graduate students who depend on their stipends. However, on campus, where federal employees scarcely visit, we, a group of graduate students who depend extensively on federal and presidential records, were also victims of the government shutdown.  
During the government shutdown, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was considered “non-essential,” and its staff were furloughed. The two National Archives in the D.C. area, the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, and several presidential libraries dotting the U.S. remained closed to researchers, regardless of their earlier appointments. During this time, all researchers had to cancel their original working plans. Usually, that does not only mean changing their plans solely for visiting the NARA and its associated facilities; all subsequent schedules in the following months are affected.
This year’s shutdown was extremely annoying to researchers, as they underwent a shutdown that seemingly had no end in sight and depended not on serious political bargains, but on the capricious decisions of reckless politicians. In previous years, a government shutdown was not an issue: both sides could straighten out the funding gaps in a few days. Such a shutdown could give relief to our souring eyes that enabled us to scan and focus on the fading scripts on the documents created tens of hundreds of years ago. An excursion in the city where the archives are located is also a good option. The only annoying part is having to pay several additional days charge for Airbnb or motels. How about a shutdown over a week without a predictable end? Going home and only knowing that the government is reopened the moment we arrived back? Staying in our Airbnb houses or motel rooms to wait for the archives to reopen while spending 50-100 dollars per day? This is especially a dilemma to those foreign visitors who must pay thousands of dollars for air travel and invest great effort in getting a U.S. visa. 
In December 2017, I scheduled a trip to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston. Traveling from Pittsburgh to Boston is not cheap by any means, and the cost of living in Boston in December was about 100 dollars per night. When I learned that a government shutdown was looming, I could only focus on the updates from Congress, worrying whether a shutdown would bankrupt me or truncate my research trip. Luckily, the shutdown did not happen then. 
Even for domestic researchers who do not need to travel far or spend lots of money to visit archives, the shutdown was still a headache. For faculty members, winter break is a great opportunity for them to conduct any archival research, as they are fully occupied by teaching during the semesters. A shutdown in winter just ruins their plans, and they have to wait until summer — assuming there is not a shutdown then. 
For graduate students like me, this was an even worse situation. Students only have a limited and pre-scheduled period to carry out their research in archives. At other times, they must teach courses to finance their stay in graduate school. When such a shutdown unexpectedly happens, they cannot visit archives as planned. Neither could they be immediately assigned a teaching assistantship as those are usually determined months in advance. They were thus stranded on campus without payment. Certainly, students did — and are supposed to — do research in local archives for another part of their dissertation or begin writing with whatever they have. However, this was just a temporary solution when faced with a shutdown that seemed to have no end in sight. How about the students who were at the initial stage of their research (with few primary sources at hand) or whose dissertation depends almost exclusively on federal records? 
I feel very lucky as I had finished all my research in the NARA system in 2017 and 2018. I could not imagine what I would do had I scheduled all my research in the national archives and presidential libraries in this year. My graduation would certainly have been delayed. This shutdown certainly foiled my scheduled trip to the National Personnel Records Center this January.

In the last two months of 2018, the most important elections in the run-up to the 2019 general elections in India took place in five different states. It was a litmus test to the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and a possible preview of the general elections that are expected to take place in six months.
The arrival of Narendra Modi on the table of world leaders in 2014 was the beginning of a wave of big wins for right-wing politicians around the world, like President Donald Trump in the United States and President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Perhaps studying how his tenure has progressed could give political analysts a rough template of what to expect from these politicians.
Five states went to the polls: Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Nagaland, and Telangana. Three of them were ruled by the BJP, the current party in power at the central level: Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, all part of the Hindi heartland, equivalent to the Rust Belt states in the U.S. In fact, those three states had overwhelmingly voted in favor of BJP in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. However, the 2018 State Legislature elections saw a different outcome, as the three states voted BJP out and elected Congress to power. Granted, Parliamentary and State Legislative elections are different, yet with only six months left for the general elections, it is ample reason for the Prime Minister’s party to be worried.
The elections can be viewed as a warning to the party from the people, that the promises they made during the 2014 elections of improved economic conditions for the middle class, elimination of corruption, and increased safety for women haven’t yet come to fruition.
When the 2014 elections took place, one of the reasons for Modi’s win had been his personal charisma: his image as a strongman who will not yield to foreign pressure, and the reports, drummed up by BJP’s brilliant PR and election management, that his rule in the state of Gujarat had led to its increased prosperity. The bigger reasons, however, were the failures of the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government led by the Congress.
The UPA had been in power since 2004 and in the run-up to 2014, there had been a huge anti-incumbency sentiment sweeping the masses. There was frustration that multiple corruption scams were taking place and that the leaders of the nation seemed to do nothing about it. Violence against women was on the rise and the 2012 Nirbhaya Rape case, in which a young woman was raped brutally on a moving bus in the nation’s capital, led to massive outrage that resulted in Congress losing most of its female voters. Amidst all of this came Narendra Modi with his sparkling track record in Gujarat and his promise to change the status quo — to make India great again.
Winning 282 seats, BJP had secured a simple majority, and as the leading member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, they had 336 of the 543 seats in the lower house of the Parliament. It was a big win, considering that the last time any party had won the elections without having to form a coalition was back in 1984.
The Congress appeared to be decimated. Referred to as the Grand Old Party, its days seemed numbered. A 2019 victory for Narendra Modi looked as though it was all but inevitable. However, the party bounced back in the 2018 midterm elections. Breaking into traditional BJP fortresses in the Hindi heartland, it proved that the BJP still has cause to worry about the upcoming elections.
Primary causes for the Congress’s victory were not just BJP’s failure to deliver on its promises but also some of the most prominent economic decisions they made in the last 4 years — especially demonetization, which banned about 80 percent of the currency in circulation in a poorly-planned attempt to curb corruption and the poor implementation of Goods and Services Taxes (GST’s). Added in were also some of the biggest financial frauds in the country’s history, like the case of the Punjab National Bank where businessman Nirav Modi and his associates had defrauded the bank for approximately 40 million USD, and managed to escape the country after that. He’d even met Prime Minister Modi in Davos a couple weeks before news of the fraud broke. However, Nirav Modi will only be joining a list of fraudulent businessmen who had fled India to London like Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya who’d all fled in the last four years, blatantly undermining Modi’s anti-government promises.
Another possible factor that contributed to the BJP defeat could be the fact that the BJP had concentrated on religious and caste-based conflict rather than addressing issues that are facing the people of the states such as the agrarian crisis, the crippling debt being faced by the farmers, and the collapse of the small-scale industries in rural areas post-demonetization. Much like how Trump had raised the caravan as a constant talking point in his campaign for the midterm elections, the BJP and its IT Cell started branding all government critics as “Urban Maoists.” Meanwhile, the opposition focused not only on countering these tactics by the BJP, but also managed to make policy issues the main talking points in their own campaigns that ensured that the opposition is more than just the parties that are not the BJP but also are strong contenders in their own right. There was an increased tilt of minority voter groups towards the opposition, which also was one of the major factors for BJP’s defeat.
BJP’s, and therefore Modi’s, prospects for 2019 are definitely bleaker than they were only a couple months ago. But they can’t and shouldn’t be written off just yet. Modi’s image as a strongman and his fanbase are still almost as strong as before. Plus, there are still doubts about whether the opposition can still organize themselves to fight on a national level. BJP is an election-machine. And to counter the joint forces of Modi and Amit Shah is the real challenge. Put together with the fact that in the next five months, the government could enact various legislations that cater to different voter groups in different states and regions to secure their votes, BJP’s game is not over yet, as proven by the recent 10 percent reservation for economically weaker sections that was approved by the government.
One can expect the same to happen in the United States, as 2020 elections near and with a similar defeat suffered by the Republicans in the midterms in the House. In the run-up to 2020, there will be legislation that will be made to cater to Trump’s voter base, to ensure that they will vote for him. But the real game changer would be how the Democrats approach this election. If they project themselves as merely the anti-Trump party, chances are that they won’t win. Democrats should rise up as beyond being the reactionary party to one that has its own strong policy agendas that resonate with its voters.
Perhaps the 2019 general elections in India, which will also be the first time that people born in this century will be voting, will provide answers for both Republicans and Democrats on how to approach the 2020 elections.

Climate change has been in the news for a hot minute. However, the news that 60 percent of coffee species are threatened by climate change surely caught many people off guard. One of the species is Coffea arabica, one of the world's most commonly enjoyed species. To grow, it requires shade and cooler temperatures, both of which could be affected by climate change. Global warming will also make coffee plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Economies like Ethiopia's, which strongly rely on coffee for export income and employment, are threatened. It is predicted that about half of the land currently used to farm coffee will be unusable by the year 2100. The consequences may be more immediate for coffee lovers like you and me: coffee prices may spike while quality spirals down.
Of course, climate change is not a new topic, but it is a persistent problem. The U.S. pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords in June 2017, showing the world its lack of dedication towards sustainability and providing a dangerous precedent for other countries to do the same. This can be seen in Brazil where newly-elected president Jair Bolsonaro plans to loosen protections that guarded the Amazon rainforests. As of 1965, landowners are required to keep up to 80 percent of their land forested. The new policy will allow for further deforestation. Unsurprisingly, Bolsonaro has suggested that Brazil pull out of the Paris Agreement, claiming "its requirements compromise Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon region."
The consequences of climate change aren't in the distant future. In fact, we have already seen the tip of the iceberg. Devastating natural disasters, record-breaking temperatures, and rapid extinction of various animal species have already been documented. Naturally, the annual "background rate" of extinction for animals is anywhere between one to five per year. This means that if we eliminate human contribution to climate change, we should expect no more than five species going extinct annually on average. However, scientists are estimating we have multiplied this number at least by 1,000 and perhaps up to 10,000.
Even corporations have picked up on the effects of climate change. Phenomena such as storms, floods, droughts, and heat waves are a threat to many industries. In 2018, big oil companies demanded federal protection for their facilities lying on the Texas Gulf Coast. Additionally, banks worry that climate change will affect housing. Heat will turn consumers away from amusement parks. The food and beverage industry is already calculating how to deal with future shortages and overall trends, and the coffee industry is the latest to come on board. Supply chain management and operations will have to be modified to accommodate changes in climate. The list goes on.
The current trajectory we are heading in is pessimistic at best. Although it will be difficult — if not impossible — to reverse any of the damage that has already been made, the impact of climate change is becoming increasingly apparent and larger corporations with more power than everyday people are being incentivized to push towards sustainability. Even if our current politicians don't appear to notice the exigence of the state we are in (or even go so far as to claim the phenomena is a hoax "created by the Chinese"), perhaps nature threatening a critical aspect of their morning routine might help them reconsider.

For the first time in history, vaccine skeptics teamed up to appear on the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of Top 10 Threats to global health in 2019. Other threats include air pollution and climate change as well as diseases such as influenza and HIV. However, the other threats are more traditional and have made multiple appearances in the past, indicating that the rise of vaccine hesitancy is emerging at a higher rate than before.
"Vaccine hesitancy" is defined as the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate, despite the availability of vaccines. Currently, it is estimated that vaccination saves two to three million lives per year and could save 1.5 million more with greater accessibility. However, we are seeing a global return of diseases such as measles, even in countries like the U.S. where the disease was almost eradicated.
Vaccine opponents, commonly referred to as "anti-vaxxers," have various reasons for their stance: some are afraid of injecting chemicals into their bodies and are convinced a natural approach to fending off illnesses is the way to go; others direct their skepticism towards "Big Pharma"; and in communities like the Somali community in Minnesota, there are those who cite religious reasons. Regardless, pathogens don't care about intent. Communities with a significant anti-vax population have been victims of outbreaks of preventable diseases, most notably measles.
Of course, the concept of parents refusing or even being hesitant to give their child immunizations to preventable diseases is not new. The hysteria picked up speed when former doctor Andrew Wakefield claimed that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines caused autism, a false statement that led to his supporting study being retracted and his medical license nullified. However, vaccination skepticism continues. Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, was pulled out of almost all childhood vaccines despite lack of scientific evidence showing the level was significant or harmful. 
Even our current administration has shown skepticism towards how vaccines are being administered. Just a year ago, President Trump's evangelical campaign adviser responded to a severe flu outbreak by claiming, "We don't have a flu season and don’t receive it when someone threatens you with ‘everybody is getting the flu.'" Copeland added, "We’ve already had our shot: He [Jesus] bore our sicknesses and carried our diseases. That’s what we stand on. And by His stripes we are healed." Although Johnnie Moore, a member of Trump's evangelical advisory board, claims that he doesn't "know a single person in the White House who would agree with [Copeland's claim]," the president has shared his fair share of hesitancy. His Twitter history shows he believes in a correlation between vaccines and autism, and his concerns during the campaign trail are further confirmation. Even today, many anti-vaxxers feel emboldened by the president and his message. Americans — or anyone, for that matter — should take medical advice from medical experts such as their primary care physician, but the truth of the matter is that people seek confirmation of their beliefs, especially when it comes from someone of authority.
Vaccine hesitancy is not a partisan issue. While the Left arguably began the modern anti-vax movement — the measles outbreak started off in 2015 in a liberal part of Marin County, CA and a handful of prominent anti-vaxxers, such as Jenny McCarthy, appear to lean Democrat — research shows that those who fall strongly on either end of the political spectrum are more susceptible to questioning the safety of vaccinations than those who fall in the middle. However, it is important to note that those who believe that vaccination should be a parent's choice and not the government's choice leans much more conservative. Regardless of where one stands on the political spectrum, they are potential targets of pseudoscience.
Modern science has come a long way. Over the past decades, new discoveries and medical advancements have allowed people to live longer and healthier lives. However, growing skepticism sets us back. As nice as essential oils smell and fresh produce tastes, none of those "precautions" will shield off preventable diseases.
