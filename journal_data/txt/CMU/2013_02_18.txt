Carnegie Mellon’s varsity tennis team has made quite the racket in recent weeks. The nationally ranked men's squad is undefeated with a 6–0 record, as the team’s spring portion of the season has officially begun. 
Yesterday, the women’s team defeated Indiana University of Pennsylvania 8–1. The team went 3–0 in doubles with wins from junior Katie Cecil and sophomore Angela Pratt, sophomores Bryn Raschke and Chelsea Motie, and first-years Abbey Hamstra and Brooke Tsu.
The match also benefited from singles victories from Cecil, Motie, Pratt, Hamstra, and sophomore Lydia Utkin.
“This weekend was a really good test for our team and a great way to prepare for the indoor championship,” Hamstra said.
While the women celebrated the win, the men’s team continued its undefeated streak with a 7–2 victory over the Stevens Institute of Technology. Sophomore Bryce Beisswanger and first-year Abhishek Alla won the first match of the day against the Stevens Tech No. 3 doubles pair. After Stevens Tech tied the match, sophomores Christian Heaney-Secord and Thomas Cooper paired to win at No. 2 doubles in a tiebreaker 9–8.
Senior Harsha Rao gave the Tartans a 3–1 advantage with his win in singles play, and Alla followed with another singles win.
Senior Duke Miller sealed the win for the Tartans with his singles victory. First-years Yuvraj Kumar and Kosuke Hasegawa also won for Carnegie Mellon.
On Sunday, the men’s tennis team defeated Haverford College 6–3. Although the team encountered three losses in doubles matches, the men rallied back with stellar singles matches. Alla, Miller, Hasegawa, senior Jooho Yu, and Heaney-Secord all sealed victories for the Tartans to remain undefeated.
Unfortunately, the women’s team faced tough competition just the day before against eighth-ranked Division II California University of Pennsylvania and fell 6–3. Tsu and Hamstra won their doubles matches, while Hamstra and Pratt each won their singles matches against Cal U.
On Feb. 9, the men’s team defeated Division I Bucknell University. Beisswanger and Alla won 8–4 in doubles play to give the Tartans an excellent start. Kumar, Miller, and Rao all won in singles to contribute to the 5–4 victory.
"We've had a few great wins for the guys' team, which is especially important going into some tough spring break competition in California," Kumar said of the team's victories.
The day before, the women’s team took down Slippery Rock University in a 9–0 victory. The ladies won all of their singles and doubles matches to win on their home court. On the doubles side, Cecil paired with Pratt to win 8–0 against the No. 1 doubles team from Slippery Rock. Motie and Hamstra also won their doubles match against the No. 2 team.
Cecil, Motie, Martin, Pratt, Hamstra, and senior Alex Tapak all won their respective singles matches to contribute to a resounding Tartan victory.
The tennis team heads to Skidmore College on March 1 for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Team Indoor National Championship.

Over the course of the winter, the 21 determined members of the Carnegie Mellon Ski & Snowboard Club team have hit the slopes to compete in a variety of events, namely the slalom and giant slalom for skiers and the slope-style and giant slalom for snowboarders. With practices at Seven Springs Mountain Resort and competitions across the region, the team has proven itself this year, performing at what is arguably its highest level in years.
On Feb. 9–10, both the ski and snowboard segments of the squad  competed at Blue Knob in the Allegheny Mountains, against teams from around the Mid-Atlantic region. The ski team placed second in the men’s category and fourth in the women’s. 
The women were led by junior Anna Cederquist, who placed second in the individual single-course race. Other strong performers in the women’s race were first-years Niki Kawakami and Robin Song, who achieved 12th and 14th places, respectively.
“Our team did pretty well, with no disqualifications,” Kawakami said. “I think we were successful.”
Carnegie Mellon’s club ski team offers racing opportunities to both those with significant racing experience and newcomers alike. “Many of our members this year are freshmen or new members. [Junior Eric Telmer] and I are the only two returning skiers from two years ago,” Kawakami said.
The top performer on the men’s team was first-year standout Shepard Emerson, subject of last week’s Athlete Profile and winner of the individual competition at Blue Knob, followed by junior Alexander Warzinski in 24th place and sophomore Caleb Levine in 27th. 
Emerson, who also placed second at the team’s previous race at Elk Mountain in January, said that the team has been “dominant among several local teams, and we have done especially well for a team that has people with little racing experience.” 
The snowboard members also performed well. At the past competition, the team placed second, only falling behind the United States Naval Academy. Telmer and senior Ruari Egan have led the team in men’s alpine and women’s alpine, respectively. 
Telmer said that this has been the “best season so far, [with the team] consistently placing in the top three as a team each weekend and having members placing first in some of the weekends.” 
“We place[d] second as a team for the season, and one of our guys and one of our girls got second overall for the season,” he added.
The ski and snowboard team practices nearly every Wednesday at Seven Springs Mountain Resort, in addition to having workouts throughout the week on campus.
The team participates in five competitions sponsored by the Allegheny Collegiate Ski Conference during January and February. 
The conference spans Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia. It includes the U.S. Naval Academy, the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania State University, West Virginia University, West Virginia Wesleyan College, Davis and Elkins College, Bucknell University, Villanova University, and West Chester University.
The Ski & Snowboard Club team will travel to Timberline, W.Va., for the regional competition this Friday.

Junior professional writing major Soleil Phan has made a splash as one of Carnegie Mellon’s top female swimmers on the varsity swimming and diving team.
Phan most recently competed at the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships at the University of Chicago, where she placed second in the 200-meter individual medley (IM) and helped lead her 400-meter relay team to a second-place finish. Phan’s performance in the 200-yard medley relay assisted her team to a first-place finish and a University of Chicago pool record. 
Phan also broke her own school record in the 100-yard butterfly during the preliminaries after finishing in 56.79 seconds. She finished the championship heat in fourth and provisionally qualified for the NCAA Championships. Phan also qualified for NCAAs in the the 200-yard butterfly and helped lead a 800-yard freestyle relay to meet the qualification time as well.
Phan specializes in the freestyle and butterfly events. She said that her biggest accomplishment this season was “finally breaking 57:00 in the 100 butterfly,” which she did at the Kenyon Total Performance Invitational at Kenyon College on Nov. 30, also breaking her own school record. Phan was victorious numerous times at invitational meets throughout the season.
These accomplishments only add to Phan’s list of honors, including finishing first on the team last year in four different events and being named All-America Honorable Mention her first year, UAA Champion in 2011 in the 100-yard butterfly, and All-UAA second team in the 200-meter relay that same year. Also in 2011, Phan competed in seven events in the NCAA Championships. “Making NCAAs my freshman year was one of the best experiences I’ve had as a swimmer,” Phan said.
Phan hopes to repeat that experience this year and make NCAAs both individually and on relays. Coming into the season, she knew that “this year was going to be a faster field, so giving a 110 percent effort at every practice was one of my goals that I knew could help get me there.”
Phan’s talents, ambition, and positive outlook are recognized by her fellow swimmers.
“Soleil is one of the hardest workers and consistent performers on our team, and her cheerful attitude makes it such a pleasure to swim with her,” said junior Wesley Kim.
Sophomore Wendy Liu said, “Soleil has a very positive presence on the team and leads the team both through example and voice. Not only is she an awesome swimmer, but [she is also] an incredibly focused and fantastic person.”
Phan’s focus is also driven by her teammates. “I think this year our team has trained faster than any other year,” she said.
But the Tartan swim team is not all about the rivalry and races in the pool. Phan emphasized that the team is “so close that we’re like a family. The support that I’ve seen this group give each other is unlike any other,” she said. “We hold each other accountable for everything both in and out of the pool.”
From large team dinners to coach Matt Kinney quoting Mean Girls, Phan said she “can’t imagine swimming without the team.”
Phan has been swimming competitively since she was nine years old. “My favorite part is being able to compete both individually and for your team. I’ve been swimming for more than half my life, so I couldn’t imagine life without it,” she said.
When Phan is not gliding through the water like a sailfish, she can often be found shopping or designing. She hopes to pursue her love for design as a future career. 
“Not only is [Soleil] an awesome swimmer and person, but she’s also incredibly artsy and designs apparel,” Liu said. “She also takes a lot of pictures for the team.”
For now, Phan sets her sights on the national meet on March 20. Although she cringes as meet announcers (and even a few joking teammates) mispronounce her name “So-leeeeeel,” she hopes to hear her name be called as she is proclaimed a NCAA champion.

While the NBA season is well past the halfway point (most teams have played over 52 games out of the 82-game schedule), this is still a good moment to reflect upon the season to date. 
This season has seen the fall of two traditional powers — from title contenders to fighting for their playoff lives — and the rise of two young teams that are exceeding all expectations. These standings mix-ups have made the first half of the season a joy to watch while setting up some fantastic playoff battles in the future.
The Los Angeles Lakers entered the season with championship aspirations, much like every season. 
This off-season, they picked up all-star center Dwight Howard and two-time MVP point guard Steve Nash to complement legendary guard Kobe Bryant and all-star power forward Pau Gasol. 
On paper this team seemed unstoppable, but reality proved to be very different. After a 1–4 start, the Lakers fired head coach Mike Brown and eventually hired Mike D’Antoni, who was the coach in Phoenix when Nash won his two MVPs.
The Lakers are still four games under .500 for the season and several games back from the Houston Rockets for the final playoff spot, but they have recently changed their playing style to try and recapture some wins, with Kobe passing more than at any point in his long career and Nash turning into more of a spot-up jump shooter.
The Boston Celtics are another storied franchise currently experiencing a fall from grace. Last season’s run to the Conference Finals appeared to be the last hurrah for the big three — guard Ray Allen, small forward Paul Pierce, and power forward/center Kevin Garnett — who started the super-team era when they joined forces in 2007, winning a title in 2008. 
In the off-season, Allen jumped ship and signed with Celtics rival Miami Heat. Rumors of the team breaking up spread after Garnett was said to be a free agent. Garnett resigned, but the writing on the wall is that the current Celtics are not going to be around much longer.
Leader of the future, point guard Rajon Rondo appears to be the piece the team will build around eventually, but his season-ending ACL tear and the team’s subsequent winning streak have raised doubts about even that future. 
Currently the Celtics occupy the eighth playoff spot with a sizable lead after their winning streak, but the effects of losing two starters  — Rondo and rookie forward Jared Sullinger — for the season will eventually take its toll.
For all the struggles the Lakers have endured, the Los Angeles Clippers have surpassed almost all expectations. 
The strangely assembled team comprised of both very young talent and older veterans is led by forward Blake Griffin, center DeAndre Jordan, and point guard Chris Paul. 
The Clippers took the NBA by storm, leading the top-heavy Western Conference after posting a 17-game winning streak and a perfect 16–0 December. 
They have since slipped to third after injuries to Griffin, Paul, and key bench player Jordan Crawford. But with Paul in the lineup, the Clippers look to pick up right where they left off and make some serious noise in the playoffs. 
The Houston Rockets have been lacking star power since their great but injury-prone center Yao Ming retired in 2011, but the team was finally able to change that this off-season. 
After signing point guard phenom Jeremy Lin from the New York Knicks, the Rockets took everyone by surprise and traded for shooting guard James Harden, sending veteran guard Kevin Martin, two first-round draft picks, and other considerations to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Harden, who came off the bench in his time with the Thunder, made an immediate impact with the Rockets, scoring 37 and a career-high 45 points in his first two games with the team. 
The Thunder was willing to trade Harden because it did not believe he was worth a max-level contract, but so far Houston appears more than happy with their decision to give the 23-year-old Harden an all-star-level salary, given his stellar performance, attitude, and leadership thus far.
All-Star Game weekend gives us the chance to reflect upon the NBA, where stars can single-handedly carry a team through the playoffs, but a bad apple or two in the locker room can quickly spoil title hopes. 
The Lakers and Celtics came into the break with multiple all-stars but are struggling to make the playoffs, while the Clippers and Rockets are lauding their big acquisitions and watching their teams’ futures take a turn from hopeful playoff team to perennial title contenders in the next two to three years.
So sit back, relax, and watch the last third of the season unfold, before the playoffs show us once and for all which teams are pretenders and which teams will end up fighting for the ultimate prize.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming teams competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships, hosted by the University of Chicago last Thursday to Saturday.
The meet was highlighted by the men’s team’s second-place finish and a series of individual championships for both the men and the women. 
A series of strong performances led the Tartan men to a silver victory. Sophomore Anton Razanav and junior Edward Sears brought home individual championships. In the 1,650-yard freestyle, four finished in the top 10.
Razanav repeated as the 200-yard backstroke champion and qualified for the NCAA Championships in March. On Friday, Razanav also earned All-UAA status in the 100-yard backstroke, earning third with a career-best time of 51.56 seconds and provisionally qualifying for the NCAA meet.
Sears also was a UAA champion, winning the 100-yard freestyle and provisionally qualifying for NCAAs. Earlier in the meet, Sears was just 0.03 seconds away from breaking the school record in the 50-yard freestyle, touching the wall in 20.90 seconds.
First year Matthew Nielsen earned All-UAA status in the 400-yard Individual Medley (IM) by finishing third. His time was a season-best and helped him qualify for NCAAs. Sophomore David Campbell also provisionally qualified for NCAAs in the preliminaries. 
The relay events were the highlight of the first day. The 200-yard freestyle relay team placed third to earn All-UAA status, and the 400-yard medley relay team touched in a provisional NCAA-qualifying time of 3:24.47.
“Our performance reflected all of our hard work we put in this season. We left everything in the pool and fought through adversity to wrap up our season with an excellent conference finish,” Razanav said.
The women also had impressive races at UAAs, finishing in fourth place. Senior Breanna Stillo finished second in the 400-yard medley, setting a school record with a time of 3:52.62. During the preliminaries, Stillo broke her personal record in the 50-yard freestyle and qualified for NCAAs. On Friday, Stillo swam to another All-UAA performance with a third-place showing in the 100-yard breaststroke. Her time broke her own school record and qualified her for the NCAAs.
The 400-yard medley relay team set a new school record and met last year’s NCAA selection time.
The women proved their relay prowess elsewhere, winning the 200-yard medley relay on Friday, setting a University of Chicago pool record and bettering last year’s NCAA Championship selection time. 
Phan’s time of 2:06.31 earned her second place in the 200-yard IM. Phan was a major contributor and swam on several relay teams, all of which qualified her for the NCAA Championship.
First-year Kira Singhaus’ time of 2:05.38 was undefeated in the 200-yard backstroke, ranking her provisionally qualified as well.
“The team did very well at UAAs,” sophomore Wendy Liu said. “We had two conference champions, broke at least five school records, and so many people got best times. Our team has gone through so much together and it is really culminated at UAAs.”

When postdoctoral fellow of machine learning Burr Settles was in graduate school, he was missing his passion; The rigor imposed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison left the once-avid musician swamped with research and classes. To get his musical fix, he and a few friends decided to try and write a song every other day for an entire month. The group chose February, and since then, the endeavor has bloomed into February Album Writing Month (FAWM), now a popular creative collaboration website that cranks out thousands of songs every February. Settles and assistant professor of human-computer interaction Steven Dow recently analyzed FAWM to answer some fundamental questions regarding creative collaboration.
The pair came with different skill sets, with Settles’ background in computer science and machine learning and Dow’s focus on social science. They used their diverse backgrounds to answer two main questions: How do creative collaborations form, and what makes a collaboration successful?
In FAWM, artists often collaborate to create their 14-song album. Settles and Dow utilized path-based regression to determine which factors were most likely to predict collaboration between artists. Path-based regression works by randomly working through a large set of data that includes users, user comments, songs, and genres. The program starts with one user; it then randomly makes a path through the data from that user until it hits another user. For instance, the program may start at user “A” then randomly move to one of user A’s songs, then to a comment user B left on that song, and then finally to user B. Settles and Dow used the lengths and maps of these paths and compared the results to artists that actually worked together to determine which factors or “connectors” were most common in collaborations.
The findings fell in line with some common social theories — for example, communication between users was a key predictor for collaborations. This communication may come in the form of users commenting on other’s songs, “following” each other, or directly messaging each other. The study also found that users collaborating together were more likely to have a similar, but not exact, amount of musical experience.
Perhaps even more surprisingly, Dow and Settles found a negative correlation between users who tagged songs with the same genre. For example, a user who tags his or her song as folk was more likely to team up with a heavy-metal singer that happened to appreciate folk than another folk artist.
“There is sort of a desire to connect to people outside your area of genre, which we found was an interesting thing that bubbled up,” Dow said. Settles added, “In hindsight, this makes a lot of sense, but there wasn’t a precedent for it in the literature.”
To answer what made a collaboration successful, Settles and Dow utilized a survey asking participants about their least and most successful collaborations. Along with asking users to quantify their experience (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 100, how much work did you put in?), users were encouraged to give comments. As with path-based regression, the survey yielded some results that were in line with common social theories: For instance, plenty of communication was key for a successful collaboration.
Furthermore, the artists were happiest with their collaborations when the work was split completely evenly. As predicted, artists who do the lion’s share of the work often end up dissatisfied. Surprisingly, however, the users who did little work also had negative feelings regarding the collaboration. “If you don’t put your work into the collaboration, it’s bound not to be successful,” Dow said. The study also indicated that a shared interest in genre did not necessarily predict a successful collaboration.
Settles and Dow believe the future application of methods similar to theirs could be far-reaching, especially in other areas of creative collaboration. Both believe the mixture of quantitative and qualitative analysis resulted in a successful collaboration of their own. “In the end, I think we made a lot of contributions in both directions that neither of us could have made alone,” Settles said.

Many people would agree that food is one of the great pleasures of life. However, one of the principle tools we use to eat — our teeth — are poorly rewarded for the work they perform. In return for their work in crushing food and enabling us to eat all sorts of delicious substances, they are attacked by acid and dental bacteria. Fortunately, toothpaste can help mitigate the harmful effects that can befall teeth. This commonplace substance contains many ingredients that give it its potency and make it so essential to dental health.
According to researchers at New York University, toothpaste is not a recent invention; humans realized long ago the importance of keeping teeth clean and healthy. This substance originated about 6000 years ago in several forms. In China, twigs, flower petals, salt, water, and bones were mashed and put on the end of a sharp bamboo leaf to apply to teeth. In Egypt, salt, pepper, mint leaves, and iris flowers were mixed into a paste and used. In India, twigs from trees known for special dental properties were chewed upon and rubbed against teeth. All these methods led to healthy teeth that did not suffer from dental problems.
Now, let’s brush up on the science (pun intended) behind dental problems with some help from dental.net. Our teeth are made of layers; the outermost one is comprised of hard enamel. This hard substance protects the softer inside and nerves of our teeth. When taken care of, this enamel can last us an entire lifetime. However, modern-day diets that are extremely high in sugars and carbohydrates can cause several dental problems.
Sugars and carbohydrates release sulfur molecules that are responsible for dreaded bad breath. In addition, these substances are consumed by bacteria living in the teeth and enable them to multiply quickly. These bacteria release acids that eat away at enamel. If the enamel erodes, it exposes the nerves underneath which can lead to extreme pain and discomfort. Also, if the acid keeps building up, it may reach the root and render the tooth useless. The bacteria that cause all these problems live in plaque and food debris in our teeth. Toothpaste can help remove these bacteria, helping to prevent several dental problems.
According to thefactsabout.co.uk, one of the most well-known ingredients in toothpaste is fluoride. This element is naturally found in several foods like tea, fish, vegetables, and fruits. It is necessary for healthy teeth as it helps draw in minerals like calcium to the enamel and helps repair the tooth. Fluoride also attaches itself to weakened parts of the tooth, which keeps the tooth stronger in the future. These properties of fluoride are also the reason it is added to water supplies, and has been instrumental in improving the dental health of most people in the last few decades.
In addition to fluoride, toothpastes also contain other common materials. Toothpaste can contain abrasives, which help remove plaque and polish the teeth. These abrasives need to be able to scrub away harmful substances without causing permanent damage to the tooth enamel. 
Toothpaste also contains detergents, which give rise to the foam created while brushing. Toothpaste manufacturers also give importance to the texture of toothpaste. Humectants are the substances used to ensure that toothpaste stays moist and doesn’t dry out while in the tube. Thickeners are used to make the toothpaste stick together when squeezed from the tube and stick to the brush. Finally, preservatives and flavors ensure that toothpaste stays fresh and is enticing to users no matter what their taste preferences might be.
With the variety and styles of toothpaste available to us today, it is possible for everyone to find a type suited to their exact needs. The various benefits of toothpaste make it an essential part of our lives. Now, if only we could all floss regularly too.

Russia suffers from damage after large meteorite
A 15-meter meteorite broke through the atmosphere and exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia. The meteorite, which was the largest to hit the country in over a century, injured 1,200 people and caused approximately $33 million in damage. Some scientists drew comparisons to another meteorite that occurred in 1908, which caused damage to buildings over 100 miles away.
Even more astounding is the fact that a 50-meter asteroid made a record-breaking close pass with Earth on the very same day. The good news is that according to NASA’s Near-Earth Object Program, there are currently no expected large impacts for the next 100 years, as most projectiles burn up in the atmosphere long before causing harm.

Dogs are able to recognize other dogs on screen
According to a research team led by Dr. Dominique Autier-Dérian from the National Veterinary School in Lyon in France, dogs can differentiate between non-dog and dog faces. Researchers showed nine domestic dogs 144 pairs of pictures of various animal faces, including human faces, on a computer screen. 
They observed that all nine dogs were able to recognize their own species, despite the large variety of breeds. This result demonstrates that dogs are able to group various dog breeds into one category, based only on visual cues. This is particularly impressive because, with over 400 known breeds, dogs have the largest morphological variety among all animal species. The researchers concluded that mating between breeds was still possible, despite the species being “stretched to its morphological limits.”

Disabled turtle receives new set of prosthetic limbs
When Yu, a 25-year-old loggerhead turtle, was found washed up in a Japanese fishing net five years ago, her front flippers had been brutally ripped apart from a fight with a shark. The keepers at an aquarium in Kobe, Japan have been working on a high-tech cure that could help the turtle swim again. 
To date, they have tried 27 models of prosthetic fins, all of which either caused the turtle pain or fell off when she tried to swim. Their latest version made of rubber and a material used in diving wetsuits, was finally successful in allowing the loggerhead turtle, an endangered species, to swim. “My dream for her is that one day she can use her prosthetic fins to swim to the surface, walk about, and dig a proper hole to lay her eggs in,” said Naoki Kamezaki, director of the aquatic park.

FDA approves artificial retina that gives vision to blind
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved a new technology, called the artificial retina, that can give limited vision to people who are blind. The artificial retina, which has been under development for over 20 years, is a sheet of electrodes implanted in the eye. 
The artificial retina is part of a system called Argus II  that includes glasses that have an attached camera and a portable video processor allow visual signals to bypass the damaged portion of the retina and be transmitted to the brain. Although the artificial retina does not give the blind person real vision, it allows him or her to make out boundaries and identify outlines of objects, particularly those with a large contrast in lightness and darkness.

Psychologists reveal algorithm behind eHarmony
Psychologists at eHarmony, a matchmaking website, are arguing a claim made by a psychology journal that matchmaking sites do not use valid algorithms to pair people together. The site’s senior research scientist, Gian C. Gonzaga, recently spoke at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology to explain how the algorithm works. 
According to Gonzaga, six main factors are used to determine two individuals’ compatibility: level of agreeableness, preference for closeness with a partner, degree of sexual and romantic passion, level of extroversion and openness to new experience, the importance of spirituality, and one’s level of happiness and optimism. The more similarities two people have in these categories, the more likely they are to develop a relationship, according to Gonzaga.

Apple may be developing new wristwatch
Rumors that Apple is working on a new wristwatch made of curved glass have been confirmed by unnamed Apple insiders. The watch may operate on Apple’s iOS platform. Corning Glass Technologies, the company that manufactures the extremely durable Gorilla Glass used in iPhones, has recently developed Willow Glass, a glass that is as bendable as piece of paper.  
While there is much secrecy regarding the details of Apple’s potential new wristwatch, Peter Bocko, the chief technology officer for Corning Glass Technologies, confirmed that Willow Glass is flexible enough to bend around a wrist like a watch. Like Google Glass, a new watch by Apple could bring us even closer to wearable computing. So far, however, the technology giant has remained silent on the issue.

Pulsing music sets the beat for the model strutting down the catwalk. She strikes a pose for the myriad clicking cameras recording her outfit: black leggings, a black long-sleeved shirt, and a high silver collar reminiscent of a visor on a suit of armor. She struts back down the catwalk toward the fog billowing out at one end.
This high fashion event didn’t take place on a runway in New York or Paris. It happened in Wiegand Gym last Saturday, as part of Carnegie Mellon’s annual Lunar Gala.
Although Saturday’s show was under four hours long, the members of Lunar Gala have been working on the fashion show since last April, according to Alexander DeRonde, an executive producer for Lunar Gala and a senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student studying communication design and decision science.
This year’s theme of venin — the toxic substances found in the venom of snakes — was inspired by the Chinese New Year, DeRonde said. “The past three years have been pretty vague themes because we don’t like to constrict the fashion designers,” he explained. “But this year, we wanted to do something a little bit different, and we went into this year knowing that we wanted to have a theme with the show.”
He and the other members of the Lunar Gala executive board — including fellow executive producers Chris Ioffreda, a senior design major, and Joanne Yun, a senior technical writing major — decided that as part of the theme, the designers’ lines would progress from light to dark. “We wanted half the designers to fit into the light spectrum and half the designers to fit into the dark spectrum,” DeRonde said.
The emphasis on theme wasn’t the only change to this year’s show. Lunar Gala’s board decided to add multiple elements to the show, including video art created exclusively for Lunar Gala; 360-degree photographs of every outfit; promotional videos by cmuTV; and a mobile application that Gala attendees could view to learn more about the designs.
By incorporating more technology into the event, “we thought we could really strengthen our image and draw in some people that maybe wouldn’t normally be interested [in the show],” DeRonde said.
The board also decided to turn to an outside public relations firm, Pretty Living PR, for help in promoting the event. “[Lunar Gala is] the largest student-run event on campus, and we sort of realized that we’d reached a wall when it comes to campus publicity, because we really exhausted our resources on campus,” DeRonde said. “We wanted to turn the fashion show into something that’s important in the larger Pittsburgh community.”
Participation in the gala was selective. Designers had to submit their proposed lines in the middle of the fall semester; ultimately, 19 lines were selected for the fashion show. Over 200 students auditioned to be models, but only about 60 were chosen.
Once selected, the participants had to put in hours of work every week. Maureen Griswold, a Lunar Gala designer and senior industrial design major, explained, “You had to go to every rehearsal, and rehearsals were once a week usually in the evening [for about three hours] … and last week before the show there was practice every day.”
All of that work culminated in Saturday’s event, which featured three dance groups, five local boutiques, six visual artists, 19 student-designed lines, nearly 60 models, and almost 200 outfits.
For the fashion show, Wiegand Gym was transformed into a dramatic space, with the catwalk striking out into the middle of the gym from a black curtain backdrop with mounted video screens. The seating area was packed, so for those who were sitting farther from the runway, there were multiple video cameras recording the models as they strutted down the catwalk, and the footage was broadcasted on several of the screens.
The show kicked off with “Expression in White,” a collection of wedding dresses by senior design major Laura West, set to a peppy remix of a song by French pop group Yelle. The dresses featured plenty of ruffles and were all made of the same unusual material: paper. As Lunar Gala’s website explains, “Her collection aims to redefine what a wedding dress can be. By constructing the wedding dress out of a more sustainable material, paper, she aim[s] to put more importance on the memories of the day rather than the artifacts that are left over.” Since the dresses were all made of the same material, the designs for all eight dresses were very similar.
“Quartz,” by sophomore design major Antonio Ono and sophomore Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student Samantha Chiu, featured a collection of eight all-white outfits with geometric details that, according to Lunar Gala’s website, “focuses on the tensions between structure and gravity, light and form, and the manufactured world versus the natural world.”
Although Kate Spade was originally listed as a boutique whose clothes would be modeled in the show, clothing line Younique showed instead.
The rest of the designers in the first act fit the theme of a lighter spectrum, with several of the lines featuring pastel colors, lace and chiffon fabrics, and interesting geometric shapes. “Sense & Sensibility,” a line by first-year biology major Angela Thomas, stayed true to her muse of Jane Austen with dreamy, pastel dresses and dapper bow ties and pastel pants for men.
Another highlight was “Mobier,” a shoe collection by fourth-year architecture majors Morgan Stampf and Scott Harrison. The shoes were structurally impressive: They were all highly geometric tan shoes with black ribbon details that were probably impossible to walk in, but looked like works of art.
The second act of the show featured darker colors and heavier fabrics. “Oppidan Winter” by fifth-year architecture and philosophy double major Rain Chan-Kalin mixed heavy winter fabrics with dark-colored chiffon in well-crafted outfits for both men and women.
The second act also included the most raucous moment of the evening, when men and women modeled for Pussycat, a lingerie boutique. Audience members cheered wildly for their friends, and when all the models for the boutique came out together at the end, they broke their serious poses for the first time in the evening to dance along to the music.
Suddenly, a dancer for hip-hop dance team Soulstylz came out on stage and began dancing between the lines of models. The rest of the dancers in the troupe soon joined him, and they kept the audience cheering with their impressive, high-energy dancing.
The final line of the evening — “Proxy,” by sophomore design major Rachel Ciavarella — was by far the most experimental line of the evening. Models wore simple, all-black outfits with wild appendages; one model was encased in what looked like a white plastic ribcage, while another wore a high silver collar reminiscent of a visor on a suit of armor. Dark and experimental, it was a far cry from the white paper dresses that began the show, and exemplified the wide range of designs featured in the show.
At the close of the show, the executive producers thanked a long list of people and raffled off a Kate Spade handbag before closing the evening, encouraging everyone to attend the official after-party at Club Whim in the South Side. As the audience members poured out of the gym, dancing to Macklemore’s “Thrift Shop” as it blared over the speakers, they chattered excitedly about all the fashion talent they had just witnessed. Carnegie Mellon may not have a fashion design program, but Lunar Gala proved yet again that there is still plenty of fashion talent on campus.

Never before has a passage of music sounded more like a sexual climax than in Carnegie Mellon alumna Elisabeth Turchi’s magnificent rendition of “Dulcissime,” a movement of Carl Orff’s famous classical “scenic cantata” Carmina Burana. And what better way than through great primal passion — and through one of the most famous classical pieces of all time — to celebrate the final concert of Robert Page, the venerated maestro and director of choral studies at Carnegie Mellon.
His exit marks a turning point for the College of Fine Arts. Page is indubitably one of the greatest choral conductors of our time, and can be credited significantly for shaping the world-renowned voice department at the School of Music. Carmina Burana is one of his signature pieces: He won a Grammy for his recording of Carmina with the Cleveland Orchestra with Michael Tilson Thomas, and conducted the piece with the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1997.
The joint Carnegie Mellon choirs, the Carnegie Mellon Percussion Ensemble, School of Music faculty pianists Luz Manriquez and Mark Carver, and featured soloists including Turchi (CFA ’99) presented the piece to a packed house at the Pittsburgh School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) on Saturday, with a repeat performance yesterday at St. John Vianney Church in South Hills. The two other alumni soloists were tenor Dillon McCartney (CFA ’92) and baritone Dimitrie Lazich.
Carmina Burana — especially the movement that serves as its beginning and end, “O Fortuna” — is practically a stereotype for heightened drama, having been used as incidental music for Gatorade commercials, the BBC’s World Cup coverage, and Pittsburgh Pirates games. This energy reflects the piece’s text, which journeys from philosophical ruminations on wealth to great raucous numbers about drinking, gambling, and sex. This drama, coupled with Page’s characteristic chutzpah, made for a passionate night.
This passion took a few different forms over the course of Saturday night. It was certainly contagious in the choir, and one could easily pick out singers head-banging during movements with driving beats. But as junior composition student and back-row head-banger Sean Salamon astutely observed, “How can you not rock out to Carmina Burana?”
Considering that the student singers had only a month to prepare — and that the soloists didn’t rehearse with the choir until two days before the show — they did an incredible job. Page elicited spitting diction and an enormous vocal force for all the choral movements of the piece, especially from the men. Most impressive of all were the short solos from certain chorus members.
It’s rather unfortunate that the School of Music didn’t have the resources to perform the full-scale version of the work. What would have been moments to highlight a large ensemble in the full version of Carmina came off as dry and flat in this arrangement.
That is to say, the arrangement was entirely at fault. The Carnegie Mellon Percussion Ensemble, a conglomerate of undergraduate and graduate percussion performance majors, subtly showcased some of the best talent of the night, managing to accentuate the piece’s drama without stealing the spotlight from the singers. Master’s student in percussion performance Lily Hoi, in particular, radiated more intensity than nearly anyone else onstage. Also commendable were Manriquez and Carver, both master pianists by their own right who came together under Page’s baton to celebrate his last concert. 
Although Carl Orff wrote Carmina primarily for the chorus, many of his vocal parts sit in an uncomfortably high range in the human voice. Turchi mastered this range the moment she stood from her chair. The piece’s single tenor solo depicts a stumbling drunk singing in a stratospheric wail. He acted out the part of the drunk by frequently breaking the fourth wall, once even looking at the score over Page’s shoulder (the maestro turned to him, apparently aghast). The tenor’s acting more than made up for the slight weakness in his voice.
Lazich had a sonorous and luscious voice in his lower range, but his part goes rather high as well. There were some points in the performances when one was worried he wouldn’t make all his notes, and the tension he exuded in the upper register of his voice was unnerving. He also had a tendency to slide from one note to another — a practical rather than a stylistic choice — which was largely a turnoff. He also acted out his part, but after the tenor’s solo, his movements seemed like a cheap imitation of McCartney’s.
The soloists aside, the last few movements of the cantata were riveting. During the reprise of “O Fortuna,” Page — usually hunched over like a noble crow — seemed to grow a head taller. The audience saw, for at least a minute, the great conductor as a spry young man. His heart and music have never grown stiff with age.

Scotch’n’Soda Theater put on a production last Friday and Saturday of 12 Angry Men, a drama concerning 12 jurors who are tasked with determining the guilt or innocence of a boy charged with homicide.
Despite the title, the cast of jurors included women as well as men. Compared to traditional productions, this production featured a much more diverse cast, which played to its benefit; the cast resonated much more with a modern-day American audience, touching upon themes related to race and gender.
The staging was relatively understated, with much of the attention going toward the people in the jury room. However, it was extraordinary to note that the set featured running water and electricity, showing the great deal of effort that was put into every aspect of the production.
Although the play was generally enjoyable, the implementation of the ’50s-era dialogue was less than seamless. The actors’ rendition of the slang expressions sounded somewhat awkward and forced at times, but it became less of an issue as the play went on.
The play itself was remarkably tightly woven and dramatic; every detail was intrinsically important or revealing. Throughout the piece, there was a very real sense of frustration and tension between each of the jurors, which fluctuated between the scenes of the play. Audience members were intently sitting upright in their seats as they watched the play, which spoke to its tense atmosphere.
Keeping true to the title, the focus of the production was the jurors themselves. The cast portraying the jurors was very talented; each actor gave a unique and memorable performance. Of special mention is junior Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts student Andrew Bueno, who played Juror 8, the dissenting juror who was the first person to vote “not guilty.” Bueno gave an outstanding performance as the calm and controlled yet passionate objector who manages to sway the opinions of his fellow jurors.
Opposing Bueno’s character was Juror 3, played by senior decision science major Kevin Handerhan, who gave a solid performance as a vociferous older man fostering bitterness toward his son. Senior economics major Erika Tang was also very noteworthy in her portrayal of Juror 9, an observant old woman who seems to go off on miscellaneous tangents, but whose words carry a deeper significance. Lastly, master’s student in design Shree Lakshmi Rao’s portrayal of Juror 11, an immigrant with strong moral principles, was also very moving.
In addition to the strong performances, the play featured several striking and memorable scenes. In one scene, Jurors 3 and 8 attempt to reenact the scene of the murder, with Juror 3 pointing a switchblade down at Juror 8’s chest. This scene comes after an exchange between two other jurors, in which it is stated that anyone has the potential to commit murder. The other jurors’ collective jump as Juror 3 motions to “stab” Juror 8 startled the audience, making the subsequent short bit of comedic relief all the more hilarious.
In another scene, the jurors decided one by one to turn their backs to Juror 10, played by senior decision science major Christopher Sparks. Juror 10 is a garage owner who is highly intolerant of people who live in the slums. The jurors’ actions were in response to Juror 10’s rant on the untrustworthiness of poor people. In the end, with no one listening to him, 10 backed into a corner and remained silent for the rest of the play. This scene spoke greatly to the power of the simplest of human gestures in making a difference.
The play raised very important questions regarding the American judicial system and the meaning of “reasonable doubt.” It made one wonder what would have happened in the same case without a conscientious objector; as the play pointed out, “People make mistakes all the time.” Those mistakes have led to innocent people being sentenced to death. 
12 Angry Men was more than just a commentary on the American judicial system. The play was also an examination of human nature: our hypocrisies and prejudices, as well as our better angels of responsibility and morality. It looked at what makes us tick, and how the smallest things can affect our decisions.
Scotch’n’Soda’s production of 12 Angry Men was truly a unique experience. Its greatest strength lay in the simple, undiluted power of its personalities, which created a strong emotional connection between the characters and the audience. As director and junior voice major James Alexander states in the playbill, “You don’t need flashy special effects or musical numbers to hold an audience’s attention, because a powerful script with a talented cast can be just as compelling.”

Teens of Pittsburgh were in for a great treat last Wednesday when California-based pop band Allstar Weekend performed at the Altar Bar. The band is famous for its catchy pop songs, such as “Hey, Princess,” which was featured on the Disney Channel.
Allstar Weekend was no stranger to the venue; the band had performed there last year as well. This stop on the tour was Allstar Weekend’s last; the band is taking a hiatus after this concert, so Wednesday’s performance was a chance for fans to say goodbye to the beloved boy band.
The show kicked off with a native Pittsburgh band called the Sleeper Pick. The four-person pop rock band was a good attempt to start off the show, but because the audience was unfamiliar with its songs, it was hard to raise the energy of the crowd and people started getting restless. 
Thankfully, the next band, Beneath the Sun, had a larger fan base. With the band members’ outrageous hair and fresh new talent, fans were eager to scream along to their music.
The next performance was given by YouTube star Tiffany Alvord. Although she was very talented and sweet, her songs were met with derision from the audience. Her music style was very different from that of the rest of the bands, as her voice was only accompanied by her acoustic guitar. Amid laughter and remarks of, “Why is she here?” Tiffany Alvord struggled to capture the attention of fans who were really only interested in the boy bands to follow.
The second-to-last band, Cute Is What We Aim For, caused a huge stir in the crowd. Many people had come just to see them, so there was a huge surge in the crowd when they appeared on stage. One boy knocked his way to the front, abandoning his girlfriend in the back with all the preteen girls, where he proceeded to sing his heart out along with the lead singer. The band’s alternative rock style and the lead singer’s inspirational messages between songs made for a very enjoyable performance. 
There was a sizable time gap between Cute Is What We Aim For’s performance and Allstar Weekend’s appearance. The audience started to get restless and chanted for Allstar Weekend to come on stage. When the band finally appeared, it was met with shrill screams.
Allstar Weekend kicked off with one of its characteristic high-energy pop songs. Lead singer Zachary Porter tended to dance around a lot, doing hip thrusts as he sang, while lead guitarist Cameron Quiseng preferred to stand still and smile seductively at the audience. It was slightly disappointing that this band had the weakest vocals of the bunch, although most of the audience didn’t seem to mind.
In the middle of the concert, the band members announced that this was their last tour as Allstar Weekend and thanked their fans. They also popped out with “Musical Twerks,” an Allstar Weekend tradition where they pull out members of the audience to dance on stage. Porter’s comment that the girls could use his mic stand as a stripper pole was a little inappropriate considering that most of his fans in the audience were in high school, but they seemed to love the comment. When the boys left the stage, fans started screaming for an encore, and the band finally reemerged in denim overalls and finished with a dance for the fans.
After the concert, the crowd was given a chance to meet and greet all of the above bands that had performed. All of the musicians were selling merchandise, and most of them were by their tables talking to fans. They were all very friendly and open to chatting, giving out autographs, and talking about their music.
Overall the concert was very enjoyable. The upbeat songs excited the crowd, and the pop rock music was a good mix to let loose to on a Wednesday night.

You are flying through a field of stars. You hit a key on the keyboard, confused. A string of words appears before you: “This is not a game to be won. Do not want or think. Just be.”
So begins the game Bientôt l’été — or in English, It’s Nearly Summer. The game then asks you to decide between a male or female avatar. In most games, this would be where the major choices end. But in Bientôt l’été, the choices have barely begun.
After you decide, your avatar is dropped on an ethereal beach, dressed simply in white. Seagulls fly around, waves lap at your feet, ambient music plays in the background, and the game provides a supremely calming experience. You can walk along the beach in either direction. As you do, the music changes from the simple, light ditties to include deep bass notes, giving an eerie feeling. The horizon then slowly fades away, revealing a sky of spinning stars and planets. Walk far enough and you will come across an impassable barrier — the avatar of the opposite sex staring back at you, mimicking your movements.
You also have the ability to close your eyes, which reveals what this world truly is: a hologram. According to the developer Tale of Tales’ description of the game, this is all taking place in an Intergalactic Holocom Transmitter II in deep space. This may be a bit weird, but the main point of the game becomes apparent when you turn around, looking away from the sea.
A little distance behind the starting point is a house, which you can enter. When you do, you sit down at a table with an empty chess board (with nothing but a king, if it’s your first time), a wine glass, an ashtray, and some cigarettes. The game then searches the Internet for a companion (someone playing the opposite sex). This other player appears as a digital apparition across the table from you.
This is the crux of the game: to have a simulated conversation with another person over a game of chess. When I realized that the conversation and small interactions that occur within the house were the driving points of the game, my mind was blown. Having a game with the purpose of establishing some sort of connection with someone you can’t see, playing as two characters who are — again, according to computer game developer Tale of Tales — deeply in love, and attempting to maintain a relationship across the vast expanse of space is not only a risk, but also a great artistic undertaking.
Being a self-described gamer, if the premise of this game was proposed to me directly, I would be extremely skeptical and would probably avoid it to some degree. However, going into this game without a firm grasp of what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, the actual conversations themselves were random and confusing. According to the blog of programmer Michaël Samyn, that was the point. But in my experience, this mirrors actual relationships, at least to some extent (even though for some reason most of my dialogue options were about wine).
If you’re coming into Bientôt l’été expecting a normal video game, prepare to be disappointed (and probably shocked). Come into it with an open mind, expecting more of a calm experience than something to play and beat, and you will be treated to something remarkable. This is a prime example of an “artistic game” — something to be admired and pondered, rather than treated with a competitive mindset. As the game reminds you when it begins, it is important to “just be.”

Three Carnegie Mellon alumnae came to Baker Hall’s Adamson Wing on Thursday to read their poetry as part of the English department’s Alumni Reading Series.
Lillian-Yvonne Bertram (DC ’06), Sarah Smith (DC ’05), and Anne Marie Rooney (DC ’07) all pursued further education after graduating from Carnegie Mellon. Bertram earned her master’s degree in fine arts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. at the University of Utah; Smith earned her MFA at the University of Texas at Austin; and Rooney earned her MFA at Cornell University. Bertram, Smith, and Rooney have all recently published books; Bertram’s But a Storm is Blowing From Paradise, Smith’s I Live in a Hut, and Rooney’s Spitshine were all published in 2012.
The Adamson Wing was filled almost to full capacity for the reading; students and faculty from Carnegie Mellon’s English department made up the bulk of the audience. 
Rooney’s poems were decidedly dark; words like “black” and “darkness” wove a common thread throughout her poetry, capturing the essence of the traditional tortured artist. At times, it felt a little heavy for the lighthearted atmosphere of the Adamson Wing.
Rooney ended with some unpublished poetry, including a poem dedicated to Carnegie Mellon’s Greek Quad, where Rooney said she had spent a lot of time her first year at the university. 
Smith continued the readings with selections from her book, I Live in a Hut, and ended with an unfinished poem dedicated to her mother, who was in attendance. Smith’s work was characterized by a dry, sarcastic wit that drew regular interjections of laughter from the audience. Her poems were generally more narrative than Rooney’s, relying less on figurative language and more on detailed descriptions of relatively normal scenes that, despite their mundane nature, captured the full spectrum of human emotion.
But like Rooney’s work, Smith’s poems were sardonic and dark; she warned before reading what she called a Valentine’s Day poem that “like many things in I Live in a Hut, it’s a little bleak.” Indeed, most of Smith’s poems deal with love lost rather than love found. 
Smith’s last poem was what she called “sort of an advice poem,” directed at current Carnegie Mellon students. Titled “Situational Humor,” the poem captured the essence of Smith’s experience at Carnegie Mellon and how she felt that current students should take advantage of their experience. Smith’s down-to-earth reading style complemented the sharp wit of her poetry, making her the most successful of the three readers.
The last reader was Bertram, who began with a poem about Pittsburgh. “Strip District Eclogue” drew from Bertram’s experiences within the city. 
Of the three poets, Bertram was the most abstract. Bertram’s poems were often based in generous poetic license fitted within precise form; in a couple of poems her experimental style detracted from the powerful emotion of her poetry. Bertram’s location-based poems, like “Strip District Eclogue” and her two fractals (a form of poetry she invented), had the most impact out of the poems she read; her language made it easy for the listener to imagine her in those settings.
Bertram, Smith, and Rooney finished the reading with a Q & A session, describing their creative processes, inspiration behind their poetry, and their perspectives on pursuing education past an undergraduate degree. In terms of writing poetry, Bertram said, “It’s like trying to call a cat; it doesn’t really come when you want it to.”
It’s clear that all three artists keep strong ties to Carnegie Mellon: Although a good portion of the reading carried a serious, thought-provoking tone, the many poems dedicated to the university and to Pittsburgh made the reading an enjoyable celebration of Carnegie Mellon alumnae.

I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a million times: I want to live in Phipps Conservatory. Is there anything that the botanical gardens can’t accomplish? The answer seems to be a resounding no, especially with the recent addition of their new green building: the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL).
Officially open as of Tuesday, the CSL — the center’s fashionable acronym — is a crucial, innovative step in the nationwide craze for sustainability.
The building — which was designed by a conglomeration of Pennsylvanian designers, engineers, architects, and contractors — is the winner of two international awards for sustainable buildings: the Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) Platinum and the Sustainable Sites Initiative certifications.
According to the information that is presented throughout the building, the LEED Platinum certification is the highest level of recognition for environmentally friendly buildings.
According to CSL docent Sibylle Ingold, the Sustainable Sites Initiative award was given to recognize that the CSL is a zero-water, zero-energy facility. As the friendly docents who guide the daily 
1 p.m. tours will explain, that means that the building has a net usage of zero gallons of water and zero watts of electricity.
The facility produces water through a rainwater collection system that stores and filters water through the use of lagoons, constructed wetlands, and permeable parking pavement. Electricity is produced and conserved with photovoltaic panels (solar panels), a vertical wind turbine, and a direct digital control building management system.
The results of these efforts are 200 gallons of water and 125 kilowatts of electricity produced each day — quite an impressive amount for such a small facility. If the CSL is able to uphold these standards for a year and collect the data necessary to back those qualifications, it will qualify for the international Living Building Challenge, one of the most honorable and competitive awards that can be bestowed upon a green building.
While the $23 million project is breathtaking on paper, the realized vision is unfortunately underwhelming. While visitors can easily see the lagoons and solar panels, it’s hard to truly appreciate the vast strides that the facility has made in sustainable building and landscape: The dull concrete building is unfinished, not very visually engaging, and lacking in visitor resources, save for a docent and interactive computer. The result doesn’t do justice to the amazing environmental efforts of the Conservatory.
That being said, I have high hopes for this incredible project. Phipps as a whole consistently presents exhaustively-researched, well-organized, well-funded, and creatively presented efforts. This project in particular has the added importance of being a building that has attained three international awards.
Phipps isn’t going to drop the ball; it’s just possible they tossed it into the public court a little too early.
For more information on the CSL, please visit phipps.conservatory.org. You can also follow updates to the entire Conservatory @phippsnews and ask questions directly about the Center for Sustainable Living with #askcsl on Twitter.

Dear Patrick,
Running Linux was the only thing keeping me from spending all my free time playing video games, but Steam for Linux just came out, and now I’m worried I’ll spend all my time playing games instead of going to class — or, more importantly, bars. What can I do to resist the Steam sale’s siren song?
Thanks,
Uselessly Laboring, Yearning Silencing Steam’s Endless Serenade
Dear ULYSSES,
As far as I know, there are only two known methods for resisting a siren’s song: Stuff your ears with wax or tie yourself to a ship’s mast. Metaphorically, of course. Stuffing your ears with wax would mean uninstalling Steam and all those games. Pretend you’ve never heard of it. Wait to install it again until after the semester is over. But the dulcet tones of cheap games are already ringing in your ears.
The only solution, then, is to have your crewmen strap you to the mast — in other words, willpower — by which I mean having friends willing to drag you to class and bars. I know, friends suck. But it must be done! If you keep strong, you may finally lay eyes on your sweet Penelope. By which I mean some drunk chick at a bar.
Reading The Odyssey in high school is finally paying off,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m interested in these two dudes and can’t choose between them. Worse still, they’re friends, and I don’t want to do anything to mess up their friendship. I think I’d have a shot with either one; all that’s left to do is choose. How?
Thanks,
Either Valentine Excites Romantic Yearning, Requires Organizing My Choices Or May Shortly Terminate Any Romance
Dear EVERY ROM COM STAR,
Why choose? Hey, man, it’s the 21st century; we’re pretty free-wheeling. You’re all consenting adults (hopefully), and as long as they’re cool with it, you may not have to choose. Don’t worry about ruining their friendship. You’ll make them more than friends: You’ll make them Eskimo brothers.
Okay, maybe you’re not down with that. Or they’re not. (Bunch of squares. Did Austin Powers teach us nothing?) Either way, you’ll actually have to choose. You could make a pro/con list, or actually get to know them, or whatever. But if they’re really so interchangeable that you can’t choose, then you may as well just flip a coin. That’s how I solve all my difficult decisions, like which bar to go to.
The answer’s the one with cheap beer,
Patrick Hoskins

My favorite new album at WRCT has been coldwave band Black Marble’s A Different Arrangement. Like much of Black Marble’s other source material, the album’s vocals are reminiscent of a low-key Ian Curtis, further developing the sound of their earlier Weight Against the Door EP. Here, the typically subdued tension between the angular synthesizers and human melancholia is at its zenith.
A Different Arrangement surveys a wide variety of sounds, from the radiant, bouncing ebullience of “A Great Design” to the haunted-playground bop of “Limitations,” juxtaposing sampled rim-drum tracks with layers of sentimental synth melodies. Warm basslines shapeshift across the album’s runtime and vintage synthesizer arrangements are airy and, at times, so distinctly sculpted they seem otherworldly.
“A certain handmade feeling is what we’re after,” Stewart explained in an interview with Hardly Art, the record label. “The music doesn’t have to be complex, but it’s more important to carry some residue of the process, especially when working with what [can sometimes] be construed as cold-sounding electronics. It’s humanizing.”
Black Marble’s latest album certainly embodies an analog quality that brings life to otherwise unfeeling electronic music. The textural complexities to which Stewart refers can only be fully appreciated after multiple listens, allowing the soundscapes to sink in further, quietly addictive.
If Weight Against the Door constituted a long, cold night, then A Different Arrangement heralds the moment when the radiator finally sputters to life, flooding the room with heat as the sun rises over a horizon of Brutalist tower blocks. The homemade soundtrack to a still, uncertain dawn, A Different Arrangement is a striking evolution in Black Marble’s sound.

I Love You Phillip Morris
8 10 12
We can all agree that Jim Carrey has made some very bad decisions. But we can also agree that, when given an intelligent script, he has an exciting, unique, and tragicomic personality (see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Cable Guy). I Love You Phillip Morris gives Carrey a great opportunity to play those chops again. He stars as a con-artist and impostor willing to escape from multiple prisons to be with the love of his life (Ewan McGregor).
The Iron Lady
10 12
The Iron Lady is a run-of-the-mill biopic with nearly no flavor, detailing the glory years of Margaret Thatcher’s reign. But at least there’s Meryl Streep, right? Streep has garnered such an absurd amount of esteem among acting appreciators that this reasonably wretched film was allowed to win Streep an Academy Award for her work. The film follows Thatcher through a variety of life-changing events and her personal struggles as a powerful woman.
The Perks of Being a Wallflower
8 10 12
Anyone who read this book in high school remembers it. Stephen Chbosky’s text was so formative to so many young people around the turn of the millenium that I’m surprised it took this long to adapt to a film. Alas, we are treated to a perfectly reasonable adaptation of Chbosky’s book. The author, a Pittsburgh native, also directed the film, starring Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller. It chronicles the struggles of Charlie, a high-school social outcast, as he tries to fit in. College students are a little outside the target audience and the film plays unironically. But it’s an honest attempt at true, emotional filmmaking that mostly works: a major accomplishment these days.

Carnegie Mellon University student government is currently sponsoring a survey to measure the usage of the Arts Pass Program. The Arts Pass Program offers students free admission to museums and venues throughout Pittsburgh, including Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, Carnegie Science Center’s Highmark SportsWorks, the Andy Warhol Museum, the Mattress Factory, the National Aviary, and Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. Students can gain free access simply by showing their Carnegie Mellon Student ID card, and the museum or venue then bills Carnegie Mellon per student visit.
The program is sponsored by the Student Dormitory Council, Student Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, CFA Dean’s Office, and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. 
Without the Arts Pass, student admission to these locations costs anywhere between $10 and $20.
Student government has been looking into changing the program and sent out the recent survey administered by Carnegie Mellon’s Office of Institutional Research to improve their current data. Surveys were emailed to the student body this past week. As an incentive for participation, students who completed the survey were entered into a raffle to win one of two Amazon Kindle Fires. Student body president Will Weiner said, “We’re trying to understand the landscape. We don’t necessarily know why people are using Arts Pass, how well people are informed about Arts Pass, and what are the things people would like to see.”
The survey included questions measuring students’ awareness of the Arts Pass program and how frequently they used their Carnegie Mellon ID to gain access to included venues and programs, among other options.
Potential changes to the program include partnering with Pittsburgh Connections or expanding the pass to include more artistic rather than museum-like venues, such as galleries or Benedum Center shows. “There’s a whole spectrum out there that’s not being tapped,” Weiner said.
Senior biology major Mridula Nadamuni frequently uses the pass and thinks that Carnegie Mellon should continue to sponsor the program. “It has made my Pittsburgh experience more interesting,” she said.
Additionally, the pass can be a valuable resource for students new to the Pittsburgh region. Sophomore biology and psychology double major Matthew Early said, “As someone who is not originally from Pittsburgh, the Arts Pass Program has provided a great opportunity to experience the local culture. More students should consider using it as way of enriching their time here.” Nadamuni added, “Freshmen need to get off campus. They think CMU is Pittsburgh. It’s not Pittsburgh, it’s just a part of Pittsburgh.”
Changes, however, are not going to take place in the near future. 
According to Weiner, “It’s pretty up in the air right now. We’re not necessarily sure what we want to change, or if we want to change anything.”

Many Carnegie Mellon University students have recently been targeted by an individual soliciting money in the Oakland area. The suspect, described as an African-American woman,  has reportedly been fabricating stories to solicit money from students and Pittsburgh residents.
The suspect, who appears to be in her 40s, has been seen driving a purple Chrysler Sebring sedan and a black Chevrolet Blazer SUV in the Oakland area, as well as a silver Toyota Camry and a minivan. Carnegie Mellon University Police, University of Pittsburgh Police, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police have been trying to stop her, but they need assistance.
According to lieutenant Gary Scheimer, the university has had issues with the suspect since 2011. 
Scheimer noted that the suspect has posed as various individuals, including “a flight attendant who ran out of gas, someone who had to go to a hospital,” among others.
Although it seems that the students approached were not susceptible to the scam, the suspect has allegedly been very convincing. 
According to police reports, the woman stays in her car and fakes a breakdown. She is “persistent and has even given her cell phone number and had people go to ATMs.” Furthermore, she has commonly brought along a young boy of about 3 or 4 years old, whom she calls her son, to manipulate individuals into helping her out.
Already, there have been dozens of cases of people being scammed. She has been spotted throughout the Oakland and Squirrel Hill area, and University of Pittsburgh Police have also been trying to thwart her attempts. Most recently, she has attempted to get money from individuals in the Squirrel Hill area.
Scheimer noted that in August 2011, University Police chief Thomas Ogden sent out an email to the entire campus community warning people about the woman. “She’s stopped a couple times,” Scheimer said, “but then reappears.” University Police already knows the identity of the woman; she has been given a Defiant Trespass Order by Carnegie Mellon that warns her against continuing her activity. But this has not stopped her from continuing to harass people in the area.
Most recently, a female student from Squirrel Hill emailed the police about an African-American woman in a car who stopped her and asked for cash. 
Carnegie Mellon officer Daniel Janeda notes that the woman is highly skilled at her craft, and her use of a 3-year-old child during her attempts “makes people compassionate to want to help her.” Despite some awareness about this woman, she has remained very effective in her attempts.
According to Scheimer, the woman has been tried in court multiple times. Scheimer said that a University of Pittsburgh detective has filed charges against her, and she is due in court soon. However, past charges against the woman have been “dismissed multiple times” because victims are not willing to spend valuable time and effort prosecuting a woman who did not steal much money from them in the first place. She usually will take small amounts of cash, occasionally soliciting $50 from a victim.
Another part of the problem with prosecuting her has been that some feel her only crime is lying, which would not warrant a major penalty. Janeda notes there is a “slippery slope because she’s asking for money.”
However, Scheimer feels a line has been crossed with the particular individual because she is partaking in “a coercive action with theft by scam, so it’s just a matter of getting victims to come testify.” The fact that she has also disregarded the Defiant Trespass Order will help the police build a case against her in a future trial. The police believe the woman has been so convincing that not every case has been reported, as individuals have thought she legitimately needed help.
Je-Hoon Oh, a first-year chemistry major, was glad to have been alerted to this ongoing scam, noting that he believed the woman’s actions to be “classless.”
University Police ask students to be vigilant and aware of this woman’s behavior. Regarding the variety of vehicles the woman has used, the police urge students and faculty to understand that she may be driving in other vehicles. 
She usually pulls up to curbs to provoke her would-be victims; she likely prefers staying in her car so she can flee quickly if necessary.
Many Carnegie Mellon students have already heard of this issue and have known friends who were solicited by the woman. 
However, newer students are unaware of the solicitation. 
Reaction to the scam was that of concern. 
Sam Farley, a first-year chemistry major, was shocked. “Wow, that’s weird. I’m concerned for the child, actually,” he said.
Yassine Mouline, a first-year electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering double major, agreed with this sentiment, saying, “That’s completely messed up.”
If you see this woman and you are not in any danger of harm, the police ask that you call University Police if you are on campus and the Pittsburgh Police (911) if you are not.
Try to discern where she is going and the make and model of the vehicle she is driving. 
If you are given the woman’s number, you can verify it belongs to her by going to www.800notes.com. 
Janeda, however, stresses that safety is “number one” for anyone who comes in contact with the perpetrator. 
Police just need a student to come forward and be willing to aid them in their quest to prevent this woman from pestering individuals in the area.

Carnegie Mellon University’s Vice President of Campus Affairs Michael Murphy took questions from members of the university community during an open town hall meeting on the progress of the university’s vice-president & chief financial officer (VP/CFO) search committee’s efforts last Thursday.
The VP/CFO search committee consists of 17 university faculty and staff members and was established following former chief financial officer Deb Moon’s departure in late 2012. 
Murphy currently chairs the committee and also serves as interim VP/CFO until a successor is named.
The town hall follows the university’s public posting of the open vice–president and chief financial officer position on several public job boards.
The university is also contracting with executive search consulting firm Storbeck/Pimentel & Associates to aid with less publically visible forms of recruitment.
Commenting on Storbeck/Pimentel’s role in the search, Murphy noted, “Often people don’t want to be identified as candidates, particularly if they’re currently in high profile positions.”
Storbeck/Pimentel also facilitated Carnegie Mellon’s recent recruitment of Subra Suresh as its new president.
As the VP/CFO search committee now begins to consider applications received in response to these public job postings and from Storbeck/Pimentel, Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the town hall was to “hear your thoughts about the position and to make sure that as we move forward, we have your input.” 
With that, Murphy posed three discussion questions for the audience before opening up the floor to questions: “What are the great reasons to come to Carnegie Mellon? What are the challenges of the VP/CFO position? And what are some of the core qualities that committee should be looking for in candidates?”
Attendance at the open town hall consisted primarily of other members on the search committee, who both asked questions as audience members and joined Murphy in answering  questions posed by the attendees.
The town hall sparked a great deal of discussion in particular about how the committee should weigh entrepreneurship and business skills against previous experience in higher education. 
According to Murphy, the university has generally only recruited executives from higher education backgrounds, such as retiring president Jared Cohon, who worked at Yale University and Johns Hopkins University. 
“We tend to presume that the ideal candidate will come in with an understanding and enthusiasm [for] … the structure of a large private institution like Carnegie Mellon,” said Murphy.
However, as audience member and Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert, pointed out, “[Carnegie Mellon’s] aspirations and the league in which we want to play is much higher than what the university actually has these resources to do, and it won’t be a walk in park for CFO to navigate this reality constantly.”
Carnegie Mellon’s endowment of $1 billion is a fraction of the endowments of the other private institutions in its peer group. 
“We’re always looking at our peers and seeing how with the endowment draw and gifts that they get, they can pay for things that we can’t afford,” observed Barbara Morycz, committee member and Assistant Vice President of Budget and Financial Planning. 
“But we’ve been fortunate enough to be able to find creative sources of funding for things that don’t just naturally fall into our laps out of the budget.”
Given how the 2008 economic crisis and the possibilities of federal spending sequestration have exacerbated this discrepancy between Carnegie Mellon’s ambitions and its available resources, committee member and professor of philosophy Joel Smith posed the question of whether a particular candidate’s entrepreneurship skills merited additional consideration in this process.
“If candidates present themselves as coming from a very entrepreneurial background and can think creatively about financial situations…. Can that experience make up for a lack of experience in higher ed?” Smith asked.
Murphy announced that the committee will be reviewing applications starting in March. 
They expect to narrow down candidates to a list of three finalists by the first week of May. 
The start date for the new vice president and chief financial officer selection is slated for July 1, the same day that Suresh is set to take office as Carnegie Mellon’s ninth president.

“You don’t need to solve the entire problem to do something useful,” Obama for America chief scientist Rayid Ghani told the packed audience in the Gates Hillman Complex’s Rashid Auditorium on Thursday. A Carnegie Mellon graduate, Ghani faced a problem that was easy to phrase but hard to solve: Where should the Obama 2012 presidential campaign put its money, advertisements, and volunteers in order to maximize its chances of getting the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the election?
Ghani — and the rest of the Obama campaign’s technical staff, headed by chief technology officer Harper Reed and chief innovation and integration officer Michael Slaby — solved the problem with data mining and machine learning.
“We used a lot of heuristics because we had to solve the problem before the election. We could have spent years on this thing. But this is an example of other problems ... very similar in nature that a lot of you guys are capable of solving.”
Ghani first discussed how the campaign identified the states in which money would be most effectively spent.
“That’s the reason data and machine learning and analytics are so important: because it’s all about resource allocation,” Ghani said. “I have a limited amount of resources and I need to spend them in different states to maximize my chances of getting 270 votes. We had a lot of money but it’s still finite, and you can only put it in so many places.”
But the most important decisions, Ghani said, took place not at the state level, but at the individual level. “I’m not taking actions in a state. I’m not trying to convince a state to register to vote. Every action a campaign takes is at a very individual level, with a couple of exceptions.”
According to Ghani, the campaign made contact with about 135 million people via phone calls and door-to-door canvassing. They used data from publicly available voting forms. 
Each person the campaign came into contact with was assigned three scores: one indicating his or her support for President Obama, one indicating his or her ability to be persuaded, and one indicating the likelihood that he or she would vote at all.
The campaign performed small experiments to determine what factors made a person likely to be persuaded in either direction. 
They drew data on support from polling, as well as from proxy data such as party affiliation.
Once individuals had been scored, the campaign was able to efficiently target people who could be persuaded or convinced to vote for Obama — and not waste money on those who were unlikely to vote or switch sides.
The campaign also used the individual scores to target communities. 
“The nice thing about doing everything at an individual level: You can aggregate up,” Ghani said. “You can easily aggregate up and calculate the number of votes you’re going to get from a particular zip code.”
Ghani said that the campaign used individual scores to make decisions about canvassing, online ads, and television ads.
In addition to getting voters, part of Ghani’s job was to find ways to raise more money. To do so, the campaign performed many small, controlled experiments with fundraising emails.
“It wasn’t enough to build a model and just watch and see what happened,” Ghani said. “You had to convince somebody to do that work. You couldn’t just say that it’s going to work, so go ahead and do it. We had to almost prove everything using randomized experiments.”
These studies determined whether emails that came from First Lady Michelle Obama were more successful than those from Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. 
It also determined whether emails should have a link in them, and how much the campaign should ask of a particular person in order to maximize their contribution.
One result of the experiments surprised Ghani.
“In the beginning, when I started the campaign, I thought we were sending too many emails to people,” Ghani said.
He worried that bombarding people with too many emails would cause them to unsubscribe. 
But, he said, experiments proved him wrong.
“Turns out, every time we did an experiment reducing the email frequency, we lost money,” he commented.
Ghani’s lecture was well-attended by machine learning students, most of whom were excited to hear from someone using machine learning in the field.
“I liked that he was really using machine learning to address a problem that is a practical problem,” said Edward McFowland III, a machine learning Ph.D. student in Heinz College. 
“It’s really a practical application of machine learning. I think we motivate a lot of our machine learning algorithms with practical applications, but rarely do we actually go out and apply our algorithms to the actual problems, see them working in real life.”
Machine learning Ph.D. student Alex Loewi agreed. 
“It felt vindicating. We work on this with the conception that it will be useful, and very rarely feel like it actually is.”
Ghani was one of the first people to receive a master’s degree in machine learning from Carnegie Mellon.

Elections board
Five members of the Undergraduate Student Senate along with Graduate School Assembly representatives were elected as chairs of the elections board. These individuals will oversee the student body elections process. This board will have support from people specializing in technology as well as in the relevant rules and regulations. 
Spring break trip funding discussion
Student Senate funding of spring break travel expenses was a topic of significant discussion, largely resulting from the decision by the Joint Funding Committee to cut all funding for spring break travel last year. 
Organizations that have had difficulty raising funds have petitioned Student Senate for the money, and are being heard on a case-by-case basis. 
After a discussion about the Senate’s responsiblity to student organizations, specific petitions were heard.The Senate currently funds 50 percent of travel costs for an organization, and is making decisions based on the potential value that the specific spring break trip would bring to the university.
Election bylaws
The specific language regarding bylaw changes is currently being drafted. There will be no limits on campaign funds, however, there will be a limitation on things that can be given out as part of a campaign. There will be a $1 limitation on gifts, and a $500 total spending limit on gifts. The rules that prevent study abroad students and outgoing seniors from voting are currently being reviewed.
Elections timeline
Petitions to run for Senator or an executive position were released last Friday, and petitions can be on paper or online. To run for executive, president, or vice-president, at least 100 signatures are required from across all colleges during the petitioning period. To run for Senator, at least 25 signatures are required from the undergraduate college one is running to represent. Petitions are due March 4.
Money allocations
Allocations were made to the Lacrosse Team and Global Medical Brigades for $8,000 to cover travel expenses, in addition to $2,500 to CMU Bhangra to cover their travel expenses. An allocation of $3,000 was made for the Global Business Brigade for Panama, along with $800 to the Chinese Student Association.

Senator Daylin Leach (D-Pa.) recently proposed a bill to the Pennsylvania state legislature to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. It’s about time. Since states like Washington and Colorado legalized weed in the last election, the rest of the country, Pennsylvania included, needs to follow suit.
I can’t think of one good reason why marijuana should be illegal. According to The Economist, cannabis is significantly less harmful than both alcohol and tobacco, two legal drugs. Overdosing on marijuana is unheard of, whereas getting sick from drinking — better known as alcohol poisoning — is something that many college students experience at least once in their lives. Regarding tobacco, smoking causes cancer and endangers others via second and thirdhand smoke, which lingers in fabric and furniture.
One common argument against marijuana is that it’s a gateway drug which leads to the consumption of other, more harmful drugs such as heroin and cocaine. While this may be true regarding marijuana now, it won’t be true if it’s legalized. If registered businesses sold marijuana, it would be taken off of the street and removed from the culture that surrounds other, more dangerous drugs. Legalization would add a layer of separation between marijuana and the other drugs that it’s a supposed gateway to.
Along with other arguments against marijuana, people claim that having high drivers on the road would be particularly dangerous. Yet there’s no reason that this couldn’t be illegal like drunk driving.
Furthermore, a study done by two economists affiliated with the University of Colorado and the University of Michigan found that high drivers are safer than their drunk counterparts. While drunk drivers swerve and speed, high drivers wait for stop signs to turn green. Although they are still not preferable to those not under the influence, people who would otherwise drive drunk might drive high instead if marijuana were legal, keeping us a bit safer.
Another oft-argued benefit to the legalization of marijuana is increased revenue for the government. By slapping excise taxes on marijuana, the government can gain massive amounts of revenue. This could be used to solve a lot of the budget shortfalls our state is facing. Another benefit to legalizing marijuana would be the advent of organic marijuana. As unregulated as marijuana is, it can be exposed to many harmful chemicals while being grown. This unnecessarily adds health risks to your friendly neighborhood stoners. Marijuana users could opt to grow their own weed in a safe manner, or buy from storefronts regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
The criminalization of marijuana has also caused unnecessary strain on our justice system. It is an absolute injustice that even one cop has died trying to prevent the sale of marijuana. We need to better utilize our resources to prevent violent crimes and keep real criminals off of the street. 
Many people incarcerated for selling marijuana don’t actually want to break the law or hurt other people. They’re not truly a danger to society and they regularly cost our justice system tons of money. The legalization of marijuana would get these supposed criminals out of our justice system and open up more resources for preventing actual harmful crimes.
The bill to legalize marijuana is not likely to succeed due to Republican opposition and minimal Democratic support. Even if it does pass, governor Tom Corbett (R-Pa.) has said that he’d veto this bill. In Pennsylvania, where all liquor stores are run by the state, it’s ridiculous that we can’t authorize private possession of a simple and mostly harmless herb.

Since Steve Mosites founded The Mosites Company in 1992, the company has attempted to rejuvenate East Liberty. Now, the company that pulled Target and Whole Foods into East Liberty (and built Rivers Casino and Heinz Field) in order to generate commerce in Pittsburgh seeks to continue its job. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mosites is promising to add a 366-unit apartment complex, a great deal of retail stores, and a new transit center across from the Target in East Liberty by mid-2014.
The previous and current renovations to East Liberty are beneficial to the city’s growth; however, The Tartan is unable to endorse Mosites’ plan because it does not take into account the cost of living for the area’s current population.
The company’s plan for new retail stores may interfere with the lives of the area’s residents. These plans include renovating the territory on Centre Avenue and Penn Circle South to add residential-type shops. Although it is admirable that Mosites is attempting to renovate the area, it has not taken into account the local shops and venues already there.
More importantly, renovations and the inclusion of retail stores will most likely increase housing costs. Currently, 20 percent of the people who live in the ZIP code 15206, which includes East Liberty, live below the national poverty level, according to the 2010 census. 
The area’s median household income is $35,205 while the median household income across the country is $46,326.
According to city-data.com, the median rent in East Liberty was $421, a full $151 less than the average rent in Pittsburgh, as of 2009. In an area with a population largely below the poverty line, increased costs are unacceptable.
Rising housing costs may leave many residents, as well as the students from Carnegie Mellon living in the area, scrambling to find either money or a new place to live. 
We hope that these supposedly speedy renovations will keep in mind the lives of the current residents in the district.

Last week, The Tartan printed Catherine Spence’s “Consider campus living,”  in which she argues that on-campus housing is more beneficial than off-campus housing for students. There are pros and cons to living on and off campus. However, I do not agree with some of Spence’s arguments, including her main one: I think off-campus housing is better than on-campus housing.
Spence states that bathroom necessities are always at one’s disposal on campus. However, toilet paper, paper towels, and soap are not refilled every day in the communal bathrooms of on-campus housing. On the other hand, students who live off campus can personally ensure that they do not run into this problem by storing extra bathroom necessities.
While it is true that the university’s Facilities Management Services will not be there to fix a broken window, door, or chair off campus, every housing unit has a landlord to call if anything is wrong. If you do your research correctly (through online reviews and people’s word of mouth), you could even find a landlord who responds to maintenance requests faster than the university. Thus, even if Facilities Management Services does not come off campus to repair damaged items, a specialist provided by the landlord will.
In her article, Spence acknowledges the most common argument for living off campus: Since there is no option to live on campus in real life, people should move off campus and get used to it now. She argues that people should not do this until they must. However, living off campus really does provide invaluable preparation for the real world. It teaches students life responsibilities while they still have the financial and psychological safety net provided by parents and the university.
Students living off campus will not be less informed about campus activities compared to students living on campus. Most students living off campus are at school for the majority of their days attending classes, visiting Club Hunt, or participating in extracurricular activities. Somewhere, somehow, those students will hear the same news that students living on campus hear.
Besides, off-campus housing usually offers more space to students. They do not have to be cooped up in small dormitory rooms throughout their entire college experience. While on-campus dorm sizes range from Hamerschlag House’s standard doubles to Mudge House’s prime quads, off-campus housing definitely gives students more room to spread out their belongings and relax.
Even though on-campus housing is more convenient for students in terms of proximity and promotes a certain sense of community, the pros of off-campus housing evidently outweigh the pros of on-campus housing. There is no reason for students to pay more living on campus when they could have a better college experience living off campus while learning to be more responsible.

The dangers of sharing sexual photos or sending sexually explicit text messages always grab the attention of news outlets nowadays. New technology has an undeniable effect on how people flirt and to what extent people share themselves. The issue has come up again with a seemingly harmless smartphone application known as Snapchat.
Snapchat first launched in 2011, but it only truly became popular in the second half of 2012. The application allows you to take pictures, decorate them, and send them to other friends who use the application. The hook, though, is that the recipient of a photo can only view it for a set time period (no more than 10 seconds) before it disappears from the phone. If a screenshot is taken while the photo is being viewed, the sender of the photo will be alerted and can take actions accordingly.
While the above description sounds like the perfect criterion for a carefree sexting application, responsibility doesn’t rest on the application’s creators to police the application content to prevent sexting.
The lack of stored photos is what sets the application apart from other photo-sharing services, and is what many people think could appeal to those who want to share racy photos without them circulating past the intended recipient. It can come off as a fun, safe way to sext, with a reduced fear of the pictures haunting you for years to come.
Facebook, as it is apt to do whenever a new web trend goes viral, created an application called Poke. Essentially copying the Snapchat model, Poke never took off, while Snapchat is currently the 20th most popular free application in the iTunes App Store. Being affiliated with the largest social network for sharing information and photos with friends may have turned people off from using a service meant to share private photos and videos.
Given the popularity of Snapchat, many concerns have been raised over its potential use as a sexting tool, especially when considering its young demographic. The mascot of Snapchat is a cartoon ghost, named “Ghostface Chillah” according to  Forbes, and the images on the company's website, and the images on the company's website  and application page are of preteen girls. There’s an apparent effort by the creators to appeal to the young demographic, but this becomes perverted if the application’s rumored uses are utilized.
However, it cannot be the company’s responsibility to stop its users from sexting with the application, any more than it’s the responsibility of the inventor of the camera phone to prevent sexting. What needs to happen is increased education on the pitfalls of sexting.
People, especially minors, need to be made aware that no matter the medium, anything that is shared and stored digitally can live forever. According to BuzzFeed, there are ways to find locally-stored Snapchat photos on your phone in order to save them forever. This poses a risk to anyone who would use the application for sharing suggestive material.
You can’t expect anything you do on the Internet to be temporary, and thus Snapchat’s promise can’t be a guarantee. There will always be individuals who try to hack services and applications to get what they want, which includes your naughty photos. However, users can prevent others from sharing their photos by not taking naughty photos in the first place.
Snapchat, while seemingly juvenile, has both its fun purposes as well as its risqué uses. Using Snapchat for tame things can be entertaining, as I’ve found with my growing use of the application, and the idea that it is purely a sexting application should be dispelled. The issue of sending racy photos isn’t with the application, but with the user who is uneducated about the dangers and consequences of sexting.

The Joint Funding Committee (JFC), the student group that allocates revenue from the student activities fee to campus organizations, recently stated that it would use  The Bridge to help decide how the revenue is divided among organizations for the 2013-14 academic year.
The Bridge is an online tool that connects students to organizations and events on campus. Students can join organizations through The Bridge, which lists members of groups publicly. The JFC says it will consider the number of students listed in an organization when determining budgets.
While The Bridge has the potential to accurately measure organization membership, the JFC could have given organizations more time to allow members to join the website.
Because The Bridge is fairly new, many organization leaders do not use the website. Organization membership on The Bridge often does not accurately represent true membership since most students do not join their respective extracurricular activities' pages.
While the JFC encouraged organization leaders to have their members join their respective organizations on The Bridge, they did not provide ample time for organizations to contact their members. 
Many organizations meet weekly, and some do not regularly schedule meetings. The email informing organizations to contact their members was sent on Tuesday. Budget considerations began Friday. With less than a week for organizations to contact members, leaders may not have been able to tell members to join The Bridge.
Short on time, some organizations also flocked to Facebook and email in an attempt to increase membership by telling students who are not currently members to join them on The Bridge. 
With the possibility that students joined organizations they do not belong to, budgets could be misallocated.
Admittedly, the JFC had good intentions to count organization membership, and its method for allocating funds may have caused more students to use The Bridge. But we urge the JFC to give students more time to join their respective organizations on The Bridge so that budgets can be allocated to campus organizations as accurately as possible

One of the most historical moments of recent years was the killing of Osama bin Laden. Everyone remembers the shooting of the Al Qaeda leader and the global ramifications of this clandestine operation. Nearly two years ago, bin Laden’s death created an international chasm between the United States and Pakistan. The details of his killing, however, have revealed a flaw within our own nation that goes beyond international relations: the subpar treatment of our veterans.
In a recent Esquire interview interview, the U.S. Navy SEAL who killed bin Laden came forward to speak about the military’s support — or lack thereof — for him and his family. Referred to as the “Shooter,” he resigned three years before the 20 years of service required to guarantee retirement benefits such as healthcare and pension. When he asked to be given protection for his family, the military offered to put him in a quasi-witness protection program but offered him no further assistance.
The Shooter’s story of the military’s poor treatment could seem as though he is seeking preferential treatment for being the one to kill bin Laden. People may argue that service members who resign before their terms are over cannot reasonably expect to receive full benefits. Although his decision to resign prematurely in order to protect his family is understandable, that decision carried consequences that were to be expected.
Despite this discrepancy, the story still highlights serious problems within the veterans benefits system.
Every combat veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is entitled to five years of free healthcare after returning from service. No matter when the Shooter resigned, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) should have given him these benefits. However, he was not informed of this policy. His filed disability claim with the VA has also been in backlog for several months.
The Shooter is not the only victim of a convoluted system; gaining benefits from the VA is rarely simple. Bureaucracy and inefficiency combine to form a mountain of red tape that veterans must wade through. After their service to our country, these loyal men and women should be treated with more consideration. As President Obama said last Veterans Day, “No one who fights for this country overseas should ever have to fight for a job, or a roof over their head.”
While the Shooter’s belief that he deserves the same benefits as someone who has served 20 years may be presumptuous, the problem is that some people who have served their time do not receive their deserved benefits because of how difficult the bureaucracy can be.
There is something seriously wrong with a system that would abandon its constituents, however impersonally. This abandonment is a treatment endured by many service members less notable than the Shooter. They are all people that have risked their lives to protect and serve the United States.
“I just want to be able to pay all those bills, take care of my kids, and work from there,” the Shooter said, and he should be able to.

Harvard University announced its investigation into allegations of cheating for the final exam of its Introduction to Congress course in August 2012. Over half of the class was initially accused. In early February, the university announced their final decisions regarding the fates of the students accused of cheating. 
Professor Matthew Platt grew suspicious when many exams were similar. Some exams even had the same typos. Students were accused of collaboration or plagiarism, and many were recently forced to withdraw. Some students are now on probation and lost credits for courses that they had almost completed during the Fall 2012 semester.
However, the case is not that simple. Academic integrity ultimately rests on the shoulders of students, but professors and their assistants also play a role in ensuring the clarity of what constitutes cheating.
The course Introduction to Congress has a reputation of being an exceedingly easy class, which, according to students, Platt openly acknowledged. According to a student, Platt said, “I gave out 120 A's last semester, and I'll give out 120 more.” He told students that coming to lecture was not necessary, as they could share notes. Many accused students claim that the similarities in the final tests come from these notes.
Some students claimed that the prompt for the exam — which was a take-home test — was confusing. 
It read: “The exam is completely open book, open note, open internet, etc. However, in all other regards, this should fall under similar guidelines that apply to in-class exams. More specifically, students may not discuss the exam with others — this includes resident tutors, writing centers, etc.” 
Despite these guidelines, Platt and the teaching fellows held office hours before the exam was due, in which they discussed the questions. 
If the directions stated that students could not talk about the exam, the instructors should have consistently upheld that rule.
Furthermore, the exam was the last of four take-home tests for the class. The students received similar instructions on all of those tests, but had collaborated on the first three without reprisal. Once again, consistency should have been a priority.
Academic honesty seems obvious, but each teacher has different standards for his or her class. Teachers must make those rules explicitly clear, and then stand by them.
