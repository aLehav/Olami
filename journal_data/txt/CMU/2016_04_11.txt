The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team closed off a weekend of play with a tight battle against 18th-ranked Kenyon College at home on the evening of Sunday April 3, battling to continue to show why they deserve to be ranked as one of the premier teams in Division III.
The Tartans kept the competition close after some struggles in doubles play. The Tartans won 5–4, and they continue to establish themselves as a premier team in Division III.
The men came out firing in doubles play, as two of three duos went up by a game in the first few minutes of play.  After four or five games of play, Carnegie continued to pull out in front.  With a 2–2 split in sophomore Jeffrey Chen and junior Kenny Zheng’s play looking like the tight competition, the men looked to be in good position.
Chen and Zheng  took advantage of the momentum of the break to give Carnegie Mellon its first point, however the other doubles teams fell 6–8, giving Kenyon a 2–1 lead.
With the doubles competitions wrapped up, play transitioned to singles matchups.  In the top singles game, the Tartan’s senior player Abhishek Alla fell behind early, losing an early break and letting the first set get away from him.  Dropping the set 1–6, Alla had only game going into the second set.
However, in a day filled with midgame turnarounds, Alla poured it on early, jumping out to a 5–1 lead before giving up a second game.  This still allowed Alla to take the set 6–2 to bring the match to the 3rd set.
In the Tartan’s second singles match, first-year player Daniel Levine challenged for another singles win.  Unlike Alla, Levine wasn’t looking to leave things up to suspense.  He took control of the first set midway through with a break, and extended the success with a win in both sets. Levine’s two set singles victory was accompanied by a 6–2, 6–1 win by first-year player Chaz Downing, and another singles loss, to tie the Tartans up with Kenyon, 3–3. The Tartans showed their depth in the final stage, leading in the sixth singles match and showing their competitiveness at all levels before ultimately taking the victory.
The Carnegie Mellon tennis teams took to the courts on Saturday to square off against the Blue Jays of regional rival Johns Hopkins University. The men’s team won a hard-fought match by a slim margin, 5–4, and the women’s team continued their domination by winning 8–1. This victory brings the Tartans to a 13–5 record.
The men’s team scored the points that mattered in doubles play. The duo of seniors Alla and Yuvraj Kumar scored the first point of the day for the Tartans, winning third doubles by a score of 9–7. The less experienced first-year pair of Vayum Arora and Levine dropped a barn burner of a set in first doubles, but Chen and Zheng came in clutch for the Tartans, giving their team a 2–1 lead going into singles play. 
The Blue Jays would not be silenced, however. They took second and first singles to take a 3–2 lead in the favor of Johns Hopkins, and suddenly the Tartan men were on the back foot.
Zheng scored another important point for the Tartans in fourth singles, winning 6–0, 7–5. Arora clawed the lead from the clutches of the Blue Jays in fifth singles, winning 6–3, 7–5.
Downing was the player of the day, however. Downing made a come from behind victory in third singles, forcing a second set tiebreaker and scoring five unanswered points to take the set.  Downing also scored three straight points in the third set to take the match win, 6–7 (9–11), 7–6 (8–6), 6–4.
The 11th-ranked women’s tennis team had a much easier road to victory. They started the day off right by sweeping doubles play against their 12th-ranked opponents. Senior Brooke Tsu and first-year Jamie Vizelman scored the first point of the day for the Tartans, winning 8–4. The pair of sophomore Cori Sidell and first–year Minami Makino won 9–7 against a higher-ranked duo, while senior Abbey Hamstra and junior Nicholle Torres completed the sweep of doubles by winning 9–8 (7–2).
Sidell was the first to finish singles play in the third position, winning 6–1, 6–2. First-year Marina Selenica and Makino also scored victories in singles play. Selenica won 6–0, 6–4 in sixth singles while Makino took fifth singles with a score of 4–6, 6–4, 1–0 (10–7). Tsu stepped up against the second best player in the region, and won 2–6, 6–4, 6–3 in first singles. Torres closed out the day in the second position, winning 6–3, 7–6 (7–4).
The Tartans will now move on to the UAA Championships, held in Altamonte Springs, Florida on April 21–23.

Last Monday night in Houston, Texas, University of North Carolina (UNC) and Villanova University put on a show while battling for the NCAA championship. In classic style, the Villanova Wildcats came away with the victory over the opposing Tar Heels in an end-to-end effort.
Villanova’s 77–74 win gives them their second national championship in program history, and their first since a 1985 win over Georgetown. It also ends a six-tournament streak of Villanova not making it through the second round.  
Throughout the tournament run, the Wildcats looked dominant, taking huge wins over top opponents on their climb up the bracket. The Wildcats had an especially notable win over the top seeded Kansas Jayhawks in the Elite Eight, beating out a favorite on the way to showing which team was the real team to beat.
UNC returns empty handed, with a concern about potential NCAA sanctions for academic fraud. With potential sanctions looming, UNC came up a bit short of getting a national championship win before their window of opportunity will potentially be closed by penalties. UNC is currently under investigation for providing improper help to struggling student athletes through special independent study style courses. Given their potential predicament, UNC put a big fight in the matchup.
The final 10 seconds highlighted the intensity of the game, with Villanova leading 74–71 going into the final sequence. UNC pressed the ball up the court, and UNC senior guard Marcus Paige contorted his body to make the game tying 3-pointer in the face of an oncoming defender. With only 4 seconds on the clock, Villanova made their argument for why they were the team to beat, racing up the court to try for a game winner.
With a second left, senior guard Ryan Arcidiacono tossed the ball back to junior forward Kris Jenkins, for a chance at the game. Jenkins caught the ball in motion to shoot, and dropped a game winning 3-pointer in the net as time expired. The lightning response by Villanova showed a team that had a broad range of weapons at their disposal in the game.
The game looked to be a back and forth from the gun, with Villanova winning the ball to start, only to turn it over and give UNC the chance to take the game’s first points. The game score was tied 9 times with constant lead changes, in a true championship battle.
Ten minutes into the first half, Villanova looked like they were building a lead, only to watch a 5-point lead turn into a 4-point deficit. A clutch 3 pointer by UNC sophomore guard Joel Berry II saw to that. By the end of the half, UNC looked like the team that had it figured out, holding off a Villanova counterattack to go into the locker room up 5.
It took Villanova a few minutes to get back to even, but by six minutes into the second half they did it. Villanova freshman guard Mikal Bridges took a pass by Arcidiacono and slammed it through the basket to tie things back up.
Going off Bridges’ dunk, Villanova looked to build a lead, and succeeded in working their way up by 10 points with a little over five minutes left in regulation. A smooth 3-point shot by UNC’s Paige help energize their unit in a fight to close back up in the final minutes. All of this battling built up to the clock racing finish the made the championship game one to be remembered.  
The fans showed the seismic level of the swing, with their responses to the shots. With Paige’s game tying shot at four seconds, the UNC crowd roared, as a tide of light blue jumped up in response to the shot. The audience, it seemed was largely for UNC, and a proud Michael Jordan with his arms raised up seemed emblematic of the success of UNC’s comeback.
But Villanova was not to be outdone. Jenkins’ response shot shattered the UNC picture with a Villanova uproar. With the final seconds ticking down, Jenkins took flight from well beyond the three-point line and sent his Hail Mary to the basket. Millions held their breath, the world slowed to a grinding halt, and then the only sound was the ball falling cleanly through the net. As Villanova re-broke the tie with the UNC basketball powerhouse, the dark blue jumped out. With a sudden flip-flop, the stadium seemingly transformed as the Villanova crowd erupted. Jenkins and the rest of the Villanova squad exploded in celebration with the fans and the Wildcats rode off into the history books.
As far as NCAA championship games go, this is one to be remembered for a long time. Both star-studded sides fought an unforgettable back and forth battle right up to the finish.

Throughout our day, most of us probably aren’t worried about where we’re going to go when we get thirsty: the myriad of water fountains and soda fountains make beverages an easily accessible commodity. Not all parts of the world are fortunate enough, however, to have such access to clean, filtered water. In fact, most third-world countries struggle to develop a sustainable supply of clean water.
A group of senior mechanical engineering students at Carnegie Mellon University attempted to solve that problem by developing a filtration mechanism that filters water as it is transported. The filtration consists of a big barrel that contains a smaller barrel inside of it, with a handle attached for pushing motility. The concept behind the design is that as the barrel is rolled along the ground, the motion caused by pushing the big barrel filters the dirt away from water and stores the purified, clean water in the mechanism’s smaller barrel.
“We had already seen some ideas out there that filtered water, and others that rolled the water using barrels, but we wanted to create something that filtered while you rolled,” said Deepak Ravi, one of the senior mechanical engineering students on the project, in a University press release.
The beauty of this water filtration system is that it filters water as it is transported, and it is industrially very simple in design. The filtration system contains only a few simple parts that amount to no more than $200 in cost, and requires no power input other than the physical pushing of the barrel by users during transportation of water. 
The system uses a Sawyer water filter and relies on a process called reverse osmosis. The basic design behind a reverse-osmosis water filter is that the filter is made of a porous substance that allows water to flow through it. Because water is in the liquid phase, it is able to deform and flow through the filter without any issues; any solid particles, however, cannot fit through the pores in the filter, and instead become trapped in the matter of the filter. 
The efficiency of a reverse-osmosis filtration device is dependent on its pore size: the smaller the pores are in the filter, the more solid particles it can trap. The Sawyer filter in the water barrel mechanism filters water as the barrel is pushed, conflating the issue of filtration and transportation into one solution. 
Other types of water filtration mechanisms do exist, such as ion exchange or activated carbon. In these filtration devices, water is passed through a chemical that adsorbs the dirt and other particulates that contaminate the water. While these types of filters are popular, they can get pricey due to the cost of the chemicals required for filtration. 
The advantage of using the Sawyer filter is that is does not need to be replaced, making it a one-time purchase that does not need to be refurbished over time, unlike the activated carbon or ion-exchange filtration mechanisms. Additionally, the group used a recycled industrial barrel as opposed to purchasing a new one to cut down on the cost of the device. The barrels are usually thrown away after they are used, so this senior project finds an exceptional application for what would otherwise be considered garbage.
Although this prototype was designed as part of a graduation requirement, the group of seniors is hopeful that their design is able to grow into something bigger than just a class project. 
The group calculated that if mass produced, the cost of the barrel filtration mechanism could be reduced from $200 to just $40. The seniors are hopeful that they can find a company willing to mass produce their filtration system, allowing their design to reach thousands of impoverished people in developing countries. “If someone wants to manufacture our system and get it down to that $40, none of us would be upset,” said Anna Mirabella, another one of the seniors on the project, in a University press release. “It would be awesome to have had a small part of something big.”

New material turns water to steam without boiling
Researchers have created an extremely black material that can turn water to steam without boiling. The material, a deep black color that reflects little visible light, is made up of “nanopores,” gold nanoparticles affixed to a scaffold pocked with tiny channels. On April 8, the researchers reported in Science Advances that the material is 99 percent efficient at absorbing light in the visible spectrum and parts of the infrared spectrum.
The material floats on the surface of water due to its high porosity, allowing it to naturally soak up sunlight. The electrons on the surface of a gold nanoparticle in the nanopore are excited when hit with a certain wavelength of light, and they oscillate back and forth. These oscillations, known as plasmons, create localized heating, which vaporizes the water nearby.

Fresh fruit intake reduces risk of adult heart attacks
According to new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, people who eat fresh fruit daily are at a lower risk of heart attack and stroke than people who do not. 
Researchers from the University of Oxford and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences conducted a survey of half a million adults in urban and rural areas of China who had no prior cardiovascular diseases or anti-hypertensive treatments.
The researchers monitored fruit intake (mainly apples or oranges) and health for seven years. The study found that fruit intake was strongly associated with other factors, such as education, lower blood glucose, lower blood pressure, and not smoking. The study also found that fruit intake alone was associated with about one-third less cardiovascular mortality in both men and women from different areas of China.

Curiosity shown to be masochistic biological drive
New research published in Psychological Science shows that people will choose potentially painful outcomes with no obvious benefits just to satisfy their curiosity. 
“Just as curiosity drove Pandora to open the box despite being warned of its pernicious contents, curiosity can lure humans  — like you and me — to seek information with predictably ominous consequences,” said study author Bowen Ruan of the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Researchers designed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that people are willing to resolve uncertainty even if it brings them pain. In one study, 54 college students were given various types of pens that deliver electric shocks when clicked. Participants who were unsure of whether the pen would give an electric shock were more likely to click the pen to find out than participants who knew prior.

Record-setting supermassive black hole discovered
The discovery of a near-record supermassive black hole in a local galaxy has prompted researchers to think that supermassive black holes may be more common than originally thought, according to University of California, Berkeley astronomers. 
The supermassive black hole is around the size of 17 billion suns, and located in a galaxy known as NCG 1600. Images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that the center of NGC 1600 is unusually faint, indicating a lack of stars close to the black hole, meaning that the galaxy is, therefore, massive. The researchers reported the discovery of the black hole, located about 200 million light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Eridanus, in the April 6 issue of the journal Nature.

Chinese farmers help bees, hand-pollinate flowers
As a result of the worldwide decline in bee population, farm workers in Hanyuan county, in China’s Sichuan province, are pollinating flowers by hand.  The county, known as the “world’s pear capital,” has seen drastic reduction in fruit crop as a result of pesticides reducing bee populations.
Farm workers transfer pollen from male to female flowers to artificially fertilize them. Photographer Kevin Frayer captured images of the workers pollinating the plants, saying, “On the one hand it’s a story about the human toll on the environment, while on the other it shows our ability to be more efficient in spite of it all. It is entirely possible than in our lifetime this practice could become the norm all over the world.” Bees are crucial not only to our ecosystems, but also to a heavy majority of our produce.

SpaceX lands reusable rocket on ocean platform
After four failed attempts, SpaceX has successfully landed a reusable rocket on an ocean platform off the coast of Florida.
The rocket, called Falcon 9, was returning to Earth after delivering an inflatable habitat built by Nevada company Bigelow Aerospace that will attach to the International Space Station for a two-year test. After the cargo was delivered, the main-stage booster of the rocket separated and landed on a floating platform called a drone ship.
“The rocket landed instead of putting a hole in the ship — or tipping over — so we’re really excited about that,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk told reporters in Florida. This is the first cargo run NASA has made with SpaceX since their rocket exploded after launch in June 2015.

Last week, Pugwash joined forces with the Humanist League for a joint discussion about the differences between the real and virtual worlds. 
It’s possible for people to spend the majority of their time in a virtual world making friends, achieving goals, and building a life, all in a video game or some other form of alternate reality. Are these actions somehow lesser when compared to their real-world counterparts? Is there a danger involved with the virtual world?
One of the very first points made was to change the wording of the subject matter. By calling our physical world the “real” world, and the online or technology-driven world “virtual,” the language itself was already putting the physical world above the virtual one. 
Instead of using real and virtual to refer to the distinction, it was proposed that we should refer to them as meat-space and cyber-space, so as to put them on a more linguistically even level. This proposal was enthusiastically agreed upon by all present.
Along with changing the terminology, many argued that the line between the cyber-wold and the meat-world isn’t a clear one. It’s not a distinct binary when you can be sitting in class, listening to a professor lecture, and then glance down and be communicating with someone across the hall or across the world. Even using e-mail to talk to people blurs the line between the cyber- and meat-worlds. This is only one reason to prefer the meat-world to the cyber-world. 
Without devaluing the experiences in the cyber-world, they are still based in the meat-world and rely on the meat-world, whether through electricity and server-space or because as humans we need to take care of our physical bodies.
Despite relying on the meat-world, the cyber-world can still offer meaningful experiences. It can also offer completely pointless experiences, just like the meat-world. Playing Flappy Bird and playing Portal offer different levels of experience in the cyber-world, just like fast food and a nice restaurant do in the meat-world. Social interaction is an area over which the meat-world has the upper hand. 
Humans communicate through so much more than just words, and losing out on body language, tone, and other meat-world features make cyber-world interactions somewhat lacking. A counterpoint is that cyber-world interactions could become equal, with advances in technology. 
From letters to phone calls to Skyping, and next to virtual reality, technology is making the cyber-world more  and more immersive. A concern with cyber-world interactions is their possibility for anonymity. Without the social cues and accountability that come in the meat-world, does the cyber-world encourage productive debate? 
On one hand, anonymous online communities have allowed for marginalized groups to come together and share in interests that might be looked down upon in society at large, which could be beneficial. On the other, losing out on social mores and reverting to rudeness is a serious concern. 
An interesting point was made that humans have been using various cyber-worlds for millennia, counting books, plays, art, and even further back to oral tradition and religions or mythologies. Escapism is an essential part of being human, biologically built into the human experience as dreams. Whether escaping into a book or a video game, it’s the same root concept. 
The only problem comes when it becomes difficult for the escapee to tell the difference between the cyber-world and the meat-world. One example was of someone who drove into pedestrians, thinking they were still playing Grand Theft Auto. Problems arise when people can’t tell the difference between fact and fiction, and live in their own reality unshared by the rest of society. 
Perhaps if everyone were able to transition into a cyber-world and leave the meat-world behind for good, then it would be acceptable, as there would still be a shared reality within the cyber-world, and no transition problems moving from one to the other. 
However, this brings up pragmatic issues that occur even in less-extreme scenarios. With two split worlds, meat and cyber, a question of access arises. Like most technology, the rich are able to use the cyber-world more than the poor, and as we come to rely on the cyber-world for more and more, this disparity would become more apparent. 
While having inequality is not a new thing, moving our lives into the cyber-world could exacerbate the problem. Even if all currently foreseeable problems could be solved, humanity has a way of jumping in first and asking questions later. 
For example, while we’re not particularly well-suited to drive two-ton killing machines at 60 mph, but we managed to make do, especially with seatbelts and other later additions. 
Entering into cyber-world might be the same way — while it might be bumpy, eventually we can use it to our advantage.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week's discussion on cyber-space.

There are many ways by which people have claimed to expand their consciousness: meditation, yoga, sensory deprivation, even psychedelic drugs. But none may be more ancient, polarizing, or gruesome than trepanation.
Trepanation is the process of boring a hole into the skull, just deeply enough to expose the brain’s outermost meningeal layer, the dura mater. Over a short period of time, the skin will reform over the puncture site, but the hole in the skull will remain. From time immemorial, ancient cultures’ medics would drill holes into their patients’ skulls to cure aberrant behaviors or mental illnesses. This procedure was thought to allow evil spirits to escape the affected individual.
Trepanned skulls have been unearthed across the globe, and perhaps the earliest dates back to the 5th Millennium, B.C., according to the National Museum of History of Azerbaijan. However ancient this procedure, it is not relegated to the annals of history. Trepanation is still practiced in the modern age in many ways. Some still view it as a religious ritual. Others, as a gateway to transcendence. 
Medical professionals in the present-day, however, use a milder, temporary form of the procedure called a craniotomy, for a myriad of reasons. Craniotomies can be used to examine, diagnose, and treat certain diseases like brain tumors, to remove excess blood in the skull, or to drain pus-filled abscesses, for example. The difference between a craniotomy and a trepanation procedure is that in a craniotomy, the piece of removed skull is set back in place; in trepanation, the hole remains unfilled, covered by regrown skin.
While craniotomy has superseded full-on trepanation within the legitimate medical community, there are still niche groups who practice trepanation and advocate for its induction into conventional medicine. Individuals such as Amanda Feilding, the director of the Beckley Foundation and a self-trepanned individual, have advocated for the procedure as a treatment for “chronic headaches, epilepsy, and migraines,” as quoted in an interview with Vice. 
There also exist organizations like the International Trepanation Advocacy Group (ITAG), who continue to push for destigmatization and acceptance of the procedure.
Beyond the medical community, trepanation saw an interesting surge in the 1960-70s among those who were interested in consciousness and psychedelic drugs. During this time period, several individuals involved in 60-70s drug cultures involving LSD and other psychedelics trepanned themselves.
Feilding is one such individual, as is Joe Mellen, who describes his experiences with auto-trepanation in his book Bore Hole. Many of these individuals were intrigued by the idea of expanding their minds and augmenting their consciousnesses, and according to both accounts, there may possibly be some merit to the assertion that trepanation could have some physiological or psychological benefits. 
In an interview with Vice, Feilding spoke of a trepanned friend, “I noticed a definite change in him … a mellowing, a lessening of the neurotic behavior that we all have.” She maintains that another of her friends “had chronic headaches that caused him to lose a day or two a week, but he hasn’t had those headaches in the last 30 years [since he was trepanned].” 
Feilding describes her own post-trepanation experience as “a feeling of rising, slowly and gently, to levels that felt good.” Mellen, in an interview with Vice, described his experience as “a lightness, like a weight had been lifted off [him].”
My main research question was to figure out whether or not there are any psychological or physiological explanations for these potential effects — whether pressure in the brain can actually inhibit the flow of blood or cerebrospinal fluid, thus negatively impact the brain’s performance. 
In order to do so, I examined the role of blood and cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, as well as research which provides correlations to changing circulation of both. Findings by professor Yuri Moskalenko, head of the St. Petersburg Comparative Physiology of Circulation Laboratory, might be able to finally speak to the potential medical benefits of trepanation.
An article published on the Beckley Foundation’s website says that “the brain’s productivity depends on essentially three factors: blood flow, mobility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF … ), and the flexibility of the skull.” 
Blood brings glucose and oxygen to the brain, among other things; these two metabolites allow the brain to function and survive. Cerebrospinal fluid provides cushioning to the brain and provides some basic immunological functions, such as waste removal.
Moskalenko’s technique allows researchers to track changes in these three parameters simultaneously, and his research posits that if the skull’s flexibility is diminished, cerebrospinal fluid mobility is decreased, and the brain’s functionality is decreased as a result. 
In order to back up these findings, he has also “shown that senile dementia and other age-related mental disorders of a vascular nature are more closely linked to a drop in CSF mobility than a decrease of blood flow,” which corroborates the idea that CSF mobility is a factor in mental acuity. 
Moskalenko’s research is one of the only studies which has focused on factors and conclusions related specifically to trepanation; Moskalenko focused on those who have had a craniotomy rather than a full-on trepanation. Using his measurement techniques, Moskalenko determined that trepanation caused the pulse stroke volume of the skull, or the amount of blood entering the skull after every heartbeat, to increase 8–10 percent on average. 
This increase means that more oxygen and more metabolites enter the brain, functionally increasing the brain’s processing power. While an increase in brain blood flow might seem frightening to some, Moskalenko’s research assures us that this increase is within the safe range of cerebral circulation. 
It appears as if pressure reductions in the brain (as a result of a more flexible skull) may result in some actual physiological effects.
Trepanation has a rather gruesome history, and perhaps an equally bright future. It does enter some dangerous territory, however, as a medical procedure performed solely for the purpose of human augmentation. In professional sports, steroid usage is often regarded with an “everyone’s doing it” mentality. In academics, Adderall has a reputation for being misused among hardcore students. 
Medication or operation just for the sake of “being better,” and not as a specific treatment, gets into some shady territory. When you start augmenting humanity with medicine, you’re effectively “treating” the default human condition. 
And once we start viewing natural human features as something that need to be remedied, we start voyaging into some very dangerous ethical territory with no clean-cut resolution.

“Am I a slave to my deadlines,” and “what does it mean to be alive” might rank rather high in one’s list of existential crises. 
After a sleepless night of homeworking and battling the raging desire to sleep, or to do anything other than that sadistically long problem set, one might ask herself “Do I control my own life?” 
These questions are not relegated only to sleep-deprived college students’ early morning musings; they’ve been at the center of many intellectual debates over the past 600 years. A generation’s opinions about these questions are representative of their beliefs about the past and their expectations from the future. 
This timeless fascination with the question of what it means to be living has been explored most recently be Jessica Riskin, a history professor at Stanford University. In her latest book, The Restless Clock, she moves past the previous theologically and philosophically grounded discussions and looks at these questions of autonomy through the lens of a historian. 
Riskin’s work explores the definition of an “automaton,” or a human-like machine, as well as several theories surrounding the mechanism of life.  The idea of mechanically creating another “human” is an intriguing one. This idea was first explored within a theological context. In the 15th century, automatons were often used to depict biblical scenes and dazzle the audience with the power of life-like presentations, convince them of the terror of devils, the holiness of angels and the “reality” of the Nativity scene. 
Churches would often use mechanically operated (usually using pulleys) devils, angels, saints and other figures from the bible. These automatons would be used to put up a show that was intended to inspire fear and reverence into the audience. Soon enough, the public discovered that these contraptions were the work of man and not of the Divine Providence. 
This led to the public trying to ascribe greater power over mankind’s actions to God as opposed to God that simply reacted to mankind’s actions. 
This reimagined God — unlike the medieval God — had a monopoly over fate and like a clockmaker governed the workings of his clockwork world. This idea of having no agency (no control over your actions) became popular and still is. As the Age of Reason set in, and the Church’s authority came to be questioned by scientific minds like those of Galileo, Descartes, Mersenne, the idea of having no agency developed a different reasoning. 
Descartes ascribed the products of engineering such as bellows, hydraulic systems, irrigation systems and furnaces to biological systems. 
Furthermore, he argued that such systems were driven by external stimuli, essentially saying that we are completely governed by our environments (including expression of complex emotions like humility, liberality, veneration etc.) This Cartesian philosophy used the analogy of hydraulic systems, containing the vital fluid – “animal spirit” to “drive” humans.  
This fluid would behave like all other fluids – it would pursue equilibrium, climb siphons, flow i.e., “have a purpose” (fluids are always flowing to somewhere). Fondly “rationalizing” life and agency (or lack thereof), Descartes in Riskin’s opinion sought to eliminate philosophy and theology from that was “obviously scientific”. 
No doubt, this brought about an epistemological revolution (the way people think about how they think) imbibed with the belief that “Machinery means Intelligibility” — the association of hard data and empirical reasoning with intellect.  Unsurprisingly, Descartes was also the first to explicitly express a “subjective sense of selfhood” in his opinions by acknowledging that his thoughts made him who he was. In response to this argument, Leibniz introduced the idea of a “living force”. 
He differentiated it from the Newtonian concept of force by saying that motion wasn’t a real thing, it was the effect of an interaction between objects. 
This force was “real”, an inherent property that belonged to the body itself. Both of these theories however, are incomplete. The “force” or “animal spirit” we’re unaccounted for and do hint at the involvement of either human will or divine intervention. 
Pointing out these flaws. In 1856 Henry Huxley observed that despite it being common knowledge that water was formed out of the chemical combination of hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio, we don’t understand “why” water has the properties it does. 
Yet, we don’t assume that there exists something called “aquosity” that takes possession of it. 
Then, what differentiates protoplasm that forms the interior of living cells? One can see that the answer to this question changes with time, and often demarcates significant changes in ideology over time. 
While the above mentioned are only a few of the conversations that occur in the book, one must understand that as we as humans evolve, along with our ideas, and our technology, this question will get harder to answer simply because of the blurring boundaries between the “living” and “non-living”.
Thus, by putting forth these questions in the words of past intellectuals, Riskin engages the reader in evaluating these existential questions with respect to big-picture “processes” like evolution, artificial intelligence and epistemology.

This past month in an early release to Nature, the lab of Dr. Ali Güler at University of Virginia demonstrated the ability to remotely control the activity of specific neural circuits using magnetic fields at a distance. 
This discovery is the newest in a line of method research in the field of neuroscience that is rapidly approaching the concept of being able to specifically target certain cells and generate a specific behavioral or phenomenological experience; one might say “mind control.” 
At first, the idea of scientists being able to control someone else’s behavior rapidly and non-invasively may seem terrifying, this new method is not that much more dystopian than the myriad of modern methods of neural mind control to which we have access today.
Let’s first take a few steps back. Only a little more than 10 years ago, the best methods available were electrical patch clamp stimulation and psychopharmacology. Electrical patch clamp stimulation targeted a specific area of the brain, but was not specified to a specific type of neuron; this means that researchers were unable to stimulate at a fine resolution. Psychopharmacological methods were able to target a specific system of neurons that all expressed the same receptors, but was not specified to an exact region of the brain. These were the methods that have been used in neuroscience for most of the 20th century and while many researchers were able to make significant advances using them, these limitations still posed significant issues. 
These are the methods that have been used both in research and clinically for much of neuroscience’s history. We have a slew of medications that are designed to interact with individual receptors in the brain, but these can have drastic side effects due to their lack of location specificity. According to Carnegie Mellon Assistant Teaching Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences,  Daniel J. Brasier, “the manipulations we’re talking about now [magnetogenetics] are less scary because they are only going to affect very particular targeted area of the brain; for example, antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia block dopamine. In separate parts of the brain, dopamine is necessary for movement; people can take anti-psychotic drugs and develop Parkinson-like symptoms.”  
In order to address these problems of specificity in location and cell type, scientists turned to genetic modifications to provide the necessary targeting abilities. Researchers introduce a viral vector that interacts with a specific neuron type and induces the production of a Channelrhodopsin protein. This protein, when stimulated by light, causes an influx of positively charged ions, paralleling the functioning of indigenous receptors when activating the cell. Through this method, fiber optic cables can be implanted in the target regions of the brain being studied and then this specific subset of cells can be activated by turning on the light. 
By this technique scientists are able to uncover what effect on behavior or “thought” the activation of this specific set of cells have in this specific region of the brain. However this method, too, has some shortcomings. First is the invasiveness of the procedure required to implant the fiber optic cable in the brain which has the potential for damaging other brain structures and resulting in infection. 
Second is the time delay in activating the targeted cells; using optogenetic techniques these cells can take between 20 seconds and a minute to be activated. Brasier describes that while still an improvement over pharmacological methods, this delay poses problems for researching the activity of neural networks in the brain since much of the functioning of the network is determined by how different cells interact over a course of time rather than just by their location. Two cells might both be activated, but without precise data regarding time it is difficult to determine which cell is activating the other and how the circuit mediates the observed behavior. 
The new magnetogenetic techniques pioneered by the lab of Dr. Ali Güler present a solution to these previous problems. The Magneto protein does not require any invasive surgery to be able to be activated and are able to work on the scale of a second or less, much closer to the activation capabilities of neurons themselves. 
Brasier asserts that “By looking at precise temporal patterns and controlling neurons in [said patterns], we can understand how the timing, relative timing of activity in a couple of sub populations in neurons affects behavior, or memory, or perception, and so we can not only say ... inhibitory inter-neurons that express this gene, what do they do for behavior when I turn them all off/on’ now I can say what happens when I turn them off for one second, off for two seconds—introduce a pattern of activity ... get at how the timing of activity relates to behaviors and perceptions and so on.” 
This means that we have an increased ability to test specific patterns more similar to neurons’ natural firing rates. In Brasier’s words: “[We are] getting much closer to the time scales that neurons actually communicate with each other; this allows the ability to have more precise control over the pattern of activity. Rather than blasting the neurons high or turning them all the way off, you can have a finer control over the finer temporal patterns these neurons are having.”
Electrical stimulation gave researchers specificity in location; pharmacological methods gave researchers specificity in cell type; optogenetic techniques blended these together for greater control; and now magentogenetics is giving scientists the ability to control all of these other factors as well as controlling the specific timing of these events. 
So what do these techniques mean for our understanding of the brain or our reality? Will we soon be controlled by our magnet wielding overlords? 
When asked if these if sensationalized fears that this might be the grounds for “mind-control,” Brasier responded, “Yeah, I think that would be possible in principle. Even now you could find a spot where you could implant things and make my arm twitch, and, for a couple hundred dollars, you can get a little kit where you can do a little surgery on a roach, and you can have a radio controlled roach,” Brasier said. 
“Even more complicated things people have done to influence mouse behavior. In some ways, [humans are] even easier to control than mice because our brains are bigger, and the targets are bigger. Technically, I think it’s quite possible to at least control movement; we understand a fair amount about the area of the brain that move the arms around, move the legs around and so on, and also on the areas that first receive sound and visual perceptions.” 
We don’t have as good a map as of yet about what comes between sensation and perception; it may be possible in the next few decades to be able to alter somebody’s, give somebody a very particular perception; there’s one paper that was published three years ago, where they found a way to [alter perception] with optogenetics. 
They called it implanting a memory; they activated in a mouse the neurons which were previously active in a red room, and then give the mouse an electric shock; the mouse behaved as they were shocked in the red room; and so we can maybe put in false memories, manipulate people’s memories, and so  that’s something that is very scary to think about in a lot of ways.” 
“Even the experiment used to pioneer the Magneto protein provided grounds for this impressive and intimidating control over perception and thought.”
Brasier comments that “They turn on the brain’s reward center when the animal is in a green room, animals develop a strong preference to going into the green room. Already with the very first report about this protein, they’re already essentially doing a thought-implantation-like-thing where they’re impacting the way an animal feels about a specific area.” 
However, within the context of previous methods before magnetogenetics, this power does not seem at all that surprising. Psychopharmacological methods have been modulating and altering perception from even before we understood the methods. Examples range from prescription anti-psychotics to your morning coffee. These all alter in different ways how we experience our reality by introducing an outside factor and inducing a change at the neural level. 
Optogenetics and magenetogenetics now serve as an evolution in the precision and accuracy of these methods so that potentially these desired effects are achieved without any of the side effects that come along with the extremely complicated system that is the mammalian brain. 
The dopamine system in one part of the brain helps to regulate muscle movement and in another regulates the reward and attention systems of the brain. 
A malfunction in the first yields Parkinson’s Disease and in the latter yields Schizophrenia. Many of the psychopharmacological methods for treating these diseases yield side effects by activating or deactivating the other system. 
Electrical implants have been devised for Parkinson’s patients to activate these specific cells in this specific area, but that method requires an invasive surgery that opens up the patient to all sorts of complications and potential damage. 
Magnetogenetics seems to afford an opportunity to negate most, if not all, of these potential side-effects by being able to specifically target a distinct sub-population of neurons in a specific region of the brain without the need for invasive surgery. 
This opens up not only a larger realm of study with human subjects, it also may allow for more rigorous applications in other realms. 
Perhaps magnetogenetics may have implications for future treatments to deep-brain disorders. As we become increasingly able to determine the functions of circuits, we may be getting increasingly close to being able to control them.
While this discovery may be leading us down the path of “mind-control,” it is a path we began with the very inception of the field of neuroscience and this discovery is merely providing enhanced precision and safety to the methods of “mind-control” that are currently and readily being used by researchers and physicians.

It’s Sunday night, and you haven’t seen a movie anywhere except on the confines of your too-bright laptop screen. Your hand reaches for your phone, desperate to find a nice theater where you can put your feet up and relish in the glory of the big screen, but alas, it’s cold outside, and you’re not about to wait for a bus or take an Uber to South Side or the Waterfront. Well, there’s always Manor on Murray, folks. It’s got student friendly prices, and if you go late enough, crowd sizes on the lower end of the spectrum. It’s truly a unique experience having a theatre almost all to yourself — you can laugh as loud as you want and put your feet up. You can also eat as much as you want, which for me tends to be a problem, for movies distract the part of my brain that tells me that I’ve eaten four buckets of popcorn and probably should hold off on that next one. Because of this, I strive to eat a good meal before I catch a movie, so the munchies take a backseat to the actual movie experience.
Manor is in a local hotspot for restaurants, including a handful of ones that I’ve reviewed this semester. There’s Thai food, Chinese food, Italian food, you name it, and just across the street is a local favorite: Murray Avenue Grill. It echoes the spirit of South Craig’s own Union Grill, but with a sort of small town homeliness that warms up the place.
Every time I eat here, the waiters seem to be well acquainted with a majority of the customers present, and are always incredibly friendly. What’s best? They know the menu inside out, and have yet to let me down with their recommendations. 
Favorites:
“Famous” Salmon Burger: This burger is an actual godsend. The patty melts in your mouth and is richly seasoned just enough to allow the fish to remain the hero of the plate. The warmth of the patty is cooled down with a roasted red pepper mayo. While the mayo sounds a little odd, its flavors compliment the salmon’s incredibly well. The red pepper gives an extra edge of body and bite to the mayo, and tastes best when spread over the patty as opposed to as a mere dip for the sides that come with the burger.
Onion Rings:
The onion rings at this place are huge and fried to perfection. The onion itself is thick enough to hold when you bite into the ring, but also soft and light once it hits your tongue. 
Dessert:
Murray Ave has a wonderful spread of desserts, including the famous Prantl’s Burnt Almond Torte. I did have the pleasure of trying a dessert, which I believe was a chocolate cobbler of some sort, that surpassed my expectations by a long shot. The dessert arrived in a large glass goblet, like the one’s you see giant ice cream sundaes served in in movies. It had a thick layer of a chocolate cake of some sort and glorious vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate sauce slopped on top. At first glance, it looks like an over-glorified chocolate sundae, but the flavor is something else. I guess the best way to describe it would be a solidified, gooey hot chocolate with ice cream. It’s warm, it’s familiar, but it’s new at the same time.
“But Apeksha, do they have tea?”
Of course they do, it’s your pretty standard run of the mill tea-bag selection. I think the lemon tea washes down the salmon really well, and the green tea is always great. Everyone should try tea with their dinner at some point or another.
Cha-ching:
This place takes cards and cash and is happy to split the check on request. The prices aren’t too outrageous considering the sheer size of the portions, you’ll get your money’s worth and have nice a full belly by the end of the meal.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores, lend me your ears:
There’s a pretty solid variety, I would say, of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. They do have an excellent black bean patty burger option for vegetarians that is in a class of its own. You can also craft your burger by asking for specific toppings, or you can order any of the pre-designed gourmet options they have to offer.
Are we there yet?: 
Right across the street from manor, on Murray Ave. I’d take any of the 61’s from campus. If you’re going to Uber or walk, head on over to: 1720 Murray Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15217
Click, click:
The website’s got a menu, a photo gallery, contact information, and other pretty standard features. It’s got a nice black and red aesthetic and isn’t too hard to maneuver through. Check it out: [SLANT12]http://www.murrayavenuegrill.com/[SLANT12]
For those stay-at-home days:
There’s no delivery straight from the source, but you can always use Postmates. They do have takeout though, so you can ring in to place an order and pick it up after catching a movie. Here’s a number: 412.521.1272
21+:
Pretty much a full bar, which is open later than the kitchen. 
Ambiance:
As was mentioned, the warmth of the establishment is infectious and I’ve done everything from grabbing a quick bite to working on homework here and it’s always been an enjoyable experience. 
College student friendly?:
For sure. There’s very much an “everyone is welcome” sort of vibe that lingers around the restaurant.
Overall rating: 3 melons

The Big Short
Saturday, April 16
8 p.m.
Director: Adam McKay
Cast: Ryan Gosling (Jared Vennett), Rudy Eisenzopf (Lewis Ranieri), Christian Bale (Michael Burry)
Rotten Tomatoes: 88 percent
The Big Short tells the story of the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale. Picking up on the instability of the housing market, based on the high risk and low return subprime loans being given out, Burry devises an audacious scheme to profit from the impending collapse. Using Burry as a subject, The Big Short provides a deep look into the subprime mortgage crisis and the collapse of 2008. In the process, The Big Short does a spectacular job of informing the viewer about the dangerous economics that led to the crisis, while painting a dirty, if somewhat caricatured, picture of Wall Street greed.

As the end of the semester approaches (and no, I do not want to think about that), I get more and more attached to Madrid. The more I travel, the happier I am to come back to my “home base” in Spain’s capital. I come back to Madrid exhausted and happy to be back in “my” bed. As much fun as I’ve had in the U.K. or Hungary or Morocco, it feels good to be navigating a familiar metro system and to know which grocery stores have what I need. That’s what I’ve liked about living in new places this year — I get to know a city, not just visit it.
Since January of 2015, I’ve lived in a new place every five months; I’ve gotten pretty good at packing and unpacking. When I finished my sophomore spring, I was nervous and excited to start a series of new experiences; now it’s been a year since I finished my last semester in Pittsburgh. Over the summer, I lived with other interns in Virginia. Last fall, I took classes and worked as an intern in Washington, D.C. This semester, I feel lucky to be abroad in Madrid. My year away is teaching me new things about myself.
My concept of familiarity has changed with my time away. I refer to wherever I stay as my home — I instinctively say I’m “going home” after class or after I get groceries, whether in D.C., Madrid, or Pittsburgh. I like the feeling after I’ve learned how to use public transport or when I can give someone else directions instead of asking for them myself. As I’ve become a temporary citizen of several new cities this year, each has had its own lifestyle and its challenges.
The challenges seem more evident in Spain, although the language barrier is less daunting now than when I arrived. I’ve become less self-conscious of my Spanish speaking abilities. In order to function, I’ve had to coexist with certain insecurities; these include my American accent (not as bad as others I’ve heard, but still present), my ignorance of Spanish slang expressions, and my Midwestern habit of smiling at people on the street (which has a connotation beyond friendliness here).
I appreciate the lifestyle here in Madrid. I'm learning about the city from my classes, from funny stories that my host family tells, and from the times I explore on my own. I can walk around the city, go see friends, or take a nice nap — all are socially acceptable. It’s the most relaxed I’ve ever felt in college. In Pittsburgh, friends and school are intertwined. We all live and work and study in the same area, so the separation between school and life is practically nonexistent.
I’ve been thinking of Pittsburgh a lot lately. What does it mean to be part of a community when I’ve been away for so long? I still identify as a Carnegie Mellon student. I consider campus to be one of my temporary homes.
I felt shaken when I learned of the two suicides on campus. Not being in Pittsburgh, I saw the official email without opening it right away. Then I started seeing posts on Facebook, and I began piecing together what had happened. I was heartbroken for my community. I reached out to friends, but I didn’t have much to say; I told them that my heart was hurting, that I couldn’t imagine being on campus — that I was thinking of them. (All true, but also hollow-sounding.) For the first time this semester, I wished I had another Carnegie Mellon student with me in Madrid.
It's hard to determine whether my perspective has changed this year. I suspect that it has, but I don't see evidence of it. I suspect it won't until I'm on the other side, back in familiar territory. For now, though, I don't want to think ahead to re-acclimation. I want to do everything I can while I'm still in Spain.

Every so often, we wake from the tedious repetition of our lives and, for whatever reason, remember that we are at a cutting edge, world class institution. Every once in awhile, we become conscious of how proud we are to be Carnegie Mellon students. Well, I definitely had one such moment Saturday night at the School of Music’s production of La Calisto, an opera in two acts written by the Venetian composer Francesco Cavalli.
The problem with opera, Baroque opera in particular, for modern audiences, is how dated both the content and the style normally tends to be. How are we supposed to relate to a piece of music premiered in 1651? How are we supposed to be invested in the characters and enthralled by the plot, with the centuries of progress, war, and political and social upheaval that separate them from us? This is the challenge that all modern opera directors face: how to make us care.
With a cursory reading of the synopsis, we would find it hard to imagine that La Calisto was any different from the hundreds of other 17th century operas based on mythological characters. We have the same lusting gods, bashful nymphs, and vengeful goddesses. However, from the minute I entered the theater, I saw that this was not like all those other shows!
Entering the Alumni Concert Hall in the College of Fine Arts, my eyes fell on the giant scaffold that was to serve as a set. One of the biggest problems, I have found, with modern opera productions, is where they decide to set the action. Doing faithful period productions has almost completely gone out of fashion. Rather, directors are trying to transfer the familiar action of classic operas to new situations, and in the process, make us see them in a new light. This sounds fine, until you start having productions where the new setting makes absolutely no sense. To avoid this trap, La Calisto completely avoids the problem, by not making any overt references to locations or to time periods. The entire action of the opera occurs on a construction scaffold, with different parts of the scaffold being fluidly assigned to different “settings.” The costumes of the characters range from the traditional Roman robes of the nymph Calisto, to the tank top and cargo shorts of Mercurio, Jove’s servant, to the ripped tights, leather trenchcoat and painfully high stillettos of Juno. This lack of an explicit setting or time period helped the action of the opera to transcend geo-temporal boundaries in a way that really drove home the universality of its main theme: sex.
The opera opens with Destiny asking Nature and Eternity to immortalize the nymph Calisto in the heavens through a constellation. This segues into the story of Calisto, a devotee of Diana, goddess of chastity, who, through no doing of her own, catches the fancy of Jove, the king of the Gods. Even though she spurns his advances, he refuses to take the hint, resorting, with the help of his servant Mercurio, to trickery. Jove takes on the appearance of Diana and, in this new form, commands the love of Calisto. Meanwhile, Diana is in the middle of her own little love affair with a shepherd named Endimione, causing the wrath of the minor deity Pan who lusts for her. Pan’s henchman Satirino, a lascivious half goat half man, tries seducing Linfea, another one of Diana’s devotees, who in turn obstructs Endimione’s advances. This web of sexual energy woven on stage turns into barbed thicket with the entrance of a wrathful Juno with her whip bearing furies. Determined to punish her husband’s lover, she turns Calisto into a bear. However all is resolved when Jove decides to elevate Calisto to the heavens and immortalize her in the form of the constellation Ursa Major.
As you can see, this wild romp through the sexual underbelly of mythology can satisfy the appetite of today's audiences almost as well as it could back in the mid 17th century. In particular, the seduction of Calisto by Diana (actually Jove in disguise) was quite daring for its time, considering lesbians weren’t really accepted back then. On top of all of this, we also have the angelic early Baroque music of Cavalli, with its seamless transitions from the declamatory recitatives and the virtuosic arias. The singing was divine with the hardest runs executed almost effortlessly! The most memorable aspect however, was the acting. Whether it was the banter between Jove and Mercury, the wily cunning of Satirino, Endimione’s soulful laments or Juno’s peacock chatting with the orchestra, the opera was filled with tiny moments showing us that these weren’t cold mummies, dug up from the dusty tomb of a long forgotten score. Rather, these were living, breathing characters, whose every note was a manifestation of a deeper psychological phenomenon. The entire time I was sitting in the audience, I couldn’t help but be amazed at the intelligence, talent, and dedication that must have gone into the production. In particular, I had to constantly remind myself that the gods and goddesses, nymphs and furies on stage, they were also students. They also attended classes, took tests, went to parties, and complained about campus food. They reminded me how amazing Carnegie Mellon really is.

On Wednesday March 6, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held a campaign rally in Skibo Gymnasium. The space was filled to full capacity, holding over 1,500 people in the gym with many others left outside in a line stretching well around the block. Clinton addressed the large crowd that was stuck outside before giving her speech. Meanwhile, inside Skibo, a selection of songs, including Kelly Clarkson’s “I’m a Survivor,” played in the background for the waiting crowd.
The event started with Julia Eddy, Chair of the Carnegie Mellon Graduate Senate. Eddy spoke about Carnegie Mellon’s potential for excellence, which she highlighted by asking students to help find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease by 2025. She additionally spoke about the success of the democratic process based on the turnout of so many students at the rally.
There were several other highlights from Carnegie Mellon students, including performances by senior drama major Avery Smith who sang the national anthem and the a cappella group Soundbytes which performed two pieces. Two campaign organizers, a second generation immigrant and a woman, made brief comments about their support for Clinton before Clinton herself took the stage.
Cheers of “I’m with her!” filled the gymnasium as Clinton made her way to the stage with the mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto. Peduto gave several remarks praising Clinton, saying that “others talk of building walls, but Pittsburgh is a city of bridges.” He stated that many progressive mayors like him around the country are endorsing Clinton as a unifying candidate to create an “America for all.”
Clinton began her speech by talking about Pittsburgh as a “great American city,” praising its ability to adapt into the future, and stating that one can have “resilience if you are resourceful.” She also subtly criticized Republican front-runner Donald Trump saying that “diversity is an asset” and, referring to his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border, stated that she wants to “knock down every barrier preventing [all American citizens] from achieving their God-given potential.”
She organized a large portion of her speech around three tests a president should be ready to face, tests that she claimed prove her to be a progressive who has and will continue to make progress. These tests were “Who have you helped?”, “Have you kept us safe?”, and “Can you unify us?”
For her first test, she discussed her plans to help the working class, including creating a national infrastructure bank to fix our infrastructure. Additionally, she called for $10 billion to invest in research for new technologies to begin exporting from the United States. She took the opportunity to share how the Carnegie Mellon Robotics team is a leading example of how America can bring its manufacturing industry into the new century.
Clinton went on to discuss her plans to combat climate change, such as bringing half a billion more solar panels into the United States by 2020, and by overseeing a North American climate agreement. “I actually listen to the scientists,” she said, adding that Carnegie Mellon could help teach Republican climate change deniers. Discussing her experience as a fighter for climate agreements in the past, she relayed an anecdote about her and President Obama’s mission to “stalk the Chinese and the Indians” at the 2009 Climate Conference in Copenhagen. According to Clinton, she and Obama successfully snuck past bodyguards and joined the “secret” meeting of the Chinese and Indian officials who had been avoiding them. Clinton also hailed the results of the most recent Paris Climate Conference in 2015. Although some have criticized the conference as not taking enough action, Clinton said “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Clinton then spoke about her economic platform, proclaiming her support for a livable minimum wage, equal pay for women, and small businesses of the type that often begin at Carnegie Mellon. “The economy does better with a Democrat in office,” she said, calling back to the federal government’s balanced budget and surplus under her husband Bill Clinton’s presidency as well as President Obama’s accomplishments while in office. “[Obama] doesn’t get the credit he deserves,” she said, to widespread applause, while Republicans continue “peddling the same economic snake oil.”
Although Clinton did not specify her position on how much the minimum wage should be raised, The Tartan asked Mayor Bill Peduto after the rally to address the possibility of a higher minimum wage in Pittsburgh and nationwide. According to Peduto, Pittsburgh is “on the path” to phasing in a $15 minimum wage over several years until 2019, with UPMC recently joining a two-year discussion. He has focused his efforts to raise the minimum wage on the local middle class and service workers. “Pittsburgh built the middle class,” said Peduto, and the city can “look at the same model again” as “part of a new economy.” Peduto expressed his support for a national minimum wage of $15 if it can be comfortably phased in over several years.
Clinton pledged to fight against the privatization of social security, to fix the Veteran’s Administration, and expand the Affordable Care Act. She also said she would “end Citizens United” and its attempt to make “more money equal more speech” in the federal government.
She promised to work toward universal pre-kindergarten and debt-free college education through refinancing and complete debt forgiveness after 20 years. We must “end the government making money off lending money,” she said.
She asserted her commitment to the pro-choice movement, marriage equality, equal voting rights, “common sense” gun regulations, and immigration reform with a “path to citizenship.”
To answer her second qualification of security, she called on her experience as Secretary of State. Clinton said that as president she would ensure that national security was “not an afterthought.” She mentioned her role in the military operation that killed terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden, as well as her successful nuclear arms negotiations with Russia that lessened the “biggest immediate threat” to national security.
Clinton expressed her discontent with her Republican contenders, saying that she was running an “issue-oriented” rather than an “insult-oriented” campaign. 
With a Republican in the presidential office, she said, “we will not recognize our country.” Trump in particular she called “deeply disturbing” in his attempts to “incite prejudice and paranoia.”
Finally, she portrayed herself as a uniter of the party. She contrasted herself with obstructionist Republicans in the commitment she has demonstrated in her career to “go anywhere to meet common ground.” For her entire adult life, Clinton said, she has stayed “in the trenches” and has done the “boring but necessary kind of work.” Thanking the crowd once again and urging them to vote, Clinton exited the stage to the sound of “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten.
At a booth across the street from the rally, several supporters of fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders were less enthusiastic about Clinton. One young man said that there are “lots of people who are undecided” in the primary race, and they “don’t know they have a better option.” While attendees for the Clinton rally waited in line, the Sanders supporters campaigned for their own candidate and solicited volunteers for his campaign. They described their efforts as “really successful,” claiming that they answered people’s “legitimate concerns” about their candidate and that many attendees “turned to Bernie on the spot.”
Attendees of the rally called it “surreal” and “wonderful,” and described Clinton as a “down to earth” woman who has “made a real difference in people’s lives.” One college student said that it was his first rally and he was “happy to get in” for an event that “really did touch [him].”
The Pennsylvania primary is on April 26.

Carnegie Mellon has joined a new national research institute called the Advanced Functional Fabrics of America (AFFOA) that conducts research on new fibers, fabrics, and materials and integrates them into products ranging from active wear to protective armor. The institute aims to “accelerate widespread commercialization of highly functional fabrics,” as stated on AFFOA’s website. The $75 million national non-profit will serve as a resource for industry and government, connecting various companies with the expertise of academic researchers.
“Recent breakthroughs in fiber materials and manufacturing processes will soon allow us to design and produce fabrics that see, hear, sense, communicate, store and convert energy, regulate temperature, monitor health, and change color — the dawn of a ‘fabric revolution,’” AFFOA says on its website.
Currently, the AFFOA group includes 31 academic institutions, including Carnegie Mellon, Cornell University, The Ohio State University, the University of Michigan, and the University of California, Davis. 16 companies are named as industry partners, including Nike, Microsoft, Goodyear, The North Face, Bose, and Medtronic. In addition, 26 start-up incubators and venture capital groups have pledged support, including Angel Capital Associations, Westbury Partners, and North Bridge Venture Partners.
AFFOA has been formally recognized, as announced by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last week, as one of the White House’s National Networks for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) institutes. The NNMI is a $317 million public-private initiative aiming to boost the value of American-made products internationally through innovative research and development.
“The AFFOA initiative will provide unique opportunities for Carnegie Mellon to enable new materials, devices, systems, and applications. The integration of sensors and actuators in electronic textiles and smart fabrics can help widen the use of existing applications and open new applications in health, education, transportation, or Internet of things,” Diana Marculescu, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon, said in an interview with the University. Marculescu leads a group of faculty that develops electronic textiles with novel properties by embedding processing, sensing, and actuation.
Carnegie Mellon will be part of a research hub, led by Drexel University, that assembles partners in the mid-Atlantic region and links research institutions such as Penn State, Temple University, and the University of Delaware to manufacturing and investment partners such as DuPont, Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeast Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia Office of Manufacturing and Industry, and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development.
This research hub will lead investigations in modeling, designing, and predicting the utility of new fibers, yarns, and materials, and will apply those new materials to prototypes of functional fabrics for apparel, health care, transportation, consumer electronics, architecture, and the defense industry.
“I strongly believe that AFFOA offers an unparalleled opportunity for developing our workforce,” Marculescu said. “Indeed, new generations of scientists and engineers will be trained in integrating sensors, actuators, and photonics into wearable clothing fabrics. We are looking forward to being part of AFFOA and connecting with other academic and industrial members.”

This past weekend Carnegie Mellon hosted the fifth annual CMU Summit on US-China Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Since 2012 the Summit has“attracted over 3,000 participants and 100 industry leaders” to campus to discuss the latest advances and challenges for people working in technical fields. The Summit is a massive event that works to bring students and industry leaders from all across the U.S. and China together for a schedule packed with speeches, discussions, and networking events.
This year’s Summit was broken down into five major topics, each featuring a keynote speech in the morning followed by a panel discussion and question-and-answer session. The five pillars of the event were finance, high technology, energy and sustainability, innovation and entrepreneurship, and start-ups. Energy and sustainability, finance, and innovation and entrepreneurship are regular topics for the conference, having been discussed in previous years. Meanwhile, the focus on high technology, specifically the power of artificial intelligence (AI), and start-ups were new, reflecting new trends in the ever-changing field of technology.
The weekend was opened and closed by five distinguished keynote speakers. Carnegie Mellon professors Terrence J. Collins and Tuomas Sandholm joined entrepreneurs Feng Li, Ning Yang, and Bo Tao in shaping the discussions dozens of panelists and hundreds of attendees would have over the weekend.
The first topic, finance, sparked lively discussion about the future of financial technology, or “fintech.” Deregulation was the word of the hour, with panelists weighing in to a packed auditorium on how fintech can facilitate free global trade with minimal regulation. The question-and-answer session followed a similar theme. Panelists fielded questions about the effect of the 2008 Great Recession on the fintech industry and how future regulation might change the landscape. The panelists pointed out that fintech had grown ever more important since 2008 as traditional banks were restricted by regulations but new, technology – based enterprises remained relatively deregulated and free. Tone Vays, panelist and head of research at BraveNewCoin, said that recent threats to regulate the industry, particularly from presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, “may be the best thing that’s ever happened to the industry” because fintech is by nature impossible to regulate, and the more people try to accomplish this the clearer that will become to consumers. When asked to look into the future of fintech, panelist and Carnegie Mellon professor Timothy X. Brown summed it up best, saying the future will be a process of “evolution, not revolution.”
High technology was up next, with the program promising “insights on the cutting-edge issues in Artificial Intelligence.” The panel wrestled with the fundamental questions of the AI industry such as what AI is, what problems it should try to solve, and how it will change our lives. Some panelists advocated for AI that melds with the arts, envisioning technology that facilitates creation and eliminates mental drudgery so people have more time to spend on creativity and entertainment. Others saw AI technology in a more scientific context as a tool to personalize healthcare, remove inefficiencies, and produce and analyze theories the human mind cannot grasp.
The final panel on Saturday focused on energy and sustainability. This panel was the most technical, specific, and down to earth of the three, addressing the opportunities and challenges the industry faces from government policy, changes in prices of oil and natural gas, and consumer interests. One panelist summed up the mood of the discussion, saying, “we’re moving the needle, but not fast enough.” The governments in both the U.S. and particularly China are pushing for clean energy by providing incentives to the private sector to invest, but these steps are tempered by economic concerns. Consumers are beginning to invest in sustainable products, but many remain apathetic about the issue. Finally, technological developments like smart meters, meters that provide information on how much energy a particular household or area is using, have helped create an energy supply system more conducive to clean power, but there is still a lot more progress needed on issues like energy storage.
The Sunday panels provided platforms for industry leaders to discuss and give advise on how to navigate technological fields. The start-up panel brought entrepreneurs from a variety of start-ups together to give advice on getting ideas off the ground and turning a concept into a company. According to the program, the innovation and entrepreneurship panel is “dedicated to creating a platform for prestigious investors and entrepreneurs from both China and the U.S. to network, share experiences, and exchange ideas” and to “promote a bilateral dialogue and cooperation between the two countries.” This year the panel spotlighted the robotics industry.
The Summit also invited attendees to take an active role. There were networking sessions after every panel discussion, and the New Venture Competition asked teams of student entrepreneurs to create start-up solutions to real world problems. The competition was judged based on real world feasibility and likelihood of economic success and offered a $15,000 cash prize to the winning team.
The entire event offered invaluable opportunities to technology-focused students in terms of information, experience, and connections.

Carnegie Mellon team places second in 76th annual Putnam Math Competition
The 76th annual William Lowell Putnam Competition, a mathematics competition for undergraduate students, took place in December of last year. It was recently announced that the team from Carnegie Mellon University landed second place in this prestigious competition. This marks the fifth consecutive year that a team from Carnegie Mellon has landed among the top five teams in this competition, thus making Carnegie Mellon home to many of the nation’s best math experts.
The competition took place on Dec. 5, 2015, with 4,275 undergraduate students from 554 institutions in America and Canada participating in the event. Students utilized their creative thinking and concepts knowledge taught in college mathematical courses to solve 12 complex mathematical problems in the course of six hours.
Representing Carnegie Mellon University was senior science and humanities scholar Linus Hamilton, junior mathematical sciences major Thomas Swayze, and sophomore mathematical sciences major Joshua Brakensiek.
“Teaching our students problem-solving skills that will help them to succeed in all of their future endeavors is at the heart of our math curriculum,” said Po-Shen Loh, an associate professor of mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon and the team’s coach. “Our sustained success in the Putnam shows that some of the best math students are gathering here at Carnegie Mellon and thriving.”
The efforts of these students has allowed Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Mathematical Sciences in the Mellon College of Science to receive $20,000, with each of the three team members receiving an $800 cash prize.
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama faculty members win awards for costume design
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama faculty members Susan Tsu, Bessie F. Anathan Professor of Costume Design, and Suttirat Larlarb, associate professor of costume design, have won the Theatre Development Fund Irene Sharaff Award. The award is regarded as being a high honor for American costume designers.
Tsu, an active costume designer for 40 years, has been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award and Larlarb has been awarded the Young Master Award.
Tsu’s designs have been included in hits such as “Godspell” and “The Joy Luck Club.”
“Of course it’s a great honor,” Tsu said in a statement to the University. “When I think about the number of incredibly talented designers in this country and some of the people I’m following and the number of designers I’ve been influenced and inspired by, I feel even more honored to be recognized in this way.”
Larlarb’s work has been included in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, in the recent biopic Steve Jobs, and in the Broadway musical “Finding Neverland.”
In a statement to the University Larlarb states “When I came back from the Olympics, after doing something that massive and that impactful on the world, it almost seemed greedy to just keep building my career without giving something back ... Part of me was coming to teaching because I wanted to try to instill the things I’d seen and learned and observed and challenge students to be better.”
The awards ceremony will take place on May 20 in New York City.

As my first year here at Carnegie Mellon rapidly approaches its culmination, I would like to comment on the culture and support network that is being so hotly discussed around campus. As a person with a military background, I know the stress of combat, impossible deadlines, and true life-and-death decisions. Carnegie Mellon does not ask for any of those, yet I am more stressed and demoralized about my own capabilities than ever before. I didn’t want to believe that it could affect me because I thought it was simply a product of young undergrads with little real-life experience. I was wrong.
The graduate student community is being overlooked in many ways, with the vast majority of the focus placed on undergraduates. Provost Jahanian’s email today (April 1) states that “it is clear” that faculty “understand the pressures many of you face.” I have leaned on my advisor and many other professors and students and all have offered significant support. Yet in the classroom it is a different story. There is a belief that as a graduate student you are not entitled to breaks, expected to be overloaded, and even to fail. Days after an exam where the entire class questioned why we were at this university, the professor proceeded to say that he expected the highest grade to be a 50. Another said “graduate students don’t get days off” and held class on a day the university calendar marked for no classes. Another assigned a project with no warning before Spring Break, with mandatory submissions during the break. Heinz College doesn’t even follow the larger university calendar. Advisors actively tell you not to do homework and focus on research. There are few resources for those who have children and spouses.
I say this not to complain, but rather to inform. Professors must acknowledge that the guidelines established by the university are clear on the expectations. A 12-unit course is supposed to require 12 hours of work per week, to include class time, recitation, and assignments — not 30. The best way to mitigate the issues of students is to realize that nobody wins when students give up on trying because they have no more time or energy to put towards the assignment. Saying “the rules don’t apply because you’re in a graduate program,” or, “you should be able to deal with that on your own” do not fall under the support concept the administration is seeking. Change starts at the classroom level.

Over the past few weeks, mental health issues have risen to the forefront of many of our conversations, and rightfully so. College is perhaps the most stressful and change-intensive time that any of us have experienced thus far. Given that we’re all making some generally life-defining choices so early on in our adult lives, there’s bound to be some excitement for the future, but also some fear. We’re afraid that we won’t get good grades, which means we won’t get an internship, won’t get a job, and we’ll all die penniless and alone, begging on a dingy little street corner in Ohio somewhere. With so much to juggle and so little time in the day, we’re bound to be stressed and maybe a little exhausted. Exhaustion and perceived stress are two susceptibility factors in burnout, which can lead to depression and feelings of being overtired and overwhelmed. With so much of our self-worth often tied to external things like our workload or our general success, we can often fall into a slump when we don’t meet the standards set before us, and we begin to feel like all of the work we have been putting forth just isn’t enough or isn’t worth continuing. This is a burnt-out state: we lack energy, lack motivation, and this feeling can spiral into depression before we know what hit us. And when these sort of personal issues arise, it can be very difficult to reach out and ask for help, or even to talk with someone.
The causes of depression and similar disorders are myriad, but in college, some of the largest factors are our perceived success (how often do I succeed at something I try?), our social support (do I have people I can talk to who will support me?), and our sense of belonging (is this the place for me, or am I just taking up space?). Without these things, we can start to feel isolated and develop a cycle of negative thoughts and neurotic reactions that can spiral out of control. This was the case with my own experience during the spring of 2015.
Long story short, I needed some help. I’ve never been the kind of person to ask for help, at least when it comes to personal matters, but one fateful day I summoned up enough energy to meander over to Morewood and try my luck with CaPS. Lo and behold, the big metal door was locked (during business hours), and while there may have been another entrance of which I was unaware, that was enough for me. I packed up my help-seeking and curled up in bed.
The point here isn’t that the door was locked (for some unknown reason). It’s that I had finally mustered up the energy and the wherewithal to try and talk to someone, to try and fight whatever cycle I was in, and was met with a roadblock. One symptom of depression is a lack of energy and motivation; the sheer amount of energy it takes to be able to say “I’m going to actively try and fight this today” is extraordinary in such a state, and to have those efforts be thwarted, even by something as silly as a door, can be devastating to that initiative.
This anecdote of the closed door can be extrapolated to many situations of which I’ve recently become aware. While there are many other factors which might preclude one from getting the help they need, I’ll focus on a resource specifically created for assisting with students’ psychological needs: Carnegie Mellon’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS).
I have heard many stories about CaPS. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I was taught during Orientation that CaPS is a resource for students, and that if anyone is having a problem, CaPS can be depended upon to assist. And yes, I have certainly spoken to those who have seen success in dealing with CaPS. But an overwhelming vibe I am picking up, at least in my own friends’ experience, is that CaPS has some major strides to make before it can really be called a dependable resource for our student population.
Barring my own personal experience (or lack thereof), I have a friend who called CaPS in the early morning while having a panic attack, and the first response with which she was met was “Is this an emergency?” Thinking something along the lines of “Well, I don’t know, is it? There are probably people worse off than me,” she hung up and waited out the night. I have heard a similar story from several other friends and acquaintances, and it doesn’t quite sit well with me.
It’s not as if this is a malignant question. There’s no malice in asking whether or not a situation constitutes an emergency, but I think this is a blunt way of handling these phone calls. It places a lot of self-assessment in the hands of someone who might be unable to make these sorts of calls at the moment, and it provides another block in the road to someone’s potential recovery or present wellness.
I’ve also heard stories of CaPS actively hanging up if the caller answers with a “no, this isn’t an emergency,” sort of answer. While I understand that emergencies should take priority, and that the on-call staff might not nearly meet the present need, it’s rather cruel for the campus’s counseling service to actively ignore students who have taken the time to seek out help.
I suppose the point of all this isn’t necessarily to be pejorative towards CaPS. It’s to express frustration for the hurdles (however small and melodramatic) through which we must jump to find help. My personal opinion is that mental health issues aren’t something that can necessarily be solved or even heavily ameliorated administratively. A lot of these less severe, more fleeting issues (like my depression) can be successfully managed by just speaking with friends or having friends or doing friendly things, and having the social structures in place to really feel close to someone. In our day-to-day lives, we might think about ourselves more than others, or only our close friends. It’s surprising what an open hand or a little conversation can do for someone’s day, so I would encourage any reader to be an open hand rather than a closed door. Don’t concern yourselves only with emergencies; it’s that kind of thing that often pushes people toward rash action. Reach out during the week, when you don’t have any reason to be concerned. Be sincere when you ask “how are you,” and have time to listen to a real answer. Grow your ears and shrink your mouth, and be there for someone when neither of you may know how necessary your presence is.

Last Sunday, April 3, a trail derailment in Philadelphia killed two construction workers and injured thirty-five people. Just a month ago, a train derailment in Kansas injured thirty-two. In 2015, another Philadelphia derailment killed eight and injured over two hundred, the deadliest train accident in the region in nearly thirty years.
Let’s face it: America has a transportation infrastructure problem, and it’s getting costly and dangerous. 
Once known for our innovative, state-of-the-art highways and railways, our country now lags behind much of the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to public investments in transportation. We’re losing money, and lives, because we lack the collective will to tackle our infrastructure head-on with meaningful and decisive action.
While many advanced nations are pushing to update their infrastructure, the United States is falling behind. In less than a decade, the United States fell from 7th in the World Economic Forum’s rankings of international road quality to 18th.
When considering infrastructure holistically, the World Economic Forum ranks the United States even worse: 25th. China ranked lower, yet it is moving up, while the United States continues to fall down. China spends 9 percent of its GDP on improving infrastructure compared to the 2.4 percent of GDP that the United States spends for that purpose.
This lack of public investment is reflected by sobering statistics. 65 percent of American roads are in poor condition, and 25 percent of America’s bridges urgently require repair or handle more traffic than they were designed to handle. Here in the City of Bridges, 20 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient, including the all-powerful Liberty Bridge.
The United States ranks 18th in the world for the quality of our railroads and just 30th in the world for the quality of our air transport. Meanwhile, nearly half of Americans lack stable access to any transit at all.
Having such poor infrastructure has fiscal and physical consequences. Americans spend 5.5 billion hours in traffic every year, resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars in lost productivity and increased fuel costs. In 2020, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that poor infrastructure will cost $1 trillion in business sales, endangering 3.5 million jobs and costing the GDP $3.1 trillion between 2012 and 2020. Historically, huge public investments in infrastructure, such as the transcontinental railroad and the Interstate Highway System, have corresponded with periods of unbridled economic growth and productivity. In our current case the converse is true: failing to invest in infrastructure has suffocated our economy.
More importantly, the New York Times estimates that more than 14,000 transportation deaths are caused by poor infrastructure every year. 
Train derailments are a perfect example. Many derailment deaths, including the deaths in both of the above Philadelphia derailments, could have been prevented had those railroads been retrofitted with a technology called Positive Train Control. 
It is a moral failing to allow so many transportation-related deaths that could be prevented by greater investments in infrastructure.
It’s time to get over our infrastructure problem by committing to a massive infrastructure spending program over the next decade. It’s time to bid farewell to train derailments and traffic jams, and time to greet a new American century marked by the innovation, economic growth, and security that enhanced infrastructure can help provide.

Over the past few days, a change.org petition for “Zero Tolerance for Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mellon University” has been circulating through social media. People have shared it on Facebook pages, campaigned for it in line for the Hillary Clinton rally, and asked admitted students to sign it.
During my time at Carnegie Mellon, I’ve transformed Carnegie Mellon’s feminist organization, MORF, turning it from a group of three freshmen to what it is today, a club that raised thousands of dollars for reproductive rights at The Vagina Monologues and brought the campus together for sexual education at Love Female Orgasm. I have always been an advocate for survivors, but that is not why I’m writing today. I’m writing because I did some thinking, and I do not support this petition.
The writers of this petition are correct in that Carnegie Mellon has a huge sexual assault problem. Our numbers are significantly above the national average and that needs to be addressed via serious policy change. This petition proposes one solution that I’ve been told I should agree with, but I can’t endorse.
The petition as it currently stands requires mandatory expulsion for any student found responsible for sexual assault via the University Disciplinary Committee. Carnegie Mellon’s definition of sexual assault is consistent: “any physical sexual act perpetrated against a person’s will, where that person does not give clear and voluntary consent, or where that person is incapable of giving consent.” Any physical sexual act perpetrated against a person’s will includes grabbing someone’s butt at a party, or kissing them before asking. Sexual assault also includes situations where one or both parties are intoxicated.
Mandatory expulsion would be harsher than any other university policy. The closest comparison is Dartmouth College’s policy, which mandates expulsion only in specific cases such as repeat and violent offenses. The proposal, much broader than Dartmouth’s, would force the Disciplinary Committee to act as an expulsion committee, rather than one that decides a consequence appropriate for each individual case. This does not mean that the University should not expel rapists — in fact, it regularly does. But it also decides what to do in cases that are not so clear-cut. What if we had clearly delineated consequences so that survivors had a strong grasp of what was a likely outcome? Consequences like mandatory counseling, community service, suspension, and removal from campus housing could all be publicly known consequences that a survivor might select and recommend to a Disciplinary Committee.
Some might think the only reason survivors go to the University Disciplinary Committee is in dire situations. I find that argument odd. The Disciplinary Committee is an opportunity to arrive at a formal, rather than informal, decision over a violation of our sexual assault policy, and is often a reasonable way to address a dispute in a controlled setting. Students choose to go through the formal process for sexual assault for many reasons, and not all of them warrant mandatory expulsion.
The other two aspects of the petition — Transparency and Education — are initiatives that the Title IX Office has not only already agreed to, but has been working on for some time. They’ve made it clear that both of these points are part of their initiatives moving forward. More transparency about the actual consequence determination processes, both formal and informal, is necessary moving forward, but has not been addressed by the Title IX Office or this petition. I hope that the discussion surrounding this petition leads to a broader knowledge of the operations of the Title IX Office, rather than a dismissal of it as ineffective.
Carnegie Mellon has a sexual assault problem. But mandatory expulsion for anyone who commits sexual assault isn’t the solution. Hopefully, discussion of this petition will bring up other policies that we can take away from Dartmouth College’s more rigorous sexual assault prevention strategy, including an online reporting option, mandatory expulsion in serious cases, and clear delineation of consequences for specific violations. The people who wrote this petition clearly care about survivors of sexual assault. But in their empathy, they lose sight of the fact that not all situations are black and white. I encourage readers to consider whether this policy and this document are worth supporting.
We’ve been given a great opportunity by the writers of “Zero Tolerance for Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mellon University.” In the wake of the Title IX investigations our University has faced, we now have the opportunity to use both our hearts and minds to make policy decisions about its future. Let’s make the right ones.

For those of you night owls on campus, on the morning of Monday, April 4, the fraction of campus that goes to their 8:30 a.m. classes woke up to find the touching memorial for our recently deceased fellow students replaced by the slogan “Make America Great Again.”
By 1:30 p.m. that same afternoon, things got even more confusing when all that was left of the message was the red background and splotches of white paint just managing to make the original message indecipherable. It was at this time that the Facebook group Overheard at Carnegie Mellon exploded with before and after pictures of The Fence and escalating debate over the legality and morality of what happened.
First, to address the accusations of vandalism against whoever painted The Fence in broad daylight, the only regulation I was able to find related to painting The Fence prohibits the use of spraypaint, air-brushes, paint rollers and similar tools. Using these to paint The Fence is an act of graffiti. All the other stipulations however, such as only being able to paint between midnight and 6 a.m. and having to completely cover the previous message, seem to just be traditions. So far, there doesn’t seem to be a problem.
Now however, we get to the more charged part of the debate. Was painting The Fence in support of Donald Trump inappropriate? Was this worth breaking our traditions for? As usual, there were heated arguments on both sides, some rational, some less so. What the situation ultimately boils down to is your right to voice your political opinion. The fence didn’t have any hate speech on it. There was no sexist, racist, homophobic, or otherwise inappropriate content on The Fence.
There was only a political slogan, of the front runner for the 2016 Republican Presidential Nomination might I add. Whether you like the policies he advocates, or you personally get offended by what he stands for, that’s a value judgement that you’re making. What gets me is the blatant hypocrisy of the situation: less than two days after the student body erupts on Overheard, we welcome Hillary Clinton, another Presidential candidate, to our campus with great pomp and celebration.
The problem with breaking our traditions for this scenario is the message it sends. It shows that we, as a campus, will do whatever it takes to silence the voices of those who oppose what we decide as the acceptable opinion.
As a university that prides itself in its diversity, I would hope that we’re capable of seeing and accepting, though not necessarily agreeing with, differing perspectives. There is a frightening trend on college campuses around the country these days that is pruning the students’ right to free speech almost to the point of nonexistence. The Spotlight on Speech Codes 2016 survey found that 49.3 percent of the 440 institutions of higher education surveyed have “at least one policy both clearly and substantially restricting freedom of speech, or that bars public access to its speech-related policies,” while Carnegie Mellon is one of the mere 22 universities found to not have any policies threatening campus expression. I for one, would like to keep it that way. Personally, the idea of dissident opinions being eradicated makes me feel a lot more unsafe than Donald Trump’s slogan, especially since my right to have a dissident opinion is what allows me to vote against him in the first place.
Something that was much more troubling, though not as talked about, was how the Trump propaganda covered up the memorial to our recently deceased fellow students. Painting over The Fence after a mere two days with any message whatsoever is quite a callous gesture. However, The Fence is meant to be painted over, and callousness should not be mistaken for bigotry.
And finally, I’d like to remind everyone that this entire uproar was about a fence with a lot of paint on it.

The Tartan has dedicated significant space to the political process this year, for both national elections and the student body ones occurring here at Carnegie Mellon. However, while we often talk about the effect of policy, we rarely talk about what the responsibilities of an elected official are and how they affect the campus community.
Elected student officials have two obligations: to follow Student Government’s rules and to advocate for the student body that elected them.
The first obligation to the bylaws serves three purposes. The first is that this is an important check on the bylaws and constitutional requirements of the Student Government. By following its own rules, student government representatives can understand the burdens and costs these rules place on other students. This asymmetry created when they do not follow the rules makes it harder for Student Government to advocate for students and for students to trust the government’s actions.
The second is that organizations deserve predictability and consistency, which they look to Student Government to provide. When officials violate their own bylaws, it has the potential to burden students’ organizations with unexpected consequences, and it becomes harder for them to fulfill their purposes. The third is that, should Student Government officials violate bylaws, it constitutes an argument from the government itself that the law needs exceptions. This means the government ought to look into changing the rule entirely rather than just breaking it. Otherwise, the rule loses authority.
Student government officials are also obligated to advocate for the student body with the power afforded to them in the Constitution and bylaws. Officials are put in power with students’ votes, meaning students’ interests should be the goal of the government. When Student Government officials fail to advocate for students, they reject the nature of their own job.
Yet democracy is not a one-way street. The student body also has two duties. The first is to be well informed, active participants in the voting process. With student government elections just wrapping up, this obligation has recently been center stage.
A second, less frequently discussed piece of the process is our responsibility to hold student government accountable throughout their term. As we look towards the future, it seems like an important time to look back at an example of why these obligations are important and how to give students recourse.
The first time most organizations heard about the 2016 Student Organization Summit (herein referred to as Summit, not to be confused with CMU Summit, an event hosted by the Chinese Student Scholar Association) was through an email that threatened de-recognition for the organization should they fail to attend. The Committee on Student Organization (CoSO) Bylaws state that “CoSO is expected to accept applications for re-recognition from groups whose complete and accurate application demonstrates a continuing pursuit of their stated primary purpose,” and make no mention of an event like Summit in the definition of a complete and accurate application. Although the bylaws seem to make it so that Summit could not be grounds for derecognition, many students were not familiar with the bylaws and took this threat seriously, resulting in confusion and panic among those dedicated to the organizations. Students who were not free on Valentine’s Day, did not expect this threat, missed the email, or plenty of other occurrences that were not their fault suddenly felt their organizations were on the chopping block.
While student organization leaders may not know the bylaws and inner workings of CoSO, were taught  about the re-recognition proccess by their predecessors. A drastic change to the process needs to be handled carefully because it can cause difficulty for an organization, and confusion that would hurt the organization’s ability to pursue their goals.
Many organizations were greatly confused by the transition surrounding Summit. Beyond the turmoil surrounding the derecognition threat, there was confusion about whether Summit was in addition to the re-recognition process as per usual or whether it replaced the process entirely and about who the change applied to. Traditionally the re-recognition process for mature organizations, which are organizations that have been on campus for seven years or more, is separate from the process for young organizations due to their different needs. Summit lumped certain young organizations who were working through the standard procedure but had not yet finished getting re-recognized in with a subset of mature organizations.
This situation becomes more troubling when one realizes that, as explained by a source within CoSO, “much of the reason [young organizations] weren’t re-recognized during the fall was because CoSO wasn’t doing it’s job properly. They weren’t finishing up. They weren’t meeting with these organizations properly and weren’t discussing these organizations in a timely manner.” This ended up applying inconsistent standards to young organizations applying for re-recognition based on whether CoSO managed to have time for them in the fall or not, and punishing organizations who got lost in the process with a sudden move for things that were not their fault.
In the end no one was derecognized for their inability to attend Summit, which indicates that the threat was empty to begin with. This means the letter of the bylaws was not directly violated, but the spirit of them was and it is quite possible that the trust of organizations was. They were threatened with a serious punishment for failing to do something not central to their purpose on campus. This is not fair to those organizations and certainly not advocating for them.
In addition, while no one was de-recognized, organizations were put on probation for failing to attend the event on Feb. 14. Probation can cause significant inconveniences for organizations based on the consequences assigned by CoSO and, more simply, can scare and confuse an organization. When their organizational efforts are focused on figuring out why they were on probation, this can take time and resources away from an organization’s function.
The other problem with probation is that the burdens on organizations to avoid it are well-defined. According to the CoSO Bylaws Article VII, Section B, “Criteria for Recognition Probation include 1. Repeated and/or egregious failure to meet the expectations placed on Student Government Recognized organizations, as described in the Carnegie Mellon University Student Body Constitution (herein referred to as the Constitution); 2. Decrease in membership to less than eight (8) members of the student body.” Those responsibilities, according to Article VI Section D the Student Body Constitution include a requirement to “1. Notify [CoSO] regarding any change in name, mission, or purpose; 2. Notify [CoSO] regarding any change in contact information for officers of the organization; 3. Pursuit of the organization’s primary purpose and goals, in the form on record with the Committee on Student Organizations; 4. Adherence to [the bylaws and constitution of Student Government, the university, and the organization].”
These are the ground rules and expectations that have been laid between Student Government and organizational officers. Violating these expectations by placing burdens on them outside of this scope is both a failure of Student Government to follow its own rules and harmful to the organizations.
Of course, the Constitution is a living document that can be amended if a branch of Student Government wishes to change its policies. This process, however, is intentionally structured to ameliorate the issues stemming from a big change, many of which are described above. No amendment was passed.
Summit is only one example of an issue the Student Government and student body need to have a dialogue about. With elections wrapping up, the vast majority of the voting that will happen already has. However, going forward, the next Student Government has important considerations to make regarding how to keep itself accountable to its bylaws and responsibilities.
The first is fiscal transparency of Student Government actions. This makes it easier for students to see how Student Government money is used. This will both improve campus knowledge of various funding sources and what they are used for and create accountability for Student Government officials to use their funds within the scope of the existing rules.
The second is better avenues of protest through governing bodies like Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly. Organizations should have been able to challenge the derecognition threat or probationary period in regards to Summit, and they should also be able to challenge actions by the Student Government they feel to be wrong as a whole.
Senate and GSA are representative bodies and have knowledge of how Student Government processes work, making them a good check on the actions of the Student Government Executive Branch.
With these and perhaps other new measures in place the student body will have the resources it needs to uphold its end of the bargain.
