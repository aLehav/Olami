With three of the six Matchdays gone in the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League season, it’s time for a quick recap of the games and standings so far:
Group A
A tightly-contested match between Salzburg and Lokomotiv Moscow on Matchday 1 saw each side unable to gain a substantial lead, and the game ended 2-2. In Germany, however, reigning champions Bayern Munich put on a phenomenal performance against a sub-par Atlético Madrid, putting up a 4-0 scoreline.
Atléti played much better on Matchday 2. Though they lost an early lead to Salzburg, two goals from João Félix were enough to rescue all three points for the hosts. In Moscow, an early goal by Leon Goretzka gave the defending champions the lead. An equalizer from Anton Miranchuk proved to be in vain, as a late goal from Joshua Kimmich sealed the deal for Bayern.
Lokomotiv Moscow would not let history repeat itself, however. After equalizing against an early goal by Atlético Madrid on Matchday 3, they successfully held off the much stronger Spanish side to end the match 1-1. However, Atléti retained their position of second in the group on goal difference. In Salzburg, the hosts seemed to have a chance at dethroning the defending champions, opening the scoring after four minutes. Bayern then scored two to take the lead, but a 66th minute equalizer by Masaya Okugawa gave Salzburg a shot at victory. However, any such hopes were shut down when Bayern scored four times within the last 15 minutes to make the final scoreline 6-2. This secured the German giants’ spot at the top of Group A, extended their UCL win-streak to 14 games, and left Salzburg at the bottom of the table.
Group B
In perhaps the most surprising game on Matchday 1, Real Madrid conceded three goals at home against Shakhtar Donetsk in the first half. The 2018 champions managed to score two in the second half, but it wasn’t enough to stop Shakhtar from taking home all three points. Inter Milan and Borussia Mönchengladbach held each other to a goalless first half until a shot by Romelu Lukaku put the hosts in front. Two successive goals from Gladbach saw them overtake the Italian side, but a second goal from Lukaku recovered a point for Inter.
Gladbach’s misfortunes continued into Matchday 2, where they lost a 2-goal lead in the final six minutes of the game against Real Madrid. Against Shakhtar Donetsk, Inter Milan put on a strong performance, but they were unable to capitalize on any chances in a match that eventually ended goalless.
When Borussia Mönchengladbach scored inside eight minutes of play on Matchday 3, however, it was a sign of things to come. In a show of complete dominance, Gladbach put six goals past hosts Shakhtar Donetsk (including a hattrick by Alassane Pléa) to elevate themselves to the top of Group B. At the Bernabéu, Real Madrid started off well, establishing a two-goal lead. However, Inter Milan matched the home side, also scoring two to equalize. An 80th minute goal by Rodrygo finally gave the hosts their first win in this season’s UCL group stage, putting them third in Group B and leaving Inter at the bottom, winless.
Group C
Porto started out well against Manchester City, taking the lead after 14 minutes. Two converted set-pieces from City put them ahead of the Portuguese side, however, and a third quickly solidified their win. In Piraeus, it looked like visitors Marseille would hold Olympiacos to a draw, but a late header from Ahmed Mahgoub won all three points for the hosts.
Olympiacos’s luck would not hold in Matchday 2, however. An early mistake practically gifted Porto the lead, and a late goal from Sérgio Oliveira sealed the win for the Primeira Liga champions. In Marseille, there was no doubt over who would come out on top. Manchester City dominated the game, and the 3-0 scoreline is proof of it.
Against Porto, Marseille was unable to capitalize on any opportunities, and the home team took full advantage, putting three past Steve Mandanda and pulling themselves up to second in the group, leaving Marseille rock bottom. Olympiacos found themselves in a similar position as Marseille. Completely outmatched by Manchester City, they relinquished all three points in a 3-0 game that put City solidly at the top of Group C.
Group D
Ajax and Liverpool looked well-matched against each other, with only an unfortunate own goal from Nicolás Tagliafico giving the Reds the win. In contrast, Atalanta overpowered Danish side Midtjylland in a deserved 4-0 victory.
On Matchday 2, Ajax started strong against Atalanta, sporting a 2-0 lead after the first half. However, two second-half goals from Duván Zapata salvaged a point for the hosts. Midtjylland put up a valiant effort against the Premier League champions, but goals from Diogo Jota and Mo Salah secured all three points for Liverpool.
In yet another Matchday 3 game ending with a large scoreline and a hattrick, Liverpool breezed past Atalanta by a final score of 5-0, with Diogo Jota bagging three goals, securing their place at the top of Group D. Ajax started off strong against Midtjylland, with Antony scoring inside the first minute and Dušan Tadić converting a free kick inside the box in the 13th minute. The hosts attempted to fight back, with Anders Dreyer netting a goal in the 18th minute, but made no other headway, leaving Midtjylland at the bottom of Group D while Ajax clung to second, ahead of Atalanta by a single point in goal difference.
Group E
On Matchday 1, Serhou Guirassy opened the scoring with a penalty for Rennes, but an equalizer by Krasnodar’s Cristian Ramírez forced the hosts to split the points. Likewise, Chelsea and Sevilla had to settle for one point each after a goalless match.
Chelsea would find their momentum in Russia, however, scoring four goals against Krasnodar on Matchday 2 to come away with all three points. In Sevilla, the home side completely dictated the game, but Rennes put up an admirable defense. Still, a well-controlled volley by Luuk de Jong put Sevilla up 1-0, and the scoreline stayed there until the end of the match.
Chelsea continued their streak on Matchday 3 against Rennes. Two penalties taken by Timo Werner put the hosts up by two, and a third goal by Tammy Abraham secured Chelsea’s spot at the top of Group E, while Rennes was left at the bottom. Against Sevilla, Krasnodar had a rather impressive start, managing to open the scoring in the 17th minute and double their lead in the 21st. However, they were unable to keep up the momentum, and three subsequent goals by the stronger Spanish side gave Sevilla the victory, placing them right behind Chelsea in Group E, second only by goal difference.
Group F
Zenit St. Petersburg and Club Brugge looked evenly matched on Matchday 1 until Emmanuel Bonaventure bundled in a goal in the 63rd minute. A shot from Dejan Lovren ricocheted off Club Brugge keeper Ethan Horvath to let Zenit draw level, but a goal from young Charles De Ketelaere in the last 90 seconds gave Club Brugge their first UCL group stage win in nearly two years. In contrast, Dortmund was unable to perform against Lazio, who capitalized on the visitors’ mistakes to get an early two-goal lead. A goal from Erling Haaland gave the German side some hope, but a goal by Jean-Daniel Akpro sealed the deal for I Biancocelesti.
Zenit’s miseries only worsened in their second game. They held Dortmund off for most of the match, but a foul by Vyacheslav Karavayev presented Dortmund with a penalty, which Jadon Sancho cooly converted. Haaland then finished the job with a second goal in stoppage time. Lazio found that they couldn’t capitalize on their momentum. Though they scored early against Club Brugge, a penalty tied the score, and they were forced to split the points with the hosts.
On Matchday 3, Zenit started well against Lazio, with Aleksandr Yerokhin scoring for the hosts in the 32nd minute. However, a late-game equalizer by Felipe Caicedo forced Zenit to split the points and stay at the bottom of Group F while Lazio climbed to second. In yet another 3-0 game, Borussia Dortmund emerged victorious against Club Brugge through an opener by Thorgan Hazard and a brace from Haaland. This placed Die Schwarzgelben at the top of Group F.
Group G
Dynamo Kyiv put on a resilient first half against Italian giants Juventus, but two goals from Álvaro Morata in the second half sealed the win for the Old Lady. At Camp Nou, there was little contest between Barcelona and Ferencvárosi, with Barcelona dominating in a 5-1 performance and extending their unbeaten run at home to 37 games.
In Budapest, Viktor Tsygankov converted a penalty to give Dynamo their first UCL group stage goal in four years, which was quickly followed up by a second. However, the visitors were unable to keep the lead, and two second-half goals from Ferencvárosi salvaged a point for the hosts. A stroke of fortune found Ousmane Dembélé’s shot deflected into the back of the Juventus net, and a late penalty conversion by Lionel Messi found Barcelona victorious 2-0 in Turin.
An early penalty by Messi put Barcelona up 1-0 against Dynamo Kyiv on Matchday 3. A goal by Gerard Piqué extended their lead, but Viktor Tsygankov pulled one back in the 75th minute. The 2-1 win was enough for Barça to maintain their place at the top of Group G. Against Ferencvárosi, Juventus put on an unsurprisingly strong performance, netting four goals. A 90th minute goal by Franck Boli was too little, too late for Ferencvárosi, who stayed at the bottom of the table while Juve retained their second place.
Group H
In Paris, a penalty from Bruno Fernandes put visitors Manchester United up early in the first half, but a 55th minute own goal courtesy of Anthony Martial tied the score for Paris Saint-Germain. A late goal by Marcus Rashford delivered a 2-1 victory for the English side. Two goals from Angeliño put Leipzig up 2-0 against İstanbul Başakşehir after just 20 minutes of play time, and the score stood for the rest of the game.
İstanbul Başakşehir played much better at home on Matchday 2, and for a good portion of the match, it seemed like it could be anybody’s game. However, a later brace from Moise Kean secured the win for PSG. At Old Trafford, Leipzig seemed completely outmatched. Though they only conceded one goal in the first half, a Marcus Rashford hattrick plus a penalty by Martial in the last 20 minutes made the final scoreline 5-0 to Manchester United.
On Matchday 3, İstanbul Başakşehir played their best game yet, putting two past Manchester United before halftime. Though Martial scrambled one back for United in the 43rd minute, a goalless second half saw İstanbul Başakşehir take all three points. However, they remained at the bottom of the table and United stayed at the top, both on goal difference. PSG started well against Leipzig, with Ángel Di María opening scoring after six minutes. However, a well-placed shot by Christopher Nkunku and an Emil Forsberg penalty was enough for the hosts to edge out the visitors, leaving them second and third in Group H, respectively.

When Richard Grenell was brought on as Senior Fellow in the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) this past June, students and faculty pushed back citing concerns about Grenell’s actions and rhetoric. Administration attempted to quell the fear about what this appointment would do to the school’s reputation, writing in an Aug. 3 report that “we fully expect Mr. Grenell to abide by all CMU policies, including the stipulation ‘to conduct all business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, accuracy, integrity and respect for others.’” In the last few weeks, more students and professors have argued that Grenell’s actions do no not constitute the “good faith” the university expected.
To his almost 700,000 Twitter followers, Grenell has posted disinformation about president-elect Joe Biden’s mask wearing, which was later deleted, as well as numerous claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which have not been substantiated. He’s called COVID-19 the “Chinese Flu,” has posted anti-mask rhetoric, and throughout the election cycle, has appeared at several political events without consideration of social distancing and without wearing a mask.   
Many members of the Carnegie Mellon community have taken issue with Grenell’s recent behavior, sharing their takes on social media. In an open letter to president Farnam Jahanian posted on the Carnegie Mellon subreddit Nov. 7, one Reddit user wrote, “[Grenell] makes a mockery of our academic community's ethical, health, and cultural norms and has proven himself incapable of being restricted by any standard of decency.” Later in the letter, they state, “I am not a political radical. I do not criticize the political leanings of the recent appointee. I am incensed, rather, by his attacks on our sacrosanct democratic institutions. I am outraged by his vitriolic, racist, hateful speech so to the detriment of the culture of collaboration and unity we have attempted to foster at our beloved university.”
Another post on Reddit asked the university to “drop” him, citing his frequent sharing of misinformation on twitter. One user, who wrote that they had previously worked in the call center that solicits alumni donations, said in a separate post on Nov. 3 that alumni should tell Carnegie Mellon that they’re withholding donations pending Grenell’s employment status. That user concluded, “if CMU doesn’t care about their reputation, I’m sure they at least care about their money.”
On Twitter, a satirical account, complete with the username @CMU_IPS and a profile photo to match, has been quote-tweeting posts of Grenell at public events without a mask. Responding to a photo of Grenell and Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) both without masks, the account wrote, “Thank you to our Senior Fellow @RichardGrenell for refusing to wear a mask and continuing to combat the Fake News China Virus!”
The tweet garnered the attention of the university, which tweeted back from it’s official account, “That is not an official CMU-related account and we have already reported the fake account to Twitter” on Nov. 3. 
That tweet marked the first university comment related to Grenell’s recent actions. To it, one user responded, “it’s not a fake account, it’s a parody. Y’all staff EMBARRASSING people and we like to joke about it!” Another chimed in, “might want to rethink these priorities.”
On Oct. 30, Jonathan Aldrich, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, posted a blog entry titled “What to do about Richard Grenell?” The piece argues that Grenell has not upheld the basic requirements for employment at Carnegie Mellon, specifically, those of the university’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Grenell’s use of the term “Chinese Flu” after being hired, as well as his lack of compliance with the university’s COVID-19 guidelines, Aldrich says, have demonstrated that the concerns the community had upon Grenell’s appointment have been realized. “[Grenell’s] behavior has not changed simply by being hired at CMU; even if we will not fire him immediately for it, it does demonstrate pretty clearly that hiring him was a mistake,” Aldrich wrote.
Aldrich says the Grenell situation has illuminated the need for greater “checks and balances” in the hiring process at Carnegie Mellon. “CMU’s policy of giving department heads discretion to hire high profile visiting faculty and staff is fundamentally flawed,” Aldrich writes, “One person can make the decision to hire, with no checks and balances – despite the fact that the hired person can contribute to a hostile environment for racial minorities.” Aldrich urges the university to understand that “academic freedom is about individual teaching and research, not about administrative hiring.”
In an interview with The Tartan, Aldrich said that his gripes with Grenell stem not from anyone’s political beliefs, but from Grenell’s actions. “We've seen very partisan behavior from [Grenell] as part of the Trump campaign, and that's expected. I don't have any opposition to faculty or staff members at Carnegie Mellon being involved in politics. But I do have a problem with misinformation,” he said. Any Carnegie Mellon staff member, especially those that are prominent enough to be a “voice of the university,” Aldrich says, have an “obligation to the truth.”
Referring to the lack of administrative action regarding Grenell’s frequent incompliance with university COVID-19 policy, Aldrich said, “maybe [the administration] figure this doesn't matter, because maybe [Grenell] actually is never on campus, and never in a room with students.” But, given the public reprimand that a CFA professor received for violating COVID-19 guidelines on Oct. 24, Aldrich said that “it certainly seems at least a bit hypocritical to have this very public flaunting of COVID guidelines by a senior [staff member] without any comment.”
Conlon Novak, a masters student in Human-Computer Interaction, saw Grenell’s lack of COVID-19 safety on social media and began reporting instances of it to the university’s ethics reporting system on Oct. 14. So far, Novak has reported 4 of Grenell’s violations of COVID-19 guidelines to the university. In an interview with The Tartan, Novak said that he reported these violations in the spirit of A Tartan’s Responsibility, the university’s guiding principles for COVID-19 behavior, which stipulate that “every member of the Carnegie Mellon University community has a shared responsibility to uphold a culture of safety that balances health considerations with our desire to fulfill the university’s core mission.”
Novak said that the university has “been encouraging everyone to use these reporting resources when they see faculty, staff, students not following protocols.” Since Grenell is a staff member at IPS, “I made sure to pass along everything I saw violating the code as I understood it,” Novak said.
Novak, like Aldrich, says that trying to get the university to enforce COVID-19 guidelines, or reevaluate hiring practices, is not at all politically motivated. “This is the furthest thing from a political question, which is, I think, one of the reasons why this discourse seems to be so charged,” he said. “In actuality, this is a university who has bent over backwards to justify the hiring of someone who is not upholding their good name and reputation, and I genuinely can’t figure out why.”
“I don't want to call for anyone to lose their job, but I don't want to see anyone endanger the health and safety and lives of these students,” Novak said. He plans to keep reporting Grenell’s public COVID-19 policy violations to the university. 
Carnegie Mellon spokesperson Jason Maderer said in a statement to The Tartan that university leadership have “received reports from members of the community about Ambassador Grenell’s campaign appearances”, and that they “have advised [Grenell] that these appearances, often while not wearing a facial covering or maintaining physical distancing, constitute high risk behaviors.” The statement continues, “as with all CMU community members, [Grenell] must comply with our COVID policies if he is going to come to campus or engage with other members of the community in person,” including a 14-day quarantine prior to arrival on-campus, the practice of physical distancing, and the use of a facial covering. “We are not aware of him being on campus or engaging with community members in person,” Maderer said.
When asked about Grenell’s unsubstantiated claims about the election, Director of IPS Kiron Skinner told The Tartan in a statement, “Like all CMU employees, the Institute for Politics and Strategy faculty and staff are free to engage in political activity on their own time."
Richard Grenell did not immediately respond to request for comment on this story

In light of the spring semester’s delayed start date of Feb. 1, the school’s detrimental decision to replace our standard spring break must be reconsidered, along with its attempts to quell worries of the new alternative.
In his Sep. 10 letter, Provost Jim Garrett outlined the tentative replacements for what most would consider a standard spring break. Provost Garrett later introduced a more definitive spring calendar in his Oct. 9 letter, which reaffirmed the school’s decision to opt for separated break days throughout the semester. While the rationale for a shortened spring break exists, the decision’s flaw lies with the Calendar Innovation Committee’s distribution of spring break’s remnants to isolated points throughout the semester. Essentially, the updated calendar prioritizes individual break days over consecutive ones, with the exception of the now larger gap between semesters.
I’m sure most would agree that nearly a week off in the midst of spring’s academic load would be far more helpful than an extra week in January. However, the break’s placement isn’t necessarily the problem. I’m even more confident that most would expect a break to take the form of consecutive days off rather than isolated ones. This is because, in my experience, individual break days do not translate to the same relaxation or leisure time as that of consecutive ones, even if the number of both is the same. 
An underlying problem of individual break days is that they never seem to account for the nature of academic deadlines, especially given the new hybrid model of learning. Provost Garrett addressed this in his Oct. 9 letter when he stated that the University Leadership Council has asked that “major academic deadlines or assessments do not immediately follow these break days.” While this might seem to ease worries surrounding the individual replacement days, in my experience, similar requests have done almost nothing to reduce the amount of work needed on such “break days.” Thus far, we’ve had at least two of these so-called break days in the fall semester: community engagement day, and mid-semester break. The benefits of these for myself and several others were almost invisible, as homework, projects, and papers were still due in a few days. 
A better example would be election day, which despite the persistence of many classes, was addressed similarly. In response to a massive petition, Provost Garrett stated in an Oct. 15 letter, that the school’s “expectation is that maximum flexibility be extended to students, faculty and staff on Election Day by cancelling non-election related events and assuring no academic deadlines fall on the day.” Strangely enough, I recall the cancelling of some or all lectures and recitations for myself and others on election day. Despite the day’s resemblance of spring semester’s planned “break days” in their lack of both classes and deadlines, I found myself with a standard weekday workload. With such changes and restrictions on deadlines, it’s not hard to imagine instructors moving deadlines closer together to ensure that they don’t fall on such days.
When separated from each other, such “break days” aren’t necessarily break days. Future deadlines don’t frequently change out of respect for a single day off. Even if they do, the work remains to be done. With multi-day breaks, however, it’s more likely that such deadlines will be planned with respect to the break and its leisure time. For this reason, I feel that it’s important that both Provost Garrett and the Calendar Innovation Committee reconsider the placement of the spring break replacement days.

When Carnegie Mellon announced their decision to remove spring break, I immediately hated it. Why would the administration choose to rip away the one thing students and faculty all look forward to? Alas, my first chance to experience a college spring break was taken from me. The thought of enduring a full semester of Carnegie Mellon curriculum and stress without a major break still seems inconceivable. However, after closer examination of the circumstances that forced the hand of the administration shines some light to the decision. The fact of the matter is that under the extenuating circumstances we are all under, the current state of the calendar is the only viable option left, after prioritizing our health and the interests of all students and faculty. 
With the total coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania exceeding 200,000, the university’s foremost priority is to ensure the physical health of students. However, next semester brings with it a tremendous amount of new complications. Considering the onset of the flu season, which usually peaks between December and February, along with the possibility that more students may be on campus next semester, it made sense to push back the start of the semester and get rid of spring break. In order to guarantee our safety, further preventative measures are necessary. By pushing the start of second semester back and limiting the time school is in session during the flu season, the calendar adjustment does just that. 
Well, why not just extend the end of the semester and allow everyone to still enjoy a spring break? This is simply not viable. If this was considered, then all the summer programs and courses would be impacted, and the following year would consequently also be pushed back. What about internships? Students with jobs lined up? Would they be expected to give up weeks of their internship or job? Given Carnegie Mellon’s expensive tuition, many students depend on these paid internships. If the semester is extended, by days even, students may miss out on a significant amount of possible income. The recent schedule change, however, takes the vested interests of everyone into consideration. 
The last option would be to have consecutive break days instead of the isolated breaks days of Feb. 23, April 5, and March 19. But, would that really be much better? With a single consecutive break, however, we would not be given any break for essentially 3 months straight! The thought of that seems truly terrifying. Chucking in a mere 3-day break after months of continuous schooling and stress seems to do more harm than good. Instead, with isolated break days, we are given an opportunity to unwind each month, allowing us to maintain stability and prevent stress and burnout. 
Although some may say otherwise, the faculty will be trying their best to ensure we do get a true break. Professor David Kosbie, who teaches Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, wrote in an email: “We do all we can to avoid assigned work over breaks. We try hard to adjust our sequencing rather than to adjust our curriculum itself, so that students are not adversely affected by somehow learning less due to how breaks happen to align. We take it seriously and we do our best to give our students the best learning experience while also letting them take maximum advantage of their breaks.”
We are all just trying to wade through the uncertain waters of the pandemic. The administration was pushed into a corner, with the physical safety of students, faculty and the general public threatened, and every possible option having its pitfalls. The removal of spring protects us and grants us intervals of relaxation, so we don’t have to endure months of schooling without a break. 
So, what now? The only thing we can do is utilize our winter break well. So after this semester comes to an end, let's rest well and rejuvenate. Let’s use our month or so off to learn wellness techniques and create positive habits to equip us for the semester ahead. Let’s jump into the new semester knowing that the professors and the faculty are on our side, doing whatever is in their power to help us. Let’s enter the new semester with a clear plan of attack, knowing that we can overcome anything we set our minds to.

After several delays of vote counting, lawsuits, threats of violence and disinformation, and protests, former Vice President Joe Biden is projected to be the next President of the United States. While President Trump has threatened to pursue legal cases, they hold no water and will only result in lost money for his campaign. Many Americans took to the streets to dance and celebrate as if a weight was lifted off their shoulders. 
However, even as people celebrate, we have to remember that this was still a Pyrrhic victory. The election was not just a referendum on Trump’s mishandling of the pandemic; it was also a referendum on the Democratic leadership strategy. Though it worked out in the end, it’s very clear that Biden would have lost the election had the pandemic not have happened. Even with the pandemic, the credit for Biden’s victory lies with the thousands of local organizers who pulled together to run up the margins in key swing states. 
Within hours of the election results being announced, the infighting among the party resumed immediately as centrists attacked the left and the left attacked centrists. In reality, both wings of the party have major lessons that need to be learned from this election if they want any hope of winning in the future. 
The right wing has been weaponizing economic inequality for the last decade, turning a lot of rural, white working-class folk against each other and minority communities while they continue to loot them. Beyond this, there are many other working-class voters not in rural areas who feel alienated, particularly a lot of minority voters. This election shows that no matter how much the Democrats run up the margins, they can no longer claim to be the party of the working class unless they actively pursue and endorse the policies that lift them up. 
Centrists need to understand these types of policies are popular, as shown by the success of many progressive ballot measures that passed. Florida voted for a $15 minimum wage, which needed over 60% of the votes to pass. Los Angeles passed Measure J, which will reallocate hundreds of millions of dollars away from criminal justice institutions to social programs. Arizona passed a measure that will add a 3.5% income tax on anyone earning over $250,000 to fund education. 
In addition, centrist Democrats have a bad history of not being able to define themselves or control the narrative, and they often pander based on identity politics rather than real substance for the average voter to latch onto. This year alone, Biden spent a lot of time telling people he wasn’t a socialist, and the Democrats failed to capitalize on the major frustrations people have had because of the pandemic. As a result, they come off as a weak party incapable of properly branding themselves and marketing effective policies. No matter what they offer, it doesn’t matter if voters perceive them to be too weak to get it done.
For the left, there is almost an opposite issue. Though left-wing policies are gaining popularity, the actual messaging from the left alienates and scares a lot of voters. Defunding the police and dismantling capitalism are both absolutely necessary, but it has to be palatable for the average voter. It can be easy to blame media bias or centrist propaganda for making left-wing messaging seem scarier than it is, but it’s also foolish not to consider that a lot of Americans genuinely like the police and capitalism. Our messaging needs to be more appealing and focus solely on the policy and not the rhetoric. Katie Porter and Ayanna Pressley in particular are really excellent at this.
Any hope for the left to move the moderate wing of the party is naive at best. Republicans are going to continue their economic nationalist strategy, and the electoral college is not going to disappear for quite some time either. The moderates need to be pushed and held accountable, but in order for our agenda to pass, we can’t alienate the moderate crowd either.
Another final point I want to make is the centrists and the left are really bad at picking their battles. For example, the Trump-Russia scandal amounted to nothing, and the party wasted resources and political capital fighting something they had no chance of winning. When it comes to infighting, both wings of the party have continuously picked the wrong times to attack each other through this election cycle. Republicans are effective because even those who only get less than half of what they want will fall in line in order to get something done when push comes to shove, and Democrats are completely incapable of doing the same thing. 
Despite all these criticisms, I still couldn’t help but feel relieved that Biden had won. My Indian family was proud to watch Kamala Harris speak after the announcement of her election. For the first time in a long time, many in the country felt slightly more optimistic about the direction we are headed in. This election needs to be a wake-up call for the Democrats. It will be necessary for them to play hardball and push a broad coalition of well-written policies that lift the working class up and provide justice for minority communities and immigrants. If they don’t, then expect a worse fascist to rise up by 2024.
