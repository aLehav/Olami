Women’s Soccer
The eighth-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team dominated play against third-ranked Hardin-Simmons University on Saturday, Nov. 18 in the sectional semifinal of the 2017 NCAA Division III Women’s Soccer Championship but were unable to finish any of its 17 shots, as the Cowgirls narrowly defeated the Tartans, 1–0.
The Tartans controlled possession and stymied the potent offensive attack of the Cowgirls, which has scored 108 goals this year, but only one mattered — a corner kick toward the net that was just over the arms of first-year Carolyn Botz in the 77th minute. A Cowgirl was at the front post and prevented Botz from getting to the service that curved across the line.
The Tartans peppered the Cowgirls defense and the goalkeeper all game long and continued to press forward even after the Cowgirls went ahead. In the 87th minute, senior Alex Moy fired a shot off the crossbar, and the goalkeeper saved a shot by senior Tori Iatarola 25 seconds later.
Iatarola and senior Haili Adams each put two shots on goal while senior Sienna Stritter fired off three shots, one of which was just high of the goal in the 12th minute.
The Tartans conclude the season with a 15–3–2 record in the program’s sixth straight trip to the NCAA tournament and fourth appearance in the final 16.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team competed in the 2017 Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Asa S. Bushnell Bowl and fell to the Mules of Muhlenberg College, 32–6. The game was held on the campus of the University of Delaware in Newark, DE.
Following an interception by Carnegie Mellon senior linebacker Sean Graff, the Tartans put together an 11-play, 59-yard drive that resulted in a 29-yard field goal by senior Tyler Kohman. Kohman’s kick gave the Cardinal and Gray a 3-0 lead with 3:29 to play in the first quarter.
Muhlenberg took a 7-3 lead with 2:43 left in the half after a 49-yard catch and run. The Mules intercepted junior quarterback Cline on the Tartans’ first play of the ensuing possession and took over on the Carnegie Mellon 15-yard line. The Tartans defense held the Mules to a field goal, as the 24-yard boot by made the score 10–3 with 1:21 on the clock.
With seven minutes to play in the third quarter, Muhlenberg extended its lead to 17–3 with a 2-yard run. A 28-yard field goal by Kohman with 1:44 to play in the third put the score at 17–6.
The Mules responded and pushed their lead to 23–6 on the next possession. A nine-play, 79-yard drive was capped off with a 5-yard touchdown run at the 12:35 mark of the fourth quarter. A safety by the Mules and another touchdown run, this time a 2-yard run, left the score at 32–6 with 6:49 to play.
Cline became the school’s single-season passing leader after throwing for 178 yards. The signal caller finished the season with 2,336 yards and passed Andrew Hearon’s mark of 2,201 yards set in 2015.
Junior wide receiver Karl-Mark Kumm had a career-high seven receptions for career-best 80 yards while senior wide receiver John Prather finished with 38 yards and four catches.
Senior running back Sam Benger led the Tartans rushing attack with 70 yards and ends the season with 1,053 yards, becoming the first back in program history to rush for 1,000 yards in three straight seasons.
Benger and Prather both finish their careers as the program’s all-time leader at their respective positions. Benger rushed for 5,376 yards and 59 touchdowns while Prather recorded 3,077 receiving yards and 25 touchdowns.
Defensively, junior cornerback Ethan Anderson led the Tartans with ten tackles, six solo. Graff ended with nine while seniors Stanley Bikulege, Kyle Brittain, and Drew Fitzmorris each finished with seven.
The Tartans finish their season with a record of 7–4 while the Mules end the year with a record of 8–3.
Women’s Cross Country
The Carnegie Mellon women’s cross country team finished 24th in the 2017 NCAA Division III Women’s Cross Country Championships hosted by Principia College in Elsah, IL, on Saturday, Nov. 18. The Tartans were running in the championship race for the fourth time in program history and first time since 1998.
The Tartans finished ahead of University Athletic Association (UAA) counterpart Emory University and ahead of Mideast Regional opponents Elizabethtown College, Haverford College, and Dickinson College.
Senior Aparna Alavilli led the Tartans, finishing 49th overall with a time of 21:46.90. This was her second year in a row competing in the championships, and she placed 60 spots better than her previous record.
Sophomore Abigail Levine crossed second for the team in 22:15.60, finishing 108th. Sophomore Emmalyn Lindsey crossed the finish line next for the Tartans and 119th overall with a time of 22:22.80. Fourth for Carnegie Mellon was sophomore Kate Reilly in 23:17.80.
Following Reilly were first-year Parvathi Meyyappan with a time of 23:35.80 and senior Rhiannon Farney in 23:45.90. Finishing strong for the Tartans was junior Allison Scibisz with a time of 24:23.80.
The memorable season comes to a close with the Tartans also earning fourth-place finishes at the UAA Championship and Mideast Regional, both their best since the 2012 season.
Men’s Cross Country
The Carnegie Mellon men’s cross country team placed 21st at the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships on Saturday, Nov. 18. The meet was hosted by Principia College in Elsah, IL, with North Central College earning the championship title.
Junior Aadi Mhatre was the first Tartan to cross the finish line when he finished the 8k course 83rd overall in 25:24.98. Junior Jared Moore wasn’t far behind as he finished 95th in 25:28.16.
Sophomore Liam Walsh ran the course in 25:46.30 while senior Andrew Harter finished three seconds later and fourth for the Tartans.
Senior Jordan Safer was the fifth Tartan to cross the finish line when he finished 185th overall in 25:56.30.
Also competing in the championship meet were sophomores Evan Yukevich and Josh Kalapos. Yukevich finished in 26:20.92 and Kalapos in 26:46.14.
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team picked up its second 20-plus win of the season on Saturday, Nov. 18 when the Tartans topped Allegheny College, 76–47, in the Allegheny Greg Richards Memorial Classic. The Tartans are now 2–0 for the season while the Gators move to 1–1.
The Tartans were led by sophomore Katharine Higgins who had 20 points and seven rebounds. Joining Higgins in double-digit points was sophomore Makayla Filiere with 15 points and sophomore Laurel Pereira with 14.
The Tartans put together a defensive effort that caused 19 turnovers and held the Gators to 25.0 percent shooting from the field. Higgins had three of the team’s ten steals and the Tartans scored 21 points off of 19 turnovers.
Higgins, who shot 42.9 percent from the floor, opened the game with one of her two three-pointers for the game. The Gators then went on a 14–0 run before Filiere hit a jumper off an assist by junior Jenn Mayberger with half the period still to play. The Tartans then finished the final five minutes with an 11–6 run that they extended to 18–6 through the first 4:48 of the second period.
While the Gators shot 64.3 percent in the first period, they went cold in the second, hitting just one of 13 from the floor and scoring just five points. The Tartans hit seven field goals and shot 41.2 percent from the floor to lead 35–25 at the break.
The Gators would score the first four points of the second half to pull within six points but the Tartans answered with a 15–0 run that began with a layup by sophomore Laura Ochsner. The run put the Tartans up 50–29 with 4:34 to go in the third period.
The Tartans continued to add to their lead, which topped out at 32 when first-year Kylie Huffman drained the team’s eighth three-pointer of the game with 1:46 to play in the game.
Mayberger collected six assists and seven rebounds in the game while playing 37 minutes, as Ochsner scored seven points and grabbed nine rebounds to lead the team.
The Tartans will continue their season on the road Tuesday, Nov. 21 at Bethany College at 4:00 p.m.

This week, I’m back to recap week ten of The Tartan’s fantasy football league. I’m filling in for staffwriter Josh Andah, who scored the least number of points in the league for the week. Save for Andah’s team, all five of the other competitors reached above 100 points. Here are the highlights from the week:
Third-String Team over Yes We Cam 114.5–101
Despite winning this week, my team Third-String Team’s record of 5–5 trails behind Editor-in-Chief India Price’s team Yes We Cam’s record, which now sits at 7–3. Price earned a whopping 35.7 points from Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, by far his best week this season. Despite Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs’s 17.8 points off of 4 catches, 78 yards, and a touchdown, and a solid 15.2 points from Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry (5 catches, 42 yards, and a touchdown), Price’s team was derailed by earning only 0.3 points from Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman before he left his game due to a concussion.
My running back, the Chicago Bears’ Tarik Cohen, also let me down with only 2.1 points, but I managed to get the win this week due to great performances from Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green (22.5 points) and New York Giants tight end Evan Engram (15.1 points). The Los Angeles Rams defense also showed up, adding 16 points.
Drop it like it’s Crock over Team Andah 161.9–56.2
Publisher Jade Crockem predicted correctly in her recap last week that she would get the win over Andah. New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram had his best week of the season with 131 yards on 21 carries and three touchdowns, totaling 31.1 points for Crockem. Wide receivers Adam Thielen of the Vikings and Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals also performed well for Crockem, with 30.6 points and 21.3 points, respectively.
Crockem didn’t need so many players from her lineup to perform as well as they did because two players in Andah’s lineup were on their bye weeks, one is on injured reserve, and another served a suspension during the week. Of the remaining five players, three contributed fewer than ten points apiece. In past weeks, Andah’s completely hands-off approach (read: auto-drafting and never adjusting his lineup) has worked to his advantage, but this week it failed him.
Easy Breesy over Justin Tucker Must (not) Die 131.5–127.3
In the closest matchup of the week, Sports Editor Ian Tanaya topped contributing editor Lula Beresford to stand at the top of the standings next to Price’s team. Tanaya’s team had a great week across the board, but the performances from two of his running backs helped him pull past Beresford. Saints running back Alvin Kamara earned 24.8 points from 106 yards off 12 carries and a touchdown. Tennessee Titans running back DeMarco Murray returned to form, scoring two touchdowns and adding 29.2 points for Tanaya’s team.
Beresford’s team, for the most part, also had a great week, with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady scoring 22.6 points, Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas with 20.7 points, Panthers running back Christian McCafferty adding 20 points, and the Ram’s Greg Zuerlein kicking his way to 17 points. The Denver Broncos defense was the only member of her lineup that had a significantly bad week, with negative three points.
Next week, we have the top two teams Yes We Cam and Easy Breesy facing off. Despite Team Andah’s poor showing this past week, I predict it will rebound against Justin Tucker Must (not) Die; the last time the teams played each other they tied. The final matchup is my team versus Drop it like it’s Crock, which stands in my way to getting above .500 for the first time.

The men’s basketball team opened the season at home against La Roche College on Friday night, falling 71–64.
Three Tartans turned in 11-point performances as senior guard Ryan Maha, junior forward and guard Seth Henry, and sophomore guard Colin McNeil led the team, which shot 43.9 percent from the floor. The Tartans held the Redhawks to a 36.4 percent effort from the floor but were out-rebounded 53–31. Maha dished out five assists, tying his career high.
First-year guard Zach Watson made his first shot of the game, a three-pointer, to put the Tartans up 9–6 before a three-pointer by the Redhawks tied the game with 12:49 to play in the first half. The Tartans then scored nine straight points over a two-minute span to take an 18–9 lead. First-year forward Daniel Weiss hit a three-pointer at the end of the run.
The Redhawks went on an 11–1 run to take the lead at 20–19 with seven minutes to play in the half. The lead changed hands four times before the half ended with the Redhawks leading 28–26.
Henry hit the opening bucket of the second half to tie the game for the sixth time before McNeil converted a layup to give the Tartans back the lead, 30–28. The teams traded buckets until the Redhawks took the lead for good on a three-pointer with 10:04 to play in the game. That three-pointer broke up the 12th tie of the contest and sparked a 9–2 run that put the visitors ahead 53–46.
The Tartans pulled to within one point after a layup by sophomore forward Trent Suddeth and a layup by McNeil with 2:33 to play but the Redhawks scored on a jumper in the paint and the Redhawks hit 6-of-8 from the line to keep the lead and win by seven.
The Tartans will next face Bethany College on Tuesday, Nov. 21 at 6 p.m.

The women’s basketball team opened the season with a 75–47 victory against Fredonia State University of New York at the Allegheny College Greg Richards Memorial Classic on Friday.
Leading the Tartans was sophomore guard Laurel Pereira with a career-best 20 points. Sophomore forward Katharine Higgins and sophomore guard Makayla Filiere also scored in the double digits with 15 points apiece while first-year forward Kylie Huffman put in 11 points in her first outing in a Tartan uniform. Higgins also pulled down ten rebounds for her first double-double of the season, tying her career best in the category. Filiere grabbed a career-best seven boards and Pereira tied her career-best with five rebounds.
The Tartans led 23–10 after the first quarter behind nine points from Pereira. The sophomore guard put in seven straight during the quarter for the Tartans, who held the Blue Devils to no points for the first three minutes of the game.
Higgins hit the last basket of the quarter for the Tartans and opened the second with another bucket on her way to 10 first-half points. The Tartans extended their 13-point first-quarter lead to a 19-point lead by the break, leading 40–21 at halftime.

Bees and butterflies are experiencing widespread population decline, creating public concern in recent years. Data collected in Germany suggest that it’s not just bees and butterflies at risk: insect populations overall have plummeted by more than 75 percent since 1989. Scientists have known about the population decline for several years. However, they didn’t know how many species were declining, and they didn’t expect it to be happening so fast.
The insect population data comes from a group in Germany called the Krefeld Entomological Society. The Krefeld Society, whose members are mostly amateur entomologists, has been collecting data on insect populations since the 1980s in 63 different nature preserves. The members travel to a given spot every few years to set up an insect trap: essentially, a fabric tent suspended above a jar of alcohol. The insects fly into the tent and can’t fly out. While they’re trapped in the tent, the rising vapor from the alcohol below gradually inebriates them, and they drop into the jar. The Krefeld Society can then catalog the number, type, and weight of the collected insects.
The fact that they collect any species that flies into the trap is what makes this study so important. It’s rare to find numbers on the population trends of most insects. While researchers have kept fairly consistent tabs on iconic insects like monarch butterflies and honey bees, “we have a pretty good track record of ignoring most noncharismatic species,” says Joe Nocera, an ecologist at the University of New Brunswick. Because the Krefeld Society isn’t focused on any one kind of insect, they can look at the big picture.
Based on this study, the big picture for insects looks grim. While the Krefeld Society is still working on cataloging the species in their collection, and don’t yet know all the details, they do know the biomass of each catch (the combined weight of all the insects). They found that since 1989, insect biomass has gone down by over 75 percent.  This number — far larger than expected — has left the scientific community reeling. “If we lose insects we’re doomed,” says Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex in the U.K. “I know this sounds overly dramatic, but we absolutely are. Life on Earth would be utterly changed. We wouldn’t be able to grow our crops. Dung would build up in the fields. Life on Earth would essentially cease. So, we absolutely have to take this really seriously.”
It’s hard to figure out what can be done to solve the problem of insect disappearance without knowing what’s making the insects disappear in the first place. In the Krefeld study, the Krefeld Society members worked with scientists at German universities to analyze their data, examining several factors like the changes in weather and local plant life. No simple correlations have been revealed, suggesting that multiple complex factors are causing the population decline.
One factor is likely the way that land is being used. All the data in the Krefeld study was collected from protected nature areas, but the surrounding land can play a factor in how well the nature preserve can support insect species. (Insects, which travel frequently, don’t pay attention to the boundary between the preserve and private land.) 
When fields are fertilized to make better grazing land, wildflowers (which insects need) are replaced by grasses. When towns and urban areas replace fields, the lights confuse nocturnal insects and disrupt their mating. “We’ve lost huge amounts of habitat, which has certainly contributed to all these declines,” Goulson says. “If we turn all the seminatural habitats to wheat and cornfields, then there will be virtually no life in those fields.”
In agricultural areas, the use of pesticides has also contributed to the decline of insects. Decades ago, when pesticides like DDT were exposed as poisonous, they were replaced by safer alternatives: safer for humans, but with lethal effects for insects.  Neonicotinoid pesticides, introduced in the 1980s when the Krefeld Society began their study, are considered safer for humans than many alternatives because they are applied to seeds before planting rather than to growing crops.
However, they have disastrous effects on insects. When bees are exposed to these insecticides, they become less able to navigate and communicate with other bees. In wasps, neonicotinoid exposure cuts mating rates in half. Neonicotinoids have already been revealed as a major culprit in the declining population of bees and other pollinators. Because neonicotinoids dissolve in water so easily, rainwater can carry them far away from farm fields. 
In meadows adjacent to agricultural areas, flowers produce pollen and nectar that contains more neonicotinoids than the crops the insecticides were intended for, Goulson and his colleagues showed in 2015. Despite the fact that they are demonstrably harmful, neonicotinoids are the most commonly used insecticides today.
The decline of insects is a problem that needs to be taken very, very seriously. 
Almost our entire agricultural system depends on insects to pollinate plants so that they can produce fruits, vegetables, and seeds. If we have no insects, we will not be able to grow food.
We aren’t the only ones who will suffer if insects go. Researchers have already connected insects’ decreasing numbers to the population declines of starlings in North America. Birds, reptiles, amphibians — any species that depends on insects for food will start to die out, and anything that eats those animals will take losses. The biodiversity of the entire world is at stake.
The fact that we’ve apparently lost 75 percent of insect biomass in less than 30 years makes that future seem a lot closer than anyone would have guessed. 
But how accurate is the 75 percent figure? It’s hard to say. This study took place in a single country, and the measurements weren’t as regular as the members would have liked. 
Because comprehensive data on insect populations is so rare, there aren’t many datasets from other parts of the world to compare it to. However, the studies on bees and butterflies,  as well as smaller-scale studies in England and the U.S., seem to tell a similar story. 
In light of this data, the Krefeld Society has immediate plans to make sure their data collection is as thorough and accurate as possible. They plan to install a “biodiversity weather station” that can consistently monitor the presence of species in a nature preserve, with seven automated components. 
It includes a pollen collector, a ‘sky scanner’ to spot birds, bats, and flying insects, and a sound recorder to listen for frog, bird, and insect calls. They are also planning to continue their traditional insect collections at more frequent intervals. Though the exact magnitude of insect population decline is uncertain, scientists are certain that it’s happening. 
While there are strategies that might slow it —such as putting restrictions on pesticide use — “they all require buy-in from significant numbers of people,” Goulson says. “One or two environmentalists like me banging on isn’t going to do anything. We need the majority of people on Earth to change their ways, and that’s a pretty difficult thing to achieve.”

On Nov. 6, Jamie M. Caldwell, a disease ecologist at Stanford University, and her colleagues published a paper titled “Intra-colony disease progression induces fragmentation of coral fluorescent pigments” in Scientific Reports. The paper describes a relatively new technique called live-imaging laser scanning confocal microscopy and its applications in better understanding the health of corals.
Coral fluorescence — the ability of corals to glow in shades of red, blue or green under some light wavelengths, is a common yet poorly understood phenomenon. 
Corals contain fluorescent proteins that possibly allow it to perform photosynthesis better by using light that would otherwise be unusable. This phenomenon helps absorb the sun’s ultraviolet rays and reflect it back to the symbiotic organisms so the they can photosynthesize under insufficient sunlight. Some scientists also suggest that this fluorescent helps protect the coral ecosystem from the harsh rays of the sun.
The researchers along with Caldwell, say that coral fluorescence is a “potentially powerful non-invasive intrinsic marker of coral disease”. Previous research suggests that stressors such as heat and wounding affects coral fluorescent pigments, but this study is the first to suggest a relationship between coral infectious disease and fluorescent pigments. The research studied the difference between fluorescent pigment distribution in healthy and diseased living samples of Montipora capitata coral — commonly known as rice coral or pore coral. it is a type of reef coral typically found in Hawaii. The diseased sample in this case was artificially created, by infecting it with the Montipora white syndrome — bacterial infection that causes tissue loss.
While comparing, the scientists found that the two coral samples looked similar on a macroscopic level. However, after observing closely, they found that the sick sample had lost fluorescence and the distribution of the fluorescent pigments was a lot more scattered and disorganized. In fact, according to an article on Science News, the healthy coral had 1.2 times more florescence area as compared to the diseased coral.
Drew Harwell, a disease ecologist at Cornell University says in the article that research in this field, “is transormative in our struggle to visualize the dance between pathogen attack and host response in the initial attack.“ 
This type of coral is very dependent on the organisms called zooxanthellae that live inside it. The temperature of the sea chases out these organisms, leaving the coral colorless and susceptible to disease. Corals die very quickly after that. As habitat destruction and global warming wipes out reef corals at an alarming rate, research like this is a step forward in organizing better conservation efforts.

In an era where drug overdose deaths are the leading cause of injury and death in the United States, the abuse and misuse of opioids is a growing, alarming public health issue — namely, the “opioid crisis”. According to the United States Health and Human Services, 12.5 million people misused prescription opioids in 2015 alone, 2.1 million of those being first-time offenders. Clearly, this is a dangerous social problem that doesn’t seem easy to prevent. The government has been trying to tackle this issue since the late 1990s, but there are few solutions with much scientific proof or potential.
Suboxone, a relatively mild opioid containing a combination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an effective treatment of opioid addiction in 2002. Patients undergoing treatment take daily doses of Suboxone either in the form of strips that dissolve on the tongue or tablets to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Although much more expensive, this is preferred to another addiction medication known as methadone because it can be prescribed by primary doctors, and does not require specially licensed clinics.
Vivitrol is a relatively new form of addiction medication approved by the FDA only in 2010. This injection of nalextrone that blocks the effects of opioids is to be taken once a month, as its effects last slightly over 28 days. According to Alkermes, it is by far the most expensive opioid addiction treatment substance, costing $500 per shot through Medicaid and $1000 through private insurance. Despite its high cost, Vivitrol has been supported and encouraged by Alkermes as an alternative for Suboxone, as many people view Suboxone as simply substituting a deadly opioid (heroin) with another addictive but less dangerous opioid (Suboxone itself.) 
A study comparing these two forms of addiction treatment medication was published in The Lancet on Tuesday. Led by Dr. Joshua D. Lee of the New York University School of Medicine, this was the largest study so far to directly compare the effectiveness Vivitrol with that of Suboxone. 
The study was conducted with 570 adults, most addicted to heroin, and found that 52 percent of those who were under Vivitrol relapsed throughout the span of the 24-week study. This is a number only slightly lower than the 56 percent of patients that relapsed under Suboxone in the same study. 
While discovering the potential of Vivitrol to become a more widespread form of treatment for opioid addicts in the nation, the study also revealed a fatal flaw of Vivitrol. This not only makes the results of the study much more difficult to interpret but also speaks to the limitations of Vivitrol itself as a treatment substance. A large number of participants were not even able to start treatment with Vivitrol because a detox period (complete abstention from drug use) of three days to one week is required for its consumption. According to Stat News, patients failed to start on Vivitrol at four times the rate that they did Suboxone because of this difficult barrier to beginning treatment.
“It’s going to take a few days or a week or more to get them on naltrexone in the first place,” said Dr. Lee. “And that detox hurdle does not exist for buprenorphine or Suboxone.” However, the research still does encourage medical professionals and treatment providers to offer both medications, as relapse rates are significantly higher if patients don’t get onto and continue a medication. 
The bottom line is that both forms of medication should be widely available and readily offered to patients suffering opioid addiction. Now that the effectiveness and safety precautions of both Suboxone and Vivitrol have been studied in depth and published, we have taken a step forward to treat this huge public health issue. Perhaps it was because of the lack of such evidence and research in the past that led to severe under-treatment of the opioid epidemic.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked operations for Bhangra in the Burgh twice and only seen the show in segments, between flapping doors and late-
arriving spectators. This year, however, I was determined to grab a seat and really take in the whole experience, and boy was it worth it.
Bhangra in the Burgh is a completely student-run Bhangra competition hosted by students at Carnegie Mellon University. Under the guidance of juniors Nandini Radhakrishnan and Isha Laad, who co-directed this year’s show, a team of more than 20 executive board members and even more operations volunteers took the year to create a truly incredible program. This year’s program benefited the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation, specifically their inspiring Creative and Expressive Arts Therapy program.
Every year, eight teams arrive to compete for first, second, and third place. This year, the eleventh iteration of the event, teams hailed from Canada, the West Coast, the Tri-State Area, Detroit, North Carolina, and, of course, Pittsburgh. The line-up this year featured many past champions, such as last year’s reigning champs Anakh E Gabroo, from the Tri-State Area. The full line up was as follows: Anakh E Gabroo (Tri-State Area), Cal Bhangra (UC Berkeley), First Class Bhangra (Pittsburgh, PA), Furteelay (Detroit, MI), Nachdi Jawani Ankhiley (Ontario, Canada), Nachde Shokeen Gabroo (Bay Area, CA), UNC Bhangra (UNC Chapel Hill), and Royal Academy – Royal Queens (Canada).
Teams were judged on their formations, vadiya (attire), mix (music and lights), synchronization, and creativity. As a result, every performance was intricately crafted and packed with energy. Of the eight teams that performed five were all male and two were all female. Each brought an interesting twist to the table. While some groups pretended to leave the stage, only to come back with an even more exciting finale, others climbed on each other’s shoulders and brought other dance forms into their Bhangra performances. The costumes were bursting with color and shimmer, and no dancer graced the stage without the signature Bhangra smile that we’ve come to know and love.
Despite a few technical difficulties throughout the evening, the show was held together well by the emcees, seniors Piyush Puri and Rohan Shah. Both Puri and Shah kept the audience chuckling with an ongoing gag about the miraculous Vicks Vaporub and numerous impromptu dance battles. Constant allusions to the “bio-data”-hungry aspect of Indian-American match-making culture gave both the students and parents in the audience a good laugh. 
Other entertainment of the evening included Carnegie Mellon’s own all-female south Asian a cappella group, Saans, and Infra Dance Company. The University of Pittsburgh’s classical dance troupe, Pitt Nrityamala, also took the stage, as did the nine to thirteen years olds of the Nandanik Dance Academy. The show was, of course, sealed off with a power-packed performance by CMU Bhangra while the judges decided the winner.
While all the teams danced valiantly, there could be only three winners. Here was the final decision:
Winners:
1. Nachde Shokeen Gabroo (Bay Area, CA)
2. First Class Bhangra (Pittsburgh, PA)
3. Anakh E Gabroo (Tri-State Area)

I love churches. The history, the architecture, the stained glass, the ambiance. What can I say, I’m a bit obsessed. So when I found out there was a microbrewery in a former Catholic Church, it was only a matter of time before I ended up grabbing a drink at The Church Brew Works.
The location: Situated between Polish Hill and Lawrenceville, Church Brew Works is a bit of a hike from campus. The 54 from Craig St. and Winthrop St. is your best bet, or a combination of the 61B and 87 or 71 and 86. Once you’re finally there, there’s plenty to do. The church is on Liberty Ave., so the restaurants and bars of Penn Ave. are a short walk away.
The drinks: I don’t like beer, so a microbrewery was a bit of a weird move for me. But it paid off big time. We tried two of their seasonal draft beers: Count Dankula and Oats McOats. Count Dankula is a bright red color that earns its name. Oats McOats is a beer for beer haters like me. It has a smooth, hoppy taste that means business but isn’t too bitter. They also have a couple more seasonal offerings, including a spiced Christmas Ale and a Jack Skellington Imp Pumpkin Stout if you’re not ready to let go of the Halloween spirit and jump on the Christmas bandwagon just yet.
The bar also has food offerings and a restaurant section on one side of the aisle if you’re feeling a bit more upscale. However, the food prices are steep, more in a parent’s budget than a college student’s. 
The vibe: The vibe very much depends on how you feel about having a bar in a church, because it most definitely is a church. The Church Brew Works team isn’t shy about the somewhat sacrilegious nature of their endeavor. Core draft brews include Celestial Gold and Pious Monk Dunkel, and the first thing you see when you walk in are massive steel and copper tanks for beer brewing on the high altar.
However, there is no denying that the space is gorgeous, and it was abandoned for three years and in disrepair before the Church Brew Works owners restored it in 1996. Now, the beautiful architecture is being maintained and the history of the parish is being remembered, so something good came of the conversion. 
The Church Brew Works is hardly a rowdy nightclub full of hedonistic sin (luckily there are plenty of other places for that in Pittsburgh). The crowd is older, and the vibe is quiet and relaxed. It’s the kind of place where you grab a quality beer with a friend or two.
Lit or Nah: I am going to go with Nah. It doesn’t have the energy to be a place to start or end a night out, and it’s too far and too gimmicky to be a comfortable, neighborhood bar for a weeknight drink with a friend. It’s worth a visit at least once for the good beer and the experience, but I’d say once is enough unless you’re a beer fanatic.

Fleshy pomegranate carcasses and a shrine to a breast-shaped void are the centerpieces of undergraduate artist Darya Kharabi’s solo show No Different from Your Other at Carnegie Mellon’s Ellis Gallery. Playing with the sacred, damned, and macabre, Kharabi’s work explores the dark history of women and medicine. Matter-of-fact recordings of dehumanizing and horrifying past treatments for breast cancer are paired with drawings and paintings that line the walls of the gallery.
No Different from Your Other is a beautiful show that marries research and various mediums to create a complex yet clear story about women in history. Without being didactic, the show brought to light these tragic and horrifying pieces of medical history. Kharabi writes about historic practices of mastectomies before the science was where it is today — the insertion of hooks and the severing of nerves allude to the tendency of medicine to ignore women’s voices as patients. Using a color palette of fleshy pinks, burgundy reds, and sickly greens, these surrealist pieces combine imagery and text from medical journals with heavily stylized figurative drawing that build a chronology of instances in the history of treating, or not treating, breast cancer.
The show is also successful in its contradictions. On the one hand, this show is a space to hold the pain of women throughout history. Yet on the other, despite this fact, the show leans into the dehumanizing nature of medical practices. There are no identifiable women subjects of this story, the drawings of women, although beautiful and intricate, either allude to physiological diagrams or display an abstracted and distorted woman. The absence of an overt female subject emphasizes the invisibility of women in medical literature, but these figures keep the viewer grounded in the perspective of a female narrator.
The narrative Kharabi presents is clearly from a clinical perspective but is also contextualized by heavy religious references. The pomegranates and grapefruits reference the fall of Eve but also the human body; the entire show is set up like a holy space. The relationship of science, medicine, and religion is complex, and we see the lasting effects of that even today in our system for women’s healthcare. The confusion of untangling the relationship between these institutions with body politics and self-perception is central to Kharabi’s work. In some of the pieces, the role of religiosity enshrines misogyny and negligence in the medical fields. In others, however, it turns the unnamed woman into martyrs and provides the basis for the pieces that allude to the reclamation of the female body.
A black form shaped like a bullet or a breast appears as a monolith in several of the pieces. It works as a void that represents perhaps the breast or its removal, as well as the removal of the agency of women around their own bodies in these cultural and medical spaces. It is the centerpiece of the show. A wreath of twigs turns the absence of women from medical knowledge into a holy tragedy. The void of the monolith and the holy space of the entire show allows for a space to grieve for the women who suffered for the sake of science. This show’s source of power is the pairing of sadness with rage. Most present in the final piece that contains a poem sentencing an unknown other “enrobed in [their] own ignorance” to hell, these works are also a direct expression of anger.
This past year, news outlets from Teen Vogue to The New York Times have become hyper-aware of women’s anger, claiming that we as a society have never seen women become so publicly angry as they are right now. In the past month alone, with the slew of sexual harassment charges and attacks on women’s health care, has been a trying time for women. We’ve also seen the ways women have learned how to channel and express anger in a culture that teaches women that they aren’t allowed to hold this emotion. In No Different from Your Other, we see the exploration of a specific piece of scientific history built into our cultural understanding of women and their bodies with pieces that work frustration and pain in academic and artistic language. Given this broader social context, the work of artists like Kharabi are important and brave.
It is, therefore, also important that we listen to the women speaking out about injustice in their lives and our world. Often, the changes we see in the world come from youth culture and college campuses. And so, although the Ellis Gallery may feel separate from the professionalism of formal galleries, it is vital that we take participate and consume the expression of young artists on college campuses. The most important takeaway from these articles is that our student artists are preserving the values and questions our students are holding about our society, and will ultimately determine what direction progress is pushed towards. Keep an eye out for the work of Kharabi and the artists working in these spaces — their voices are a force to be reckoned with.

It’s never too early to get into the holiday spirit. The city of Pittsburgh makes that clear every year when it hosts Comcast Light Up Night. During Light Up Night, all of downtown is decorated with beautiful lights and Christmas trees, Market Square is transformed into a little holiday-themed village, and live musical performances take place down by the bridges. 
It’s a wonderful event to attend with friends and family that will definitely help set the mood for the holidays. If you’re planning on attending Light Up Night in the coming years, I have a few tips on how to make the most of your experience, since this was my second time going:
Check the schedule of events ahead of time
Starting at 11:30 a.m., different holiday-themed events take place all over downtown Pittsburgh. You’ll usually find the tree-lighting ceremonies occur in the morning, while all the live musical 
performances and fireworks happen at night. Downtown can get really crowded on this day, making it a bit difficult to navigate through the city. It’ll make things a lot easier for you if you know all the event locations and how much time it takes to get from one place to the next.
Dress warm for the weather
Nobody really knows what to expect when it comes to Pittsburgh weather. However, in my Light Up Night experiences, it has been pretty cold both years. Wearing a big jacket, scarf, hat (they usually give out Santa hats, but they won’t keep you very warm), and comfortable shoes is ideal.
Book a reservation for a restaurant downtown way in advance, or eat before going
Almost every restaurant my friends and I passed by was packed. We made reservations to Sienna Mercato about a week before Light Up Night, so we were able to eat there. But even when we were making the reservations, we saw that many other restaurants were already booked, so be sure to reserve spots about two to three weeks in advance. Generally, I find most food places downtown to be pricier, so eating at home or somewhere else beforehand isn’t a bad idea either.
Find some time for ice skating
Every year around this time, PPG Place opens their ice skating rink to the public, where people can skate around a giant Christmas tree. It doesn’t cost too much, and it’s a great opportunity for you and your friends to have fun and possibly try something new. If you decide to go skating, I do warn you to wear long socks because deep ankle blisters are definitely not fun to have.
Embrace spontaneity
Not knowing what to expect during Light Up Night can result in a very fulfilling experience. Although planning your trip ahead of time can make things more convenient for you as you explore the city, the spontaneity can add a lot of excitement. 
For example, my friends and I knew that singer Andy Grammer was performing this year, we just didn’t know where and at what time. As we were walking downtown, we began to hear him singing his song “Honey, I’m Good.” My friends and I followed the sound of his voice and ran to the area where he was performing. We even got great spots to take pictures of him on stage. Generally, when it comes to Light Up Night in Pittsburgh, there’s really no harm in not knowing what’s going on and where things are all happening. The downtown area isn’t too big, so it’s not too hard to locate certain events. Just being in the center of all the Pittsburgh holiday excitement makes a very worthwhile experience.

Few authors have had as global an impact as Isabel Allende, a writer with over 20 works published in 30 languages. Not only do Allende’s works reach a global audience, but they also appeal to universal human experiences and emotions. A distinguished writer and speaker, she made a perfect addition to Pittsburgh Arts and Lectures’ Ten Evenings, a series of author lectures meant to “create community through the literary arts.” As in her writing, Allende shared valuable and heartfelt lessons during her talk at Carnegie Music Hall. These lessons covered how to be a better writer, American citizen, and person overall. Through dialogue, Allende honestly divulged her thoughts on political controversies, the refugee experience, the necessity of grief, and the joy of falling in love no matter one’s age. Intelligent, charming, and bitingly funny, Allende is the elegant mentor we’ve all been looking for.
While Allende spoke on many subjects, this particular visit to Pittsburgh was in support of her new novel, In the Midst of Winter. The novel follows a group of three individuals who, through a chance encounter, are brought out of their personal traumas and into the light. After undergoing a divorce and a series of tragedies herself, including the deaths of various friends, her agent, and her beloved dog, Allende found herself feeling as though “nothing good was ever going to happen.” In the midst of that sorrowful period, she discovered a quote by Albert Camus that reads, “in the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.” And thus, Allende began to write in hopes that she and her characters would make it through the long, cold winter to their invincible summers.
The characters are clearly informed by Allende’s own experiences, in particular, the story of Evelyn Ortega, a Guatemalan immigrant fleeing a violent past. Allende is deeply familiar with the political turmoil of Latin America and its impact on daily life. She herself fled Chile following the coup in 1973 and has a deep understanding of life as an immigrant. She is also involved in the work of the Isabel Allende Foundation, an organization that strives to end violence towards and exploitation of women and girls. Many women who receive aid from the foundation have shared their stories with Allende, and one such story became the inspiration for Evelyn’s journey.
As for the other two characters, Lucia and Richard, their story depicts the experience of falling in love at an older age. A romance between older characters is rare in popular literature, but the idea of finding love and expressing one’s sexuality later in life is very important to Allende. New love has recently made its way into Allende’s life, in the form of an email correspondence with a man who reached out to the author after hearing her on a radio show. On their first date, (which happened after five months of emailing each other every day) Allende didn’t hold back in asking, “What are your intentions? I’m 74 years old, I don’t have time to waste!”
It was with this same frankness and intensity that Allende approached audience questions submitted later in the night. Questions ranged from, “How do you stay so beautiful?” (to which Allende laughingly replied, “money”) to more serious questions such as, “How can we solve the refugee crises going on all over the world?” While Allende openly admitted she did not have a final answer for such a complex problem, she offered what insight she could. She urged audience members to look at each statistic related to immigration and refugees not as a number but as a person with a name and a story. Allende believes we need to make an effort to understand the reasons people have for leaving and recognize both how difficult it is to leave one’s home and how perilous that journey to a new place can be. “It’s not about building a wall,“ said Allende. “It’s about supporting efforts to improve conditions in countries of origin. It’s about understanding that no one wants to leave their home and that we are all people.”
Allende then went on to share her writing wisdom. The question, “Does everyone have a story?” led to some interesting truths about both fiction and real life. While the author admitted that some people are in fact, boring, it’s all about the way you tell that person’s story. On the other end of the spectrum, Allende admitted that sometimes you have to water down reality instead of building it up. According to Allende, “the first duty of a fiction writer is to trap the reader,” but sometimes reality is too horrific to keep a reader invested and the truth must be diluted into something more manageable.
Allende is no stranger to hard times and hard truths. She has experienced two divorces, the loss of her daughter, years of displacement and many other trials. Through her work, she has encountered individuals with truly heartbreaking stories and unimaginable losses, and as a writer, she carries those stories with her always. Allende speaks with the kind of confidence and omniscience that can only come from knowing the pain and making it through to the other side. When the audience addressed Allende’s life experiences, she was not afraid to acknowledge them. In fact, she announced that each negative and painful event in our lives must be acknowledged and they must be lived in order for times of joy to be so powerful. Our sorrows and pains are just a part of the narrative, but they’re not who the characters are. That attitude is what tied the entire night together.
The final question of the night asked, “With all that’s going on in the world, what gives you hope?”
Allende’s response: “Everything. Everything gives me hope.”
And there lies the power of Isabel Allende and her stories, to push through the pain to find the joy, to acknowledge loss to find new love, and to wait out the winter until the dawn of that invincible summer.

Compōs-it Opera, a collaborative showcase of original student work, premiered two new operas last Friday in the Cohon Center Studio Theatre. 
The evening of performances began with Bowl of Small Hands, an expressionist exploration of a tormented young woman seeking refuge. Senior BHA student in music technology and technical writing Joshua Brown wrote and composed the opera as part of his capstone, a cumulative project that BXA students complete during their senior year. 
Jacqueline Tardanico (CFA ’18) exhibited raw emotion in the role of Cherry, a woman who realizes “the boundaries between what is real and what is not... are becoming porous.” Visually compelling set design by sophomore drama major Katherine Sharpless, paired with Brown’s mesmerizing orchestrations, placed the audience directly in Cherry’s mind, while stage direction by sophomore drama major Rachel Pospisil effectively used movement to show the control exercised by Cherry’s inner demons.
The next performance was Suburban Mompera, a contemporary take on the classical Faustian narrative. This was the first composition by senior music major Russel H. Holbert, who wrote the score that underlies Brown’s libretto. 
The audience was fully engaged with Suburban Mompera from the start, when housewives Pam, Shelby, and Mindy reveal their longing for a life beyond mommy blogs and PTA meetings. The opera successfully blended comedy and emotion, weaving hilarious one-liners with fully-realized backstories and excellent characterization. 
Holbert created the opera as part of his requirements for Fifth Year Scholars, a university-sponsored fellowship that funds an additional year of study for students who wish to launch impactful projects on campus. Holbert hoped Compōs-it Opera would provide the Carnegie Mellon community with music “by the students, for the students” and expose the audience to contemporary opera. 
Overall, the team behind Compōs-it Opera admirably took risks and forged partnerships from all corners of the university. “If there’s something I know how to do, it’s start something I don’t know how to do,” said Brown. 
“Throughout the process, there was a lot of magic and luck.” Holbert and Brown clearly have a strong collaborative relationship and Compōs-it Opera promises continued growth and achievement in any future work they may embark on.

**Hey Ruth!
Last week you wrote about ways to talk to your family about your major, which is great, but what about, like, everything else?
What I mean is — I find holidays with family exhausting. Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing everyone and celebrating, and the excuse to do nothing all day is amazing, but in reality, I don’t actually end up doing “nothing.” My aunts and uncles are always asking me to watch my younger cousins and I just cannot be responsible for six different kids, even if I am related to all of them.
I’m also finding more and more as I grow up, that being at the level of holiday cheerfulness and engagement that’s expected of me is getting more difficult. I don’t know if I could be around anyone for eight hours straight and be up for a conversation about my/their life at any point. I don’t think I’m a Grinch or anything, but sometimes I just want to take a break.
Quit the Useless, Intrusive, Endless Talking. People Like Silence.** 
Dear QUIET PLS ,
The good news is that you’re definitely not a Grinch. Well, you might be, but not because of this. Trust me when I say it’s a nearly universal experience to get sick of your relatives during holiday visits. Just look at every holiday comedy ever made. I do recognize that knowing that everyone else is suffering with you is less useful as a practical solution, though I find it emotionally helpful, so let’s talk about how to tell people “no.” Because that is, ultimately, what you’re going to have to do.
It can be extremely difficult to say no in this kind of situation. We’re more or less trained to automatically love our family because they’re blood, and as any such indication of disagreement or declining what they’ve asked of you can be read as impolite or rude. And when you’re already trying to mediate between these people who you do love, but can definitely get on each other’s nerves, one little “no” can feel like the breaking point. Maybe it’s not your responsibility to make sure everything goes well when people are visiting, but it’s just much easier to deal with all of it than have everyone explode, right?
Is it, though? You sound as if acquiescing to everyone’s requests is already beating you and your level of enjoyment down. But it’s only every so often, and dealing with the fallout would be so much worse, maybe. I honestly don’t know — you’re the only one who can judge yourself and your family situation. But part of growing up is learning how to set boundaries and actually enforce them, so I’m generally in support of saying “no” even when you’re not sure how it will go. And honestly? If your relatives are the type of people to explode the moment you don’t agree to everything they ask, I think you should start learning how to say “no” real soon.
If the hard, blunt “no” is still intimidating, I’d recommend building in a way to give a “soft no” if needed. Basically, find something that will give you a way out of babysitting or conversation without explicitly turning someone down. Go help in the kitchen, or have work you need to do (don’t we all), or even just go for a walk. I’m sure it gets just as stuffy at your house as it does at mine, and going out by yourself or with a family member whose company you know you enjoy is a good way to get a break and clear your head. You can’t be full of holiday cheer if you’re full of frustration, so take care of yourself.
Have a wonderful time of the year,
Ruth

In the United States, as one of the first countries founded on the basis of democratically electing government officials, the practice of gerrymandering, defined as drawing election districts in a way that favors one political party over another, is almost as old as the country itself, starting with some of the first elections in this country. In 1788, Patrick Henry and his Anti-Federalist allies tried to draw districts in such a way to keep James Madison out of the U.S. House of Representatives, although they were unsuccessful.
More recently, the GOP has increasingly been criticized for using sophisticated algorithms to draw districts in such a way that heavily favors their own party, using methods such as packing minority voters (who tend to vote Democratic) in as few districts as possible, or splitting opponents’ voters into as many districts as possible so the opponents are in the minority. Currently, the Supreme Court is in the midst of a case related to Wisconsin’s redistricting practices that some have criticized as unconstitutional.
In order to alleviate this problem, some states have hired independent commissions to draw districts. But Carnegie Mellon researchers see another solution without involving independent commissions. Ariel Proccacia, associate professor of computer science, and Wesley Pegden, associate professor of mathematics, recently submitted a paper detailing an algorithm using computational social choice theory to ensure fair division, research that was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Sloan Foundation and the Office of Naval Research, according to a university press release.
The algorithm can be thought of as an extension of the method children use to divide a cake into two — one child cuts the cake in half while the other child takes his or her preferred piece, reducing envy. Applied to gerrymandering, the algorithm would entail having one party divide up the districts, then having the other party choosing one district to “freeze” — or finalize so that no one can subsequently change it — and re-mapping the remaining districts according to its preferences, and so on until all the districts are “frozen”.
In their paper, Proccacia, Pegden, and Dingli Yu, a visiting student from China’s Tsinghua University, detailed a mathematical proof of why this division protocol puts both parties on equal footing.
“If one party attempts to pack districts, for instance, the other party can simply not choose to freeze a packed district [one where specific concentrations of voters are packed into a district]. And because that party can then re-map the districts to eliminate the packing, the first party would not get the opportunity to freeze a packed district either,” details a university press release regarding the intuition behind the fairness of the algorithm.
In an interview with The Tartan, Pegden detailed the motivation behind the project and why he and the team wanted to apply cake-cutting techniques in particular. “The mathematics of fair division is all about leveraging competition between two sides to get a fair outcome; cake cutting is the classic example. If we want to be able to draw fair districts and we don’t know how to find truly independent agents, then fair division algorithms were a natural thing to aim for,” explained Pegden, who had previously done research on detecting gerrymandering.
Proccacia saw gerrymandering as a natural extension of the ideas behind cake-cutting. “The viewpoint [behind cake-cutting] seems natural in the context of redistricting (replacing ‘good’ with ‘state’), as we would like to see the two parties interact in a way that gives rise to a districting both sides perceive as fair,” said Proccacia.
Pegden and Proccacia’s goal is that ultimately, states will adopt this protocol as their method of redistricting. They hope to promote this method through more press coverage and start a grassroots national conversation surrounding fair redistricting techniques.

We have a tendency to think of data as concrete, as being something that communicates some kind of exact and empirical truth, just because we have found a way to quantify the world around us. However, communicating the uncertainties that come with every dataset is one of the challenges that purveyors of data journalism face today. Mona Chalabi, Data Editor for The Guardian US, has found one way to convey this uncertainty: with illustrations that allow people to both connect and engage with data, but also to not overly state its precision.
In a talk last Sunday at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Chalabi outlined her process when it comes to presenting issues through data. This talk was one of the many events centered around data and its usage hosted by the Carnegie Library over the past months.
The Department of Statistics and Data Science at the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences is one of the fastest growing departments at Carnegie Mellon University, with the number of undergraduate statistics majors being more than 20 times what it was in 2003. This uptick was attributed to the fact that the department focuses on “problems that are real,” as stated by Professor Rebecca Nugent, director of undergraduate studies.
These “real problems” are Mona Chalabi’s job. She began her talk by talking about the myriad issues she had covered during her work as a journalist, bringing up that “whichever of those issues you care about, and hopefully you care about at least one of them, with both data and design skills you can try to make sure that other people care about those issues too.” She outlined the capacity for data visualizations to engage people with different viewpoints, hoping that when the talk was over “that whatever it is that you are interested in, you leave with a bit of insight into how to communicate your knowledge to other people, maybe even people that are totally different to you.”
She also cited spreading knowledge about statistics and data usage as part of the mission of her journalism, hoping that her reporting will leave readers empowered to fact check. She states, “When you read something, it’s okay to feel skeptical.” However, she also emphasized that “it’s important to channel that skepticism into action and test this stuff for yourself. And in order to do that, it’s important that as many citizens as possible have these skills to be able to do that research.”
This commitment to careful and ethical data usage lends transparency and another layer to her work. “Mona commits to transparency at every step along the way by sharing her sources, collaborating with her followers through live streams and comments, and editing her art based on feedback. By providing a window to her methodology, Mona allows her audience to fully engage with the data and art,” stated Eleanor Tutt, Open Data and Knowledge Manager at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in a follow-up email to the talk.
Her social media usage is not the only thing that distinguishes her journalism. She firmly believes that all charts she makes should reflect something about their subject matter. She displayed generic charts and bar graphs and opined that while they were “powerful, I guess, in terms of their clarity, but if you were to remove the labels these could be about absolutely anything, and I think charts should connect to the subject matter that they are depicting.”
Though Chalabi focused a lot on how to analyze and present data, she views her job primarily as that of “a journalist who really loves numbers.” While she works as a designer and with data, she primarily views herself as a journalist. “My job is to find reliable, recent numbers and get them in front of as many people as possible. Sometimes those numbers are buried way down deep in a database, sometimes they’re in the appendix of a PDF. But my job is to track them down and translate them from endless possible iterations of digital page to either words or images.”

Carnegie Mellon is a global research university that offers unlimited opportunities for growth, experience, and interdisciplinary engagement for its students. We have seen Carnegie Mellon graduates become the country’s next leaders in research, entrepreneurship, the STEM field, and a multitude of other disciplines. Now, it’s time for Carnegie Mellon students, alumni, and other affiliates to show our appreciation to the institution that has given us so much.
This year, Carnegie Mellon University will be celebrating Giving Tuesday on Nov. 28. This is an incredible opportunity for students to give back! After the great success that the event had last year, Carnegie Mellon is hoping to further engage its students, alumni, parents, faculty, staff, and friends this year by utilizing the power of social media. From 12 a.m. to 11:59 p.m., Carnegie Mellon University will be hosting a variety of events and challenges, both online and offline, to break the old record set last year of most donors giving in one day — 1,430! The highlight of these challenges is the Presidential Student Match of a 2:1 dollar match for students only, so a $5 gift can become $15 or a $10 gift can become $30. There are also matching funds for the Nooks project and the UPLIFT project, and much more!
To kick off the event, students are invited to a midnight party — Plaid Palooza! At that time, Carnegie Mellon will begin its social media challenges and award two students with $500 each to give to any fund of their choice. Throughout the rest of the day, you can find tabling events in the Cohon Center and get a chance to make your gift and recommend any fund to receive $500!
Where exactly does your donation go? The answer is simple: anywhere! You can choose to donate to any fund at Carnegie Mellon, including a student organization you are a part of, your department, your school, or anywhere else! Your donation can go towards helping anything you are passionate about growing and develop so that future generations of Carnegie Mellon students can also partake in these experiences.
Make sure to check the Carnegie Mellon University and Carnegie Mellon Alumni pages of Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn and use the hashtag #givingCMUday throughout Giving Tuesday for challenges and updates on the fundraising progress!
Remember, if your heart is in the work, give from your heart this Giving Tuesday!

The winner of the Ford College Community Challenge (Ford C3) mobility-themed competition was The Aquaponics Project, a startup company which focuses on urban agriculture by raising aquatic animal and plants in a single, small environment. The company received $10,000 and a Ford Transit Connect passenger van to transport its portable aquaponics facility for winning the challenge. The project team includes Carnegie Mellon University students Alexis Hoane, a sophomore chemistry major, and Sasha Cohen Ioannides, a sophomore in the College of Engineering. The team also consists of students from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan.
The goal of The Aquaponics Project is to provide an innovative solution to food production and waste and soil remediation. The startup company was established in 2016 when it created its first aquaponics farm, which produced 50 pounds of basil and 80 tilapia last year.
“The vehicle will improve our aquaponics startup, allowing us to start integrating anaerobic digestion and improve food rescue mobilization in Pittsburgh. This will create a 21st-century food system that we hope other urban areas can model,” said Cohen Ioannides, director of design and maintenance for The Aquaponics Project.
The company previously pitched an idea for an anaerobic digestive system at the 2017 Ford C3 and won $25,000. The system involved a series of biological processes in which microorganisms break down food waste in the absence of oxygen. The end product is biofertilizer and biogas, which is used for energy and heat.
The Aquaponics Project partners with various organizations around the city including Repair the World, The Door Campaign, and 412 Food Rescue, co-founded by Carnegie Mellon alumna Leah Lizarondo, a 2003 graduate of the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. 412 Food Rescue provides compost for the startup’s anaerobic digestive system.
“My biggest passion is creating accessibility to food,” said Ioannides. “The Aquaponics Project allows me to collaborate with other students on and off campus, get out and do the things I’m passionate about and get involved with the community.”
The signature Ford Mobility Challenge celebrated the ten-year anniversary of the Ford C3 with a special mobility-themed competition, “Making Lives Better by Changing the Way People Move.” Three of the ten original winning teams were invited to Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, including The Aquaponics Project, to pitch their solutions to a panel of Ford executives for the chance to win the passenger van and additional monetary prizes.
“The future of C3 will broaden our goal to help students create meaningful, sustainable social enterprises to drive change,” said Mike Schmidt, director of education and global community development for Ford Motor Company Fund, in a press release on the challenge. “Our goal is to create a movement, not a program, that allows students to be a powerful force for good in this world and to help make people’s lives better across the globe.”
Home Inc.Ubator, led by Carnegie Mellon architecture major Sophie Nahrmann, was an additional 2017 C3 winning team that received $25,000 for its portable residential housing module prototype, which used virtual reality technology which enables residents to have input on the design of their affordable housing. According to a press release on the challenge, the purpose of the project is to “empower residents to develop affordable housing, foster a more inclusive path to homeownership, contribute to social mobility, provide education/training opportunities, and support community-based entrepreneurship.”
In second place came the Olin College of Engineering, where students developed Coahoma Mobile Education, a project which allowed rural youth in Coahoma County, Mississippi to explore topics in the arts, technology, and entrepreneurship. The students will work with the youth to build electric guitars, teaching them electrically, carpentry, and 3D-modeling skills in a mobile space.
Michigan Tech University landed third place. The students built a user-friendly medical transportation management system to allow their partner organization, Little Brothers-Friends of the Elderly, to maximize their free door-to-door medical transportation service for the elderly.
“Ford C3 has been a tremendously successful program in that it has completely changed our mindset on how we engage with college students,” said Schmidt. “Through C3, we recognized that students can be a huge force for good and that if we give them the right support, they can change in the world. And we are doing that, now, on a global scale.”

After the elections of 2016, it would be easy to become disillusioned with the idea of representation, to begin doubting that your vote can make a difference. But after a hard year of unethical policies and unintelligible claims from the government, this year’s elections across the country have brought some much-needed hope to America. Those elected to office include many Democrats as well as many firsts, from the first black mayor in a number of towns and cities, to the first Latina and Asian American women, to the first transgender people, all serving in various states and even nationally.
In Framingham, MA, Yvonne Spicer is not only the first black female mayor but also the first mayor in Framingham’s 317-year history, as the residents narrowly voted to change from a town to a city form of government in April. At 39.1 percent, voter turnout was a record high for the last 25 years in this historic election, and Spicer won with 58 percent of the vote. A native of Brooklyn, NY, Spicer has a doctorate in educational leadership and works to build capacity for STEM programs in schools. She will take office on Jan. 1, 2018.
Vi Lyles will become Charlotte, NC’s first black female mayor as well — with 58 percent of the vote, she easily beat her Republican opponent Kenny Smith. Over the past three decades, she has served as a budget official and assistant city manager in city hall. North Carolina had a high voter turnout as well — for this election, it was about 20 percent, which was higher than the predicted rate.
Jonathan McCollar will become the first black mayor of Statesboro, GA, unseating the current mayor with his progressive platform and 52 percent of the vote. Cairo, GA. also voted for their first black mayor: Booker Gainor, who is only 28 years old. Brendon Barber and Ailment Collins became the first black mayors of Georgetown, SC and Helena, MO respectively. And in Milledgeville, GA, Mary Parham-Copelan won the election for mayor by a margin of only six votes, making her the first woman and African American to be elected mayor.
Elizabeth Guzman and Hala Ayala became the first two Latinas elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, also turning their districts from Republican to Democrat. Guzman immigrated from Peru to create a better life for her children, pursuing first a community college degree and then several others. Ayala is a cybersecurity specialist who was involved in organizing the Women’s March last January. She supports raising minimum wage, equal pay and access to health care for everyone, and increasing the percentage of women in government to ensure all voices are heard.
Kathy Tran, the first Asian American woman elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, fled Vietnam with her parents when she was a baby. She supports strengthening public schools, the economy, and environmental protection, preventing gun violence, and immigration reform. Ravinder Bhalla, who was elected the mayor of Hoboken, became the first Sikh mayor in all of New Jersey. He wants to upgrade Hoboken’s infrastructure, balance the budget, and push for environmentally sustainable policies to help residents in both the short and long terms.
Jenny Durkan previously made history as the first gay U.S. attorney in American history, and has now become the first lesbian mayor in Seattle. Some of her goals are to create affordable housing, help the homeless, and reform the criminal justice system. Zachary DeWolf, Seattle’s first openly gay school board member, wants to close the gap created by differences in individual students' circumstances, and create a safe environment for everyone to learn.
In Provo City, Utah, Michelle Kaufusi will be sworn in as the first female mayor on Dec. 5. She emphasizes strength when considering issues, and intends to focus on creating strong neighborhoods, strong budgets and other forms of fiscal management, a strong economy through businesses, and strong engagement from all residents.
In the Virgina state senate, Democrat Danica Roem became one of the country’s first transgender elected officials — she defeated Republican Rob Marshall, who has been elected 13 times in 26 years, wrote Virginia’s discriminatory “bathroom bill,” and referred to Roem with incorrect pronouns throughout the election cycle while at the same time refusing to debate with her. She plans to focus on four things: a traffic problem that arises during rush hour, increasing and improving jobs by conducting studies and raising minimum wage, aiding schools by bringing in more commercial taxes, alleviating overcrowding, and increasing teacher pay, and striving toward equality for those of different religions, races, genders, sexual orientations, and disabilities.
In addition, Andrea Jenkins, who has been elected to the Minneapolis City Council, is the first black, openly-transgender woman ever elected to a public office. She is a poet, activist, and historian, and curator of the Transgender Oral History Project at the University of Minnesota.
Despite the discouraging claims and actions that have been put forth by our national government over the past few months, it is uplifting to see an effort to incorporate so much diversity into our local elections. The people elected  to these offices can have meaningful impact on our day-to-day lives, and Americans have shown through our votes the issues that are important to us as a nation to address. Voters being aware of current events and showing up to cast their ballots played an important role in bringing about this change — it is important to remember the ways we can shape policy and make a difference as we move forward into the future.

One of the greatest powers of the United States lies in the ability of its higher education system to attract diverse and talented students from all over the world. According to the 2017 Open Doors Report by the Institute of International Education, the international student population in the United States increased by 3.4 percent to 1,078,822 students this year. This large presence of international students amounts to around $32 billion that is brought into the U.S. economy.
Recently, however, many universities around the U.S. have seen a dip in the number of foreign applicants. A survey of 250 colleges, conducted by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), has found that “39 [percent] of responding institutions reported a decline in international applicants.” The survey further observed that the highest declines in applicants were from the Middle East, while the number of applications from India and China was also impacted. 
“[Many international students] said they were concerned about the Trump effect,” said Wim Wiewel, President of Portland State University, in an interview with The New York Times. “I’d say the rhetoric and actual executive orders are definitely having a chilling effect.” 
Indeed, many call this decline in applicants an outcome of the "Trump effect:" the effects that President Trump's actions, words, and political agenda bring to the U.S. both on a domestic and an international level. From what I see, this decline in the number of foreign applicants to U.S. colleges can be divided into two main attributes. First, the visa application process has become more difficult under the Trump presidency, especially for students in the Middle East, preventing many students who wish to come to the U.S. from pursuing such an academic career. Second, the political climate of the United States has put much worry into many families around the world, prompting many students to look to domestic higher education systems or those of other countries like China, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom. 
As an international student myself, I have experienced both of these challenges in choosing to come to the United States for college. While I was fortunate to reside in the United States previously, making my visa application process easier than most, I have a couple of friends in South Korea who were caught in the bureaucratic mess of the visa application process, which prevented them from attending U.S. colleges in the fall of 2017. As for the political climate of the U.S., Trump and his agenda have instigated a changed reputation of the United States in the eyes of countries around the world. The words and actions of the President — the travel bans imposed by the administration, for example — and the many displays of violence and national division — mass shootings and the more public presence of white supremacy, to name a couple — have certainly proven to many families around the world that the sentiments of isolationism and nationalism are growing. In essence, it has become harder and less attractive to be an international student in the United States.
"Are they going to be welcomed in the United States? Are the Americans going to treat their sons and daughters well? Are they going to be safe on U.S. campuses and in U.S. cities?" asked Gary Bergman, founder, and president of College Study US, in an interview with Newsweek. "A lot of the comments that are coming out of the current administration are leading a lot of families to really take a step back and wonder if the U.S. is really a good place to go for their education."
As Bergman comments above, for many foreigners, the United States is no longer seen as the "land of immigrants." The once deeply held values of diversity and openness seem to have changed to become more exclusive rather than inclusive. As such, it is expected that fewer and fewer students will choose the U.S. as their destination for higher education; it is the reputation that the U.S. displays on the international stage that has caused such a phenomenon. In order for the U.S. to continue enjoying the large presence of international students on its campuses, its reputation in the international community must be revived. If the Trump administration continues its agenda on immigration, maintaining its stance and proceeding to make negative remarks on foreigners or immigrants, the United States will no longer be at the frontiers of higher education and potentially risk the intellectual leadership of many of its academic institutions.

Yet again, America finds hyperpartisanship interfering with ethics. On Dec. 12, voters in Alabama must decide on a senator to represent their state: Democratic candidate Doug Jones or Republican candidate Roy Moore. But these candidates differ on more than their parties. Moore has been accused of sexually abusing minors by at least four different women, who were all in their teens at the time of the alleged assault.
What should be a simple choice — a choice between a man who prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan and an alleged pedophile — is apparently a difficult question being raised and warranting heated debates.
Alabama is not known to be the most liberal state. Gallup considers Alabama to be the fifth most conservative state in the U.S., and conservatives outnumber liberals by approximately 30 percentage points. Thus, it comes as no surprise that Moore had enjoyed being in the lead up until recently despite voters knowing that they are potentially supporting a pedophile.
Additionally, Alabama is not known to be the most accepting of change or authority. Years back during the Civil War, Alabama proudly joined the secession to keep allowing slave ownership. It was one of the last states to racially integrate schools and was reluctant to allow marriage equality. Today, party chairwoman Terry Lathan stated that "Alabamians will be the ultimate jury in this election, not the media or those from afar," pushing away anyone outside the state of Alabama. Loyalty is an admirable quality. However, this intention to defend and protect Alabama by mindlessly defending its every action regardless of right or wrong ultimately hurts Alabama. Voting for a Democrat does break the Republican status quo of the state, but this choosing a candidate to represent Alabama just because of political affiliation does anything but protect Alabama. It's committing state suicide.
Although Jones led the polls by five percentage points as of Nov. 18, it is frightening to think that just four days prior, Moore maintained a lead in a poll.
Even some of those who believe that Moore is a child molester consider Moore to be the more qualified candidate. Right-leaning author David Horowitz tweeted "electing a Dem strengthens a party that defends [criminals such as Obama and Clinton whose] crimes are far far worse," Jones is automatically an inferior choice. Others on Twitter have shared this common sentiment. These votes are not swayed by actual policies or morals; they are made solely by party affiliation. This is not an issue that only Republicans or right-wing parties are susceptible to, but we are in a situation where there is a great political division and exacerbated by a president that further perpetuates a division between the two prominent political parties.
Controversial blogger Elizabeth Johnston, known as The Activist Mommy, posted a meme on her Twitter, placing Moore on a higher moral ground than Jones. The meme argues that since Moore allegedly molested a child but Jones definitely advocates for what she calls "actual infanticide," Moore is the more ethical choice. Additionally, she has spoken to support Moore, whom she believes is "the greatest judge in America who has faithfully fought for 20 years for the unborn, traditional marriage, the 10 commandments, and the constitution." Her defending Moore is not that surprising, given her perception that Christian America is under attack. However, it is disheartening to know that she influences thousands of people on the Internet and can potentially validate hardcore Republicans who ultimately decide that party is more important than policy or ethics.
I understand that topics such as abortion are sensitive and topics of great gravity. However, latching onto a candidate because of one stance and disregarding everything else about the candidate is uneducated at best. Moore "fighting for the unborn" does not erase the striking evidence that states he preyed on young and vulnerable girls.
Hyperpartisanship is a growing problem in the U.S., and it is not hard to see why it has increased in intensity over the years. Echo chambers and social media algorithms strategically lay out what media we surround ourselves with. Thus, we are more likely to be surrounded by media that aligns with our preexisting beliefs. Seeing something that contradicts our paradigm can be upsetting and unenjoyable for someone with strong opinions on a particular topic. However, this kind of group polarization that transforms what would be moderate stances into polarized stances.
I have lived in Alabama for ten years of my life. Am I surprised that my home state is choosing party over ethics? No. Am I ashamed and wish that I could be registered to vote in my home state instead of Pennsylvania? Yes. With less than a month remaining until the election, all I can hope is that we can separate Moore from the party that he so poorly represents.

Many of us have most likely grown up with parents or teachers instructing us to not judge others simply because their beliefs are different from our own. While this surely has its merits, it is intended to be applicable in a very general sense, with glaring exceptions.
I certainly would never judge someone harshly for their taste in food or music — well, perhaps only jokingly — but I do believe that politics is a key belief that lies outside the realm of that piece of advice. It should be perfectly acceptable to be judged for one’s political views.
I do not mean this as a hard-and-fast rule, however, as everyone should be left to his or her own devices to decide to what degree, personally, politics play a role in his or her evaluation of someone. What I do argue, instead, is that people should not be deemed closed-minded or otherwise for choosing to let politics color their opinions on someone else.
Relationships in life are often based on things shared and other commonalities, as many of them seemingly arise out of shared circumstances. Therefore, I hold the belief that it is definitely easier to befriend someone who holds the same set of political views.
Of course, I definitely am not saying that, for example, Republicans have trouble befriending or cannot befriend those who are Democrats or vice versa, as those friendships often occur. Furthermore, the variation within those two ideologies is as varied as the political spectrum itself, so one may find themselves sharing many opinions despite identifying as a part of completely different parties.
My message is that, should someone choose to not enter into a relationship with someone, romantic or platonic, they should be allowed to cite politics as a reason why. People should be held accountable for their beliefs, even if that accountability amounts to judgment. For example, while I am perfectly happy to and do have friends who are more conservative than I am, I cannot see myself dating someone who has views that deviate far from mine.
Some people would personally not associate themselves with those who are rude or those who partake in activities against their own morals, such as doing drugs, so why should politics be any different? By choosing to espouse and stand behind a certain set of stances, you indicate to others exactly what is and isn’t important to you as a person. Abortion rights or no abortion rights, affirmative action or no affirmative action, gun control or no gun control — what you think affects how you behave and how you vote, which in turn affects those around you.
Being offended has turned into an ugly term in recent years, as more people nowadays are being mocked for being “overly sensitive” or “easily triggered.” But, if what another says or believes affronts, invalidates, or belittles your own views, you have a right to be offended, to judge another for thinking that way, or to choose not to associate with them.
There can certainly be harmful political beliefs, such as being against gay marriage or being for neo-Nazism, to name some of the ones that are more unilaterally believed as problematic. As for the most controversial ones, it will be up to each person individually to decide what it is and where his or her boundaries lie.
In a tumultuous time and country like the contemporary United States, we find it harder and harder to separate politics and our everyday lives. Even in the most recent presidential election, I am sure that many people have or have seen their friends be shocked when someone they know come out in support of a candidate that they themselves despise.
I’m here to say that it’s a reasonable, logical reaction and that their judgment is perfectly warranted.

Graduate students are under attack in the latest House tax bill. The GOP’s plan is to tax our tuition waivers as if they were income, and to remove student loan interest deductions, making graduate school substantially more expensive. According to an analysis by our very own Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), some Ph.D. students may owe $10k annually in taxes under this bill. This is unacceptable.
The first Carnegie Mellon University responses to the bill came from our GSA (see their appearance in several articles, including in Wired). Carnegie Mellon administrators seem to have been caught unaware and uninformed. Yet this information has been public since Nov. 2, when the House Bill was first released, and at the time of writing, the administration still has no public plan.
In fact, in Interim President Jahanian’s only email to the University at large, he mentions only “proposals to tax graduate student stipends,” which is not even the correct issue. The proposal is to tax our tuition, not our stipends. This response fails to inspire confidence. By way of contrast, Cornell and Notre Dame have already released definitive statements about whether their students are affected by the proposed tuition tax. Why has our administration not made a similar statement?
Either the administration simply does not know, or it is deliberately keeping us in the dark to prevent a panic.
Perhaps the administration is genuinely clueless, due to CMU’s decentralized nature. Without central oversight, there is wild variation in how tuition, stipends, fees, and health insurance are handled across the colleges.
What seems likely is that, as a private school with extremely high tuition, CMU will be hurt a lot more by this tax bill than public R1 universities. It’s bad enough that we students pay $2000 plus tax for health insurance. This additional tax burden will make graduate school fiscally untenable. Either the university will shoulder the financial burden or students will choose to go elsewhere.
Ph.D. students commonly do not take classes after their first two years, but tuition is still paid on their behalf. So what does our tuition fund? Our previous president made nearly $900,000 annually, while annual stipends for CMU Ph.D. students can be as low as $13,500 per year (for reference, according to one I-20, the cost of living in Pittsburgh is $20,500).
And what if the bill passes? The Trump administration wants this signed by Thanksgiving and telling ourselves “it will never pass” is delusional. If not passed, the bill could come back in some watered-down form, likely still harmful (like Trump’s immigration ban and healthcare bill). We need to be prepared to fight a long fight against this provision whenever it appears.
If passed, the bill will take effect April 6, likely affecting every graduate student on campus, and the University needs a plan for when that happens.
Signed,
Concerned Graduate Students

Tech has infiltrated every aspect of our lives: Uber has displaced taxi cabs, AirBnB has transformed hotels, and Amazon has started to crush brick-and-mortar retailers. While disruption has uprooted countless industries, it has had a limited impact — so far — on the hospitality industry. Restaurants have experienced only moderate disruption due to technology and high-end restaurant options have been particularly spared. These fine dining establishments may allow guests to make reservations online or read a menu on their webpages, but that is generally the extent of technological involvement. This will not last forever, though, as fine dining establishments begin to integrate more data-driven technology into their daily operations to boost their bottom line.
Until recently, most technologies in restaurants were focused on the front of house – employee interactions with customers. These technologies included reservation systems, customer data aggregators and order management systems. New technologies are beginning to move to other parts of the restaurant, like the kitchen itself. One nascent product, Foodpairing, helps chefs discover new combinations of foods that can surprise and delight the palette. Combinations include items ranging from common spices to unique varieties of fish. While new pairings were previously discovered through a basic guess-and-check method, Foodpairing claims to analyze “unique scientific and consumer data sources in combination with big data… for identifying the successful flavors of tomorrow.” This methodology may generate some peculiar-sounding combinations on menus, but they’ll be worthwhile if a desirable flavor is produced and customers return for more.
Outside of the kitchen, fine dining establishments are also investing in data analytics to drive profits. New systems, such as Upserve, track every detail related to a diner’s experience, including their contact information, visit history, past expenditures and individual food and drink orders. This data is compiled across the restaurant and can unveil powerful insights about the restaurant’s operation. For instance, Upserve’s platform automatically generates a scorecard that ranks menu items in comparison to each other and identifies what types of diners are most likely to order each dish. A repeat customer may select an entrée that is rarely ordered by first time diners, so this dish would be classified as a “hidden gem.” Upserve claims that this meaningful data can help servers give recommendations and help restaurants retain their customers over the long term by providing better service.
Another domain affected by an increased role of technology is in neither the kitchen nor the restaurant itself, but rather on the web. Online social media giants like Instagram and Facebook, as well as online review aggregators such as Yelp, are a dominant technology in the hospitality industry. Diners are eager to share pictures of their meals “tagged” with the restaurant’s name, especially at exclusive and trendy restaurants. “The average guest takes pictures for 10 minutes before ordering anything,” says Madelyn Markoe, owner of Media Noche, an Instagram hot-spot restaurant in San Francisco. Often, restaurants even have their own Instagram pages to promote seasonal menu items or nightly specials. While the free marketing is valuable, restaurants must now dedicate additional time and energy to fully engage with customers online.
To help restaurants optimize their online presence, Avero, a long-standing hospitality technology company, launched Avero Buzz in December of 2016. Avero Buzz is a “social listening tool” offering a centralized platform for communicating with customers across all online platforms. This service is particularly impactful for restaurant groups with a portfolio of different fine dining establishments, each with its own account on Yelp, Instagram, and Facebook. It integrates restaurant data with social data and generates analytics measuring the effectiveness of social media marketing campaigns. Though there are many ways to measure campaign effectiveness, the Avero Buzz platform focuses on changes in customer volume and customer behavior over long-term periods. By recognizing these changes and adapting to them, restaurants can derive real value from their customers’ online habits.
Across restaurant operations, data is playing an increased role. The data of flavor is helping chefs try new pairings and combinations. The data of customer history is shaping profitability and the dining experience. And the constant chatter of customer interactions across various social platforms online is a low-cost yet meaningful opportunity for publicity. Yet as these technologies and others continue to integrate into restaurants, other forms of innovation seem far off. Hopefully the 3D-printed hamburger is not in the near future.

"Take her swimming on the first date" is a common saying circulating on the internet and being shared among men who joke about how women "hide" behind layers of makeup, thus deceiving the world with artificially good looks. However, this statement has become more than just a silly meme. Ashot Gabrelyanov created an app called MakeApp that essentially makes a camera filter that predicts what women look like without makeup.
As a makeup enthusiast, I obviously had to give this app a try. For an app that costs money, I was not impressed with the results. Despite the poor estimate of what my bare face looks like, I could not help but laugh. There are men out in the world who may take a photo of me in my usual "cake face," toss it through this app, and decide whether I am attractive enough to be associated with — all without knowing anything about me.
There has been heavy criticism targeted at the app. Many articles have claimed that such a "removal" of makeup is sexist because it makes men use a makeup-less woman's appearance be a dealbreaker for whether he wants to pursue a relationship with her. Buzzfeed pointed out that a man — not a woman — was in charge of the creation of the app in the title, heavily hinting that Gabrelyanov had sexist intentions behind the app.
What some feminists and some men fail to realize is that a lot of people don't wear makeup because they feel ashamed of their appearances. I don't deny the possibility that there may be someone out there who cakes on makeup to hide insecurities. If that someone is reading this article, I hope there soon comes a realization that one's beauty and one's worth does not lie in makeup. However, for many people, makeup is a creative outlet. Much like wearing a nice outfit instead of pajamas, it can boost one's confidence and make one feel more prepared to face the day. No amount of makeup in the world changes the value or beauty of a person. Kim Kardashian is the same reality star with and without her famous dramatic contour. Similarly, a person hasn't shape-shifted by applying makeup (and frankly, did not invest so much money to impress someone who demands all the products to be washed down the drain).
What's notable is that Gabrelyanov claims that the app could be used to identify victims of human trafficking. "In most of these cases, makeup is heavily used to disguise the age and/or identity of these people," he said in an emailed statement. "If human traffickers can hide these victim's identities, their chances of rescue are low." Of course, the app has a long way to go, but this is a possibility. However, if this is the direction the app is heading, something to consider would be to change the image of the app. Instead of marketing it as an app where a user can play around with camera filters for fun to see what a potential girlfriend would look like bare-faced, further emphasize its potential usage to identify victims who may be heavily disguised with makeup.
If you insist on being outraged by makeup, I suggest you look into the lack of racial inclusiveness in the beauty industry that conveniently excludes consumers with darker skin colors. Just let people use makeup as they feel comfortable and realize that they aren't "hiding" something from you.
