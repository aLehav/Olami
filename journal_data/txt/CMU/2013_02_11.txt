Carnegie Mellon’s women’s basketball team celebrated two victories at home this weekend against Brandeis University and New York University. The Tartans’ wins were particularly special as yesterday was Senior Day, marking the last home game for seniors Emily Peel, Elissa Goldner, and Tori Baggio.
The Tartans defeated the Brandeis University Judges on Friday with a score of 58–50, making the team’s record 12–9 and 4–6 in the University Athletic Association (UAA). Senior forward Peel’s performance was crucial in the game as she led the Tartans with 21 points. 
At the break, the Tartans were up five points, and their lead continued throughout the second half. Peel shot seven for eight in the first half for a total of 17 points. 
When Brandeis took the lead, Peel scored seven points to put the Tartans back ahead 13–9 with around 40 minutes left on the clock. The Tartans shot 43.3 percent on the court for the first period and forced the Judges into 11 half-turnovers the same period. First-year Liza Otto was also a key player, scoring 14 points, eight rebounds, and four assists, while fellow first-year Lindsay Poss scored a total of seven points. The Tartans scoring percentage in the second half was 38.1 percent, outdoing the Judges’ 36.5 percent. The Tartans also had more rebounds during this same period. 
The Carnegie Mellon women’s team then played New York University Violets on Sunday and defeated them by 20 points with a score of 76–56. This secured Carnegie Mellon’s first winning season since 2002–03. 
At Senior Day yesterday,  the Tartans celebrated their dedicated senior members by presenting them with photo frames and basketball memorabilia to commemorate their careers at Carnegie Mellon. 
“Today’s game wasn’t just the last game for the seniors to play at Skibo Gym — it was the last chance for this unique group of girls to play together on their home court,” Goldner said. “I’m so proud of the way we came together today to beat NYU. It’s experiences like today’s game that I will remember for the rest of my life.”
The Tartans finished with a 13–9 record and a 5–6 record in the UAA. Peel, again, was a huge contribution to the Tartans’ success as she scored 14 points. Poss also was a key player and contributed to the win with 13 points and 10 rebounds. At the break, the Tartans led by 14 points with a shooting percentage of 47.1 percent. 
In the game-opening 9–1 run, Peel assisted in scoring four points after Otto started the game with a layup. The Tartans never fell behind as they had a 25–9 lead in the first period. Sophomore guard Chandler Caufield and sophomore guard Gabrielle West each had three pointers to continue the Tartans’ lead. 
In the second half, Peel, Otto, and Poss each shot baskets to give the Tartans a whopping 60–20 lead that secured a win. West finished with 13 points, making her just a mere two shots away from becoming fourth on Carnegie Mellon’s career-high scoring chart.
“[The wins] felt awesome! It was great to see everything come together after all of the hard work our team has put in throughout the season. We played together defensively and offensively,” Peel said. “I am so happy to have won, but I am really looking forward to our next three games, we still have a lot to get done. 
The Carnegie Mellon women’s team will travel to the University of Rochester on Friday for the first of three final UAA games.

You may have seen first-year electrical and computer engineering major Shepard Emerson merrily biking around campus. However, you may not have seen him swiftly skiing down the slopes at the speed of light, barely visible.
The first-year athlete is the top male skier for the Carnegie Mellon Ski & Snowboard Club this season. He also placed second in a slalom race in Elk Mountain on Jan. 26 and a race in Blue Knob on Jan. 19 among some of the top skiers in the nation, including members of the very competitive Pennsylvania State University and United States Naval Academy teams.
“I’ve been pleased with the results so far. I’ve faced some really good competition with Penn State and Navy, but I’ve shown that I can compete with the best of them,” Emerson said.
Emerson is certainly no stranger to the slopes. He has been skiing since he was four years old and racing since he was 10. Hailing from Norwich, Vt., there was no shortage of great off-trail skiing and mountains for Emerson growing up.
In 2008, Emerson made it to the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Junior Olympics in skiing, competing with the best skiers in the East, and finishing in the top half. Although he took a year-long hiatus from skiing his senior year of high school, Emerson now aims to “get back into it” and “race for fun, and race to win.”
But Emerson’s desire to win is equally matched by his support for his teammates. “He’s very upbeat and supportive. He’s very helpful at giving advice to the less experienced skiers,” club president Anna Cederquist said.
From the beginning, Emerson fell in love with the “freedom of being on the mountain.”
“I’m a complete adrenaline junkie. I just love going as fast as I possibly can,” he said.
Emerson satisfies his need for adrenaline and outdoor adventure not only by skiing, but also by rock climbing, running, and biking with Carnegie Mellon’s Cycling Club.
All of these adventures provide Emerson with a welcome distraction from his demanding coursework in the electrical and computer engineering curriculum.
Emerson said that being a member of Carnegie Mellon’s ski team provides him with opportunities to “get away from the city for the weekend, hang with a great group of people, and come back feeling refreshed.”
For now, Emerson has his sights set on racing, with hopes of qualifying for Nationals.
“I think that Shepard will keep doing extremely well and stay involved in the team,” Cederquist said. “He’s definitely someone everyone can cheer for.”

The Tartans went 1–1 in its final home weekend game against Brandeis University and New York University. This brings their overall record to 5–17 and 2–9 in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference.
Friday night, the Tartans battled the Judges of Brandeis University in the Skibo gym. The Tartans came out a little sluggish at the beginning of the game when Brandeis took a 9–2 lead within the first three minutes of play.
As the game continued and the home team got settled, the Tartans were able to work their way back into the game and cut the deficit to one point after junior guard Asad Meghani hit a three pointer to reflect a scoreboard of 16–15 with 13 minutes to go in the first half.
Just after the 10-minute mark, the Tartans scored seven straight points to take the lead for the rest of the half. As the game progressed, the Tartans continued to pull away with great offense, leading to more three pointers from Meghani and senior guard Andre Moore.
The Tartans led by 12 with just over three minutes left to play in the game when Brandeis went on an 18–4 run to regain the lead and eventually win the game with a final score of 73–68. 
The Tartans played their last home game Sunday afternoon, defeating the Violets of New York University. At the sound of the first buzzer the Tartans maintained a narrow lead until four minutes into the second half when sophomore Jasen Blakney finished a layup to take his team’s lead to nine points.
Soon after the layup, the Violets made an 11–2 run to tie the game with 10 minutes to go. The game stayed very close with a 56–55 lead for the Tartans with 26 seconds left in the game and a final possession for the Violets. With the clock running down, and the ball in the hands of a Violet forward right underneath the basket, junior forward Sean Brophy stole the ball just before the clock ran out and secured the win for the Tartans. After reflecting on his last home game as a Tartan, Moore said, “It’s kind of bittersweet knowing that was my last game at Skibo. Even though I wasn’t hitting shots, my teammates stepped up and I can’t thank them enough for sending me out on a win.” Moore is the Tartans’ only senior this year.
On Friday, the Tartans will travel to Rochester to face the University of Rochester Yellowjackets.

Every spectator would like to think that sports are clean and pure. In fact, sports are based on the –premise that each competition takes place on an even playing field, with only size, skill, and wit determining the outcome. This premise is unfortunately flawed. 
The same competitive drive that makes athletes train for hours a day to become their best also drives them to find any edge possible to gain an advantage.
Lance Armstrong was supposed to be the poster child for doing things the right way. In a sport filled with doping, Armstrong was the glimmer of hope that training and natural ability can out perform drugs. 
After his publicized bout with cancer, Armstrong went on to win seven consecutive Tour de Frances, setting a new record for the sport.  He met accusations of doping with fierce rebuttal, then used his fame to create and lead Livestrong, an organization dedicated to fighting cancer, branded by those trademark yellow Livestrong rubber bracelets.
This idealistic image came crashing down after Armstrong’s admission to Oprah Winfrey that he did in fact use Human Growth Hormones (HGH), blood doping, and other banned substances to help win each of his titles. His confession came on the heels of his refusal to continue fighting United States Anti-Doping Agency charges. This defeat ended with Armstrong’s lifetime ban from the sport.
Armstrong negated much of his great charity work with his blatant lies about doping. 
He once ruined several reporters’ careers after they attempted to make allegations about his drug usage. Positive views of him are no longer in the court of public opinion. 
But is America really upset about his drug use or his lies? After all, more than a third of the top 10 finishers in the Tour de France since 1998 have admitted to using performance enhancing drugs.
When talking about performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), steroids and baseball are the first things that come to mind. 
Baseball’s steroid era went well into the last decade, with its first stars now facing the true court of public opinion, the National Baseball Hall of Fame committee. 
That committee, made up of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, has made it quite clear that they believe no player that has ever been linked to steroids should be admitted to the Hall of Fame.
This seems contradictory since, before steroids, the use of amphetamines (also known as “greenies”) among baseball players was substantial. 
Many current Hall of Famers have admitted to taking greenies on a near daily basis, and yet they do not have the stigma that steroid usage has attached to them. 
Some current drug tests consist solely of a urine test and can be used to identify steroids and other common PEDs (such as Viagra or Adderall), but HGH and other designer drugs can only be identified using a more invasive blood test. 
The MLB just approved blood testing for the upcoming season, and the NFL and NBA are currently in talks to implement testing for their upcoming seasons. These new testing protocols have increased the market for both designer and natural, and thus legal, PEDs.
While little is known about designer drugs, all natural, legal alternatives to steroids are gaining press. 
The little information we know about designer drugs comes from month-long exposés into personal health clinics that are masquerades for drug clinics. One of these clinics was recently busted in South Florida.
Natural alternatives have also been in the news. The most recent example of these new alternative enhancers is the two-man company Sports with Alternatives to Steroids (SWATS). 
Sports Illustrated ran a large exposé on the company and their main product, deer-antler spray, just before the Super Bowl. A large portion of the article focused on Baltimore Ravens’ veteran linebacker Ray Lewis and his unusually speedy recover from a torn right tricep.
Deer-antler spray is formulated from the antlers of a New Zealand species of deer. Its effect comes from its high concentrations of IGF-1, or insulin-like growth factor. 
IGF-1 is banned by every pro league as well as the NCAA, but there is still very little that can be done to test for it with enough accuracy to punish players based on its findings.
Athletes will always be looking for the item, or supplement, that will give them an edge, whether it’s HGH, greenies, or deer-antler spray. 
As long as Americans continue to idealize the “win at all costs” mentality, we must also accept the fact that PEDs and other cheating methods will be a part of sports. 
While we should never give up on trying to keep cheating out of the game, it is important to remember that all of the loopholes and PEDs are available to every player, thus creating a uniquely level playing field for each era. 
Therefore, we can feel confident electing the best players of each generation to the Hall of Fame, knowing that they were the best among their peers, and that true transgenerational comparisons, while fun, are also trivial.

Carnegie Mellon is famous for its prominence in the technical world, but recently, a team of Carnegie Mellon mechanical engineering students navigated their way to the top of one of the world’s most creative realms. Senior mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Laura Laham, senior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major Andre Sutanto, and senior mechanical engineering major Anisha Vyas were selected as one of six finalist teams in the ImagiNations Design Contest held by Walt Disney Imagineering.
Disney Imagineering is responsible for Disney’s design and development, including the creation of theme parks, resorts, cruise ships, and entertainment. The design competition, ImagiNations, is hosted annually to give participants the opportunity to exhibit their creative talents as well as gain practical skills to implement their ideas.
Vyas, Sutanto, and Laham entered the contest with Sophia Chan last year and were named semi-finalists; Chan, now a Carnegie Mellon alum, works for Disney Imagineers. This year, the three collaborated with Jane Liu from the Art Center College of Design in California.
The topic for this year’s contest was to choose any city in the world and design an entertainment experience for its citizens and tourists. Finalists were selected based on guest experience, marketing perspective, uniqueness, and collaboration skills.
The team’s project, “Legenda Emas,” is an interactive boat ride set in Jakarta, Indonesia. Unlike a number of Disney attractions, which focus on common Disney fairy tales, the team designed a project that immerses participants in an Indonesian legend of a betrothed prince and princess and a nefarious witch who seeks to keep them apart.
“When we took a step back and realized that this should be an original ride from the location that we’re placing it in, our project really changed and took on a lot more value,” Laham said.
The attraction takes the riders through scenes of the legend, and places them as volunteers in the Royal Search Party whose objective is to follow a golden trail to find the princess. Another unique aspect of the ride is that each set of riders has a different experience. “Participants feel like they are a part of the story, so they are interactively changing the story as they go,” Sutanto said.
The attraction integrates technology such as radio-frequency identification, Kinect sensors, and computer-generated imagery to allow the participants to interact with the prince throughout the journey. At the end of the ride, riders are rewarded with a fireworks show for finding the princess.
For the team members, bringing their idea to life was both invigorating and challenging.
“It’s pretty rare to have to put all of your creativity into one project. It’s interesting to be drained of that in a way. Also, working with the artist [Jane Liu], and us being engineers, we came from two completely different mindsets…even between the three of us, our mindsets were completely different…. So trying to find a commonality was both our strength and the hardest part,” Vyas said.
In addition to the pressure to apply their creativity to the fullest, it was also a challenge to manage the project in addition to coursework. “To me, one of the hardest part of this projects was the fact that we were very passionate about the project, so it was hard to pull away from it to do other classwork,” Sutanto said.
Putting the project together provided an opportunity to apply their education to bring their ideas to life. “One of my favorite parts was the engineering principles I picked up along the way to figure out how the engineering parts should look, or how the parts should be redesigned to accommodate our vision — also just applying the train of thought to the technology that went into it as well,” Laham said. “I didn’t think I would use the same principles that I learned in Intro to Programming to program a Kinect to follow my hand, so that when I moved it around, something would happen on a screen. But it was all the same principles, which was awesome.” 
The finalist teams traveled on a five-day, all-expense-paid -trip to Imagineering headquarters in Glendale, California. There, they participated in a final competition, presenting their project in person to a panel of Imagineer executive judges. Laham, Sutanto, Vyas, and Liu won the second-place prize of $1,000.
In addition, finalist team members had the chance to interview for paid internships, interact with Imagineers, and receive behind-the-scenes tours. A number of past winners have proceeded to receive paid internships and even full-time employment with Walt Disney Imagineering.
All three hope to work for Disney Imagineers in the near future. “Working for Imagineers is one of those lifelong goals for any engineer,” Vyas said.

Carnegie Mellon is known for its five-year architecture program, yet many students do not realize how interdisciplinary the field can be. It is more than the design and construction of buildings — it is the creative combination of art and science. Architects do not just sketch drawings and make building plans — they collaborate with scientists from all different disciplines and develop innovative materials and building technologies to continuously improve the world of architecture.
Dale Clifford, assistant professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon, uniquely combines biology and architecture. “I look at natural systems and transfer that knowledge into building technology. Specifically what we’ve been looking at is self-regulating systems and mechanisms — how does an organism tune itself to the world around it? Can buildings do this too?”
Clifford’s unique way of revolutionizing architecture is the reason why Google has asked him to be the materials innovation consultant for a new building that the company is designing. Never before has Google designed its own building. “Google wants to know how to use new and emerging materials in their building practice. We’ll look at a range of materials and my team and I will make models, take photographs, do experiments and then come back and present it to Google to see how they can incorporate it into their building,” Clifford explained. This process is riskier than the normal practice of picking materials that already exist — they are actually developing new products never used before in buildings.
Pointing at an image of a soaring eagle, Clifford said, “This bird is continuously changing its form in response to fluctuating conditions.... This is what buildings should do.”
One material that Clifford has been developing, called a “phase-change” material, is going to be used in the Frick Park Environmental Center in Pittsburgh and is also a possible material for the Google project. As it undergoes a change in phase, in this case from liquid to solid, the material absorbs a large amount of latent heat.
“There’s a company that’s making an organic phase-change material based from palm oil. This type of material is generally behind walls, but we are taking it out of its opaque plastic packaging and developing a new packaging that will allow it to be more visible,” Clifford said. The palm oil material is given a target set-point temperature so that, as the temperature around the building changes, the phase-change material changes from clear to frosty. 
Most buildings have set points of temperature which determine when the air conditioning or heating system switches on and off; with walls made of phase change material, the set point would become wider and the air conditioning or heating unit would come on less, making the building more energy efficient. Clifford proposed to have tiles of this sort of material within a glass wall, attached to the glass by gecko feet fiber produced by mechanical engineering professor Metin Sitti.
Two other proposed projects that allow a building to  interact with the environment are optic-fiber stalks and petals actuated by shape-memory alloys. The stalk system would look like bundles of fiber-optic tubes with photovoltaic collectors at the tips. Sunlight would be filtered through the tubes to light the interior of the building.
The petal system would be a series of flower-like structures covering a glass wall, seen in the picture below. The petals are connected to a nickel-titanium alloy, which contracts at a target temperature. The contracting of the alloy pulls the petals down so that on a cold day, the petals would be closed to let sunlight in, while on a hot day, the petals would expand to shade the building.
According to Clifford, technologies that allow a building to respond to its environment accomplish two important goals: energy conservation and education. Innovations such as porous walls, phase-change materials, optic-fiber stalks, and petal systems not only improve the mechanics of a building, but provide a visual representation of how the building interacts with its surroundings. “By bringing what is usually inside walls to the exterior of buildings, people would directly be able to understand how we are lowering reliance on mechanical conditioning,” Clifford said.
Innovative building technologies such as those being developed by Clifford’s team require the collaboration of scientists from all different fields. Although students in the Mellon College of Science or Carnegie Institute of Technology might think they have nothing to with the School of Architecture, Clifford said it would be “a feast” if he could work with more scientists and engineers from other fields.
“Architecture always has an expanding footprint,” Clifford said. “In the future I think we’ll be collaborating more with materials scientists, physicists, chemical engineers, to develop new materials for buildings that are more responsive. It’s happening — it’s not the mainstream, but it’s an undercurrent.”

It is difficult to undermine the importance of the human brain in regard to our survival and daily functions. When the brain is affected by injury, it can have long lasting detrimental effects making simple things such as remembering what you had for breakfast very difficult. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University’s Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging have successfully combined different techniques to learn about how the brain performs simple functions before, during, and after an injury.
Scientists have hypothesized that when a specific portion of the brain is damaged and can no longer function, the brain activates secondary regions to supplement those that are damaged. Marcel Just, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon and senior research psychologist Robert Mason had the unique opportunity to combine Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Simulation (TMS) with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure what parts of the brain are activated and how they coordinate in the presence of an injury.
TMS involves generating a magnetic field to target a specific part of the brain, inducing a temporary virtual lesion. Mason explained that “this non invasive and generally safe technique allowed us to overstimulate a specific region of the brain so that the region cannot carry out its normal function when necessary. We targeted the Wernicke area of the brain that is responsible for speech and asked participants of the study to read sentences of varying difficulty.”
The fMRI enables scientists to see which parts of the brain are working together. Consistent with their hypothesis, Mason and his team found that after simulating an injury in a targeted region of the brain, higher levels of activity were found in three other regions. The contralesional region is made up of areas on the half of the brain opposite the target region; the paralesional region is made up of areas that are immediately adjacent to the target region. Both of these regions immediately worked to supplement the injured region. In addition, the frontal region helped coordinate the contralsional and paralesional regions to ensure that signals were still being sent out to the body.
Mason noticed that “when impairing a region of the brain, other areas of the brain that are connected [to the injured area] also showed significantly reduced activity as well.” This deviated from their expectations: They expected that after simulating the injury, the participants would exhibit a slower performance and have difficulty with the task at hand due to this reduced activity in regions that typically assist with the injured area’s function. However, Mason and his team were surprised to find that the participants actually became better at the task.
Mason explained that after overstimulation, the targeted region of the brain slowly regains function. “The secondary regions that had been activated as a result of the injury and the injured region were both activated at the same time giving the brain two ways to carry out the function.” Over time, the secondary regions return to their typical functioning.
Mason presumes, “We could train the brain so that these regions could fill in in the case of more permanent damage.” 
He added that “in education, if students were encouraged to find multiple solutions or methods to deriving the correct answer, it would force us to recruit regions that would not normally function for a task.” This would allow the brain to have a more manageable time recruiting secondary regions to supplement an injured region.
Mason and his team are curious whether or not their results would be consistent if they target other regions of the brain. Nevertheless, they are proud of the hurdles they have overcome; Mason feel s like their discoveries “advance the understanding of how the brain functions.”

Breakthrough in limiting carbon dioxide emissions
By mimicking the way sea urchins create their exoskeletons, physicists have developed a means of converting carbon dioxide pollution into harmless calcium carbonate or chalk. Lidija Siller and her team at Newcastle University realized that they needed a catalyst to speed up the process of absorption of carbon dioxide into water. While examining sea urchins that absorb carbon dioxide into their skeletons, they found that nickel was abundant on the exoskeleton of urchin larvae. By adding nickel as a catalyst to the absorption process, they were able to almost completely remove the carbon dioxide.
By diverting gases from chimneys into water tanks saturated with nickel nanoparticles, the carbon dioxide present in the emissions can be almost completely eliminated, as it will react with the water to form chalk.

New York Times investigates recent hacker attack
Chinese hackers compromised the computer systems of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal at the end of last month. The attacks seemed to have been more personal than previous hacks, raising further concerns among enterprises. The more targeted an attack, the less effective traditional security is. 
In particular, the anti-virus software that the Times was using failed to detect 44 different kinds of malware. This was because the malware was custom built, and current malware detection systems are able to catch only more generic types. The Pentagon plans to expand its ranks of cyber-warriors to help fight against such attacks. However, the lack of enough highly-skilled individuals and a fiscally conservative Congress are likely to be large obstacles in the Pentagon’s future recruitment plans.

Researchers create material that can repel all fluids
Dr. Anish Tuteja and his team at the University of Michigan have developed a coating that repels almost all fluids. Currently, liquid resistant coatings are either oleophobic (oil-repellent, like those on touchscreens) or hydrophobic (water-repellent, as on waterproof gear). The new coating, dubbed “superomniphobic,” repels fluids by trapping millions of microscopic pockets of air within itself, so that fluids are unable to come in contact with the surface. It is resistant against almost all fluids, including highly reactive ones like hydrochloric acid. Currently, the durability of the coating is an issue, since it can be easily peeled off; the team is working toward developing a more permanent coating.

Blackout during Super Bowl being investigated
The cause of the power failure during the Super Bowl, which suspended play for more than half an hour, has been narrowed down to a device that ironically, had been installed to prevent the possibility of a blackout. The device was a relay that had been installed in the switching gear by Entergy New Orleans, the company that supplies power to the Superdome. The relay was intended to protect the Superdome from a cable failure between the company’s incoming power line and the lines that run through the stadium. The exact cause for the failure of the relay has yet to be investigated.

Cake mix is the bane of bakers everywhere. It’s a miracle when you’re in a pinch, when you’re feeling lazy, or when you’re just absolutely craving that from-a-box taste that nobody should like but almost everyone actually does.
But when you use a cake mix just to make a cake, something inside you dies a little bit. The little baker inside you who serves as your baking Jiminy Cricket sits down and puts his head in his hands and sobs. Isn’t there a compromise — something that can make everyone happy?
Of course there is. In fact, there are a lot of options. So without further ado, here’s a selection of recipes that uses cake mix in unexpected ways to make something fabulous, even more so.
Cake Mix Cake: Enhanced Version 
You might be skeptical, but you won’t believe how much more delicious and homemade this version tastes.
1 box of cake mix
1 teaspoon of vanilla
3 eggs
¼ cup of vegetable or canola oil (or applesauce as a low-fat option)
1 cup of milk
Instead of the cup of water that the directions indicate, use a cup of milk. Bake according to the directions on the mix’s box and marvel at your amazing skill.
Cake Mix Truffles
Adapted from loveveggiesandyoga.com.
1 cup of cake mix
¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla
Mix the ingredients together in a bowl and use your palms to roll the mix into one-inch balls. Put them on a tray and refrigerate for an hour or two. At this point, if you have the patience of a saint, you can roll the truffles in the melted chocolate and refrigerate them again.
Cake Batter Milkshakes
You need these now. I don’t care how cold it is. Adapted from abeautifulmess.com.
1 box of cake mix (my favorites are red velvet and Funfetti)
4–5 cups of milk
4–5 scoops of ice cream (feel free to go crazy with your flavors here)
Throw it all in a blender and find a straw. A big one.
Funfetti Pancakes
Adapted from wifessionals.com.
1½ cups of Funfetti cake mix
2 tablespoons of oil
¾ cup of milk
1 egg
Mix together until bubbles form. Butter a skillet and heat the mixture over medium-low heat. Cook small pancakes for no longer than three minutes on each side. You have to watch these guys pretty closely to make sure they don’t burn. If you want the true breakfast of champions, top these babies with a glaze by microwaving Funfetti icing and milk until the texture is smooth.

1 box of cake mix (my favorite is Funfetti)
2 cups of vanilla yogurt
1 cup of Cool Whip
Dip vehicles: animal crackers, graham crackers, or fruit, if you’re being healthy.
Mix it all together and prepare to die of dip happiness. Fair warning: This makes a ton of dip — like an entire mixing bowl. I hope you’re either searching for the cure for the everyday blues or inviting your entire floor to dessert.
Butter Pecan Miracles
They really are miracles for your taste buds. Adapted from tasteofhome.com.
1 box of butter pecan cake mix
1 teaspoon of vanilla
2 eggs
½ cup of butter, softened
1 cup of chocolate or butterscotch chips
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Cream the butter, eggs, and vanilla. Add half of the cake mix with the electric mixer, then mix the rest of it in by hand. Stir in the chips, then use two spoons to scoop onto the cookie tray. The batter will be very sticky. Bake for 10–12 minutes or until golden brown.
Luscious Lemon Bars
Adapted from allrecipes.com.
1 box of lemon cake mix
1 egg
½ cup of oil
1–8-ounce package of cream cheese
1 cup of sugar
1 tablespoon of lemon juice
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Mix the cake mix, oil, and egg, then pat into a greased 9-by-13-inch pan. Bake for 15 minutes. In the meantime, beat together the lemon juice, cream cheese, and sugar. After the cake has baked for the initial 15 minutes, spread the cream cheese mixture smoothly over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes, then slice into bars. Normally, I don’t go for refrigeration of baked goods, but a few hours in the refrigerator takes this recipe to a higher level. It’s your call. No, I take it back: It’s a test of your patience and restraint.
Fruit and Soda Cobbler
Adapted from livingachangedlife.blogspot.com.
24 ounces of fruit (mixed berries are my favorite, but peaches also work)
1 box of vanilla or yellow cake mix
1–2 cans of lemon-lime soda
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Spread the fruit on the bottom of a greased 9-by-13-inch pan. Pour the cake mix evenly on top, but don’t mix it in. Then, pour a can of soda over the the cake mix; don’t mix that in either. You may need more than one can in order to avoid dry spots. Bake for 45-50 minutes, and then dig in with a spoon. To avoid the inevitable burning of your tongue, you can always top the cobbler with ice cream.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes
1 box of yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1/3 cup of vegetable oil
2 cups of canned pumpkin
2 tablespoons of water
1 can of vanilla icing
1 teaspoon of cinnamon, plus additional for topping
1 teaspoon of ginger, plus additional for topping
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Mix the cake mix, eggs, oil, spices, and pumpkin. Add the water until the mix is smooth but not watery. Pour the mix into greased cupcake tins, filling them about three-fourths of the way. Bake for 18–20 minutes or until golden brown. Once they’re cooled, spread the vanilla icing on top. If you’re feeling particularly artsy or Julia Child-esque, sprinkle cinnamon and ginger on top.

Valentine’s Day is the one special day of the year when it’s socially acceptable to shower a loved one with extravagant displays of public affection. However, because we’re poor college students, it can be hard to find creative (but cheap!) ways to show your love. We’ve come up with a list of ideas of epic things to do on Feb. 14 that won’t break the bank.
Phipps Conservatory is a great idea for newer couples. With beautiful flower displays and free admission for Carnegie Mellon students, it’s a cute way to get to know someone without cleaning out your wallet.
For the more adventurous, outside-the-box couple, the Mattress Factory is a great option. The museum, which showcases contemporary installation art in the Mexican War Streets, has many interesting art displays, and admission is free for Carnegie Mellon students. James Turrell’s Pleiades is a special highlight — an installation in which you can sit with your significant other in the dark for 10 minutes.
To take a page out of A Walk to Remember, a picnic is a classic Valentine’s date. Make sure to pack your significant other’s favorite food, a towel to sit on, and some blankets to cuddle in. Don’t forget to bundle up; it’s cold outside! For bonus points, bring a telescope and a star map to stargaze.
For the most chick-flick-come-to-life date, try ice skating in Schenley Park at night. It’s a classic for a reason. Not only will it be cold (ensuring hand-holding), but the park will also have a special deal for the night. The entrance fee will be a mere $4 for the two of you, and although skate rentals are not included in that entrance fee, chocolates, roses, and mini-massages are included if you’re one of the first 175 couples there.
The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium is a great destination for people who aren’t looking for a super intimate date. In fact, it’s perfect for a double date, or even a group of friends. For $10 per person, you can explore seven different kinds of animal habitats. Just make sure to plan  for a couple of hours in your schedule so you can explore the entire zoo during your visit.
The Double Wide Grill at 2339 E. Carson St. is a great place to bring someone for a unique date; the restaurant is having a special zombie Valentine’s Day dinner. The average price per person ranges from $11 to $30, making this the priciest option on our list. But a zombie Valentine’s dinner is too fun to pass up. Make sure to dress to impress (the dead), and have a good time.
For students who have too much work, try a study date at Club Hunt. It might not be the most exciting option, but hey, at least you can finish that 251 homework! Just make sure to bring some flowers or chocolates to still make your study buddy feel special.
And last but not least, the forever-alone date is always an option. If you don’t have a significant other this Valentine’s Day, you can always buy plenty of chocolates, order Vocelli’s, and rent out some chick flicks. Invite some friends over and make fun night out of it!

The Carnegie Mellon School of Music kicked off its Brown Bag Chamber Music Concert series last Tuesday with the one sound Carnegie Mellon students just can’t seem to get enough of: the wail of bagpipes. Students, faculty, and any others who want to listen to some top-notch music while snacking or eating their lunches are invited to the concerts, which will take place in McConomy Auditorium at noon every Tuesday through March 12.
The concerts are an informal and (best of all) free way to reap some of the benefits of being on a campus brimming with so much talent. The performance opened with a number of bagpipe tunes by master’s student in bagpipe performance Andrew Bova — everything from marches to folksy jigs rooted in tales of one-eyed wives, 200-year-old feuds, and a lot of characters with the prefix “Mc” attached to their surnames. The sound of the pipes managed to cut above the hustle and bustle of the Employment Opportunities Conference outside the auditorium, as numerous heads popped in to investigate the source of that piece of Scottish heritage Carnegie Mellon holds so dear.
To make a point of the diversity of music one can expect to hear at these concerts, the second of the two acts on the bill changed gears dramatically: After 20 minutes of bagpipes, the program continued with master’s student in violin performance Xiowan Wu and master’s student in viola performance Rui Li playing a Mozart duet. The beautiful and gentle notes flowed out of the strings seamlessly, filling the room with a sound so full that any kind of alien noise (such as me unzipping my backpack) immediately stood out.
It’s always amazing that some individuals can really rock out whilst playing classical violin. Although they never quite reached the same intensity as a 16-year-old in his garage, or the energy of a performer like Mick Jagger, these two master’s students swayed their bodies to the swirl of the music and became completely engrossed in it. That’s just the kind of thing that Carnegie Mellon students project: a mix of technical precision and good, old-fashioned passion for what they’re doing.
So if you’re looking to whet your musical whistle,  support your classmates, or just listen to music while you chill and eat some lunch with friends, check out future events in the Brown Bag Chamber Music Concert series. There’s no guarantee that each performance will be as good as the first, but based on this strong opening, we can only expect good things.

Video performance artist and Carnegie Mellon alumna Shana Moulton (CFA ’04) creates kitschy and endearing work with a poppy aesthetic that contradicts its exploration of the hopelessness of the individual. As the first speaker of the 2013 School of Art Spring Lecture Series, Moulton spoke of her experiences both at Carnegie Mellon and after graduation, as well as her current work at the Andy Warhol Museum.
Moulton’s work is largely based on a fictional character formulated in her graduate years spent at Carnegie Mellon, named Cynthia. Cynthia is a hypochondriac and an agoraphobiac, stuck in endless delusional attempts to find comfort while being plagued by technicolor hallucinations. Cynthia’s environment is clean, loaded with pastel-colored products, and coated in false hope. Her series of videos — entitled “Whispering Pines” after the mobile home she grew up in — follow Cynthia in her quest to find fulfillment in all the wrong places: cheap “as-seen-on-TV” beauty products, fad diets, and televised wonders like The Antiques Roadshow.
Moulton began the talk with “a walk down memory lane”; she explained how the medical-inspired garments she made as a master’s student at Carnegie Mellon influenced the creation of Cynthia. She explained that, after creating a dress with a hemorrhoid pillow built in, she wondered what sort of character would wear this dress, and, subsequently, concocted Cynthia. After graduation, she spent two years abroad in an artist residency in Amsterdam, where Cynthia’s videos began to take shape, mirroring Moulton’s family’s experiences, such as her mother’s sleep terrors, a result of chemicals in artificial sweeteners.
Moulton showed two full seven-and-a-half-minute videos in her talk, as well as clips from several others, allowing the work to speak for itself. The presentation concluded in her reading an excerpt from an author who had reviewed her work, because, as she claimed, “I’m terrible at summing it up myself.”
The videos rely largely on strange after-effect elements, creating a trippy, kitschy aesthetic. Many ended with Cynthia doing a strange, rave-type dance, often with body parts superimposed with 
tye-die and spiral designs. “I use dance a lot as a kind of ultimate experience,” Moulton explained, laughing at how two of the clips she showed ended this way. “I don’t always dance at the end of my videos.”
Moulton was not a dynamic speaker, but her use of video and documentation made for a dynamic presentation. The “Whispering Pines” saga played on familiar tasteless products, like medication for Restless Leg Syndrome, Crystal Light, and other televised promises of comfort for the American home. The videos have a sad, ironic humor, ending in the realization that Cynthia’s wants, health, and spiritual desires are relatively obsolete; these are mirrored in the videos’ endings, with Cynthia feeling relatively unfulfilled or lacking the results that these products promised.
Recently, Moulton has begun using her body with several projections of the “Whispering Pines” world to create an interactive performance as Cynthia. On Friday she made an appearance at the Andy Warhol Museum for “Whispering Pines 10,” a one-act opera created by Moulton in collaboration with composer Nick Hallett and featuring vocalist Daisy Press.

Cincinnati-based band Walk the Moon performed at the Altar Bar in the Strip District last Wednesday. Noted for its indie pop and its hit “Anna Sun,” the band is no stranger to Pittsburgh or the Altar Bar — it opened for Neon Trees last August. Even for moderate fans, the show fostered an appreciation for what Walk the Moon tries to do: create a fun performance.
Similar to Mr. Small’s Theatre, another local tour stop for bands, the Altar Bar serves as a good location for smaller bands. The Altar Bar, a renovated church-turned-concert venue, provides both a sense of history as well as an intimacy you lose in other, larger locations.
Unlike Mr. Small’s, however, the Altar Bar is more accessible and easier to get to for young concert-goers. A majority of the crowd seemed to be high-school students, while the 21-and-over section seemed to be occupied by their parents. While this isn’t a bad thing in and of itself, having a noticeable age gap among the audience can be distracting.
The show started with Pacific Air, a Southern California-based band fronted by brothers Ryan and Taylor Lawhon. Similar to Walk the Moon, the band seemed to work in the indie pop genre. Singer Ryan Lawhon’s initial request that everyone get “sexy” was slightly awkward, considering that many people in the audience were either minors or adults bordering on menopause.
Pacific Air’s song “Float” stood out the most, with a catchy hook of whistling and a sing-along tune. However, the rest of the performance wasn’t original enough to be memorable. Ryan Lawhon had a swagger and style that was entertaining to watch, but for the most part, there was a lack of energy in the crowd throughout the opening act. The music sounded fine, but the lack of a distinct sound made it hard for the band to stand out.
This apathy ended when Walk the Moon took the stage after a short recording of Gene Wilder’s performance of “Pure Imagination” from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Performing two of the band’s most popular and up-tempo songs right off the bat — “Next in Line” and “Tightrope” — was a smart choice, infusing the crowd with a liveliness that was previously missing. Singer Nicholas Petricca’s frantic use of the bass drum and energetic shouts really helped kick off the show.
The performance continued at this pace for much of the show. It did noticeably die down, however, with the band’s performance of “Iscariot,” the slowest song of their debut, self-titled album. While it’s a beautiful track, and the slower pace was a welcome change from the energetic and sweaty ambience of the show, it was a jarring shift. Almost lullaby-like, the song felt out of place in an otherwise fun show.
That sense of fun, however, is exactly what the audience took away. Not only did the crowd enjoy the upbeat rhythm and tone of the songs, the band members, too, were visibly enjoying themselves. It was clear how much fun the members of Walk the Moon were having on stage, and how much they appreciated the chance to perform. Their rapport with the crowd was especially evident in their pre-encore performance of their most popular song “Anna Sun”; guitarist Eli Maiman had a huge smile on his face at the close of the song, repeatedly mouthing “thank you” to the crowd.
Little things like that really drove the atmosphere of the show home. Walk the Moon isn’t a serious band, and the members aren’t doing anything truly unique musically or performance-wise. Yet they excel at creating an environment where people can let loose and enjoy themselves — even if their parents are watching from the bar.

The glum shoegazers that make up indie pop band Veronica Falls return tomorrow with their sophomore album installation, Waiting for Something to Happen. The newest release is certainly a ray of sunshine in one of the year’s darkest months, suffused with jangling guitars, flowing harmonies, and bittersweet hooks.
Veronica Falls’ Waiting for Something to Happen is a euphoric departure from the brooding, punk-inspired tropes of “Right Side of My Brain” and “Beachy Feeling,” songs from the band’s 2011 self-titled album. Instead, it is a more polished and pop-inspired iteration of the last record, showing the band’s evolution into a more poised and confident entity.
The album’s emotional motif is one of coming to terms with growing up; the lyrics obsess over lost love and loneliness. “Teenage” — possibly the best song on the album — captures the fear and wonder we feel before we understand how fleeting young love can be. The song begins harmlessly enough, as Roxanne Clifford and James Hoare share lead vocals and a late-night ride. Melodic guitars and a driving rhythm section propel the couple through a lighter first verse, yet darkness dips in during the chorus. “Driving late at night, I’ll let you listen to the music you like,” Clifford croons, adding that she is “searching for a shooting star to point [her] in the right direction.”
Far from retreading the playful atmosphere of the debut, the band mines a richer, more emotionally resonant vein. Waiting for Something to Happen is weary with dead-end social scenes (“So Tired”) and the fear of your peers leaving you behind (“Everybody’s Changing”). In its entirety, the album embodies more achingly tender messages, from the touching love song “Broken Toy” (“I am broken, a broken toy like you”), to the gentle reverie “Daniel,” which strips the track to its bare essentials: shimmering guitar lines and perfectly harmonized vocals. Thematically, the album is a success in its portrayal of the advent of adulthood: Its sense of uncertainty is palpable.
Musically, the album is more self-assured than Veronica Falls’ last album. The opener, “Tell Me,” is representative of the release’s more muscular melodies. “Buried Alive” and “My Heart Beats” are similarly robust, featuring skewed drum beats and catchy vocals. Here, the band seems to fall somewhere in between the suburban surfer rock of bands like The Drums and the dreamy pop of The Dum Dum Girls. While Veronica Falls has retreated from its lo-fi roots, it has achieved the ranks of like-minded upbeat indie bands. Musical references to 1980s London nostalgia — including The Velvet Underground, The Pastels, and Echobelly — are so skillful that the songs, though not unlike London rock we have heard before, do not tire.
This most recent installation is enduring. Undoubtedly, Veronica Falls can stake its claim as one of the most gloriously unpredictable and invaluable bands the U.K. has right now.

Just over 25 years ago, a game called Final Fantasy appeared on store shelves in Japan for the Famicom (known to us as the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES). According to an interview in Beyond Final Fantasy — a bonus DVD from European versions of Final Fantasy X — the game’s creator, Hironobu Sakaguchi, truly believed it would be the last game he would ever make: hence, the ominous name. What he did not anticipate, however, was that Final Fantasy would be a gigantic hit, taking the video game world by storm and doing extremely well in both Japan and North America, where it was released almost three years later.
The game was first proposed around the time the original Dragon Quest was released; it had demonstrated that role-playing games could sell well. Its success was so great that a myth began circulating that after the third game in the series was released, Japan had to pass a law that Dragon Quest games could only be sold on weekends or holidays, because so many people were skipping school and work to stand in lines to purchase the games.
Mainly inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, Sakaguchi and his team wanted to make the then-standard of turn-based RPGs as close to Western pen-and-paper RPGs as possible, according to an interview with 1up.com. This meant introducing enemies with specific weaknesses, something the genre had long ignored. The game also allowed players to choose specific members of their four-person parties from a list of six different types: warrior, thief, black mage, white mage, red mage, and monk. The players therefore had much more control over their fates than in any other game before — a fate that could spell certain death if players chose their parties unwisely. It also allowed the player to see his party at all times, taking a third-person view in battles when the norm at the time was to switch to first-person during enemy encounters.
After the game did surprisingly well in both the Japanese and North American markets, video game developer Square (now known as Square Enix, after merging with Enix in 2003) naturally wanted to continue the series. Fourteen main-series and 32 spinoff games later, the Final Fantasy series continues to push and introduce new concepts to a genre that could have died off long ago — something it has done since inception. With Final Fantasy III came the job system, a tool with which players could change their characters’ types to allow for more diverse, complex, and powerful characters that were truly unique to the player. Final Fantasy IV was the first game to turn away from the classic “chosen hero” story formula and presented a truly compelling plot and backstory, something that has continued throughout the rest of the series — except perhaps in Final Fantasy V.
Final Fantasy VII brought the series into the third dimension on PlayStation and further developed amazingly deep story lines. The game featured internal mini-games that, unlike many games of the time, were somewhat enjoyable. With every new arrival of the series, Final Fantasy pushed and broke the boundaries and preconceptions of what an RPG was and could be.
This is not to say the series is without fault. The most recent addition to the spinoff collection, Final Fantasy All the Bravest for iOS, is an absolute abomination. The premise is simple: The players control a horde of heroes from the series and battle a horde of enemies. And that’s all there is. With the swipe a finger, every character that the player touches attacks. So where’s the appeal? The only really “new” element is that the characters from the 3-D games have been grotesquely turned into 32-bit representations of themselves.
However, in order to unlock any of the more famous and recognizable characters, one must pay an additional cost (something to the tune of $1 per character) — and that’s just for a random character. If this isn’t a clear example of what’s wrong with the gaming industry, I don’t know what is. The new sprites of the characters and locations in 32 bits is a little cool, but that’s as far as I’m willing to go with praise for this game (especially because it’s clear that the characters are not much more than recolored versions of each other).
The most recent blunder aside, the Final Fantasy series is a great beacon for others to aspire to. Some argue that the quality of the games has been dropping in recent years. However, I attribute this to the nostalgia factor: People view the games they grew up with as intrinsically better, much the same way I prefer A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back, even though the latter is clearly the better Star Wars film. Final Fantasy was the series that brought RPGs to the West, and for that alone it should always be held in high esteem, aside from being one of the greatest video game series ever made.

Dear Patrick,
My roommate never leaves the room. I mean never. I can’t masturbate in the bathroom because I live in Stever and we have communal bathrooms. My grades are dropping because all I can think about is masturbating. Do you have any recommendations on where I can get a fix? I’m thinking about Wean because I think that’s more isolated. Help a brother get his nut.
Thanks,
Cohabitant Here, I Can’t Keep Enjoying Nothing, Can’t Handle Ordeal, Kinky Eroticism Required
Dear CHICKEN CHOKER,
First, thank you for writing in! I haven’t gotten a real question in two years, so this is a real treat for me! My first advice would be to try to go home with a girl (or boy) at a party. But if you do, try not to make your desperate need for sex sound like you’re a drug addict (“Get a fix”? Seriously?). That’s a real turnoff.
You shouldn’t masturbate in public, but there are a lot of good places on campus to masturbate. Just try to go at night. The bathrooms in the bowels of Wean are always empty, although it does feel like you’re in a leaking submarine. Just remember to wear headphones if you bring your laptop in.
There’s a reason everyone wears flipflops in the showers,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My roommate can’t stop masturbating! I’ll walk out of the room for two seconds, and by the time I get back he has one hand in his pants and unspeakable things on his laptop. Our whole room is sticky. I came home from class early one day, and he made me wait outside until he finished. How can I get him to stop? Or at least control himself?
Thanks,
Mate’s Obstinate Nethers Keep Engaging, Yet Solitude Lacking And Puissant Privates Entertained Daily
Dear MONKEY SLAPPED,
This isn’t a real question, so I don’t have to answer it, but I might as well stick with this week’s theme. First, invest in some wet wipes. Just give your whole room a rub-down when you come home for the day. Once you’re done, why don’t you give your roommate a copy of this column? That way he’ll know where he can go to do his duty.
If he still insists on using your room, try getting him to use the old sock-on-the-doorknob trick so at least you won’t walk in on him. You could also try getting him a girlfriend. I’m sure any woman would be impressed by how soft his hands are.
Or just douse him in cold water,
Patrick Hoskins

The Master
7:30 10 12:30
Much has been said about The Master. Advertised as a Scientology exposé, audiences were startled to find a dense, demanding character study. Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are at the center of this film, playing an emotionally battered WWII vet and a charismatic cult leader, respectively, who enter into a deeply complicated relationship. Director Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest living cinematic maestros; he created the masterpieces There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights, and Punch-Drunk Love, all before his 40th birthday. The Master is a harrowing experiment that displays utterly electric cinematic force. Anderson continues his deconstruction of 20th-century America with one of the five best films of 2012 — a must-see.
Life of Pi
7:30 10 12:30
Anyone who has read the novel upon which this film is based will attest to its seemingly unfilmable structure and aesthetic. “But how do we get a tiger in that little boat?” they asked. “CGI, I guess,” replied some savvy studio executive. CGI, indeed. Life of Pi gives us an excruciatingly boring story mixed with some of the most unthinkably spectacular visual creativity. Director Ang Lee (_Brokeback Mountain_, Crouching Tiger, and Hidden Dragon) crafts the last 40 minutes of this film in an uncommon display of computer-generated spectacle. While the film hasn’t done particularly well in the American market, it is setting international records.
Flight
7:30 10 12:30
Denzel Washington turns in another admirable performance in this frustrating picture. He plays airline captain William “Whip” Whitaker, a pilot struggling with alcoholism and cocaine addiction. The film suggests an interesting premise — that we would rather be in a plane piloted by a cocaine-addicted but controlled drunk than by a sober, panicky stickler. But Flight is primarily concerned with punishing Whip for his addiction. Still, the movie contains one of the most exciting and excellent scenes of last year and a seriously convincing performance of oft-explored material by one of our greatest living actors.

The arrival of winter leads to the arrival of snow, and that calls for the hot drink that can warm up a frozen pair of hands like no other: hot chocolate. While only a simple mixture of warm milk and melted chocolate, this drink can do wonders for the weary, cold, and runny-nosed student. Choices are abundant on and around campus but are in no way equal, both in terms of taste and price. While some boast the rich complexity of good chocolate, others offer little more than warm water and sugar, making a taste test more than necessary during these times of cold and suffering. 
The Underground
The first, and possibly most questionable, choice of hot chocolate on campus can be found at the Underground. If students can brave the distinctive odors surrounding the campus eatery located under Morewood Gardens, $1.50 will get them a large hot chocolate. There is nothing commendable about the hot chocolate at the Underground. A first whiff from the paper CulinArt cup will reveal a cloyingly sweet scent, but the drink is more water than milk and the flavor more sugar than chocolate (justified by a film of undissolved sugar at the bottom of the cup). Though the drink is nothing special, it will give a tired student a warm pick-me-up with the swipe of a card. 
Tazza d'Oro 
At the bottom of the spiral in the Gates-Hillman Center you will find the wide glass windows of Tazza d'Oro. Though the most expensive choice on campus, at $2.75 for a small cup, the hot chocolate here does not taste very much of chocolate. An abundance of milk (an improvement over the Underground hot chocolate) lets through only a subtle cacao flavor. The drink is lukewarm and incapable of heating up a cold student fresh out of the snow. However, it boasts milk foam (not whipped cream) and has a creamy consistency thanks to the milk, not water, it contains. Though not the ideal drink to be holding when walking across campus in the cold, this hot chocolate avoids ready-made mixes and employs quality ingredients for those who are looking for more than heat and sugar. 
La Prima Espresso
La Prima Espresso in Wean Hall offers the best hot chocolate on campus. Though not much cheaper than Tazza d'Oro at $2.65 for a small cup, the hot chocolate here is hot, creamy, mildly sweet, and actually tastes of chocolate. The petite cup is topped with a dollop of milk foam and the milk in this drink tastes more like a complement to the chocolate than a flavor mask. This hot chocolate is truly creamy and will serve as a good companion during a chilly walk. It is perfectly balanced between mouth-scorching and warm, and the rush it gives comes from actual hot chocolate mix, not sugar.
Starbucks
As you venture off-campus, the choices are generally more promising with the exception of the closest choice, Starbucks. At $2.56 for a tall (or small), its price does not differ much from other hot drinks on campus. The first sip reveals an initial film of whipped cream, followed by a thin water/sugar concoction with a hint of chocolate flavor. A difference between the Starbucks hot chocolate and others with a water base is a mysterious creaminess that, while pleasant to some, will seem artificial to others. 
Bagel Factory
Again on Craig Street, right across from Starbucks, is the Bagel Factory. Though more well known for its obvious specialty, the hot drinks here are all of good quality. At $2.50 the small hot chocolate is the same price as the one at Starbucks but is creamier, less sweet, and generally tastes more like chocolate. The hot chocolate here will both warm and satisfy any individual retreating from the cold.
Crepes Parisiennes
The “chocolat chaud” (or hot chocolate) at Crepes Parisiennes, the small creperie at the end of Craig Street, is by far the best hot chocolate around Carnegie Mellon. A small disc of bitter chocolate poised on top of the drink as well as the highest price so far (at $3.85) reveals this hot chocolate's true character. It is not for the weak of heart. A first sip reveals a very rich, dense, dark chocolate taste and a creamy consistency. This is more than a drink, it is a dessert, and any tired, snow-frosted student deserves to have a sip of it at the end of a long day.

Carnegie Mellon University announced its selection of Subra Suresh as the university’s ninth president last Tuesday. Suresh will take office at Carnegie Mellon on July 1, succeeding President Jared Cohon after his 16 years of service.
Carnegie Mellon announced its selection to the university community with a campus-wide email from Ray Lane, chairman of Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees. The announcement marks the decision of the university’s presidential search committee, which is comprised of faculty and alumni and was established in 2012 to find a successor to Cohon.
Suresh announced his resignation as director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) last Tuesday in a letter to agency staff. The NSF is a $7-billion government agency charged with advancing all fields of fundamental science and engineering research and education. Since his appointment by President Barack Obama in August 2010, Suresh has established a record of accomplishments and support for international and interdisciplinary research and education, including programs like Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) and Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER).
Following Suresh’s announcement of his departure, the White House issued statement thanking Suresh for his service to the country: “We have been very fortunate to have Subra Suresh guiding the National Science Foundation for the last two years.”
Suresh also brings an illustrious background in academia. Prior to leading the NSF, Suresh was dean of the School of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he also holds an advanced degree in materials engineering and is distinguished as the Vannevar Bush Professor of Engineering. Suresh has also held faculty appointments at MIT in materials, mechanic, and biological engineering. At MIT, Suresh again developed a reputation for promoting interdisciplinary initiatives and research. Suresh has co-authored more than 240 research articles, and his name appears on 22 national and international patent applications, according to The New York Times.
Suresh marks the third consecutive Carnegie Mellon president with an advanced degree in engineering from MIT, following Cohon and Robert Mehrabian. Although this particular achievement was not part of the search committee’s criteria in evaluating candidates, Cohon states “Given the importance of engineering at Carnegie Mellon, it’s no surprise that people with experience in engineering line up well with Carnegie Mellon’s strengths.”
Cohon also added that Suresh’s experience at a prestigious research university  like MIT makes him a better fit for Carnegie Mellon’s decentralized culture. “He is very used to the type of decentralized and interdisciplinary approach that we have, since MIT operates in the same way,” he said.
“I think that CMU got a star, and I am excited to work hard and see what CMU can accomplish with Dr. Suresh at the helm,” said John Mackey, associate department head of mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon.
While his announcement to leave his post at the NSF in the middle of what was supposed to be a six-year term has left some of his colleagues puzzled, Suresh has expressed praise and admiration for Carnegie Mellon and describes the presidency as an offer he cannot turn down. “He knows that the university is better than its rankings and reputation implies,” Cohon said.
In an interview published in the Chronicle of Higher Education following Carnegie Mellon’s announcement of their selection, Suresh cites Carnegie Mellon’s interdisciplinary culture in particular. “We are particularly pleased that he has recognized the outstanding achievements of our faculty, students and alumni — many of whom are breaking new ground at the intersection of technology, business, and the arts,” Lane wrote in his email.
Since Suresh’s appointment as director in 2010, the NSF has recognized and supported Carnegie Mellon projects and research in engineering, computer science, and architecture with more than $7 million in grants, awards, and sponsorships.
This type of enthusiasm ties directly into the president’s role of promoting the university and growing its image.
Cohon, who worked during his tenure to increase the university’s prestige and expand its presence, describes the role of the president as “cheerleader-in-chief.” According to Cohon, the announcement of Suresh’s appointment alone has already raised awareness and recognition for Carnegie Mellon.
“The fact that he is international is a very important statement for us as a university and keeps us on a good trajectory to grow our global brand,” commented senior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner, who also serves as Carnegie Mellon’s student body president. “I think he is the perfect choice to put us on level with the few other top- tier institutions that are considered ‘better’ than CMU.”
Suresh’s departure from the NSF and appointment at Carnegie Mellon comes at a time when both organizations face the effects of possible mandatory 5 percent cuts in federal spending as part of government austerity measures. “His understanding of research universities, including his career at MIT and his directorship of the NSF, will be important to us as we navigate the ever-changing world of federally funded research,”  Randal Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science, commented.
“The university needs an advocate who will secure federal research funding and long-term financial resources for Carnegie Mellon, even as the federal budget faces sequestration,” Cohon said. “I can’t think of anyone more qualified than Dr. Suresh.”
Suresh, his wife, and their two daughters will be on campus on Feb. 21 for a welcome celebration, and the family will be relocating to Pittsburgh over the summer. Cohon states that he will spend as much time with Suresh as he needs to get him settled in to his new job.
Cohon will be taking a year of leave after Suresh takes office. After that year, Cohon plans to return to Carnegie Mellon as a professor of civil and environmental engineering.

Sarah was a first-year at Carnegie Mellon when a friend sexually assaulted her.
“One night when I was really drunk I somehow ended up at his apartment,” she said. “He’s a cool guy, but he was drunk too. And I started kissing him and it was fine — like, I was fine with that — and then he went further and then I said no, but then he kept on continuing and I was drunk at the time so … I kind of just went with it.”
“That’s my story. It’s a very typical college [story],” Sarah, now a senior, added.
Her story is indeed typical of many experiences of university women. According to a study released last year by the Department of Justice (DOJ), nearly one in four college women are victims of rape or attempted rape. At Carnegie Mellon — which has 2,664 undergraduate women, according to the university’s institutional research and analysis department — that means that over 660 female undergraduate students are likely to have experienced sexual assault or attempted sexual assault by the time they graduate. The DOJ also reported that 90 percent of those women know their attackers.
And many, including Sarah, never report the assault. The DOJ estimates that fewer than 5 percent of college women who are victims of rape or attempted rape report it the police. The Carnegie Mellon University Police Department said in its Annual Security and Fire Safety Report that only four police reports of forcible sex offenses had been filed in 2011; only one was filed in 2010; and six were filed in 2009.
University students have an alternative to filing a police report, though: Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 mandates that universities have a disciplinary procedure for students to file complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. At Carnegie Mellon, this means that students can file a report through a Sexual Assault Advisor (SAA) and have their cases handled by the University Disciplinary Committee (UDC).
According to Gina Casalegno, dean of Student Affairs, 24 such reports were filed in 2012. But the lack of reports doesn’t mean that sexual assault isn’t a problem at Carnegie Mellon: As Casalegno said in an interview, “I don’t think we have any more or any fewer problems here. I think this is a societal problem.”
Rebecca Jacobs, an SAA and senior psychology and Hispanic studies double major, agreed that sexual assault is a problem — even at Carnegie Mellon. “I don’t think people realize that it happens as much as it actually does. I think … there’s the whole joke and perception that people aren’t having sex here, [but] people are having sex here,” she said. “And just because CMU is a very unique school and a very unique experience doesn’t mean that it’s isolated from the statistics and the world of sexual assault.”
Fear of coming forward
The DOJ cites fear of retribution as a reason why many women don’t file a report, but Jeannine Heynes, the coordinator of gender programs, often sees another reason why students don’t pursue disciplinary cases.
When speaking to sexual assault survivors, she said, she often hears “ ‘I don’t want to go forward with it, I don’t want to get this person in trouble’ — they say that a lot, ‘I don’t want to ruin this person’s life’…. Very often survivors choose not to do anything at all. It’s somebody that they know, it’s somebody that they run in circles with, it’s somebody that they probably care about, and so more likely than not, they don’t want to go forward.”
Jacobs also said that part of the reason why people don’t report is because sexual assault is too difficult to talk about. “All control is being taken away from you. It’s very violating: This is like the most intimate thing that someone can be doing [to you],” she said.
Sarah had similar reasoning for not filing a report. “I don’t think there were bad intentions on his part. I think it was just, like, a situation where he was really drunk and he didn’t realize what was happening,” she said. “Because he’s a nice guy ... I don’t think it was him trying to take advantage of me.”
The role of alcohol
Alcohol is a frequent characteristic of sexual assault cases on college campuses; the DOJ reports that in three quarters of college rapes, the offender, the victim, or both had been drinking. Casalegno said that, in the cases she’s seen reviewed at Carnegie Mellon, “alcohol is a significant factor for both parties that are involved in an incident that ultimately could be determined as sexual assault.”
But Heynes is also quick to point out that intoxication is not an excuse for assault. “Two drunk people getting together — ‘I was too drunk to realize that she was too drunk’ — it makes for a very gray area in terms of investigation, but it’s not a gray area in terms of you’re always responsible for your actions. And if you were too drunk, that’s your fault…. You needed to get consent,” Heynes said.
Another problem with sexual assault is that “people are not aware of what consent is and what’s involved,” Heynes said. “I think people don’t realize that the absence of ‘no’ is not consent. So I think sometimes we get particularly in a masculinized culture of ‘see how far you can get.’ And if she’s silent, then just keep going, keep going, keep going. And that is so wrong, right? That is so wrong.”
“And very many people say ‘She didn’t say no’ or ‘She didn’t push me away’ or ‘I just thought she was into it.’ It is the responsibility of that other person to ask, ‘Is this okay? Is this how far you want to go?’ ” she continued. “So silence from a partner is not consent.”
Heynes also clarified that women are not the only victims of sexual assault. “Most of the reports that we get are men that sexually assault women, but I’ve had reports of men sexually assaulting other men,” she said. 
“I think another thing is that I don’t think we talk enough about women asking men. I think there’s that idea that men are completely 100 percent always ready for sex, right? And it’s the women that we have to sort of convince,” Heynes said. “But I think there also needs to be a culture of women asking as well.”
Assault Education
In order to better educate students about sexual assault, Casalegno said, “we’ve totally revamped our training and our review of policy and resources and discussion of the issues at play with sexual assault and sexual violence” for first-year Orientaton.
“It’s something we do try to be in touch with in programming [for Orientation], and even this year, definitely we changed up the sex skit a lot,” said Will Weiner, a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major who was a head orientation counselor this past fall. As student body president, Weiner is on the committee that has been overseeing the changes to the university’s sexual assault and harassment policies. “After [talking to] people in Student Life who are involved with working with [sexual assault], we’re saying, you know, ‘What is the message we’re trying to get across?’ ”
Weiner added, “I think it’s very much a freshman year issue and then goes away, at least in terms of conscientious messaging. Obviously there’s stuff that will be happening unfortunately throughout the four years, but I feel like messaging-wise it’s very much a freshman year thing.”
However, as Heynes pointed out, they only had “five, 10 minutes in front of first-year students who’ve got so much on their mind. I don’t know — hopefully it was effective.” 
Several first-years, when asked what they remembered from Orientation, recalled “Condom Man” far more easily than any education about sexual assault.
Jillian, a first-year economics major, could recall a skit focusing on sexual assault, but couldn’t remember many specifics. When asked if she thought if Carnegie Mellon was on par with the national average in regards to sexual assault, she replied, “I think at CMU it’s probably below, but I do know of this girl [who was assaulted], so it’s not, like, nonexistent.”
Alex James, an undecided Dietrich College first-year, “actually missed everything on that because I had soccer during most of the Orientation events.” Because of his practice schedule, the only Orientation events he attended were Playfair and House Wars.
According to a report on acquaintance rape released by the DOJ, this one-time educational effort is insufficient. “The Educational programs should involve multiple intervention efforts, with repeated and reinforced exposure to the issue,” the report stated.
Raising awareness
Administrators and students are now trying to do more to broaden awareness and education. Casalegno said that they have begun to do more outreach programming in Greek life communities and in residence halls.
Also, Jacobs and three other students — Michelle Ruiz, a junior chemical engineering major; Rachael Schmitt, a sophomore Dietrich College student; and Esha Shanbhogue, a senior mechanical and biomedical engineering double major — form the executive board for Got Consent?, an organization that works with the nonprofit Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) to spread awareness and education about sexual assault.
This week, in honor of Valentine’s Day, the group will be tabling in the University Center and handing out free greeting cards, posters, candy, and condoms. 
“A lot of people are worried about how to ask if something’s okay without killing the mood,” Jacobs explained. “It’s supposed to teach people what’s a sexy way to ask [for consent].”
At this year’s MOSAIC, Carnegie Mellon’s community-wide gender conference, “one of the things we’re going to address … is this idea of the hookup culture,” Heynes said. 
“It’s this idea that people are coming to parties in order to get drunk in order to hook up. And it sort of goes against everything that consent and healthy relationships and knowing yourself and taking care of others is about.” The conference, themed “The Naked Truth,” will take place Feb. 23 and 24 in the University Center.
Other events planned for the semester include a Take Back the Night event in late March, which is a protest against sexual violence; a “What’s In Your Cup?” campaign during Carnival, which will encourage students to be conscientious about what they’re drinking and to be wary of accepting drinks from others; and a Clothesline Project, during which sexual assault survivors and their allies will design T-shirts that speak out against sexual assault and then hang the shirts publicly on campus.
In the meantime, Jacobs encourages sexual assault survivors on campus to talk to an SAA, even if they don’t want to file a report. 
“The great thing about SAAs is that we’re your peers. I know that it can be scary to try and talk about this to someone who you see as being in a position of authority.... You should never feel ashamed about anything that you’ve done that would stop you from coming to talk to somebody about it.”

This spring break, a number of Carnegie Mellon student organizations will still go on both domestic and international trips, despite last year’s funding cuts by the Joint Funding Committee (JFC).
Last spring, the JFC made the decision to stop allocating money for travel expenses incurred by these trips, making it difficult for many organizations to keep their travel budgets. 
Organizations attending trips this year include ENACTUS, Engineers Without Borders, Alternative Spring Break, Habitat for Humanity, and the Global Medical Brigades.
“We’re not saying spring break trips aren’t good; we’re not saying they’re not valuable; we just have a finite amount of resources, especially considering that last year was the toughest year we ever had,” said Jon Mark, senior lighting design major and student body vice president for finance, about the decision to cut spring break trip funding.
Student Body President Will Weiner, senior decision science and economic and statistics double major, agrees that spring break trips are valuable for students, but at the same time represent a significant portion of the JFC’s budget. “It’s not they we didn’t think they are valuable, we did, and I still think they are; it’s that we just didn’t have the money, so you had to make a judgment call,” he said.
The absence of the JFC’s funding leaves many organizations with a funding gap, which they are trying to fill by asking the Student Senate for special allocations. Special allocations, as stated in the Senate Fiscal Policy article IV, section A, should “provide financial support for events and organizations that benefit Carnegie Mellon University’s undergraduate students.”
William Elmore, member of the Senate finance committee and junior engineering and public policy and civil engineering double major, described the process student groups go through to get funding from the Senate, JFC, or any other student government body.
“Organizations apply, and then I set up a meeting between them and the finance committee, and then the committee makes a recommendation to the general body, and then the general body votes,” Elmore said.
Over the past two weeks the Senate has been debating whether or not to follow the JFC’s precedent regarding the funding of organizations taking spring break trips. According to Elmore, Student Senate has about $70,000 of the money generated from the student activities fee to allocate.
“[The Senate] doesn’t have to go specifically with the word of the JFC, so they’re kind of in a philosophical debate now about how they spend their money to possibly help these groups get off their feet,” Weiner said.
In light of the JFC’s decision to stop funding travel expenses for organizations going on spring break trips, the Student Senate executive committee came up with three possibilities for making decisions about these organizations. One possibility is following the JFC and not allocating any money to any of the groups. Another would be to fund up to 5 percent of travel costs. The Senate could also make a decision based on the travel metric, which gives $194 per person going on the trip. This way, each traveler gets his or her student activities fee back but nothing more.
Senate Chair Bianka Roy, a senior in materials science and engineering, makes it clear that the Senate is not bound to one of these three options, but rather “It’s more like three philosophies, and weighing the pros and cons for each philosophy. And we presented those three to the group to say that these are what you can argue; if this is what you believe, then you should vote for it.”
Organizations are also receiving some financial assistance this year from the department of student affairs. 
Mark sent an email to the heads of organizations going on spring break trips, saying “I brought this up with Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno to see if her division might be able to provide financial assistance. We met on Monday, and it looks like [the department of student affairs] will be able to provide some level of financial assistance, for this year only.”
Mark said that Casalegno would be able to provide “anywhere in the range of five to seven thousand” for all the organizations in question, writing in his email that “this money is in lieu of JFC funding, and not associated with Senate or [the Graduate Students Association].”
Casalegno said in an email, “We have a long-standing commitment to allocate money from Student Affairs to alternative break experiences, which are typically funded through the Tartans Abroad funding process for international trips and through the DOSA funding committee for domestic trips. This year I have offered to assist with additional funding given the impact of JFC cuts and other reductions in funding sources for many groups.”
Organizations typically also receive funding from other sources, including their own fundraising efforts, member dues, grants, academic departments within Carnegie Mellon, and donations from alumni. Every organization going on a spring break trip this year is on probation with the JFC for overspending their budgets in past years.
Mark said, “If [a group] overspends more than 10 percent of their budget, they get put on supervised probation; if it’s over 25 percent, they’re put on controlled probation. And so, if you’re on controlled probation, you have to be on supervised [probation] the next year.”
“It’s important to note that, the way our system is set up, it’s very easy for a group to be put on probation. Just because they have that label doesn’t mean that they’re struggling or that something is necessarily wrong,” Roy said.
Mark is putting measures in place this year to prevent overspending. 
He said, “One of the ways that I’m curtailing that this year is that all of these groups that are on probation, they have to sign agreements to say that the member has to pay the difference at the end.”
As special allocation requests from spring break organizations are received, the Senate will make decisions based on the options outlined by the executive committee and additional input from the Senate body.
Roy said that the priority, in the end, is always the well-being of the university and the student body.
“I just think it’s important for everyone to know that we do take these allocations really serious, and we as the executive committee and the Senate have spent countless hours debating, looking at the facts, looking at different philosophies, thinking about how we can properly allocate money to our constituents and really try to help them the best way that we can, being fair to the entire university,” she said.

The university will be issuing tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction of the Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall, Carnegie Mellon Treasurer Jay Calhoun recently announced.
Scott Hall will be the new home for nanofabrication, the biomedical engineering program, and the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation; it will be located between Wean and Roberts Hall and  will link Hamerschlag, Porter, Roberts, and Wean Hall in an attempt to provide greater campus connectivity. 
The project is estimated to cost $95 million, consisting of $35 million in gifts and $60 million in bond financing. Issuing bonds is selling debt: The issuer owes the holder money and is required to repay them with interest. Initial investors who buy the bonds tend to be larger institutions. 
Carnegie Mellon decided to borrow $60 million, because this amount allows the university to retain its Standard and Poor’s AA– credit rating. This credit rating, along with its stable outlook, is a “strong rating,” according to Calhoun.
Additionally, the interest rates are currently at a historical low, and according to Calhoun, it is a “good time to borrow.” 
Carnegie Mellon is issuing bonds in a tax-exempt environment, allowing for lower borrowing costs. Although this type of environment could lead to use restrictions on the building, the situation with Scott Hall is consistent with the rules of the tax-exempt market.
“One of the things that is really attractive about this building is that we expect a lot of the work that will be done in the building [by researchers] will be sponsored more often than not by various federal government entities,” Calhoun said. “In that case, take a particular contract from, let’s say, the Department of Energy: They allow us to recover indirect costs, including the costs of space.... There should be a good stream of income coming back to us from research sponsors.” 
There is, however, risk involved with increasing debt. Although the debt is at a fixed interest rate, meaning the cost of the debt will not increase, it has pushed Carnegie Mellon closer to a lower, A+ credit rating. “If we had unfortunate economic events — let’s say we had another crisis-like year in the investment market and we lost 20 to 30 percent of the value of our endowment, — those kinds of things could have a greater impact because we are that much closer to that boundary,” Calhoun said. “There are lots of things that can happen to your financial condition, some of which you control, some of which you don’t.”
Furthermore, there is concern about what government research funding will look like in the future, and about how demographics indicate that college enrollments are dropping.
Sophomore business major Ari Halevy thinks that the risk was worth taking. “The government has had a strong history of funding university research since the 1940s, even when the private sector couldn’t afford to,” he said. “Regardless of the future state of our economy, the federal stream of funds will remain relatively stable in comparison to other government programs.”
Dahiana Jimenez, a sophomore statistics major, said,  “Predictions are not reassuring. Believing that there will be a lot of research sponsors is not the same as having them already lined up. I believe that selling the bonds will be worth the risk if there is a concrete list of enough research sponsors committed to the programs, and if there is a guarantee that tuition rates will not increase because of it.”
Carnegie Mellon currently has $509 million in long-term debt, including the new $60 million issued in bonds.

The article "Reports reveal allocation of university spending" (News, Feb. 4) misstated that the number of Carnegie Mellon employees is 12,539. It should be clarified that this figure includes university contractors. Additionally, the data on the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and Carnegie Mellon's total operating expenses were misstated. They should be $75,536,000, $71,220,000, and $966,321,000, respectively.
The photo accompanying the article "Mike McDermott jumps and vaults to UAA success" (Sports, Feb. 4) was mistakenly credited Kate Groschner as a Staff Photographer. She is the Photo Editor. 
Will Weiner was mistakenly referred to as a fifth-year student in multiple articles in the Feb. 4 issue. He is a senior.

Time to ask yourself the age-old annual college question: Where are you living next semester? As Housing and Dining Services begins its housing fairs and prepares to introduce its StarRez application for handling room assignments, Carnegie Mellon students have big decisions to make regarding where they will be sleeping next fall. With options ranging from West Wing to Webster Hall, it’s time to start evaluating where to live and why.
Living on campus has its benefits, especially for students without cars and those very involved in extracurricular activities. Remaining on campus also means that basic necessities like toilet paper and paper towels are always at one’s disposal. Besides these perks, staying on campus also takes a lot of the work out of being a resident.
Imagine if you move off campus and your window breaks; Facilities Management Services isn’t going to come make sure your bedroom window closes for you. Perhaps you and your roommate have disagreements over your heater’s temperature during the winter months and about how to split the utilities bill. Maybe your roommate decides to take a leave of absence, leaving you with a greater fraction of the rent. Unexpected problems like these often trouble those living on campus, but at least they are left with no financial obligation.
One of the most common arguments for moving off campus goes something like this: “In real life, you don’t have the option to live on campus, so you might as well get used to it starting now.” While I agree with the sentiment and concur that real life is nothing like on-campus housing, what’s the rush in moving off campus? If you are going to have to eventually live “off campus,” why do it before you must? 
I don’t see any harm in living on campus for a few more years. Furthermore, you’ll probably never again have the opportunity to live in a hallway where you know many of the residents and can casually walk into their bedrooms without being considered inappropriate or downright creepy.
Living on campus also allows students to stay engaged in campus activities. Whether it’s grabbing free food from a resident assistant, chatting with floormates, or stumbling upon a cool event on a corner of campus, chance encounters are far less likely to occur for students who don’t live on campus. How often has someone offered you a free meal as you walked down Beeler Street?
While I do see the practical benefits of cheaper rent, more space, and the absence of a campus authority, I don’t think they are compelling enough to justify living off campus. It’s easy to miss a payment on a bill or to get fed up with choosing between walking home from Club Hunt late at night or waiting for the shuttle to take you to your off-campus destination. 
In the end, I’d rather stay on campus and feel like a part of the vibrant campus community, even if it means paying a bit more.

Carnegie Mellon announced Subra Suresh as its choice for the new university president last Tuesday. Set to take office on July 1, Suresh is currently the director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), and has served as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s dean of engineering. According to The New York Times, he also co-authored more than 240 journal articles, registered 21 patents, and wrote three books on materials science.
The Tartan congratulates Suresh on becoming our new president, and thanks the members of the Presidential Search Committee for their excellent choice. 
Suresh is extremely qualified for the position — given his past experience in leadership roles — and has shown a strong commitment to the advancement of academic and scientific research throughout his career.
Although Suresh left his position at the NSF four years earlier than the date specified by his six-year term, his decision to leave does not appear to be an indication of his work ethic. 
The university stated in an official email that Suresh is “a strategic and visionary leader who will build upon [Carnegie Mellon’s] global reputation for innovation and excellence in education, research, and entrepreneurship....”
We hope that Suresh will strive to not only maintain but also advance our school’s achievement, standing, and rigorous academic community.
Additionally, we hope that the recent ongoing discussion about our community’s health and well-being will not be overlooked during this presidential transition. 
The need to address some of our school’s cultural shortcomings must be recognized in the period during and after this momentous leadership change.
Noting that Suresh is the director of the NSF, it is important that he continue to promote our arts and humanities programs too.
We hope for the best from our incoming president and commend the university on its selection.

Though it may seem strange to think of it in the middle of winter, the world is getting warmer. The year 2012 was the hottest on record for the continental United States, according to climatecentral.org.
Last summer, 19 states had their warmest year on record, and 48 states experienced above-average temperatures. Furthermore, 2012 had the second-highest number of extreme-weather; the number of heat waves, droughts, and wildfires that hit the country ensured that. 
What’s more, global temperatures worldwide have begun to increase each year. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, each year since 1980 has been recorded as warmer than average.
With these startling facts, you would think that climate change would spur a great deal of discussion in politics and media. However, that is not the case. 
Despite the impact climate change has on our lives, reporting on climate change has decreased in 2012, according to The Huffington Post. In fact, early this year, The New York Times announced it was disbanding its environmental desk, which was responsible for publishing stories on climate change.
Although I disapprove of how little climate change is discussed in the media, part of me can understand why it is a relatively unpopular topic. Much of the scientific evidence related to climate change is not easily relatable to everyday life; few people are invested in constant squabble over statistics on melting arctic ice or rising concentration of greenhouse gases as opposed to, say, gun control or illegal immigration. This makes emphasizing the dangers of climate change very difficult; many people find it difficult to explain how a few melting ice caps can spur semi-apocalyptic scenarios.
Furthermore, much of the discussion over climate change has been unnecessarily politicized. The oil industry and certain politicians often question whether climate change is real, despite the fact that nearly all scientific literature agrees that climate change is happening, and that a great deal of it can be attributed to human actions.
Even though climate is a drab issue, there is really no reason not to discuss it. 
In whatever way we can, we should attempt to facilitate discussion over climate change. There must be some way to make the topic more palatable for the average person to understand, perhaps through emphasizing more of the human role in climate change.
It may be the fact that certain climate change activists are too heavy in their messages. For example, many people disliked An Inconvenient Truth because they felt that it exaggerated the effects of climate change and that it had too much of an alarmist tone. Al Gore and his documentary were heavily mocked on shows like South Park for this reason. We could try to be more positive in our discussion of climate change and focus on ways in which people could reduce its effects.
Action is more important than ever. Each year we don’t act, we release 6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to discovery.com. 
We need to find a way to reduce that number and, in turn, reduce the number of storms, droughts, and heat waves that have resulted from climate change. The consequences of inaction are very real, and have human costs.

In light of a recent article in The New York Times describing the death of college-age Adderall user Richard Fee, it is important to remember that Adderall and other  stimulants are not the route to academic success.
Here at Carnegie Mellon, the use of stimulants may not seem as prevalent or widely discussed as on other college campuses. It is not uncommon, though, to hear students talk about using Adderall in the library or other studying facilities, especially during finals week.
While prescription medications used to treat A.D.D. and A.D.H.D. may seem like the answer to a tired brain before a late night of studying, it is important to consider the effects of these pills. 
There are better ways to achieve success in college without using stimulants.
There are serious risks associated with Adderall, including physical and psychological dependence, extreme nervousness, and hallucinations, according to prescriptiondrugabuse.org. 
Let’s not forget that using prescription drugs without a doctor’s approval is illegal.
Even when prescribed, Adderall can cause one out of every 400 patients to experience suicidal thoughts or psychotic behavior, according to a study by The American Journal of Psychiatry in 2006.
Despite these negative side effects, college students across the nation use stimulants to try to perform better academically.
The New York Times concluded “8 percent to 35 percent of college students take stimulant pills to enhance school performance.”
There are a variety of alternatives to Adderall and other stimulants that are not drugs, which can help students finish their studying and assignments at appropriate (or inappropriate) times in the evening.
You can find a companion from the same class — someone who can provide thought-provoking questions related to the assignment — off of whom you can bounce ideas. Alternatively, you can plan ahead before the assignment’s due date.
Even late night snacks can serve as motivation for finishing 30 pages of reading or one page of an essay. A positive mind can do wonders for the brain as well.
In any case, Adderall and other stimulants should never be the answer for completing assignments or studying. Sometimes, sleep may even be the best answer.

Everyone who has met me knows that I like scary movies and the month of October more than your average Halloween fanatic. I have a box of Halloween decorations hidden in my apartment, a banner reading “Be Very Afraid” above my bed, and a collection of horror movies on a living room shelf.
Recently, I started watching American Horror Story’s first season on Netflix. Even though my friends know how much I like the horror genre, many of them still wonder how I can stand watching movies and shows like this.
While I can’t give a singular answer to that question, I can pinpoint aspects of the horror genre that make my spine tingle with pleasure.
It’s about the story. Yes, many horror movies consist of mediocre acting and unoriginal plots. Some people also say that horror movies are pointless gore-fests created to make a few bucks at the box office.
While these stereotypes can be seen in some movies, there are, without a doubt, several horror movies with dynamic plots that leave audiences thinking them over for days. Final plot twists can make or break a movie, and horror movies produce the best ones. Even though the gore in the original Saw may be too much for some people, try guessing who the killer is before the credits roll.
Believe it or not, some horror movies even bring fresh ideas to the film industry. Remember the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project and the popularity of found-footage films after its release? It may not have been the first found-footage film, but it was definitely the first to do it right.
It’s also about the scares. I’m a T-type, or thrill-seeker. I like roller coasters and almost any other amusement park ride. The more loops, the better. It’s no surprise that I like the rush that comes when watching horror movies. There’s nothing more exhilarating than rising tensions that end in a scare. I attribute my enthusiasm for Paranormal Activity to this reasoning. The directors of the series know how to create tension from the tiniest creaks, while slowly building to a satisfying scare.
Finally, the horror genre is about characters; characters are my favorite part of horror stories. The actors themselves may not be memorable, but their characters are. Sometimes, the characters you grow to love the most can turn out to be your worst nightmare, but somehow you still root for them. The Uninvited, based on a South Korean film, introduced me to two of my favorite horror film characters — Anna and Alex. Without spoiling the movie, these sisters defend themselves against their father’s new lover, who they believe is trying to kill them. By the end of the movie, their judgments cause unnecessary deaths. Regardless, you can’t help but feel sympathetic for them.
Horror movies may not be for everyone, and I know I’ll never convince the people who say I’m crazy for liking them otherwise. One thing’s for certain, though: The horror movie genre has been around for so long that the creators must be doing something right.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett announced the state budget proposal last Tuesday to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Because Corbett’s popularity is low — according to CBS Pittsburgh, only 31 percent of Pennsylvanians believe he deserves re-election — the proposal may prove to be crucial for Corbett. This year, Corbett proposed measures to provide greater financial support to Pennsylvania public schools and higher education. While the proposed funding is only a small step in the right direction, it is a step for which Corbett should be commended.
Funding for education is fundamental to the continued success of the region and the state as a whole. New efforts to bring back support for schools should be applauded.
In the budget, Corbett aims to privatize liquor businesses and distributors. This change could result in an extra $1 billion for Pennsylvania’s education system, $90 million of which would go to basic public schools, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. This new proposal is a drastic change from last year’s budget, which slashed the budget of public higher education institutions, such as Pennsylvania State University, by over 30 percent, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.
There are those who doubt that the budget proposal will succeed. Some people, such as David Fillman, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, say the pension cuts required by the budget would be highly contested, according to the Trib. Politicians on both sides of the aisle seem to have major issues with the budget. These qualms may indicate that Corbett is doing something right — not trying to appeal solely to a single party.
Politics aside, increased funding for Pennsylvania schools is vital to the state’s well-being. Ensuring that institutions are able to both provide  top-quality education for students. Continuing to support life-changing research is crucial to Pennsylvania’s future.

Kyle Henson’s column on on Jan. 28 was an ill-informed and hysterical piece that added little to the gun control debate. 
His treatment of executive orders was downright embarrassing. Although he tries to depict them as an usurpation of power by President Obama, in fact the first executive orders date back to the time of President Washington, with their justification generally traced to Article II of the Constitution. Obama’s executive orders, which Henson amusingly never actually describes in detail, followed the exact purpose he claims they should have — providing guidance on how to enforce laws.
More troubling is his poorly thought-out attitude toward the Constitution. The Constitution was written in the 18th century, in a context completely alien to anything Mr. Henson would recognize, both politically and culturally. A multicultural nation of 300 million people cannot be governed in the same way as a small, slave-holding frontier nation. If, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has tried to claim, the Constitution is dead, it would need to be taken to the morgue and replaced with a living document.

Carnegie Military University: That’s what David Meieran, a Pittsburgh activist, has dubbed Carnegie Mellon, alluding to the fact that Carnegie Mellon participates extensively in research for the Department of Defense, the CIA and other military-related organizations. But how extensive are Carnegie Mellon’s ties with the U.S. military?
Meieren claims that every department at Carnegie Mellon has some ties with the military, specifically naming the Psychology Department, the Philosophy Department, the Software Engineering Institute, and, of course, the Robotics Institute, which works largely on the idea of future combat systems, a vision that more armed forces will be unmanned, operating on elaborate network and robotics systems.
Some robotics projects include Gladiator (an unmanned combat vehicle equipped with an M-35 machine gun, and a launcher that can fire CS gas), Crusher (an unmanned ground vehicle), and Dragon Runner (a surveillance vehicle).
Many other projects are confidential and occur at two secluded facilities in Lawrenceville, where 40th street ends at the Allegheny River. The facilities (known as the NREC and Carnegie Robotics) span ~350,000 sq. ft. and are monitored by at least a handful of armed security personnel nearly 24/7.
Meieran also points out that Jared Cohen, Carnegie Mellon’s now-retiring president, sat on the Homeland Security Council, from which the university has secured over $100 million in funding.
Considering the evidence, Meieran seems very justified in dubbing the university Carnegie Military University, but should we be concerned with Carnegie Mellon’s ties with military?
To those in support of U.S. foreign policy, Carnegie Mellon’s work on future combat systems is praiseworthy due to the future possibility of reduced U.S. casualties. To Meieran and the vast majority Pittsburgh’s younger population, it comes as a disappointment that many of the brightest minds in our country are utilizing their talents to enable the United States’ aggressive foreign policy.
For those disappointed with Carnegie Mellon’s military ties, there is hope. Last week, in response to widespread criticism of Carnegie Mellon’s stress culture, administrators held a town hall and have been considering drastic changes. This implies that the administration values feedback from the community and that change is possible.
In light of U.S. foreign policy being substantiated in our own backyard, the question remains, “Do we care to enough to take a stand for peace?”
If so, I urge you to email Raymond Lane, the chairman of the board of directors for Carnegie Mellon, at rjl@andrew.cmu.edu and Carnegie Mellon’s incoming president, Subra Suresh, at ssuresh@mit.edu to let them know that any benefits resulting from military funding are far outweighed by the destruction caused from bolstering an aggressive foreign policy.
