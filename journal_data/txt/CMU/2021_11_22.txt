With the conclusion of the 2021 Internationaux de France, the 2021-22 International Skating Union (ISU) Grand Prix of Figure Skating is approaching its climax: the ISU Grand Prix Final, scheduled to take place in Osaka, Japan during the second week of December.
Yuma Kagiyama of Japan won his second gold of the series, recording both the highest short program score and the highest free skate score to finish over 20 points ahead of his closest competitor. Having also won the Gran Premio d’Italia earlier this month, Kagiyama moves into the top qualifying position for men’s singles with a total of 30 points, ahead of fellow countryman Shoma Uno and American Vincent Zhou. With Kagiyama, Uno, Zhou, and American Nathan Chen guaranteed to appear in the Grand Prix Final, just two spots remain in the men’s singles category.
American Jason Brown is sitting in the fifth position with 24 points after the Internationaux de France, with Shun Sato of Japan closely behind with 22 points. Neither are fully secure in their current position, however, with Russians Mikhail Kolyada (13 points) and Evgeni Semenenko (11 points) scheduled to compete this week in the Rostelecom Cup. Brown is in a relatively safer spot, as there are only two scenarios where he does not qualify for the Grand Prix Final: either Semenenko winning gold at the Rostelecom Cup as well as Kolyada winning silver, or Kolyada winning gold at the Rostelecom Cup while Semenenko wins silver and puts up a combined score higher than 267.74 points (over nine points better than his current personal best combined-score of 258.45). In contrast, Sato’s chances of making the Grand Prix Final are slim to none. Either a podium finish by Kolyada or a top-two finish by Semenenko at the Rostelecom Cup — both likely events — would displace the Japanese athlete. With Kolyada performing well in recent competition and poised to win gold at the Rostelecom Cup, it seems likely that it will be Kolyada and Brown who join Kagiyama, Uno, Zhou, and Chen in Osaka in December.
In women’s singles, Russian Anna Shcherbakova dominated both the short program and the free skate to win gold. Having also placed first in the Gran Premio d’Italia, she becomes the top qualifier in her category with 30 points. Kaori Sakamoto of Japan’s gold medal performance at the NHK trophy proves to be enough, as she is also now guaranteed to qualify for the Grand Prix Final with 24 points. Russian Alena Kostornaia, having finished second at the Internationaux de France, also sits at 24 points, but her qualification is not guaranteed, as is the situation with You Young of Korea (22 points) and Mai Mihara of Japan (18 points), trailing closely behind.
Russians Kamila Valieva (15 points), Elizaveta Tuktamysheva (13 points), and Maya Khromykh (13 points), as well as Belgian Loena Hendrickx (11 points), are all slated to compete this weekend. With Valieva and Tuktamysheva having gone one-two at Skate Canada, it is likely that these two athletes will perform similarly at the Rostelecom Cup. Khromykh and Hendrickx placed second and third, respectively, at the Gran Premio d’Italia, and are certainly fierce competitors as well. With this being the case, it is unlikely for either Mihara or Young to retain their qualifying positions. If either Tuktamysheva, Khromykh, or Hendrickx win gold at the Rostelecom, Kostornaia will likely not be able to qualify for the Grand Prix Final, as is the case should Valieva take gold, Khromykh the silver, and Tuktamysheva the bronze at the Rostelecom Cup. If Khromykh takes bronze and Tuktamysheva takes silver, it will likely come down to a comparison between Tuktamysheva and Kostornaia’s combined scores across both of their assignments. For women’s singles, it is likely that the lineup in Osaka will be Shcherbakova, Valieva, Sakamoto, Tuktamysheva, Kostornaia, and either Khromykh or Hendrickx.
Russian pair Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (26 points) join fellow countrymen Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov (28 points), as well as China’s Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (30 points) in guaranteeing their Grand Prix Final qualification after a gold medal performance at the Internationaux de France. Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara of Japan, as well as Russia’s Iuliia Artemeva and Mikhail Nazarychev trail close behind at 24 points, followed by Americans Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, and Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc at 22 points.
It seems unlikely for either American pair to make the Grand Prix Final, with Russian pairs Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov (15 points) and Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin (13 points), as well as Italians Nicole Della Monica and Matteo Guarise (9 points) set to compete at the Rostelecom Cup. Unless Della Monica and Guarise put on a gold medal performance while the two Russian pairs take silver and bronze, Miura and Kihara, as well as Artemeva and Nazarychev, will qualify for the Grand Prix Final. In all likelihood, the pairs appearing in Osaka in December will be Sui and Han, Tarasova and Morozov, Boikova and Kozlovskii, Mishina and Galliamov, Pavliuchenko and Khodykin, and Miura and Kihara.
In the ice dance category, French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron put up a fantastic performance at the Internationaux de France, placing first in both the rhythm dance and the free dance to win gold. With a total of 30 points, they become the top qualifiers for the Grand Prix Final in ice dance. Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier took silver and also guaranteed qualification with a total of 28 points. The Canadians sit shoulder to shoulder with Americans Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donahue, who guaranteed their qualification with a gold medal performance at Skate America, followed by a silver at the Gran Premio d’Italia.
Fellow Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates trail right behind with 26 points, followed by Russian pair Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin (22 points) and Spaniards Olivia Smart and Adrián Díaz (20 points). With Russians Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov (15 points), Italians Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri (13 points), and Canadians Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sørensen (11 points) still set to compete at the Rostelecom Cup this weeken. However, it is unlikely for the former three pairs to all qualify for the Grand Prix Final. While Chock and Bates are likely to retain a qualifying position (the only scenario in which they do not qualify hinging on the unlikely scenario of Beaudry and Sørensen winning gold at the Rostelecom Cup while the other two pairs medal), Sinitsina and Katsalapov, as well as Guignard and Marco Fabbri, will almost certainly perform well enough to overtake Stepanova and Bukin, and Smart and Díaz. For ice dance, the Grand Prix Final qualifiers will likely be Papadakis and Cizeron, Hubbell and Donahue, Gilles and Poirier, Sinitsina and Katsalapov, Guignard and Marco Fabbri, and Chock and Bates.
With only the Rostelecom Cup left in this year’s Grand Prix series, it will certainly be interesting to see which athletes will excel and surpass their competitors to claim the last qualifying spots for the ISU Grand Prix Final.

Welcome back to the last rendition of the college football roundup before we go on break. There will be one last issue after break, where we summarize the end of the season — conference championships, bowls, and playoffs. But for now, we can go through an eventful week. Former #5-seed Oregon fell out of the Top 10 with a crushing loss to Utah, and Ohio State blew the doors off of Michigan State to advance in the rankings.
Our rankings:
Unsurprisingly, #1 Georgia remains atop the pack once again, with a dominant 56-7 win over Charleston Southern. They remain the frontrunners to win the SEC and have clinched the SEC East, guaranteeing their spot in the conference championship.
Right below Georgia, though, Ohio State jumps over Alabama for the #2 spot. The Buckeyes have been stellar since their loss to Oregon, and prove it week after week. Despite their narrow win at Nebraska two weeks ago, their last two games have been extraordinary, beating Purdue by four touchdowns and then crushing former #6 Michigan State on Saturday in a game that ended 56-7.
None of this is to say that the Crimson Tide, still in the playoffs at #3, have been any less good. Despite being taken to task by a very good Arkansas team — one that Georgia shut out earlier in the season — Alabama pulled out a win 42-35 to preserve their one-loss record. With their win today, Alabama clinched the SEC West, guaranteeing that they will face #1 Georgia for the conference crown.
Outside the top-three, the rankings get a little bit dicier. After blowing out SMU in what may have been their biggest test since Notre Dame, #4 Cincinnati keeps their spot. Similarly, #5 Michigan jumped two spots from #7 after crushing Maryland 59-18, and the two teams separating them from the Bearcats — Oregon and Michigan State — both got blown out. #6 Notre Dame has quietly amassed a very good season after their Cincinnati loss; after shutting out Georgia Tech 55-0, they can make a case for the playoffs. The only issue against the Fighting Irish is that, as independents, they don’t play a conference championship game, meaning they don’t really have an opportunity to break out and jump into the top-four. Their best chance is for two of Alabama, Cincinnati, or Michigan to tank, and for the Irish to slip into the fourth spot.
After that, the remaining teams have very narrow paths to the playoffs. Three Big 12 teams come in at the seventh, eighth, and ninth spots, each with a credible path to win the conference. Oklahoma, at #7, and Oklahoma State, at #8, are the two frontrunners, each with one-loss conference records, while #9 Baylor lags behind with two. However, Baylor is guaranteed a spot in the conference championship if they beat Texas Tech tomorrow; the winner of the Oklahoma-Oklahoma State game next week will take the other slot. The winner of that game will have a shot at the playoff, but it will be narrow. Finally, the SEC’s #10 Ole Miss rounds out the picture despite having virtually no shot at the playoffs.
Next Week:
Chaos will reign next week, with four teams facing other Top 10 sides, Alabama playing the Iron Bowl at Auburn, and a host of other same-state rivalries. The two games with the biggest playoff implications, by far, are Ohio State playing Michigan and the two Oklahoma teams squaring off. Whoever wins in Ann Arbor will win the Big Ten East, and probably play either Iowa or Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game. Likewise, whoever wins the matchup in Oklahoma will most likely face Baylor for the conference crown.
After that, it is off to the conference championships. Georgia, Ohio State, and Alabama could punch their tickets to the playoff by winning their conference championships, but nobody else has such an easy path. Cincinnati should make it if they win out, but an unimpressive record might make that difficult. Michigan, by beating OSU, can take the Buckeyes’ spot as the team to beat for a playoff slot. If one of the top-four fares particularly badly, one could imagine a Big 12 team jumping in to grab one of the slots.
As of now, though, we are in a unique situation — one where it is possible that three of the five Power Five conferences (the ACC, Big 12, and Pac-12) could be shut out of the playoff entirely. This week confirms what we already knew: that the SEC and Big Ten are the conferences to beat in college football.

Face masks and verbal communication
In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, many localities have asked residents to wear face masks. While important to protecting health, it might prevent us from seeing facial cues that help us understand what others are saying. Students Lindsay Zhang, Ananya Vasudev, Sophia Hill, and Anyah Stempien-Smith published a paper called "The Role of Face Masks in Native and Non-Native Speech Perception" investigating how native and non-native English speakers understood videos of speakers speaking with and without a face mask. They found that there was not a significant difference between native and non-native speakers in perceiving speech.
Do employers really look at your social media profile?
It has always been rumored that employers look at social media profiles, but do they really, and how does it impact hiring decisions? Alessandro Acquisti, professor of information technology and public policy in Heinz College, and Christina Fong, a research scientist in Dietrich's Department of Social and Decision Sciences, sought to answer this question in a study titled "An Experiment in Hiring Discrimination via Online Social Networks." In the study, they created online social media profiles for four different job candidates: one Muslim, one Christian, one gay, and one straight, and their profiles contained personal information. They then sent the same resume and cover letters, which did not reveal this personal information, to more than 4,000 job openings. They found evidence that employers did look at candidates' social media profiles, and that while interview callback rates overall did not differ between Muslim, Christian, gay, and straight candidates, they did find that employers in Republican areas exhibited bias against Muslim candidates.
Magnetism to make computers faster
As technology continues to improve, we will need more and more energy to fuel our devices. One method of reducing energy consumption is to magnetize random access memory (RAM), which is used to load applications that you want to access right away. To magnetize RAM, researchers are looking into better understanding domain walls, which separate uniform magnetized regions. Control over these domain walls could allow for fast magnetic memory by encoding 1s and 0s in bits using domain orientation. Carnegie Mellon researchers in conjunction with those of other universities found a quantitative explanation for how domains react when a magnetic force is applied.
Amazon's workers can look at your purchase history
An investigation by Wired reveals that Amazon's workers have nearly unprotected access to your data, allowing them to look at the shopping history of celebrities, listen to what you say to Alexa, and see insecurely stored passwords. Amazon also gave broad data access rights to customer service representatives that allowed them to view nearly anyone's purchasing history for the sake of answering customer questions quickly. Sellers on Amazon have also been able to pull detailed customer data from Amazon without customer consent. It was also found that there was a two-year period when the credit card numbers of American Express accounts were exposed to employees. Employees have also sold customer information to outside brokers and product sellers.
Some records of this insecurity date back to 2015, and as the company grew, these data security problems piled up. Some issues relate to how company teams would store copies of company data they were using for analytics, copies that are hard to track and secure. The information security division of Amazon could not figure out where all the company data was, so they could not protect it. Amazon, prioritizing customer experience over all else, was unwilling to fund growth in the security division, and leadership in the division came and went. With all these issues, Amazon’s information security division has been fragmented and dysfunctional in recent years.
All adults can get a Pfizer or Moderna booster shot now
The FDA has cleared Pfizer and Moderna booster shots for all adults now, an expansion of the eligibility requirements from September. 
U.S. intends to buy 10 million antiviral pills
Though yet to be officially announced, the Biden administration plans to buy about 10 million of Pfizer's antiviral pills that help reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. There are still many questions surrounding these antiviral pills, however. Currently, there are two manufacturers — Merck and Pfizer — and it is hard to tell which one is more effective as preliminary tests conducted were not performed under the same conditions. It is unknown whether these pills can be taken together or whether they work on vaccinated patients that contract COVID-19, as both companies performed tests only on unvaccinated individuals.

Nothing answers the question, “What is ‘All Too Well’ by Taylor Swift about?” better than the Pablo Neruda quote that Swift chose to open the short film she wrote and directed to accompany the recent re-release of the song by the same name. “Love is so short, forgetting is so long,” or the original line, “Es tan corto el amor, y es tan largo el olvido,” is all about the lingering, the eating-alive, the simultaneous clinging to and pushing away of a lost love. It hurts to think about, and trust me, it hurts to watch, too.
The song “All Too Well” (the regular-length version) has been released for almost a decade. For listeners, that’s a decade of reading between the lines (and in some cases, just reading the lines — Swift is pretty explicit) and crying along. It was suspected that Swift’s relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal was the inspiration for the utterly heartbreaking song, but with Swift fans, it’s always safe to say that more details were desired. Of all the songs on “Red (Taylor’s Version),” the teased 10 minute version of “All Too Well” was among the most highly anticipated. It’s one of Swift’s first dives into a longer-length song — although we all knew she had the lyrical power to do it — and she swears in it. In other words, this is, and was always meant to be, soul food — and the people are eating.
The short film that Swift released with the song stars herself, Sadie Sink as a younger Swift, Dylan O’Brien as Jake Gyllenhaal, and a ridiculous amount of autumn aesthetic, even for Swift. I think there is one lone scene that doesn’t feature majestically falling yellow leaves or warm lighting tones.
Everything about the writing of this film is literal, from the translation of the opening verse about Swift leaving her scarf at Gyllenhaal’s sister’s house, to the scene where O’Brien throws a set of car keys at Sink, and they hit the ground to the lyrics, “keychain on the ground.” From the beginning, it’s easy to pretend that the people we are seeing on the screen are just regular people, figments of Swift’s creation. We watch them drive together and hold hands and kiss outside in the cold, and it feels like they could be anybody. It would be easier to watch if they were anybody, and we protect ourselves with the thought that this is just another love story. But it isn’t, and that becomes clear as the music breaks off: Sink and O’Brien move around each other in a kitchen after he has just humiliated her at a dinner party. These people are big people with big lives and they are based directly in reality.
What follows are some of the most awkward and painful three minutes of acting that have ever been recorded. Here I must give brief notes on Sink and O’Brien’s roles — Sink is flawless, just as she is meant to be. She is beautiful and put together, clear and bright. She is blameless and innocent. This is the intent. O’Brien is clunky. He is disconnected from the action, and while this might seem at first like he hasn’t been in a successful movie in three or four years and is epically stiff, I’d argue that it’s intentional. The whole point here is that we’ve just witnessed two minutes of what appears to be perfect, devoted (if a little fling-y) love, and we know that it has to end, but we can’t fathom why it ever would. What happened? In Swift’s own words, “You, that’s what happened. You.” There must be something so incorrect with O’Brien, with the way he approaches conflict, with the way that he treats Sink, that it breaks her enough to write a 10 minute song and a movie about it. We get to see those flaws, the way he doesn’t know or doesn’t care, stuffed in between swears and “likes” as he denies having done anything wrong at the dinner with his friends, as he calls her crazy for thinking that he would. Then, just like that, they make up, and everything is ok again, but as Swift has already told us via oddly placed section titles, this is the “first crack in the glass.” Sure enough, just 60 short seconds later, everything falls apart again. O’Brien has proven his essential and inevitable villain persona and ended everything for no apparent reason. He is not sorry.
It’s devastating, and you knew it was going to be devastating all along. It almost seems natural. Things are hostile, and in some ways, a little stale. We are hearing this story again so long after it happened — the jabs Swift places against Gyllenhaal are real, but they are also old. As she points out, she was young and he was really not — “the punchline goes, ‘I’ll get older but your lovers stay my age.’” It makes sense that this would stay with her for so long, that it would cut as deep as it did. There’s something beautiful about revisiting something that you’ve grown beyond, just to remember what it used to feel like, and the final scene of “All Too Well” solidifies this idea. Swift enters now, donning a red wig to match Sink, giving a reading of her new book entitled “All Too Well” in a sure nod to her foray into filmmaking and her growth from the place where “Red” was originally written, when Swift was just 22. O’Brien watches from the window as she reads to her audience, stuck out in the snow, wearing the scarf she left at his sister’s house in the opening scene. The scarf is red. You can ask for no more from this film — this song — because it has given you everything. It has told you its story, and it has made it pretty, and now, it is done. The scarf is red.

My housemate bought “Battlefield 2042” thinking it would be a great game. He spent extra money to pre-order the game and get early access so he could play it a week before everyone else. A few days after the game came out, my housemate commented, “I can’t believe I just paid 100 bucks for a game that’s still in beta.”
He wasn’t wrong. I don’t even play “Battlefield” with a mouse and keyboard on PC, and even an incompetent player like me could still notice the game was unfinished. The death animations look weird and buggy with the bizarre camera placement. The shooting feels unsatisfying and the time to kill is way too low. I would spawn somewhere and then die a second later because I was shot by someone from across the map. The specialist class systems are just really annoying and replace a much superior system of weapon unlocks. There are so many game-breaking bugs and not enough good servers for the modes that are actually fun. DICE, the developers of “Battlefield,” and their parent company EA, one of the worst companies in America, delayed the game for a month to polish it, and somehow, it is still broken. This was after taking an extra year to work on the game and removing single-player mode to only focus on the multiplayer.
Gamers are being duped into buying these garbage games for at least 60 dollars, and they’ll keep buying into it because they still hold out hope that one day, video game companies will go back to the days where they didn’t make broken, unplayable pieces of trash. In fact, the expectation now is that the game you get opening day will be broken and the company will fix the game after it’s been launched. Can you imagine being sold a broken car, only for the manufacturer to tell you that they’ll fix only one part of it after six months? That’s what’s happening with video games. We are in a dystopian, corporate hellscape where nothing is sacred; your minimal amount of optimism left is exploitable, and vanilla-faced vultures are selling you empty words and faux revolutionary ideas in the hopes of draining you of 60 dollars that you could have used to buy your groceries for the week. Judging by the amount of people who bought “Call of Duty: Vanguard,” the 18th installment of a bloated, annual franchise that has rehashed the same mechanics since 2013, it seems gamers are still buying into the con.
Generally speaking, game developers all work so hard on their games and they have so much passion for their projects. When a game is great, it is a work of art. It is the result of countless hours put into creating a beautiful story with characters that are just as iconic as any character in a movie. It’s not the developers’ fault that the yuppies who manage them really enjoy stealing money, burning it, and then drop kicking children from skyscrapers.
Now, for legal reasons, I must clarify that the last statement is a joke. But what isn’t a joke is the culture of harassment and abuse prevalent in the industry. For those unfamiliar, there is a company called Activision-Blizzard, and they are being sued for, well, every single type of sexual harassment case you could possibly think of by the state of California. Now I won’t detail every single case itself, but all you need to know about it is that the news of the lawsuit hit the headlines several months ago, and even now, we are still learning more and more details about how messed up the whole case was. The toxic and abusive culture is not unique to Activision-Blizzard, and it’s hard to shake the feeling that the game I’m playing is created by people who work 80 hours a week with no overtime, half of whom have likely been sexually harassed.
A great thinker once said, “Everything you like is actually bad.” Be it video games, movies, politics, beauty products, academia, or whatever company you’ll sell your soul to after graduation, it’s all bad in some way or the other. Does this mean you should give up on trying to be an ethically conscious consumer and give into the monotony of corporate America, settling for whatever broken video game you paid 60 dollars for so you can pretend the person you’re killing on screen is your manager as you dissociate from reality because you’re depressed about the state of affairs and your life?
Yeah, probably.

A few of The Tartan staff got together and picked their favorite albums they discovered this year. 
“Timely!!” - Anri
This was the year I discovered city pop and my life is better as a result. City pop is a Japanese pop style that became popular in the 1980s, and it sounds like how the 1980s would interpret jazz and funk fusion. Even though it is technically pop music, the album sounds more like an upbeat jazz big band with synths. Anri’s vocals are just absolutely beautiful, and they soar so clearly over really catchy countermelodies from the wind section and a tight and groovy rhythm section. Each time I listen to the songs off the album, I discover a new detail, which makes each listen more rewarding than the last. - Sujay Utkarsh
“Everything Feels Better Now” - From Indian Lakes
Though it took me a while to check out From Indian Lakes’ discography after adding “Breathe Desperately” to one of my Spotify playlists, I am glad that I did. The album starts with “Happy Machines,” whose lyrics give the album its title. The 12-song album feels like an ache for love with its low-key vibes that seem to come and go as the album progresses. The distorted guitar that is present in many of the songs is a nice compliment to the overall feeling of the album. My personal favorites from the album are “The Monster,” “Blank Tapes,” and “Sunlight,” but the rest of the album is not far behind. - Cole Skuse
“LP!” - JPEGMAFIA
This album elevates JPEGMAFIA from one of the best rappers in the game to one of the best musicians around today. His voice is already so smooth, and he takes advantage of that to deliver killer bars with impeccable delivery. His beats were already fairly experimental on his previous efforts, but he takes them a step further on this album. There is a versatile mix of lo-fi, glitch hop, and even rock, yet it feels cohesive and every stylistic choice feels deliberate and well-thought. He’ll frequently change upbeats and flows from out of nowhere, but he knows when to hold back and let the listener jam out for a minute. It’s even more impressive when you realize that JPEGMAFIA writes, produces, and performs all of his music. - Sujay Utkarsh
“Nilsson Schmilsson” - Harry Nilsson
I was introduced to this album after binge-watching “Russian Doll,” and I gotta say, it’s pretty good. Harry Nilsson’s most successful album has had a great influence on future musicians, with Nilsson considered by some to be in that category of musician’s musicians. This album celebrated its 50th anniversary this month, and it stands the test of time, though maybe only for those with a certain taste in music. “Gotta Get Up” and “Coconut” are my standouts of the album, both songs sounding great and being interestingly constructed. Although not as good as “Nilsson sings Newman,” “Nilsson Schmilsson” still impresses. - Zachary Gelman
“Bleed The Future” - Archspire
I listened to this album when it dropped at midnight, and after listening to it, I ran around for three hours, tripped over my chair, and smacked my face into the door. But the adrenaline from the music numbed me to all the pain. This is technical death metal destruction honed into a perfect, 34-minute package. The balance between melody, heaviness, and sheer virtuosity is like no other metal band out there. One of the songs is at 400 beats per minute, yet it never feels like too much. I want to find more like this but there is nothing else like this that exists as far as I’m aware. It’s easily one of the best metal albums I’ve ever listened to. My only complaint about this album is that I’m probably never going to be technically competent enough at guitar to ever be able to play any of these songs. - Sujay Utkarsh
"The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" - Saint Motel
Somehow I missed the full album coming out in June despite having listened to Saint Motel for several years. The album is 15 songs long and is divided into three parts, each five or six songs long. While the first part of the album debuted over two years ago in 2019, the full album was not released until this year. I was impressed by “Old Soul,” “A Good Song Never Dies,” “Van Horn,” and “It’s All Happening,” all of which found their way onto at least one of my playlists upon first listen. The first part has official visualizers on the Saint Motel YouTube channel, which I feel describes the songs’ vibes very well. While I might not be able to relate to all the songs, they all have their unique charm that expresses a variety of moods and showcase some healthy experimentation from Saint Motel. Overall, a solid album with some very strong songs. - Cole Skuse
"ALL OUT" - K/DA
K/DA as a group honestly fascinates me. I’m not particularly interested in “League of Legends” as a game, but whatever Riot Games is doing with K/DA, they’re doing it right. Despite being music intentionally made to promote a game, their songs are pretty musically interesting, though lyrically lacking (though most of their audience doesn’t pay attention to the lyrics anyway). It’s also interesting that despite being corporate construction, their music does seem to have a unique style, featuring heavy percussion, powerful but balanced vocals that harmonize well, and a bit of synth that makes the music feel as colorful as their album covers. The most standout songs in this album to me are “MORE,” the first song I listened to by K/DA, which has some cool harmonies and a recurring instrumental theme that instantly grabbed my attention, and “VILLAIN,” the chorus of which has this nice moment where the instrumentals drop out and there’s only the main vocal line, a mirrored vocal bassline, and percussion. - Kaylin Li
“SINNER GET READY” - Lingua Ignota
This is the scariest thing I’ve ever listened to. I have listened to songs from death metal bands that sound like literal exorcisms, and Lingua Ignota blows them all out of the water with this esoteric, hellish, nightmare fuel that feels like what opera would sound like on a bad acid trip. I’ve never heard music with a soundscape that envelops you quite like this one. The production is immaculate, simultaneously making you feel cold and uncomfortable in a satisfying way. It is not an easy listening experience, but it still manages to be beautiful at the same time. This is not for everyone, but if you want to venture out into something experimental and terrifying, this album is for you. - Sujay Utkarsh

Q. I’ve been seeing this guy for the last month or so, but he’s not willing to say we’re dating yet. How do I move this relationship to the next level?
A. Don’t force him to say anything. Instead, just subtly escalate the relationship. When you’re holding hands, squeeze your wedding vows to him in Morse code. When you’re kissing in the rain, pause and ask if he’s seen “The Notebook.” Ask again. Then ask again. When you bring him back to your room, disguise your parents as science classroom skeletons in the corner.
Q. Hey A.T., my girlfriend’s room skeletons just asked me what I want to do when I graduate. What should I say?
A. Say you’ll love and cherish their little girl forever, that’s what you should say! Also, finance or med school. Skeletons eat that up.
Q. I’m really struggling with binge eating. How do I stop snacking so much, A.T.?
A. What I like to do is pretend my snacks are like little people that care very much about me. The Dorito chip is now your grandma. That fruit snack is now your cousin. You wouldn’t eat your cousin, would you? And if you would, just know that WVU is accepting spring transfers.
Q. My place is a dump. Where do I get the motivation to clean?
A. Ever read "Tom Sawyer"? Invite a bunch of your bros over and convince them scrubbing, sweeping, and stacking are different forms of CrossFit. 
Q. I have to clear my mind. Where do you find the time to meditate?
A. I start by making my room look like a Tibetan monastery. I put up mandalas, light candles, and play audio from PRC tanks and military raids gently in the background. Also, have you tried Headspace? Literal lifesaver.

Am I awake or am I asleep? Shoot. That’s an ad, isn’t it? It’s another ad. Actually, it’s two. And they’re unskippable. 15 seconds each. Shoot. Where is my mind? My computer looks like it’s so close yet so far away. Perhaps that means something. Is my reality so desolate that my depth perception is determined by the distance between my face and a screen?
Hello there. You must be wondering why I’m here in this position. Lying in my bed face down, flat on my stomach. It just occurred to me that you can’t actually see what I’m doing since you’re reading this. Well, friend, it’s perhaps because you are privy to important information. This information is so important that I’ve documented it for your sake and the sake of the very small number of people left in this world who matter to me. 
I’m going away today. 
I know. You must be thinking, “But [insert your randomly generated name for me here], you can’t just go away. What about all the people who care about you? What about me?” First, I appreciate that you care about me so much within two paragraphs of writing. Secondly, I wish it were that simple to explain. 
Shoot. Another ad. Why do they put 15-second ads in front of five-second videos? That doesn’t make me want to buy your product. It just makes me viscerally angry. Anyway. The simple explanation would be to say that I’m empty. Should I say that with more panache? I feel like the outer layer of a Russian nesting doll with nothing inside to make it whole. Oh, I like that. I take one step and I feel like I might end up crumbling under the weight of my sense of self. That’s enough. 
But plenty of people live like that. Isn’t that what we’re all about now? Shuffling mindlessly through the oxygen that envelops us, inhaling whatever pollutants we’ve sent out there, filled with all our regrets and unkept desires, waiting for our next paycheck? Do we collectively fail at living and do nothing about the world so we always have something to blame or do we just not care? Are we doomed to continue repeating all of our mistakes, never learning because the incentives to do so aren’t there? 
No. It’s not that emptiness. Maybe it’s the one where your negative emotions don’t even register anymore. They’re just there perpetually, slowly nibbling away at the thresholds of your reality. Your pillow doesn’t feel soft and your blankets don’t keep you warm anymore. There’s something in your mind all the time. Is it a scream or is it a whisper? What’s it telling you? How close are we to our ends anyway? The world could end tomorrow perhaps. 
I don’t have answers to why I’m going away. I was hoping perhaps you could tell me. Maybe you could say something to stop this. Will you? No. You’re not here. You wouldn’t be able to say anything to stop this. Oh well. I guess this is it. So many live this way but I don’t really want to. Don’t feel sad. I certainly don’t. Why should you? 
Shoot. There are two more unskippable ads. I'm gonna go make my breakfast now. This report isn't gonna write itself.

In early November, the All-Gender Restroom Access Committee launched an initiative to increase bathroom inclusivity across campus. Below gendered restroom signs nailed into walls, the Committee stuck foam panels reading: “This is a multi-stall restroom open to everyone. CMU supports an individual’s choice of restroom.”
On Thursday, one of these signs was jaggedly torn in half. 
The incident occurred in the women's first-floor bathroom in Margaret Morrison and was reported to the Campus Police Department. On Friday, Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and chief diversity officer Wanda Heading-Grant sent an email to the Carnegie Mellon community condemning the act of transphobic vandalism and affirming the University’s support of “our fellow trans, intersex, nonbinary (TIN) and gender expansive community members.” 
One nonbinary student (A) said that they didn’t expect “something like that would happen here, but maybe that was a naive assessment.” They asked to remain anonymous. 
The signs were introduced after about 9 months of discussion between administration and Carnegie Mellon’s Trans, Intersex, and Nonbinary Alliance (TINA). In an interview with The Tartan, founding member kai ell denazen said that TINA began in the Spring of 2019. Roughly thirty students and faculty members are currently part of the group. 
“Nonbinary people have to use the men's and women's bathrooms because oftentimes gender-neutral bathrooms aren’t readily available,” explained another nonbinary student (B), who also wished to remain anonymous. “It’s the most unideal place because we’d rather use the all-gender bathrooms...We’re not trying to invade anyone’s privacy in the bathroom, we just need to pee.”
Need for more gender-inclusive bathrooms is “disguised as something that is not urgent but is always urgent,” denazen explained. “My experience is defined by not passing as cis, and I have never felt comfortable in CMU restrooms.” For many TIN students, they said, the business intrinsic to the Carnegie Mellon workload is compounded by a constant race to find an inclusive bathroom on campus. 
TIN individuals face increased risk of violence, employment discrimination, family stressors, and psychological challenges compared to their cisgender counterparts. “We are a small community with a great need,” denazen said.
The message sent by Heading-Grant specifically addressed the defacement of restroom signage, but other incidents have slipped through the cracks. Stickers have been appearing in bathrooms and other public spaces boasting implicitly transmisogynistic rhetoric. About two weeks ago, Student A noticed a sticker in a CFA women’s bathroom. “Woman” was written across the top, under which “noun” was placed in italics, resting above a definition: “adult human female.”
At first, they didn’t think much of it. But when they got back to their room, their roommate said they saw the same sticker plastered on the Morewood and Forbes crosswalk pole. The roommates learned that the stickers are from a website that sells trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) merchandise. Student A decided to file an anonymous bias report through DEI’s Report-It site.  
TERFs perceive trans women as a threat to femininity; they claim “feminism” as a movement exclusive to cis women. Political journalist Katelyn Burns boils TERF ideology down to the “claim that trans women are really men, who are the ultimate oppressors of women. Most of their ideas — like that trans women are a threat to cisgender women’s safety — are based on cherry-picked cases of horrific behavior by a small number of trans people.” Ultimately, TERFs deny trans people “any autonomy over their gender expression.” 
Another sticker was found in a women’s bathroom in Wean reading, “Female. Nothing more. Nothing less.” It was produced by the same website. Student A said what particularly concerns them is that someone is going around campus with multiple rolls of transmisogynistic stickers; the designs are sold individually. In each instance, the stickers were quickly removed. 
The “adult human female” design was printed on billboards in Liverpool in 2018 and subsequently removed after allegations were made that the campaign promoted a transphobic hate group. The woman behind the ad denied allegations of transphobia, “but said the idea that trans women were women was ‘preposterous’.” 
The stickers appeared in response to the “trans people are welcome here” bathroom flyer campaign, according to Rue Taylor. Taylor, who is trans and a first year graduate student in Heinz, began putting up the flyers because she “saw a need to explicitly state that trans people could use the bathrooms they want.” Many were torn down by students and faculty, but Taylor was undeterred. When she saw the TERF stickers, however, she “started to feel a lot less comfortable on campus.” The University approved of the new gender-inclusive foam signage shortly after.
For Taylor, the change was bittersweet: while she no longer felt the need to put up posters because a University-sponsored initiative had taken action, the signs did not include specific language about gender identity. Taylor had hoped the phrasing would address trans people, to create a more intentional message about inclusivity. Nevertheless, she knew of multiple trans friends that now feel comfortable going to the bathroom because of the new foam boards. 
According to A, there has been a lot of discussion about the incidents “internally within TINA.” Yet most changes around campus, like the introduction of gender-inclusive bathroom signage, have been subtle and unannounced. “I don’t think [cis people] would raise an eyebrow” at the stickers, they said, because “they are not explicitly transphobic. They’re more of a dog whistle.” 
While the sticker’s simple phrasing does not immediately appear to be problematic, “adult human female” refers to the TERF belief that trans women fail to qualify as “real women” because TERFs conflate gender identity and birth sex.
Student B noticed that one of the bathroom inclusivity signs in front of the women’s bathroom near Hunan Express “was creased, like someone was trying to pull it off.” Like the stickers, it did not appear to be explicitly transphobic. They felt the crease was “not enough to be worthy of a report” but was “suspicious that someone would try to take it off.”
Taylor referred to numerous instances around campus where the signs are torn. “Even when it’s a University-sponsored installation, cis people still feel as though they’re entitled to tell trans people they don’t belong here.” She recalled two recent incidents of older cis women coming into the bathroom, seeing her, and leaving. Taylor is “considering stopping using the women’s restroom” because it puts her in a “dangerous position.”
On Aug. 6, 2020, TINA wrote to President Farnam Jahanian and Senior Leadership specifically outlining ways to make the University safer and more inclusive. Their demands are introduced in “Actionable Steps for All-Gender Equity at CMU,” a 21-page self-described “living document” that establishes a clear timeline and process for the University to disrupt barriers against TIN community members. Most demands have yet to be met.
One of TINA’s demands is for housing to default to all-gender plans and require students to opt-in to single-gender housing, reversing the status quo. Two all-gender floors currently exist for first-year students: one in Stever House, the other in Morewood Gardens. Last spring, the majority of students approved of or had no preference surrounding all-gender housing.
TINA’s plan of action also called for “all bathrooms [to] be designated as all-gender in the interim immediately.” One of the most prominent arguments against all-gender bathrooms centers around the argument that women are at an increased risk of violence. Student A pointed out that, as it stands, anyone can walk into any bathroom, regardless of a gendered sign. “I don’t know why they’re coming for us” — TIN individuals — “when it’s not our fault.” They felt that society generally (not CMU specifically) embraces an irrational fear that trans and non-binary people are the threat, when they are the ones most at risk. 
“Some nonbinary people are comfortable with using the men’s & women’s bathrooms, like my roommate,” Student B noted. Many “binary trans people also would prefer to use the men's and women's bathrooms according to their gender — trans women have to fear being harassed if they have to use the men's bathrooms, and trans men using the women's bathrooms might cause even more misunderstandings.”
Rather than focus on risks, Student A said, why not implement safer facilities? Implementing safety measures such as higher stall walls can universally increase privacy. These changes were made in Stever bathrooms, where visibility into stalls is nearly zero and each shower can be locked. TINA recommended the University collaborates “with an industry expert in the remodeling of bathrooms, like Stalled!.”
Taylor unpacked the dichotomy facing many TIN individuals: “the more visible we are, the more danger we’re in, but the more work we can get done.” Because of this, she emphasized the need for “CMU administration to be loud and persistent on behalf of trans people.” 
“To any allies who’ve seen the transphobic things going on on campus,” said Student B, “don’t focus on the TERFs.” Instead, they urged students to “uplift trans and nonbinary voices through TINA and PRISM. Listen to what trans people have to say.” 
Bias incidents can be reported to staff members at the Center for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion on the lower level of the UC or by calling 412-268-2150. Students who wish to remain anonymous can submit anonymous reports through Report-It online using the username “tartans” and password “plaid”. For other ways to report bias incidents, students can visit the Bias Reporting and Response page on the DEI.

On the morning of Monday, Nov. 15, Carnegie Mellon’s Annual Food Drive was $21,500 short of its $100,000 goal. It was the last day of the drive. “We were hesitant about setting such a lofty goal,” said Food Drive Chair Carole Panno. But Panno, who is also the Associate Director of Gift Planning, embraced the challenge.
That evening, the Food Drive Committee sent an email to the Carnegie Mellon community headed: “Thanks to You — We’ve Done It Again.”
Staff Council sponsored the fundraiser, which has historically been one of Pittsburgh’s highest-grossing food drives. The funds totaled a record-breaking $109,000 this year and were donated to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (GPCFB). The previous high was set last year at $86,500. 
In the spirit of friendly rivalry, Staff Council designed the fundraiser as a competition between the 41 participating teams. Among the schools, SCS led the pack, raising $12,000, followed by Tepper ($9,300) and CFA ($5,300). At $15,500, the group representing Campus Design and Facility Development amassed the greatest amount of funds. CIA Buggy was the top student team. 
In an interview with The Tartan, Panno explained that the “team strategy and competitive spirit we love at Carnegie Mellon drives up donations.” The concept was introduced last year when the pandemic forced the fundraiser to go virtual. With a new platform for Carnegie Mellon community members to contribute internationally, the competition was on.
The online fundraising campaign was supplemented by three drive-and-drop events. According to Panno, each doubled the previous date’s nonperishable donations (with the final day seeing donations four times greater than the first). The last event always brings in the most support, Panno said in the interview, because people tend to demonstrate more urgency for “anything that’s at the end.” Cumulatively, the food drive brought in 2,500 lbs of nonperishables, can openers, and reusable bags. 
Since its inception in 1993, Carnegie Mellon’s Annual Food Drive has contributed a cumulative $214,500 and 77 tons of nonperishables to help fight hunger. GPCFB is the biggest food assistance program in southwestern Pennsylvania, providing over 45 million meals each year, according to their website. 
Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning estimates 20 percent of the city's residents are food insecure. FeedPGH identified areas in the city with the highest rates of food insecurity as Healthy Food Priority Areas. In Council District 5, which includes Squirrel Hill, 51.6 percent of Black residents live in Priority Areas compared to 5.5 percent of their white neighbors. This is especially disproportionate because Black residents comprise less than one-tenth of the district’s population. The same disparity is seen throughout Pittsburgh: over 70 percent of Black people live in Priority Areas despite representing an estimated 23 percent of city residents.
Though there was a significant increase in student involvement this year, Panno observed that the majority of food drive contributions were made by faculty and staff. “That’s the one piece of the drive we haven’t grown enough,” she said, referring to low participation within the student body. She hopes to see increased enthusiasm among students in the coming years, both to benefit those in need and to solidify the community-building aspect of the event.

This is an extended version of the article published in the print issue of November 22, 2021
Carnegie Mellon’s academic calendar underwent a small but significant change in the Spring 2021 semester: the length of the semester, excluding the final examinations week, was shortened from 15 weeks to 14 weeks. This shorter semester-length, as part of a year-long pilot project, went on to be applied to the current Fall 2021 and the upcoming Spring 2022 semesters as well. 
Associate Teaching Professor David Kosbie, who teaches the popular introductory computer science course 15-112, thinks that effectively, the semester-length is not actually 14 weeks. Mid-semester break, which has traditionally been on Friday in past semesters, was changed to Thursday this semester. “Our students desperately needed a mid-semester break. You have Thursday off, but not Friday. What kind of break is that?” Kosbie pointed out. “So for students, you're giving them one day. Not a break — not four days, not six days, not a week. One day.” For classes with lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the mid-semester break meant losing half a week. “In a course that has a flow, which so many courses do, of setting up the material in the beginning of the week and then doing homework or harder problems and preparing for quizzes at the end of the week, a half week is a nonsense thing.” He continued, “So it was really 13 weeks — if you want to push it, maybe 13-and-a-half — but there's no way it was 14.”
This sentiment was echoed by Nierenberg Associate Professor of Design Peter Scupelli, who taught two full-length semester courses in Spring 2021 and two mini courses this Fall semester. “[14-week semesters] makes teaching two mini-courses [sic] back-to-back extremely frustrating,” he said. He pointed out that there is no time between the two minis to get the grades out for one class and the next mini-course up and running, and that there is no flexibility in the system anymore with 14 week semesters. In a 15 week semester, mid-term is on week eight, but the mini-courses end on week 7. That leaves some flexibility on week 8 to grade, wrap up late assignments and prepare for the new mini starting on week 8. In the 14-week semester, that flexibility is gone since there is not much time to get the grading done and launch the next mini-course. “It is extremely stressful for both faculty, TAs, and students,” Scupelli said. “I don't know what the issues are for full-semester courses, but for people teaching and taking mini-classes, it is a frustrating disaster.” 
The change to a 14-week semester was first implemented in Spring 2021 to delay the start of the semester. This was with the desire to “reduce the number of weeks we will be in session during flu season” while acknowledging that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue through the winter months, according to a communication from Provost Jim Garrett in September 2020. The Spring 2021 semester’s revised start date of Feb. 1 would allow for international students more time for visa processing and travel to arrive for the spring semester at a time when vaccines were still not available to be administered. A calendar innovation committee, chaired by professors Rebecca Nugent and Mark Stehlik, was also announced and was tasked with making recommendations on the timings of breaks throughout the semester so the breaks aren’t scheduled on the same days of the week.
“We had to seriously condense things,” Kosbie revealed, “because [15-112] is nearly noncompressible. We are always exploring the space … of giving our students the most preparation and the richest experience without overburdening them to the point of unreasonableness.” Kosbie emphasized the importance of looking after student health and welfare while wanting students to be challenged because they're trying to be the best in the world. “This is a delicate balance between pursuing excellence without over pursuing excellence and injuring people,” he said. “All my colleagues have spent years finessing and refining this for 15 weeks. Any change at all — I don't care if that change in the long term is better — was gonna be profoundly disruptive because these schedules were not created in a week or a month, over the years they were refined. Because when you overreach a little bit, you figure it out because the students get hit too hard.”
Kosbie said he effectively had two choices. “You can't just teach the same in less time. So you can either teach it to a lower level of rigor. Or you could just drop topics,” he explained. “And so we chose a little bit of each of those, and tried to do it as little as possible,” Kosbie emphasized that not everything is reduced in this version of 15-112. Instead, material that was not as essential was made optional, without testing it or making homework on it, and for some material that remained, the instructors made it clear that students would not have to go to quite the same depth. 
For Bill Nace, a teaching professor at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department who taught 18-240 (“Structure and Design of Digital Systems”) over the past year and some other courses this semester, the change was a bit unsettling. The changes Nace had made for the Spring 2021 semester had been somewhat reactionary, and he thought some of the decisions might have been suboptimal. This time, Nace went through the experience of trying to figure out if he could drop high-stakes exams, as he had never been happy with them. “I spent a lot of time, in fact, working with [The Eberly Center] on this trying to figure out if the things I could drop would be my midterm exams because I thought that could have the biggest impact on the course,” he revealed. The Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation, which supports faculty and graduate students in their teaching, has a section on their website dedicated to adjusting courses to 14 weeks. 
Ultimately, Nace couldn’t find a good way to drop midterm exams, so they stuck around. “But there's a lot of work in trying to figure out how to adjust what material to drop, how to drop it,” he said. He found two lectures’ worth of content that was interesting but not critical to the concepts, but removing them wasn’t straightforward — he instead took some things from each lecture and repackaged it. This also meant the timeline of homework and labs for the class had to change. Though teaching in 15 weeks is something that he’s used to, 15 weeks is not necessarily better than 14. “Maybe 14 weeks is better, and you know, I’ll figure out what to do there and that will all be good,” he said. 
The change in the Spring semester felt like an emergency measure, but Nace did not have much knowledge in advance about the change being implemented in the fall, either. “The administration pushed it to us as an experiment,” Nace remarked. “I don't know much of the backstory behind why that’s there or any thoughts as to what might be the benefits.” 
Scupelli, who taught two full-length semester courses in Spring 2021, said teaching those classes had not been much of a problem for him. Even though Scupelli was unhappy about having to remove some course content, he did it to fit the 14 week semester. Now, Scupelli is teaching two mini courses and is having to shorten them because of the lack of flexibility around mid-term. For Mini 2, there is still the exams week, so there is some flexibility in the system. Still, Scupelli said that he might be teaching the same mini twice in the semester, but the students are not getting the same experience in Mini 1 and Mini 2 because of the structural changes. “I'm sure there are good reasons for wanting to shift from a 15-week to a 14-week, so I cannot comment on why that is being done because I do not know or understand the logic,” Scupelli said.
In June, Provost Garrett had sent out another communication that the Calendar Innovation Committee proposed going to 14-week semesters for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 semesters. It is a part of the committee’s attempt to “explore calendar options in an effort to increase efficiency in learning, ensure a consistent rigor of study without increasing weekly course workloads, create space for educational innovation, and address periodic calendar constraints.” 
“Even though you can appreciate why they waited — because it was a changing landscape — before they made the final decision,” Kosbie said, “it made it harder on the faculty that we weren't told for sure what it was going to be. Until we were, and the earlier we could have been told the more preparation we could have done for it.” It wasn't the last second, he remarked, but it certainly wasn't as early as it might have been.
When Franz Franchetti, instructor of 18-202 (“Mathematical Foundations of Electrical and Computer Engineering”) and the Kavčić-Moura Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering, found out that the Fall semester is also going to be 14 weeks, it was relatively late for him. “That’s really annoying because we have the whole thing planned and [18-202] is already overstuffed,” he said. “Shortening [the semester] a little was not the most helpful thing.” Franchetti had to make many choices concerning course content and logistics. The class has two main audiences, he said: one that is well-versed in mathematical topics and another that has not heard much of math but still wants to learn and get a good grade. The class has to cater to both groups. Last summer, due to the transition to online learning, they developed and recorded boot camps to teach some basic concepts and TED Talks for advanced concepts. This semester, however, it became harder for them to teach these boot camps and TED talks live, as it’s difficult to find the space. “Last year, remotely it worked well because I would really fire up a Zoom meeting and then show up and then I just give the presentation and record. Now this semester, we just have to use the recordings from last week. Which is bad, because I'd love to do it in person.”
Kosbie also pointed out an unanticipated issue with the shorter semester: room assignments. “It's really hard to run a large course. Like [15-112] has massive room consumption. Every week, we have all these rooms we need, but you can't get them,” he explained. “I think it would be natural that if you're going to try to do all the things we do in 15 weeks, in 13 weeks, that's gonna put increased demands on the resources in those 13 weeks. So it only made that issue much more complicated. Exactly at the worst time, because we can't fill rooms to capacity.” Large lectures were moved into event spaces like McConomy and Mellon auditoriums, which do not have the right AVs, seating, or light that exist in a normal lecture hall or classroom, he said. “[Facilities Management Services] has been doing a great job adapting. But, gosh, this should have been in place since day one.”
When asked if there were benefits to the short semester, Nace responded, “I get a longer Christmas break.” Nace continued, “I guess I don’t see it. I want to give it a good honest shake. The issue is, I don't know what has driven this experiment. So I don't know what things are expected out of it. And it seems, from an academic perspective, at least in my classes, it's only negative.” He added that there may be benefits like students getting another week of summer break. He said it is hard for him to judge because the real judge of this experiment should be the university-wide student experience.
However, Nace said he likes the idea of continuing with 14-week semesters. He did all this work to shove it into 14 weeks, he said, and would have to do a bunch of more work to undo it all. “So part of me is just like, ‘whatever we decide, let's stick to it’ would probably be my preference,” he explained. There are other ways elsewhere, he acknowledged, but it still worked this semester. 
Speaking of the advantages of having a shorter semester, Franchetti revealed, “Preparing for lectures is actually a lot of work. It's taxing you. Whenever you can get out of class, that's great, of course.” But when he looks at his schedule, the feeling is offset by his desire to engage with students. “Well, I mean, I want to tell a consistent story. And now my story gets kind of wrecked.”
When Franchetti saw how his students are coping with the existent pandemic, shortening in the schedule, the transition to online learning, and back into in-person classes, he said it worried him. Many emails that Franchetti receives from students mention mental health and other related issues, which is alarming to him. “It's not that it's like exploding or anything,” he clarified. “But relative to earlier years, clearly, [there’s] not as much of an engagement, not as you know, good of a community that we could build [as] in previous years. Students are clearly suffering at a rate that I have not seen before.”
Kosbie acknowledged that those supporting the 14-week semesters have good reasons. “But like, let's say they had really good reasons to take the schedule down to 12 weeks, 10 weeks, eight weeks. We're like, obviously, there's a point where I don't care what your reasons are, like, you can't do it. And the question is, did we already cross that line or not?” He said that he thinks a lot of faculty feel either that line was crossed, or they're bumping hard against it and that this is a serious imposition on their students. 
Kosbie also explained, “To be clear, because it might sound like I’m pretty down on the decision, I understand … at the time of COVID, there's shocking complexities to a schedule.” He continued, “Even if all we did was the same thing we're doing now, but we gave students an actual break in the middle of the semester, I think that that would have been a dramatically better experience for our students, many of whom are suffering right now from some consequences from last year that they just kind of carried over into this year. Not to mention additional burdens, because we're not quite over COVID and how COVID is impacting our daily lives. And if we gave students a little more time to manage that, I think that would have been a smart move.”
Kosbie also said that he is opposed to continuing with 14-week semesters in the future. “I respect that some of my colleagues are in favor and some of the administration's in favor. And I'm not saying that it doesn't have advantages,” he acknowledged. “I am saying that the cost to our students, either in lost learning opportunities and or in lost time to decompress ... are just too high to justify whatever the other benefits are.” He pointed out that Carnegie Mellon became the best university in the world in many disciplines on a 15-week schedule. Kosbie elaborated, “That doesn't mean that 15 weeks is the best. But it does mean that we should be very thoughtful about any permanent changes we want to make to that schedule. I'm not convinced you can change that schedule and maintain our excellence.”

“For 2 years we protected you,” read a shield-shaped sign. “Now protect us.” On Thursday, dozens of UPMC workers walked off the job. Strikers gathered at UPMC headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh demanding unionization rights, higher wages, and better health insurance. They held hand-written messages that included “Pay us what we’re worth” and “I work hard. I want to be able to take my kids on vacation.”
Despite a drop in employment rates in Allegheny County by 14.6 percent during the pandemic, UPMC kept its head well above water. The company grossed $23.1 billion in 2020, its highest revenue in history. Not a cent of that revenue was taxed since UPMC is a nonprofit. During his mayoral campaign, Ed Gainey promised to attempt to make the company pay “their fair share” to the city. .
UPMC is the largest non-governmental employer in Pennsylvania, yet workers have been frustrated by unlivable wages and poor health benefits. KDKA reported that strikers demanded “a minimum wage of $20 an hour, more affordable health care and the elimination of all their medical debt from their own employer.” Organizers claimed over 700 employees signed a petition outlining these objectives. Like 89 percent of wage and salary workers in the U.S., UPMC employees are not represented by a union. SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania has unsuccessfully attempted unionization since 2011. 
Earlier this month, UPMC announced that it would raise entry-level wages to $15.75 — a five percent increase — and administer a $500 Thanksgiving bonus. Three days later, workers organized a news conference where they announced plans to strike. Speakers described the increase as “dirty money” and “a slap in the face to all workers.” 
“Any raise that is less than the rate of inflation is actually a pay cut,” said Summer Viscusi, a student behavioral associate at Western Psych. 
TRIBLive reported that “employees who participated in the rally provided at least 10 days notice so that their absence would not disrupt services for patients” and that five similar single-day strikes have occurred in recent years.
Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman stood with workers. “There’s nothing outrageous or outlandish about these demands,” he said on Thursday. “The money [UPMC] spend[s] on advertising alone could raise their [employees’] wages. Advertise all you want, but treat your employees right, too.” Fetterman served as the Mayor of Braddock from 2005 to 2019 and announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in February.
Staffing shortages predating and exacerbated by the pandemic were a central focus of Thursday’s protest, according to 90.5 WESA. Some employees have been expected to assume two or more jobs’ worth of work without reflective pay. 
“We can’t afford to live in the communities we helped build,” UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh pharmacy tech Julia Centofani said at the Nov. 5 news conference. “UPMC has all but admitted to knowing that employees have problems making ends meet. Going as far as recommending me to the food bank.” 
After her daughter was admitted to the UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh for a two-night stay, Centofani’s meager healthcare coverage left her in a precarious financial position. “Do you know what it’s like to get a call from the Pittsburgh Community Food Bank saying your employer recommended you?” 
For many workers, it seems the answer may be yes: roughly two-thirds of UPMC employees struggle to pay rent, according to University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work Professor Dr. Jeffrey Shook. 
“It’s shameful that my coworkers and I have been pushed into medical debt while working for the largest medical provider in the state,” said administrative assistant Nila Payton. 
Rachel Dittmer, a service worker at UPMC Shadyside, said her insurance was cut while she was six months into chemo treatment. Tinisha Brockman, a patient care technician at UPMC Presbyterian, could not afford her inhaler last month. “People say we’re ‘essential,’” she said at the strike, “but I think UPMC treats us like we’re expendable.”

I’ve been at work for weeks, sleepless, chain-smoking cigarettes, mainlining PopSugar articles, and burning my eyes red (no pun intended) trying to get to the bottom of the most recent Taylor Swift controversy. For the sake of journalistic integrity, I’ll start this article with some background information, for those of you who may not understand the new “Taylor’s Version” album cycle. Basically, Taylor Swift is re-recording all her old music with a few differences and a lot of similarities. The albums have the same names, and the songs all sound the same, except some don’t sound the same, and also there’s some new songs nobody’s heard before but everyone has heard about, and also she’s now also a short film director? And the short film is about when Jake Gyllenhaal was mean to her 13 years ago.
Ms. Swift’s lawsuit against Gyllenhaal, “All Too Well: The Short Film,” is a comprehensive judicial attack, using all the tools of the law to prove Mr. Gyllenhaal’s guilt. She uses sophisticated legal techniques like “showing attractive people when they are happy” and “showing attractive people when they are sad.” She clearly proves Gyllenhaal’s crimes of being “mean,” “emotionally unavailable,” and “exploitative” in a poignant scene where he tells her that she’s crazy and she aggressively cleans a stack of dinner plates. The aesthetic of the film was also rigorously researched, and great pains were taken to make it look like an extended Urban Outfitters advertisement by way of a Hallmark Movie, with costume design by 2014 Pinterest. 
My legal team and I have watched the film, and I see where the general public’s outrage is stemming from. Dylan O’Brien, playing the aptly-named character “Him,” acts really mean and old, and Sadie Sink, in a brilliant star turn as — get this —  “Her” — acts really pretty, young, and sad. Taylor and Jake dated when she was 20 and he was 29, which — if you’re following my complex reasoning — is a nine-year difference in age. It’s hinted that he used his age to manipulate her, or at the very least that the power dynamic of their relationship was not altogether healthy.
These are serious allegations. I mean, wearing a plaid button-up with a beanie is criminal enough, but to be mean as well? Who would have ever thought that a significantly older, hyper-successful and exceptionally handsome male actor would ever be a narcissist?!
In addition to the crimes outlined in the film, my lawyers have noted that Jake continues to date women significantly younger than him. Taylor herself subtly indicates this with the very understated observation that “I'll get older but your lovers stay my age.” Indeed, Jake Gyllenhaal has had plenty of lovers, some of whom are young, some of whom are very young, and some of whom are straight-up juveniles. This has led me to my true question … Jake, why won’t you date me?
Before we lock him up, it’s important to acknowledge that Jake Gyllenhaal’s greatest felony is that he hasn’t dated me. First of all, I’m 20, which should be good enough for him. Secondly, I wouldn’t be able to write a song even if someone threw a guitar at my head, so he wouldn’t need to worry about the banger-ization of our potential breakup. Thirdly, very little of the American public is aware of my existence (other than you, my dear reader), so there’s little risk of public fallout. Lastly, I think we’d make a great couple — I’ll just sit around and quote lines from “Nightcrawler” at him while he sings “Sunday in the Park with George” and looks at himself in the mirror (also, I think Maggie and I would get along great. We’re both brunettes who went to drama school). 
In summary, I think Gyllenhaal should be locked away in actor jail forever, unless he texts me ASAP and asks me to dinner, in which case he’s done nothing wrong. This is my legal report, and I will defend my observations in COURT! Detective Dahiya rests her case, over and out.

Ink has been spilled over Jake Gyllenhaal and all about how evil he is. But let's be real: Is he really that bad? Hollywood (and Hollyweird) is filled with legitimate, actual, bona fide predators, and Big J is most certainly not one of them. You can blame him for being cringe, or sometimes being in bad movies, or for not being as cool as Ryan “The Goose” Gosling, but don’t go around saying all these mean and terrible things about him.
Here are the facts.
Firstly, Jake Gyllenhaal almost certainly smells bad. He spoke about his reduced amount of bathing in a bizarre interview that also included him waxing poetically about natural loofahs, but I guess that’s actors for you. In doing so, he joined the weirdly long list of actors that don’t shower, a list almost as long as the Polanski petition (which he did not sign, by the way). This bad smelled-ness of him shows his willingness to behave as the common man who might not have time to shower after a hard day's labor on the field.
Secondly, he isn’t Armie Hammer. Armie Hammer has claimed to enjoy eating people. Jake Gyllenhaal has never. Some people might have accused him of being a bad boyfriend, but nobody has ever accused him of method acting as a zombie.
Thirdly, he was in some movies I liked. People might be mad at him, but personally I thought that his acting in “Nightcrawler” was really good and elevated the film to something truly special. His portrayal of Lou Bloom as an ambulance chaser was riveting, and he definitely deserved the Oscar for best acting, an award for which he was somehow not even nominated.
Fourthly, there is no “Sad Boy Summer” edit of "Brokeback Mountain."
Fifthly, he has been standing for his beliefs for a long time, and I respect that. He campaigned for John Kerry back in 2004, something I wish I had done. He also likes to keep it chill though, and has said that "It frustrates me when actors talk politics; I'm political and I make choices in my movies that I think are political. I try and say things with what I do.” What a standup guy!
Sixthly, he sometimes dates people older than himself. Criticism has been brought upon Gyllenhaal for pulling a Leonardo DiCaprio, yet he dated Reese Witherspoon when he was 27 and she was 31, something Leo would never do. 
Of course, there are some valid reasons why some people would dislike him. Humans are not a monolithic group, and people will have valid reasons for disliking a man I personally find unimpeachable. For example: 
They may have thought his performance in Spider-Man 7 was over the top. That is valid, although I subscribe to the belief that he personally overacted to provide a foil to Tom Holland’s mellow portrayal of Spider-Man. They may be homophobic. Some people might have watched "Brokeback Mountain" and erroneously believed Jake to be gay or bisexual. He has, however, said, “You know it's flattering when there's a rumor that says I'm bisexual. I've never really been attracted to men sexually, but I don't think I would be afraid of it if it happened.”
They don’t like the Hollywood system, and prefer the homegrown indie scene. Although Jake Gyllenhaal has appeared in some lower budget films, some might object to his deep connections to Hollywood. Many of his godparents are acting royalty themselves, which might displease those who abhor nepotism.
They are jealous. It is known that people want to either be Mr. Gyllenhaal or be with Jake Gyllenhaal. He was, of course, the sixth most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish man in the world in 2012. Jewish men ranked seventh through 7,830,005th might feel overshadowed by this. Luckily for them, the year is now 2021, so they’ve got another chance to be on that list. And to all those who want to be with him, tough luck. Last I heard of him, he was dating a very successful pop musician, and I doubt he’d leave her for any of you.

At the close of every year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and society at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the campus and our society.
A thistle to the vaccine and everyone in our community who has made the choice to get it for making it safer to see and visit all of our friends and relatives again.
A thorn to COVID, duh. It’s still here, it still sucks. Unfortunately, despite all of the progress that has been made this year, we still have a ways to go to fully escape the COVID era.
A thistle to the La Prima staff for keeping us all alive this semester. You guys rule Carnegie Mellon and give us a reason to wake up and get out of bed in the morning.
A thorn to all of the global companies and corporations who are currently accounting for a vast majority of all the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and are not doing anything to stop climate change. Some of us don’t want an increased amount of major natural disasters.
A thistle to all the states that have either decriminalized or, to some degree, have legalized marijuana. Legalization, as well as decriminalization, creates jobs, increases economic activity, and leads to less racist convictions.
A thorn to the Republican party for continuing to set the already-low bar for inhumanity even lower through passing destructive legislation.Also, to the Democratic party for being incompetent and still losing in elections.
A thistle to workers all over the country who are currently organizing, unionizing, as well as striking for fairer wages and better working conditions in their respective places of employment.
A thorn to the one percent. Avoiding having to pay taxes and having fancy, exorbitant space races does, in fact, nothing at all to help out the general population.
A thistle to Millie’s in Tepper for giving students the rare opportunity to spend all of their overpriced meal plan currencies on ice cream. It gives us five minutes to forget about the five assignments we have due at midnight.
A thorn to the new dining hours. Where are we supposed to go when we’re hungry at 2 a.m. or on the weekends? R.I.P. 2 a.m. midlife crises in The Underground.
A thistle to Buggy being in-person again! After two whole years of not having a traditional  raceday, we are excited to see people rolling downhill in tiny carbon fiber tubes going 30 m.p.h. again.
A thorn to all the people who are fighting a non-existent war against critical race theory and vaccine mandates, despite the fact that both have been around for a very long time.
A thistle to the various Carnegie Mellon student organizations for being back and better than ever, hosting activities and events again, even after having been forced online for nearly two years.
A thorn to Carnegie Mellon, as well as colleges around the country, for increasing the cost of education in the United States year after year without fail.
A thistle to an in-person Tartan Community Day and Homecoming Weekend, which created multiple opportunities for active engagement for the Carnegie Mellon campus community.
A thorn to the legislators of the state of Texas for passing so many bills, laws, and regulations that attempt to limit the reproductive rights of women.
A thistle to the landscaping goats that journeyed to the Carnegie Mellon campus earlier this semester. You truly bring Sunshine (the donkey) to all of our lives.
A thorn to the mid-semester break being on a Thursday, as well as the shortened semester that ended up really stressing everyone out.
A thistle to Pittsburgh Mayor-elect Ed Gainey for making history as Pittsburgh’s first Black mayor after winning the election against Tony Moreno earlier this month.
A thorn to major companies like  UPMC and their chronic employee mistreatment. Is it that hard to pay a fair wage?
A thistle to squishmallows. It’s high time for them to come into fashion, for they have the potential to restore faith in humanity and resolve all of the world’s crises.
A thorn to TERFs. People should be able to identify how they want, and other individuals should have no say in their identities. Hate and bigotry have no place. Enough said.
A thistle to all of our Carnegie Mellon seniors, et al., who will be graduating later this coming year. Congrats to all of you — we know how hard it was.

In my first semester serving as your Student Body President, I’ve been given the rare opportunity to work with the student body not only as a representative but also as a collaborator. And while I could ramble endlessly about all of the technical, Carnegie Mellon-specific knowledge I’ve gained, the learning experience that has impacted me the most are the lessons I learned in caring for one another. It’s no surprise that the transition to in-person learning presented a slew of logistical challenges, from re-densification challenges while practicing social distancing, to our campus population being the largest in recent years creating a need for more robust staff and services, or even just students finding their way around campus. With these sorts of challenges, the solutions are more set in stone with clear, logical responses. However, the obstacles that were most difficult to overcome are much more abstract. How do we make students feel at home on a campus that has been empty for nearly two years? What can we do to make students feel safe and supported? What makes a valuable in-person experience while we still find ourselves amidst a global pandemic? These complex issues share one thing in common: the ability to be overcome by caring for one another. Care manifested itself campus-wide through our shared acceptance of A Tartan’s Responsibility, when students, faculty, and staff committed themselves to protecting one another; also with Tartan Community Day; and with the robust philanthropy community events, which allowed for students not only to care for their peers who organized such events but also for our greater Pittsburgh community with philanthropic efforts. The efforts on the individual scale are too many to name, which can even be as simple as sending a text to check in with friends during midterms. These simple actions are not the complete response to complex issues, but they are the stepping stones to a campus that always feels like home — where everyone is safe, loved, and valued. Despite these changes, this compassion resulting from COVID-19 does not mean that such practices should be eradicated post-pandemic. In my nearly four years as a Tartan, I’ve had the honor of bearing witness to the most care, compassion, and love within our student body, and these actions have grown our campus in a unique and special way. With that, I hope that the rest of the student body will join me in continuing practices of compassion and empathy to continue making our time spent on campus meaningful.
