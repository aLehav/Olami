The Carnegie Mellon University women’s basketball team finished its 2017-18 season with a victory against University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals Case Western Reserve University Spartans on Saturday, Feb. 24. After a close start, the Tartans pulled away in the second to win the game 71–55.
Sophomore Laurel Pereira led the Tartans with a game-high of 23 points, and 10 rebounds, recording the first double-double of her career. Sophomore MaKayla Filiere had 13 points, and sophomore Megan Jaeb added 10 points, matching her career high. Junior Jenn Mayberger had team highs in assists and steals, with seven and four, respectively. First-year Kylie Huffman hauled in a team high of 11 rebounds off the bench.
The Spartans struck first with a layup in the opening minute of the first quarter, but the Tartans quickly took the lead with a three-pointer from Mayberger. Five other Tartans reached the basket as the teams traded shots and the lead for the rest of the quarter, which ended with the Tartans leading the game 18–14.
The Tartans outscored the Spartans 23–11 in the second quarter with 50 percent shooting and held the visitors to only 21.4 percent shooting. Pereira took control of the Tartans’ defense with 16 points on 5-for-6 shooting. Pereira opened the quarter with back-to-back jump shots and later scored seven straight points to build the Tartans’ lead, which was as much as 21 points a minute left to play. The Spartans responded with the final five points of the quarter to close the half, trailing the Tartans 25–41.
Coming out of halftime, the Spartans scored five points for a total 10 straight points continuing from the second quarter. Filiere ended the Spartans’ run with a three-pointer to make the score 44–30. With 2:22 left in the third, the Spartans cut the lead to 9 points, but the Tartans responded with another Filiere three-pointer to extend their lead back to double-digits. The Tartans maintained their lead in the fourth quarter, winning the game 71–55.
Overall, the Tartans shot 46.4 percent from the field, including 42.9 percent from the three-point line, the team’s third-highest team shooting percentage of the season. They benefited from more than four times as many bench points, 21 to the Spartans’ 5, as well as 10 more points in the paint. The team also recorded more rebounds, assists, and second chance points.
The Tartans finish the 2017-18 season with a 10–15 record, 2–12 in UAA play, down from last season’s 21–7 (7–7 in UAA play) record. Will all 12 players on the roster returning, the Tartans will look to build on what they accomplished as they look to next season.

The Carnegie Mellon University men’s basketball team ended its season on a high note with a big 72–63 win against their University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals, the Case Western Reserve University Spartans. The Tartans finish the season going 7–18 and 3–11 in conference play. After the Spartans’ loss, they finished with a 12–13 record, going 6–8 in conference.
The Tartans had three different players rack up double-figure points, thanks to sophomore Zach Howarth with 18, junior Patrick Ehland with 12, and junior Seth Henry with 10 points. Senior Ryan Maha drained three buckets from beyond the arc to rack up 9 points, helping him end his career ranked fourth on the all-time-three-pointers made list with 183. Maha also had four rebounds in his final game as a Tartan.
Carnegie Mellon built a sizeable lead in the first half, 30–11, after three consecutive three pointers, two from Maha and one from Howarth. The Tartans managed to control play through the remainder of the second half, at one point going up 40–19 with a minute left after a layup by Henry. The Spartans did manage to respond, however, on a jumper to make the score 40–21 at the half.
The Tartans held onto control of the game for the beginning of the second half, building a lead of 58–43 up at the 11-minute mark, but the Spartans bounced back and played some strong defense. The Spartans held the Tartans to just one field goal for 10:31 seconds, managing to shrink the Tartans’ lead to just four points, at 63–59. Howarth and the Tartans responded in kind, however, when he dropped in a layup with just 43 seconds remaining to cap off a run of seven straight points by the home team. The Tartans held onto that lead for the rest of the game, finishing off the Spartans with the final score of 72–59.
The Tartans went 27 for 67 against the Spartans, with a 40.3 shooting percentage from the field. They held the Spartans to 32.4 percent from field goal range and controlled the ball well in the paint, scoring 34 points up close at the post. They also recorded more assists and less turnovers. The Spartans maintained control of the boards, where they out-rebounded the Tartans 54–40. The Tartans received support from their bench players, who scored 31 of Carnegie Mellon’s 72 points in the victory. Nine different players recorded points in the game.
The Tartans end a lackluster season with a win and will look to bounce back next season. Good luck to the team and thanks to the seniors, Ryan Maha and Thomas Cook, for all they put into the Carnegie Mellon basketball team.

After 17 days of competition, the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang are complete. After 102 events in 15 sports, the world has watched both dreams come true and expectations loom too large. But in the end, we have also watched the spirit of the Games prevail as well.
As always, politics threatened to take over the Olympics, from the fragile relations between North and South Korea to the Russian doping scandal running its course. But as always, the Games themselves were the best story, as they should be.
For the United States, there was some familiar territory at the top of the podium, but also a fair share of disappointment. Americans dominated the Phoenix Snow Park. Teens Red Gerard and Chloe Kim took gold, in men’s slopestyle and women’s halfpipe, respectively, becoming instant household names. Jamie Anderson defended her gold in women’s slopestyle, and picked up the silver in the Olympics’ inaugural big air competition. David Wise was the only other American to defend his gold medal from Sochi, in the men’s freestyle ski halfpipe.
With his gold in the men’s snowboarding halfpipe, his third overall, Shaun White fulfilled the comeback story laid out perfectly for him by NBC after his fourth place finish in the 2014 Sochi Olympics. He is undoubtedly the greatest snowboarder ever, but his legacy is now a murky one, with sexual harassment allegations and a settlement against him.
Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic became the first woman to win gold in two sports, the alpine skiing super-G and the snowboarding parallel giant slalom. Her win in the former was one of the best moments of the entire Olympics, as the shock on her face at the run of her life remained plastered on her face long after ours had moved on.
Norway exerted its Winter Games dominance, with a world-leading 39 total medals, including 14 gold, tied with Germany for the most. The Netherlands, clad in the country’s vibrant orange and blue, continued its speed skating supremacy with all their 20 medals in the sport, eight of them gold, while Hungary won its first ever Winter Games gold in the men’s 5000m speed skating gold.
Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan defended his men’s figure skating gold from Sochi, the first man to do so since American Dick Button in 1952. American Nathan Chen showed all his 18 years in his first Olympics. Billed as a gold medal contender and one of the biggest challengers to Hanyu, he succumbed to nerves in his first two Olympic skates, the two worst of his short career. But he also showed the fearlessness of a teenager, coming back in his historic free skate, landing six quadruple jumps, five of them cleanly.
The home country also boasted some of the greatest moments of the Games, with Yun Sung-bin taking gold in the skeleton, the first athlete outside North America or Europe to win an Olympic sliding medal. The Garlic Girls curling team, all of the surname Kim, swept their way to the silver medal and into the hearts of their people watching.
But curling also saw the most quintessential example of what Americans hope they can be and what the Games should be. The U.S. men’s curling team was led by John Shuster, the best curler America has to offer, who followed a bronze in the 2006 Torino Olympics with last and second-to-last finishes in the two following Olympics. The team battled back after a 2-4 start in round-robin play, captivated an American audience that fell in love with the games for two weeks, and won the most unlikely of golds.
In a time where the greatness of White’s snowboarding skill has seemingly exonerated him to the public, we saw the flip side with women’s perseverance paying off. The U.S. Women’s Hockey team got their revenge on Canada, their biggest rivals, from the heartbreak silver from Sochi. Last year, the team announced they would boycott the world championships to protest equal pay. They took the risk, and won, striking a deal with USA Hockey, an important victory in the fight for equal pay for women.
The women’s hockey gold medal match itself was everything a fan could ask for (especially since NHL players, the best in the world, are not part of the men’s competition) – lead changes, momentum swings, and a heart-stopping shootout.
And so closes this 23rd Olympic cycle, as the athletes continue with their off-season competitions and training, and the world waits another four years to fall in love with sports they still don’t completely understand. But some moments will live with us forever, and that’s what the Olympics are all about.

Amateur astronomer discovers supernova
When observing the night sky with a telescope, the chances of witnessing the beginning of a supernova are between 1 in 10 million and 1 in 100 million. Amateur astronomer and locksmith Víctor Buso beat the odds when, while trying out a new camera, he captured a photo of a gigantic star beginning to die.
Buso was photographing the galaxy NGC 613 on September 20, 2016, in Rosario, Argentina, when he noticed that a dot of light had appeared in one of the photos. He checked the rest of the photos and realized that the dot was growing brighter. 
According to the Smithsonian Magazine, this might be the first time a photograph of the early phases of a supernova have been taken. Previous phtographs document the few minutes right after a supernova formation, but never the early moments.
When astronomer Melina Bersten of the Instituto de Astrofísica de La Plata learned of Buso's photographs, she contacted astronomers around the world to make sure that the supernova was properly documented, and helped organize a coherent study. The official description of the supernova, dubbed SN 2016gkg, was published this week in Nature.
SN 2016gkg was classified as a Type II supernova and determined to have originated from a star roughly 20 times the mass of the Sun. 
“Observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way, “ said UC Berkeley astronomer Alex Filippenko. “It’s like winning the cosmic lottery.”

Chameleons have fluorescent heads
Scientists have discovered that many chameleons have fluorescent bumps on their heads that glow under ultraviolet light.
David Prötzel, a herpetologist at Zoologische Staatssammlung München in Germany, investigated the odd fluorescent bumps after seeing a picture on Flickr of a chameleon under UV light. In the photo, taken by photographer Paul Bertner, three tiny bumps on the chameleon's head were glowing.
Though scientists have long known that chameleon heads often have bony bumps, “we were always wondering about [their function],” says Prötzel. He and his colleagues shone ultraviolet (UV) light on hundreds of chameleons, and most of them had fluorescent bumps. “We found that many species fluoresce with even larger pattern on their heads” than the chameleon in Bertner's photo, Prötzel says.
The bony bumps on the chameleons' heads aren't bioluminescent — the light doesn't come from chemical reactions within the chameleon's body. Instead, it comes from the fact that the bone is naturally fluorescent. The chameleons only have a single extremely thin layer of skin on top of the bony bumps, letting the bone's natural fluorescence shine through.
Chameleons from forests were more likely to have the bumps than chameleons in open areas. Prötzel and his colleagues believe this is because shaded forests have more ambient UV light, making the bumps more visible to other chameleons. Their function is unknown. 
Though humans usually cannot see the fluorescence, the researchers believe that other chameleons can, as chameleons are able to perceive UV light.

Neanderthals capable of making art
A recent report published in Science, claims that the art discovered in the caves of Spain dates back to 64,800 years ago which was at least 20,000 years before early humans reached Europe. This means that the art was produced by Neanderthals — which means that they were far more intelligent than previously believed. 
Recent discoveries of surprisingly sophisticated tools and ideas that were used by Neanderthals such as, medicinal plants, burial rites and stone tools - have already reframed preconceived notions about Neanderthals’ mental capacity. However, the ability to make art is indicative of a new cognitive milestone — the ability to understand and have symbolic thought. 
The art found in the Spanish caves comprise of some crudely outlined hands, series of lines, pigment stained and pierced shells. The shells’ holes seemed to suggest that they were worn as body ornaments — which makes the Neanderthals capable of first, deciding to make art and then, mixing pigments and crafting shells.  João Zilhão — a researcher at the University of Barcelona in Spain, who is an author of the paper, sees Neanderthals as the full mental equivalent of humans. While scientists remain divided on that claim, there is little doubt in attributing the art to Neanderthals.

Members of the Taino culture, indigenous to the Caribbean, have maintained their cultural history for hundreds of years through oral tradition. It is believed that the Taino were the Indians present on the coast of America when Christopher Columbus "discovered" it in 1492. After 50 years of living together, the relationships between the Taino and the colonizers began to crumble, and the Taino population began to drop. Ricardo Alegría, a Puerto Rican researcher, claims in a 2011 interview with Smithsonian Magazine that, "Their culture was interrupted by disease, marriage with Spanish and Africans, and so forth, but the main reason the Indians were exterminated as a group was sickness... By 1519, a third of the aboriginal population had died because of smallpox." As time passed, colonization did more harm than good to the Taino people and, by the early 1500s, according to some controversial records, more than 85 percent of their population was wiped out. In fact, with the publication of some recent archaeological evidence, most researchers insisted that the Tainos were an extinct people.
“According to Spanish accounts, we went extinct 30 years after [European] contact,” says Jorge Estevez, an expert on Taino cultures at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian. Historians and anthropologists usually cite disease and brutalization as the cause of Taino extinction.
A sizable percentage of people in the Caribbean lay claim to indigenous ancestry, and still participate in traditional Taino cultural practices, but many researchers still insist that they are not truly Taino descendants. Though genetic surveys of these people reveal DNA signatures indicative of indigenous origins, most researchers believed this was because they were really descended from native North Americans brought to the Caribbean as slaves.
This perception may finally change as undeniable genetic evidence comes to light.
A thousand-year-old skeleton that belonged to a Taino woman, found in a cave in the Bahamas, has had its genome sequenced in extreme detail, providing far more precise insight into Taino DNA than ever before. It's the most complete precontact Taino genome ever analyzed. And when researchers compared her genome to those of modern Puerto Ricans, the resemblance was undeniable.
“It’s almost like the ancient Taino individual they’re looking at is the cousin of the ancestors of people from Puerto Rico,” says Maria Nieves-Colón, a geneticist who studies ancient and modern Caribbean populations at the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico.
“These indigenous communities were written out of history,” says Jada Benn Torres, a genetic anthropologist at Vanderbilt University. "They are adamant about their continuous existence, that they’ve always been [on these islands]. So to see it reflected in the ancient DNA, it’s great.”
By analyzing the Taino woman's genes, the researchers were able to determine that her people were not inbred, restricted to the small island she lived on — they spanned many islands in a wide trade network. “It looks like an interconnected network of people exchanging goods, services, and genes,” says William Schaffer, a bioarchaeologist at Phoenix College who helped excavate the remains.
“You know what? These people didn’t disappear," says Nieves-Colón. "In fact, they’re still here. They’re in us.”

For a company founded 14 years ago and having only been making a true production vehicle since 2012, Tesla is doing quite well. But the established automakers, and particularly the German luxury giants, are not happy to see a new player joining their ranks. Over the past couple of years, companies like BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche have been announcing their intentions to introduce a luxury electric vehicle to battle the Tesla Model S or Model X, showing off flashy quasi-SUV concepts with electric powertrains and allegedly impressive specifications. The dominant carmakers were caught a bit off guard by the success of Model S, which is now more than five years old, and so their production models aren’t due to hit the streets until next year. However, through concepts and leaked information, Tesla should have a pretty good idea of what type of competition to expect. 
Most luxury companies initially stated plans for slinky four-door “coupes” like the Model S, but the relative success of the Model X SUV and the general market trend towards crossovers have changed several automakers’ minds. Audi’s e-tron Quattro and e-tron Sportback concepts preview an electric SUV rumored to debut within the next year. If the concepts are any indication, the SUV will use three electric motors (one on the front axle, two on the rear) that would propel the Audi to 60 mph in the mid-four seconds with a battery range of more than 300 miles. Jaguar is also prepping an SUV due next year, the I-Pace. The bodywork of the stunning concept is supposedly quite close to the production version, and with one electric motor at the front and one at the rear, the Jaguar matches the Audi’s acceleration figures. 
BMW has taken a slightly different route. BMW has created a sub-brand, trendily dubbed “i,” and has already put two electric models into production, the i3 and the i8. The i3, a quirky little hatchback, has had relative success globally, while the futuristic and gorgeous i8 sports car has sold in small numbers. While the fate of these two models is undetermined, BMW has previewed a future “i” car, to be called the i5, with its i Vision Dynamics Concept. While this concept is a sedan, rumors also suggest a car called the iNext, which may be a codename for the i5 or a separate SUV model. 
Mercedes is following in the footsteps of its Bavarian competitor, announcing its “EQ” electric sub-brand with the Generation EQ Concept two years ago. This concept, which had a two electric motor setup and scalable battery parts for different amounts of power, hinted at a midsize SUV that is due out next year. The EQA Concept, on the other hand, will be a swanky little hatchback when it comes out in 2020. With the same setup as the SUV, it will get less power but still be able to do the 60 mph sprint in 5 seconds and have a range of up to 400 miles. 
Sports car connoisseur Porsche has even jumped on the bandwagon, with its achingly beautiful "Mission E" concept. Expected to arrive next year, the Mission E promises to maintain the classic Porsche look while delivering over 600 horsepower, 60 mph in less than 3.5 seconds, and a range of approximately 500 miles. The Mission E is also rumored to be a true performance car, and might spawn an SUV variant not long after.
A recent entry is Polestar—formerly Volvo’s performance arm, Polestar is now a separate electric sports car brand. Their first vehicle, the “1,” will actually be a hybrid coupe based on the handsome Volvo Concept Coupe, and will begin production in mid-2019. With financial backing from Chinese car giant Geely and track-car know-how from Lotus (which Geely also acquired), the Polestar brand looks to have a bright future. 
While all of these automakers rush to bring their electric cars to market, Tesla is continuing to expand. Along with the Model S and Model X, a smaller sedan called the Model 3 is ramping up production now, a new Roadster supercar is coming in 2020, and a semi-truck arrives sometime before that. There are also rumors of a pickup truck, a passenger van, and a small SUV in the pipeline. The established carmakers are going to have to work even faster if they want to catch Tesla.

Identity. Representation. Power. All just some of the key themes centered in the story of Marvel’s highly-anticipated 18th installment: Black Panther.
While being immersed in the excitement that’s been building around Black Panther for the past couple months, I frequently remembered one of my first experiences with representation when I was younger. As a little girl, one of my favorite movies was Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella. If you haven’t seen it, it’s a musical version of the classic Cinderella story told with a mixed cast: the king is played by a white actor, the queen is played by Whoopi Goldberg, the prince is played by a Filipino actor, and the titular Cinderella is played by Brandy, a black actress. 
I think I loved this movie so much mostly because of the catchy songs, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more and more attached to it, because it was one of the first movies where I felt like I truly saw myself in the lead, like I could be that princess. It was my first taste of representation.
Maybe it’s not the best connection to Black Panther, being that Cinderella was a servant, forced into servitude by an evil stepmother. But maybe that’s one of the reasons why a movie like Black Panther is so important right now. There are no slaves, no gangsters, no drug addicts, none of the negative portrayals of African-Americans that are usually presented in films. Instead, Black Panther is a captivating story about a man’s journey to fulfill his destiny, never once believing that the color of his skin would hold him back. It was a superhero movie with a message.
Black Panther is set in the fictional East African nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced civilization, powered by vibranium, hidden away from the rest of the world. A lot of the central conflict of the film has to do with Wakanda’s ability to utilize its resources to help the rest of the world. The nation of Wakanda was truly a character in itself. The portrayal of the nation included dense forests, rustic reds, greens, and browns — what you would expect from an African nation, interwoven with high powered trains, towering buildings, gorgeous waterfalls, and mountains. It was a place that seemed both foreign yet familiar. Adding to the beauty of Wakanda are the gorgeous costumes, makeup, and hair designs incorporated into the film, created by Ruth E. Carter, Joel Harlow, and Camille Friend, respectively, all inspired by the history of African tribes.
The women in the movie epitomize black female power. The nation’s armed forces are called the Dora Milaje, female warriors sworn to protect Wakanda and its king, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka the Black Panther, who we are first introduced to in Captain America: Civil War. The Dora Milaje is led by Okoye (Danai Gurira) and are adorned in matching red–toned armor, shaved heads, and a fierce demeanor. One of my favorite scenes is when Okoye, while undercover, complains about her discomfort with wearing a straight-haired wig, a quick play on her acceptance of her own feminine beauty. Once a fight breaks out, the wig is one the first things she tosses away. In an interview with People Magazine, Gurira called the moment subversive, and a refusal of conventional norms of feminine beauty, saying “[Okoye] is just being who she is. You know, being proud of her bald head and her tats. And how her femininity — all of the women [in the film] — their femininity coincides so seamlessly with their ferocity. And how those two things do not have to compromise themselves for the other thing.”
Other women in the film include Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o), T’Challa’s somewhat love interest, a warrior in her own right, who is a strong believer in doing good in the world and helping those not able to help themselves. Letitia Wright shines as T’Challa’s little sister, Shuri. Although 16, she is the brains behind the creation and maintenance of the technology of Wakanda.
While Marvel villains are usually pretty one-dimensional and unmemorable, with the exception of Loki of course, Erik “Killmonger” Stephens (Michael B. Jordan) carries a complexity that makes the title of villain somehow seem wrong. While I don’t agree with his motivation to seek vengeance on T’Challa, it’s easy to understand where those motivations hailed from, and how this was created as a product of his childhood. Killmonger often cites his experiences growing up as a black man in America, being linked to a history of slavery and oppression, as the motivation behind a lot of his actions. “Y’all sitting up here comfortable. Must feel good. Meanwhile, there are about two billion people all over the world that look like us. But their lives are a lot harder. Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all,” says Killmonger at one point in the movie. There were moments when I found myself more interested in Killmonger’s story over T’Challa’s, but I praise Marvel for finally creating an antagonist that feels like an equal contender to the movie’s protagonist.
Black Panther includes a truly melanin infused cast, essentially a who’s-who of black Hollywood, including familiar faces such as Daniel Kaluuya, known for his Oscar-nominated performance in Get Out, as W’Kabi, Angela Bassett as T’Challa’s mother Ramonda, Forest Whitaker as Zuri, the spiritual guide, Sterling K. Brown as N’Jobu, Winston Duke as M’Baku, and Florence Kasumba as Ayo, among others. The film also includes Martin Freeman returning as Agent Everett Ross, and Andy Serkis who gives a stunning portrayal of the crazed Ulysses Klaue.
Black Panther has something for everybody: a captivating story, fully-fleshed out characters, a classic comic book superhero adaptation, and amazing music by Kendrick Lamar. Overall, the hype behind Black Panther is absolutely deserved, and worth every praise and box office smashing record it has received thus far.

I love Marvel, but I am very clearly not African-American. While I am proudly Asian-American, my New England experiences have also made me very basic and white. In fact, I might be one of the least qualified people to tell you how important Black Panther is. But, I can’t emphasize how instrumental this film is for not just the future of Hollywood, but for an entire generation.
It is impossible to count the number of records this movie has broken on two hands. Black Panther is currently the highest-rated superhero movie on Rotten Tomatoes with 97 percent, tied with The Incredibles. It had the most ticket presales out of all superhero films, including those from Marvel Studios. It has the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) highest-grossing first week at the box office. It had the biggest opening weekend at the box office for an African-American director, Ryan Coogler. It set a record for the highest box office opening weekend in February, beating Deadpool by $60 million. Oh and by the way, that opening weekend made $202 million.
Black Panther, a movie almost entirely featuring African-American actors, directors, writers, and overall crew members, now has the fifth-highest domestic opening weekend of all time, wedged in between two of the MCU’s biggest movies, The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Hollywood calls Black Panther and its financial performance a watershed moment. Black Panther is not just a magnificent, long-overdue film that praises its cultural origins. It’s become a beautiful gemstone in the history and culture of African-Americans, and maybe of their children’s history and culture, and perhaps a lightning rod of inspiration for those who seek it. It educates others about African culture and helps to open people’s perspectives about the world around them. It is visually stunning and probably Marvel’s smartest movie, with every choice made — certain shots, certain costumes and motifs, certain colors — meaning something. It is thought-provoking and examines a culture’s past to prepare for their future through its larger, overall messages. It is masterfully acted, featuring fantastic performances from all of its actors — especially that of Michael B. Jordan, whose portrayal of Killmonger usurps the title of the MCU’s best villain from Tom Hiddleston’s Loki for a key reason: Loki, universally loved, is a classic comic book villain. But Killmonger, also universally loved, starts discussions.
Everything surrounding Black Panther was more than just hype for another Marvel movie. It was the slow build-up to a cultural reckoning; from its casting news and announcements to its trailers to the moments before and after walking to the theater and seeing the celebration of African and African-American culture reflected in the clothes of the people Black Panther seeks to represent, this movie had much higher stakes and maybe even sky-high expectations to meet due to its material and proposed vision.
And thankfully, it did. In fact, not only did Black Panther meet those sky-high expectations, it almost fundamentally changed our cultural landscape. Black Panther caused tremors throughout a culture and through a grander political scheme. It’s finally proven how and why representation matters in Hollywood and what this can do for a person. In a time of political turmoil and loss of hope, Black Panther brings that hope back to its community and worldwide, and maybe serves as an inspiration to that young African-American boy who wants to break into the entertainment industry or that African-American teenage girl wanting to break into the STEM fields. However, since this is also a time of said political turmoil, it’s also brought out the worst in people.
In the first few days of Black Panther’s release, some Twitter accounts tried to spread false stories of attacks at screenings, saying that African-American attackers called people out saying “This movie ain’t for you, whitey” or “You’re in the wrong theater.” To make matters worse, pictures of “victims” from these Twitter accounts ranged from pictures of domestic abuse victims to pictures of people who were attacked up to five years ago.
To combat the racism and bigotry, a little while after, some Twitter users pushed back and mocked the attackers with tweets such as “last night I was attending Black Panther when a black child who looked to be around four years old told me ‘this movie wasn’t for me’ and proceeded to violently assault me with an eighteen megaton atomic bomb,” accompanied by a picture of an atomic bomb, and other stories of “attacks” combined with images of beaten up people from pop culture. The overwhelmingly positive response Black Panther has generated from people shows that overall, the movie aims to be a force for good and a catalyst to shape the future. And perhaps most importantly, people are supporting that change and working harder to make it happen.
In an op-ed piece with CNN, host of The Dean Obeidallah Show, Dean Obeidallah, stated how Black Panther’s success “gives me hope that one day my minority group, Arab Americans and Muslims, will see a superhero from our community on the big screen.” Throughout most of our lives, African-Americans and members of other minority groups like myself have seen people who look like us as people needing to be saved, or as villains, or simply not on the screen at all. But Black Panther changes all of that drastically. 
From a financial and business standpoint, Black Panther proves that African-Americans on the screen are bankable and can generate profit, and that consumers are yearning for more diverse properties where they can see themselves on TV or in a packed theater. From a cultural standpoint, Black Panther is the newest addition to a prestigious and widely celebrated list of movies like Star Wars and fellow MCU entries The Avengers and Raiders of the Lost Ark, celebrated for their impact on history, on people, and on a generation. And for African-Americans, Black Panther is an overwhelmingly positive reminder that you truly can do anything you set your mind to, because someone who looks just like you might just be doing the exact same thing.

Every year, Carnegie Mellon is lucky to have passionate students work together to organize events that celebrate diversity on campus. They help create comfortable and safe environments for students to share their various differences with others in the university. One of the most recent of these events that occurred was the Spark the Movement showcase, which took place in the Cohon Center Rangos Ballroom last Friday. The showcase, which has now become an annual university event, started just last year as a project by former fifth year scholar, Rachel Freer. I was fortunate to have been able to attend last year’s showcase, and I was excited to see how similar and different this year’s event would be. 
The live performance part of the showcase was divided into two parts. The show opened with a powerful performance of Nina Simone’s “I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,” by electrical and computer engineering major and senior, Arnelle Etienne and [MAJOR TBD] Ziv Piper accompanying her on the piano. The performance easily moved the entire audience, and it set a very empowering and reflective tone for the rest of the event. The acts that took place afterwards all had a similar impact on the audience, with each and every performance being very genuine and representative of the student performers’ experiences. Junior Art major, Emily Giedzinski’s personal choreography to the song "Ugly" by Nicole Dollanganger, was a powerful example of the honesty that the performers put into their acts, as her dance was a personal reflection of an experience of bullying. Stories of other various social and internal hardships were told through spoken word poems and songs, as well as paintings and photographs throughout the event. The second part of the Spark the Movement showcase took place immediately after the live performance portion, at a reception sponsored by the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion. All the performers and audience members were able to celebrate the event together and view visual art pieces that share similar messages to those from the live performances.
What’s so amazing about this showcase is how strong of a connection you can feel with all the artists. They shared personal feelings and stories on topics and issues that many in the audience, including myself, could easily relate to. Last year, as a freshman first seeing the showcase, I didn’t truly understand the importance of this event. Now I can say that I’ve truly realized how significant it is to talk about our feelings on both social and personal issues with others in the campus community. Sparking such conversations can help lead to creating more safe spaces for people to fearlessly be themselves and connect with others who can also understand their experiences.

There’s nothing better than a venue that serves both artisanal drinks and giant portions of food for a weekend night. Situated on Butler Street, Industry Public House has an expansive facade that you can’t miss. It’s almost entirely covered by windows, making it easy when window-shopping for places to chill and drink. When I found out the place is also known for its large selection of alcohol, I stopped by Industry Public House in Lawrenceville to see what all the fuss was about.
First of all, the space is huge, and the vibe was definitely happening. The dark decor gave a really cozy setting, and the crowd was an eclectic mix of young professionals, couples, families, and party groups.
It eventually got pretty packed, which is impressive given its huge space and many seating choices. The bar has a lot of room for movement and mingling, which makes it a hot commodity for visitors.
As the night wore on, it got more and more crowded. I wouldn’t have minded, but that’s when the service became lackluster as well. Be prepared to use your assertiveness when flagging down waiters or bartenders here. The situation wasn’t too terrible, though, because I spent my time waiting by chowing down on one of their flatbreads. It definitely has a better quality of bar food than the usual suspects, but with a better standard comes a prettier penny to spend.
I ordered the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby cocktail, which is a mix of blackberries, lemon, basil, and rhubarb liqueur. It was a perfect mix of tart, sweet, and savory. If cocktails aren’t your thing, they have a great selection of craft beers, whiskey, and other spirits. Their drinks menu is exciting, with a lot of great contenders, and the bar is decked with bottles. I would probably choose the drinks over the food here, if given the choice.
One last comment is the pricing, which can get pretty steep depending on what you order. The food, though portioned generously, is a little expensive for the college student looking for a good time. I’d recommend taking advantage of their happy hour. From 4:30 - 6:30 p.m. Monday to Friday, you get $2 off all draft beers and a flat rate of $7 for all cocktails, as well as discounted flatbreads and burgers. That way, you can enjoy the space without worrying about emptying your wallet.
Definitely worth the trip, though.

Dear Izzy,
I love my friends, but we can’t plan things for s**t. Getting the eight of us to try to plan something together for spring break is impossible. Not only are all of us loaded with a ton of club meetings on top of the classes we’re already taking, but all of us have a bunch of different ideas of what we want to do for spring break. Three people want to go somewhere down South, like Miami, or some tropical island where the weather is hot and the people are hotter, and three people want to go somewhere with more of a city-like vibe and a lot of stuff to do and see. The other person is not even sure if she can actually go anymore or be there for the whole time and she wants to accommodate for that.
Now, I’m just worried because I am very well aware we should have probably booked hotels and plane tickets a long time ago. Is there anything we can do to pull together a last minute trip?
Sincerely,
Travel-Ready ImPossible
Dear T-R.I.P.,
It is obvious that the most important thing that you guys need to do is make the effort and time out of your busy schedules to sit down and go over everything you have so far.
When you first meet up with your friends, try to talk things out and make compromises for things you want in a destination that you will and will not be able to meet. When you’re together, try to meet up and look at some places online together to try to find a few cities or islands that make everyone happy.
But, while it is clear what everyone wants, when the eight of you meet up, you need to start clearing up what you can realistically do. Some places and tickets will be completely out of your price range, and that kind of takes over all of your wants for the perfect spring break trip. Make sure to take that into consideration too, otherwise you’d run the risk of just not having enough money — which no one wants.
But, you can also consider smaller things too.
Try taking a road trip with two cars across the country — it’ll make for a great bonding experience and even greater memories, and it’ll save you the hassle of finding plane tickets — there’s always a gas station somewhere. Go to someone’s hometown and just chill there, or take them to yours and show them the place that shaped you.
But, if it’s impossible to coordinate a trip for all eight of you, staying at home and relaxing from the schoolwork, research, extracurriculars, and planning is okay too. FaceTime hopefully shouldn’t be as hard to coordinate.
Best,
Izzy

The music of rappers Tyler, the Creator and Vince Staples is seemingly diametrically opposed. Tyler, on his latest album Flower Boy, adopted a floral theme rife with garden imagery and immaculate live-instrumentation arrangements. Staples, on the other hand, worked with rising electronic producers on Big Fish Theory to craft an industrial, almost Orwellian work. Big Fish Theory is abrasive and wordy, while Flower Boy is inviting and catchy. This is not to say that Tyler failed lyrically on his album, but rather that his typically baritone flow managed to put together an album as well-known for its hooks as its verses. Both projects are successes in their own right, but this is perhaps the only unifying factor that brought Tyler and Vince together on their ongoing joint tour.
The show last week, with Vince opening and Tyler headlining, drew a packed house at Stage AE. The majority of the crowd, it seemed, came to see Tyler, and that was most apparent during Vince's set. The crowd bobbed along to his electronic-inspired bangers, but for the most part seemed disinterested in his music. This was especially upsetting given Vince's level of notoriety in hip hop and the quality of his music. The set, too, was great, as the stage and Vince's presence felt like something drawn straight from 1984. Digital cubes were able to display video twisted and turned to the beat of each song, giving the stage a surreal look meant to unsettle the audience. Hits like "Big Fish" and "Norf Norf" drew excitement from the crowd as Vince's most well known songs, but there were noticeable dips in energy when lesser-known songs like "Party People" came on. Much of Vince's new music is crafted to be danced to, as it creates an almost club-like atmosphere. As it became more explicitly clear once Tyler took the stage, the crowd was evidently more interested in moshing than dancing.
There was a lull of almost 40 minutes between Vince's and Tyler's set, and the crowd grew noticeably more restless as time went on. Then the clock struck 10:00 p.m., and Tyler's entrance began. Vince's wall of digital cubes had been disassembled to reveal a purple curtain, and the curtain eventually dropped to reveal Tyler standing atop a log resting on its side at an incline. He was well above the audience, facing away from the crowd as Flower Boy hit "Where This Flower Blooms" faded in. He turned to face the crowd only once his vocal part began, and immediately grabbed the energy of the crowd. He held it for the entirety of his set. The set itself was fairly substantial in length, as well. He played almost the entirety of Flower Boy in addition to songs off earlier albums like Goblin and Wolf. Bangers like "Who Dat Boy" and "I Ain't Got Time" sent the crowd into a frenzy. I was hit in the face at least three times, at one point so hard that my glasses flew off and went missing for half of a song. Luckily, a good samaritan helped me find them, and I was able to quickly fix them before the next track. 
Aside from former Odd Future collaborators Taco — who opened the show with a DJ set before Vince came on — and Jasper who sat off to the side, Tyler was the only person on stage, and he commanded it with ease. For someone sharing such personal details in songs like "Garden Shed" and "Glitter," both of which he performed, Tyler showed uniform confidence in the words he rapped and sang. For an artist like him, who went from spouting homophobia in his early works to quietly coming out of the closet on Flower Boy, Tyler carried the same genuine energy on stage that sold me on the album. The show felt personal, cathartic — especially for Tyler as he screamed "I've been kissing white boys since 2004" — and celebratory. Tyler, the Creator has emerged as an unlikely voice for honesty and compassion with his latest work, and his show at Stage AE fully reflected that commitment.

CMU ALLIES is hosting their third Open Mic Night event, taking place Friday, March 2, as part of their observance of Zero Discrimination Day. Zero Discrimination Day, an annual holiday celebrated by the United Nations (U.N.) and other international organizations, focuses on challenging discrimination by celebrating “diversity, tolerance, and inclusion,” a goal which ALLIES aims to fulfill with their “Shine a Light” Open Mic Night.
ALLIES is Carnegie Mellon’s primary student activist organization, with a strong focus on the diverse undergraduate LGBTQ+ community. In addition to offering materials and hosting events in support of LGBTQ+ students, they also aim to create a more inclusive and educated community at Carnegie Mellon. Frequently tabling on campus and coordinating social activities, ALLIES creates spaces for their students to become more connected and more informed. A few of their main initiatives include running support groups for various demographics and intersections within the LGBTQ+ community, like the Queer Women Support Group and the Trans and Non-binary Support Group, as well as recognition of formal holidays, like the Trans Day of Visibility, National Coming Out Day, and GAYpril.
“Shine a Light” will celebrate inclusion by placing marginalized groups at the forefront; it aims to place a spotlight on the challenges those groups face, as well as highlight the wonderful diversity that exists within them. Members of those groups will have the opportunity to perform a piece that shares their experiences, helping to create an atmosphere of understanding across the many communities and cultures within Carnegie Mellon, and even Pittsburgh as a whole. In the true spirit of inclusion, ALLIES encourages everyone and anyone to perform, “regardless of identity or affiliation.” While pieces relating to the LGBTQ+ community are welcome, “Shine a Light” will feature a variety of pieces relating to a variety of topics, so they do not have to solely relate to LGBTQ+ issues. However, there are a few requirements:
“Our main requirements are that the pieces must relate to some aspect of identity (gender,
ethnicity, religion, etc.) as well as the event theme of ‘Shine a Light,’” said ALLIES. “We encourage performers to illuminate the different aspects of their identity through various
media like spoken word, slam poetry, a cappella, playing instruments, and so on.”
ALLIES also encourages everyone to stop on by and listen to the performances, even if you do not perform. Some notable performances from past years have included songs from Carnegie Mellon’s Christian a capella group Joyful Noise, as well as spoken word on the struggles of growing up queer in a homophobic society. “Shine a Light” will take place Friday, March 2, 7:30 p.m. - 9:30 p.m. in the Connan Room.
If any individuals are interested in performing for the event or have any further questions, please send an email to allies.open.mic@gmail.com. If you’d like to gain more information about ALLIES, feel free to stop by their weekly general body meetings, which are every Wednesday at 5 p.m. in the Cohon Center Room 335 (SoHo).

A recent survey by The Tartan of Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students reveals, perhaps unsurprisingly, that students want the university to spend more on financial aid. And no survey is needed to know that students are bothered by the rising cost of tuition, which just this year saw an increase. But spending more on financial aid or lowering tuition would likely require the university to spend less on other budget items. The Tartan conducted a survey this past week in order to gauge the budget priorities of the student body and see where students think changes should be made.
To conduct the survey, The Tartan asked what students think about the current level of funding going to research, faculty salaries, buildings, and recreational facilities. Responses were collected from 64 Carnegie Mellon undergraduates via student Facebook groups and, as such, reflect the opinions of a group of voluntary undergraduate responders.
Constructing and renovating buildings was the item for which the most respondents said that Carnegie Mellon spends too much money, but even there, more respondents said that the amount of money spent on buildings is “just right” over “too much,” and many respondents were unsure or had no opinion. This indicates an area where there is a fraction of students who think that the current expansion is too much, but a significant portion are not too concerned about the level of funding. One issue with adjusting the money being sent to this area is that many donors donate funds on the understanding that they will be earmarked for a certain physical location where a plaque can be erected with their name on it, rather than more abstract needs for funding at the university.
Very few respondents believed that Carnegie Mellon should change its spending on recreational facilities, faculty salaries, or research. However, many respondents were unsure or had no opinion about spending in these areas as well. This might show that this is an area where undergraduates have less of an idea how much is being spent, and those that do are satisfied with current levels.
With faculty salaries in particular, the large majority of respondents were unsure or had no opinion. Paying faculty more might allow Carnegie Mellon to recruit better professors, or to lower class sizes by hiring more instructors. But like any spending increase, raising spending on faculty salaries would likely require raising tuition, and that is sure to be unpopular among students.
We also asked Carnegie Mellon students about their opinions of merit versus need-based scholarships. While there is support for increasing both, increasing merit scholarship funding is more popular. This might be due to low eligibility for need-based scholarships among survey respondents, although the survey did not ask about respondents’ scholarship eligibility.
It is surprising that nearly a quarter of respondents believed that the amount of money spent on need-based scholarships is “just right,” given that Carnegie Mellon lags behind peer institutions in this area. While many universities, like Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University and many more, meet all of a student’s demonstrated need, Carnegie Mellon does not. Along a similar vein, Carnegie Mellon is notable among top colleges for not participating in the QuestBridge program, which matches high-achieving, low-income students with elite schools offering them full scholarships to attend.
Any change in Carnegie Mellon’s budget would require tradeoffs to be made. And while ideally Carnegie Mellon would be able to spend more in every area where students feel there should be more spending, in reality administrators must carefully consider which items to prioritize when making decisions about the university’s budget.

Earlier this month, many were surprised to hear the news that Disney Research, a research-focused sector of Walt Disney Company, would be leaving their lab here at Carnegie Mellon University. This lab, which collaborated with Carnegie Mellon University faculty on everything from robotics to sports visualization, housed itself in the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center, but has now closed its doors there indefinitely.
The Collaborative Innovation Center has served an important role as a bridge between the university and private sector research and innovation. It is the home to many corporate partnerships and houses some of the most impactful research on campus. According to the dedication to benefactor Robert Mehrabian, former president of Carnegie Mellon, the building was constructed to be a “business incubator.” Since its construction, the Collaborative Innovation Center has been exactly that.
Disney’s time working at this location was certainly fruitful. In 2011, Carnegie Mellon faculty and Disney researchers collaborated to develop a new technology called Surround Haptics, a fully immersive tactile technology that provides a 4D interaction with movies or video games. This provides a large range of sensations with vibrating actuators, giving another layer of realism to the media we consume.
In 2015, the Pittsburgh lab announced a new suite of inexpensive physical additions to smartphones, aiding in their interactivity. The technology allowed things like knobs, sliders, and other tangible accessories to transform interaction with smartphone capabilities, being incorporated into physically unlockable alarm clocks, and even responsive dolls.
Perhaps most notable of all the work to come out of the lab would be when a Disney creator stumbled upon a robotic arm made by Carnegie Mellon robotics professor, Chris Atkeson, and decided to base a character around it. The character created went on to be Baymax, the protagonist of a critically-acclaimed Disney film Big Hero 6.
While it would make sense to mourn the leave of such a notable and impactful company, it is important to note that companies often have to pare back periodically; as Chris Atkeson notes, the leave was most likely “driven by overall cost reductions within the entire Disney family of companies to improve quarterly earnings.”
Disney Research similarly closed the doors to a research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2015. A Disney representative told The Boston Globe that Disney “regularly evaluate[s] our organization to meet the evolving needs of our business.” The decision to close the Pittsburgh Disney research facility is not something unprecedented by Disney business standards, or particularly unforeseeable.
Additionally, the  past relationship  between Carnegie Mellon University and Disney Research was not actually a formalized corporate partnership, as is being reported. 
Byron Spice, School of Computer Science Director of Media Relations, says that the lab “was owned and operated by Disney in space leased from the university,” and collaborated with Carnegie Mellon faculty, but “was not a corporate partnership with the university.”
All this being said, Disney Research will continue to be conducted in their Los Angeles and Zurich locations, and Carnegie Mellon University will fill the space they left behind with something likely just as innovative, though perhaps with less of a magical flair. Carnegie Mellon University will still continue to have a relationship with Disney Research, though from distances farther than a walk across the Cut.
Chris Atkeson is “looking forward to new corporate partners in that space,” referring to the potential for some other corporation to find their home at Carnegie Mellon University. The future of the space is unknown, but judging on the past significance of the work done in the Collaborative Innovation Center, the next undertaking will surely have comparable success.

Mass emails, which have detailed things such as a measles outbreak and a sniper threat in recent weeks, have often created more questions than they have answered. The most recent of these emails, announcing the creation of the Block Center for Technology and Society in the Heinz School for Information Systems and Public Policy, was no exception with little information available about the role the Block Center will play at Carnegie Mellon. The principal difference is that this email, rather than detailing a crisis on campus, outlined a new frontier for research at Carnegie Mellon.
The Block Center will be funded by a $15 million donation by Keith Block, vice Chairman, president, and COO of Salesforce, and his wife, Suzanne Kelley, vice president of Consulting Operations and Project Management Office at Oracle. The center, according to its barebones website, will be “dedicated to the interdisciplinary investigation of the economic, organizational, and public policy impacts of technology.”
Keith Block is an alum of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Science, graduating in 1984 with a degree in Management and Policy Analysis and Information Systems, before receiving his master’s degree at the Heinz School for Information Systems and Public Policy in a five-year accelerated degree program. He has maintained close ties with the university since then, serving on the Heinz College Dean’s Advisory Board, setting up the Keith Block Entrepreneurship Fund at Heinz, and supporting efforts to renovate Hamburg Hall, the home of Heinz College. Block was labeled, according to a Heinz College press release by former Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh at the dedication of a classroom in Hamburg Hall to him, as one of Carnegie Mellon’s “most avid proponents.”
Block stated in a Carnegie Mellon press release that he felt that the Block Center meets a need to examine the expansion and innovation happening in the world and that Carnegie Mellon is an ideal place to carry out that mission: “Innovation delivers powerful advancements that will have a profound impact on everyone... CMU sits at the intersection of technology and policy — uniquely positioned to bring together the public and private sectors to make the world a better place.”
The intersection of technology and policy to which Block refers is exemplified by the work done at Heinz, which is the locus for graduate studies for both information systems and public policy at Carnegie Mellon. The mission of the Block Center is to provide resources to this interdisciplinary study of technology and society, with interim president Farnam Jahanian stating in his university-wide email that “the Block Center will allow for a deeper connection between the many CMU programs focused on exploring the impact of technology on the human condition, bringing together thought leaders from across campus and around the world to tackle complex issues such as the future of work.”
Carnegie Mellon University sends hundreds of students from every college each year to work in the tech sector, with a recent release of 2017 MBA employment statistics showing that 43 percent of Tepper School of Business graduate students find jobs in the field of technology. With this contribution comes a responsibility to understand how those students’ work will impact society. As interim president Farnman Jahanian said in a Carnegie Mellon press release, “foreseeing and addressing the challenges posed by the rapidly increasing role of technology in our lives is a critical focus of our work here at Carnegie Mellon.”

Elections are right around the corner, and student government at Carnegie Mellon is a great way to get involved on campus and make an impact on the community. This year, student government has had a substantial effect on our campus, including but not limited to :
• Pushing the add/drop deadline to six weeks instead of two, as the administration proposed
• Facilitating the early release of final exam schedules
• Creating a Chrome extension that integrates Faculty Course Evaluation directly into SIO
• Opening up the Tartan Collaborative Commons (TCC) on the 3rd floor of the Cohon Center
If you are passionate about improving campus life at Carnegie Mellon, if you have ideas on what can be done better, if you believe that we as a community can do better — or if you’re just interested in free food, elegant wear, and thoughtful discussion — student government is a great way to turn this passion, drive, and ideas into sustainable change. There are many roles available including Student Body President, Student Body Vice President of Organizations, and Senator. We’ll be having a general interest meeting on Feb. 26 at 5:30 p.m. in Doherty Hall 1212 to go over how to set up petitions and run for office. We hope to see you there!

President Donald Trump is finding himself in a time crunch yet again. With so much on his agenda, he has shaken up America with a presidency and administration like no other in American history. Now, it is his time to propose a budget for the fiscal year of 2019. Already, his plan has not been sitting well with many Americans.
Part of the proposed budget includes a two-year elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides federal funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) stations. Perhaps, Trump sees this as a way to shave off $300 billion in new spending. Maybe, he has faith that private donations — currently CPB’s primary source of funding — will more than compensate for federal contributions. Although NPR and PBS probably aren’t going to fall into oblivion should the budget pass, it is important to realize what kind of message Trump is sending by completely ending federal funding for CPB, even if it is for only two years.
When the founding fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence, they put freedom of speech as the First Amendment for a reason. They wanted to have a country founded on democratic values where each man can pursue “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. Although we, as a society, are trying to expand those pursuits to everyone in America, one thing has remained true: we want to keep a democratic society. What do democratic regimes require that nondemocratic regimes lack? Personal freedoms and an open press.
Now, the First Amendment is not some sort of invincibility cloak that allows you to flee any possible consequence. However, the First Amendment protects the rights of Americans to express their minds and be a part of the society in which they live in. Sure, someone has the right to be offended or give some sort of negative response to whatever you have to say, but the First Amendment gives you that same right to say those things to begin with.
By pulling out all federal support from CPB, the White House is saying that it has better things to spend its money on than the core fundamentals of democracy. This, in combination with our current president’s love of the term “fake news,” and the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) decision to end net neutrality, all comes to suggest that the current administration wants to discourage the First Amendment.
Trump has not shown himself to be a huge believer in the First Amendment, to begin with. He threatened to end the Johnson Amendment, "open up" libel laws so that he could sue journalists who gave him negative coverage and “win lots of money,” and, of course, he loves the usage of the term “fake news.” Of course, Trump has every right to feel dissatisfied with how the press covers him and clear up any falsities as he deems fit. However, his tactics are beyond critiquing journalism or press coverage. His plan to end funding for CPB was the cherry on top of his anti-media sundae.
The budget has yet to fully go through, and there are far more aspects that need discussion. However, without freedom of speech, we cannot bring these topics into perspective. A democracy is supposed to be run by the people, for the people. If Trump cuts off this circulation, he puts the future of America at stake.

For someone who spends an awful lot of time finding ways to squirrel away savings into the pockets of his absurdly rich billionaire buddies, President Donald Trump seems more than comfortable chipping away at the safety nets in place for those less fortunate than himself. His latest target: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps.
SNAP provides families whose income falls beyond the poverty line with the means to purchase additional food to supplement what they can afford on their budget. They can buy various food products at a number of retailers across the country with the money put on an electronic benefit transfer card each month. More than 42.2 million Americans rely on the program, many of whom are children, elderly, disabled, or homeless. And Trump plans to cut funding for the program by nearly 30 percent — more than $213 billion — over the next decade.
To do this, he wants to have the federal government send packages of food to recipients, a delivery that would make up about half of their benefits. The goal is that the food delivered would be cheaper than that purchased individually through retailers — thus saving the government money — as well as more nutritious.
But these magical, cheap packages are nowhere near as perfect as they may seem to Trump. For one thing, they are projected to contain “shelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit and vegetables.” These choices limit options for picky eaters. They are full of items that those who are lactose intolerant or allergic to nuts or other ingredients, who have celiac’s disease, or who suffer from other dietary restrictions cannot have. And they do not include kosher or halal options or alternatives to more sugary foods like the fruits for diabetics. Taking half of these people’s benefits away and giving them food they cannot eat in return will have catastrophic results on their monthly budgets — and their health.
That doesn’t even account for the homeless on SNAP, who have no place to store a box of food meant to last an entire month and no place to cook the ingredients included as part of the package. It’s already difficult for the homeless to survive on SNAP since the program doesn’t usually cover pre-made meals from stores or fast-food restaurants. Without a pantry and a fridge to store the contents of the package until it can be eaten, recipients will struggle to keep and consume their package over the course of the month.
Furthermore, while the focus on healthy food may seem like a good way to target obesity and improve the overall health of those on benefits, healthier foods actually have far fewer calories, and thus give consumers far less energy, than high-calorie “junk” food, according to The New York Times. According to a study by University of Washington researchers, enough food to satisfy a 2,000-calorie diet can be obtained for just $3.52 a day — as long as the foods are energy-dense, high-calorie items like baked goods and snacks.
But when you buy enough foods with lower calories to meet a 2,000 calorie diet, the price increases to around $36.32 a day. The chances that these government-picked packages, which are meant to contain healthier food rather than chips and cookies and still be cheap enough to drastically cut the price of the program, will contain enough calories for people to make it through the day is extremely unlikely.
The packages will also take business away from local grocery stores and farms who currently accept food stamps in communities. Many small businesses accept food stamps, particularly in rural areas, as a significant part of their income. But with the money SNAP recipients receive cut in half each month, these stores would see a decrease in business.
Even the projected cheaper price of this initiative is probably too good to be true. Admittedly, it is likely that the government can obtain the food for a fraction of the price retailers sell it for. An existing program that sends boxed food to low-income seniors — the program that Trump’s plan is modeled from — costs the government around $22 for a box that might cost $40 to $50 if purchased elsewhere. But the program for seniors operates on a small, local scale — in order to generalize it to everyone on SNAP, other costs would begin to appear.
For example, these cheaper prices do not account for the cost of packaging and delivering the boxes to recipients. The existing program for seniors relies on volunteers to pack the boxes and distribute them from pickup centers and low-income apartment buildings — but local agencies probably don’t have the resources to deliver millions of boxes to those receiving benefits on their own. On the large-scale level of SNAP, paid employees would likely be needed to oversee distribution.
Additional complications arise from this model, too. How are homebound seniors, those unable to carry a heavy box by themselves, or those in rural areas without transportation meant to pick up their packages each month? What about people who work during the hours of pickup and can’t take off? If people are hired to deliver packages to their homes, these people will have to be paid as well. And if picking up the packages is simply deemed a personal problem to be dealt with on an individual basis, many recipients will be unable to do so and will go hungry as a result.
People who are more well off than those on SNAP have already shown distaste for the idea of receiving boxed meals. Blue Apron, a high-end meal kit delivery service that many are comparing to Trump’s proposal, had a notoriously low stock in 2017 and has struggled to hold onto customers. To assume that poorer people are better suited to the lack of options and the specific ingredients of a pre-packaged set of meals — to take away the agency of people in this way, even as those on SNAP are repeatedly told to become more independent and take care of themselves — is full of misplaced distrust and even outright contempt for the poor.
Trump’s spontaneous and unexpected proposal shows a typical lack of thought for real consequences and consideration of the realities people face, like so many of his ideas so far into his presidency. His military parade, which would cost tens of millions of dollars, is another recent idea that is equally as out-of-touch as this one. But perhaps these ideas are related in another way as well. About seven percent of all veterans (around 1.5 million) and between one and two percent of all active-duty military members (between 2,000 and 22,000 members) used food stamps in 2012. Maybe Trump should commit to helping them, along with other SNAP recipients, rather than staging his grand display of power.
The number of people receiving SNAP benefits has actually decreased in recent years. After spiking in 2013 after the 2008 Great Recession, the number of recipients has gone down more than 5 million. Hopefully, it will continue of fall as more people find full-time jobs and get back on their feet.
But if that’s not enough — if we still want to do more to decrease the number of federal dollars spent on the poor, and to help improve the quality of life for lower-income Americans — there are other ways, ways that have already produced positive results, that we can do so. We can make sure that schools provide free meals to children to take some of the burden off poorer parents — and address the shame surrounding such programs, so children feel comfortable taking advantage of the option. We can create community gardens in food deserts, areas where there are no grocery stores with healthy, affordable foods so that people in those areas have more options when it comes to meals.
We can also look into “housing first” options, which seek to decrease the amount spent on SNAP benefits, incarceration, medical treatment, and other expenses by addressing homelessness in communities. In many cases, it’s cheaper — and obviously far more humane — to provide homeless men and women with permanent housing rather than leaving home on the streets. A Florida study from 2014 showed a 68 percent reduction in cost between homeless people and those provided housing. Another study focusing on a program in Charlotte, North Carolina showed similar results: a 78 percent reduction in emergency room visits, a 79 percent reduction in hospital stays, 84 percent fewer days in jail, and a 78 percent drop in arrests. Off the streets, participants in housing first programs can regain their dignity, focus on any mental health issues, and concentrate on finding and keeping jobs more easily thanks to increased stability.
Plus, with pantries, fridges, and stoves, people will be able to store excess food, cook ingredients, and even explore healthier options on their own. They will no longer be in a position that allows Donald Trump and his abusive, out-of-touch government to do it for them.

Someone recently asked me, “where do you see yourself being when you’re 30?” The first thing that came to my mind and my response was “I think I’ll be a mom.” He then went on to ask if I had any other goals, such as plans to travel, and I began to feel a bit guilty. Here I am at Carnegie Mellon spending countless hours, and dollars, to get a degree and my first thought for what I’ll end up doing in ten years is pushing a baby around in a stroller. So many women before me have paved the way for me to even be here earning a degree and it seems a disgrace to not use it to the fullest.
But what if for me, using it to the fullest just means working a normal job and eventually going down the path of the classic “American dream” of being a mom and wife living in a white picket fence home? Does this make me a bad feminist? Is it not a bit hypocritical to not exercise the same freedoms that I fight for everyone to have? It can feel a bit burdensome to be the one feminist at the rally that’s thinking, maybe being a stay-at-home mom isn’t so bad.
With feminism, it seems that unless you want the whole kit and caboodle it’s not enough and any nonfeminist tendencies you have are just a result of internalized misogyny. This is completely true in a lot of cases — for example, the woman who slut-shames — but I hardly think that my motherhood goals are because I was told I had to. I grew up in a generation where single mothers, including my own, did it all. My mother had a lot of support from my other family members including my amazing father, but much of the day-to-day parenting was done by her and I think my fascination with motherhood comes from wanting to give another human being even just a tiny fraction of all that my mother has given me.
In today’s society, these -isms can feel a bit constricting and binding. Someone either is a feminist or isn't; one doesn’t just have feminist views. This extremism can be isolating to several different people. With white feminists having the loudest voice, it can be hard to hear the rest of us. I’ll be honest, there are some feminist issues that I don’t care about at all, one of them being female body hair. I completely understand that it is just used as another tool to police women, but it can be hard for me to support the movement of something so trivial when black women are still miles behind white women in society. White women have attained a certain level of equality that allows them to focus on the smaller issues whereas black women are still 12 cents behind white women in the wage gap. We’re not really all fighting the same fight, and overlooking these differences to unite us for one movement can be destructive in the effort to eliminate them.
Feminism isn’t the only movement that can feel isolating if your views are a bit wavering. Take capitalism for example. I can’t count the number of times I’ve said: “I hate capitalism.” I’ve tweeted this from my Apple iPhone, I’ve said it while buying coffee at Starbucks, and I’ve said it in the checkout line in Walmart. We’re all enrolled in a four-year university with hopes of getting good-paying jobs on the promise that Carnegie Mellon students earn more than students from other colleges upon graduation. It can be hard to fight a system that’s so easy to support as a student enrolled in a private university, so do I even have the right to oppose it or have I already cemented myself as a cog in the larger capitalist machine?
I don’t want to sell out to the man, but I recognize that I am doing exactly what society told me to do. By just existing, I’m unintentionally further perpetuating the idea that you have to graduate high school, go to college, and get a job to be a contributing member of society. So how do I reconcile what I believe with what I’ve done? I’ve already given stores like Walmart countless dollars and no matter how long my short stints of “I’m not shopping at Walmart” last, I always crack either out of convenience or financial reasons. I like to think that once I’m in a financial position to be able to choose to not shop at Walmart that I will, but there’s still an element of convenience provided by capitalism.
But, I think that what we choose to fight for can combat what we choose to do. I don’t think that everyone has to live life the same way as I did and I’ll continue to fight for others' rights to live life as differently as they want to. I may be just a part of the system, but I hope to use my position as a private university graduate to advocate for those that aren’t. The bonus should be on those who have the means to do more than those who do not. While it might not be our place to be the face of the movement, that doesn’t mean we cannot be the forces behind it.
I hope that my goals don’t embarrass women, but I shouldn’t have to sacrifice what I want to still be considered feminist. I know I’m not the avid anti-capitalist that I think I am, but I also know that it would be more dangerous to ignore this movement and pretend it doesn’t exist. We shouldn’t let these movements polarize us so much that we think it’s not worth the fight if we aren’t all in. We might not be leading the wars but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do our part to fight the battles.

The topic of women’s issues and bodies has garnered a lot of attention recently. In the case of the 2018 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, we are faced with a conversation involving both. Following the events of last spring surrounding both the controversial political climate and the feminist movement that passionately ensued in succession, MJ Day and her team at Sports Illustrated began working on what would be the 2018 Swimsuit Edition of the magazine with the intention of empowering women and changing preconceived notions about them. However when the issue hit stands, the world had more to say about the problematic implications of the portrayal of female empowerment and how it clashed with feminist ideology than they did about the celebration of women the issue attempted to spotlight.
Editor of the iconic, beloved, and infamous Swimsuit Edition of Sports Illustrated, MJ Day holds a spot as one of the most influential creative heads of the magazine. Having worked at Sports Illustrated for two decades, Day has been a part of the process since before any substantial conversation of change was brought to the table. Day sought to widen the standards of women that were being pushed to be printed on the glossy pages of the magazine by fighting for more diversity and size inclusivity highlighted in their annual bestselling issue. Twenty years later, Day works to make her vision take shape through a project she pioneered, with the help of an all female staff, titled In Her Own Words. The project features nude models posed and painted with words of their choosing, giving them artistic control and agency in how they label and express their personal empowerment. With current events in mind such as the #MeToo movement and a personal ideology formed from years of working as a woman under a male-centric publication, Day had a vision of altering the status quo of the Swimsuit Edition from within through an act of female empowerment in a time of female liberation.
So how have we found ourselves criticizing a project for lack of feminist ingenuity from a woman who claims she is aiming to fulfill that very agenda? The answer lies in the fact that not all ideas translate properly. In this case, the intentions behind the project did not read the same as the final result. In the context of a publication such as Sports Illustrated, the spread sat nestled between other salacious photo shoots curated for male consumers, the promise of change seemed more like a selling point than an honest ideological shift.
The feminist title seemed demeaned and commercialized as it claimed to stand as a fighting testament to misogyny while at the same time being published within a magazine that continuously neglected those concerns. Sports Illustrated has notably capitalized on the marketing of sexual images of women while disregarding scandals against their photographers, such as sexual assault accusations made against celebrity photographer and Sports Illustrated veteran Terry Richardson. Their heavy emphasis on the “progressiveness” of a project fully in the hands of women seemed to only mock the idea further, making it seem as if that were an extraordinary feat which justified their ability to call it feminism rather than truly celebrating it. People are not angry that this project has women finding liberation in their nakedness, but they are angry that they do so in a magazine that is capitalizing off of that freedom by simultaneously giving a platform to standards that oppress them. Woman or not, Day’s idea to reform a magazine with a historically exploitative portrayal of women through a visual narrative seemed naive — if not insulting — to many, and brings us to question feminism in the context of where it is used.
The issue here is not about male-dominated brands or corporations delving into the realm of feminist conversation, but is instead about the capitalization of feminism and the hypocrisy of their ethics in contrast to the ideology they are claiming to promote. It is no secret that female owned corporations have committed these same infractions in the past; Sophia Amoruso and Miki Agrawal, CEOs of Nasty Gal and Thinx respectively, have both been rightly condemned for their false activism after stories arose about their company policies neglecting maternity leave and affordable health plans along with hostile work environments arose. Feminism is not exclusive to any gender and falsifying activism for the sake of good standing is not a new concept, but is feminism in practice not a viable option for successful corporations? Similarly, within Sports Illustrated, the inclusion of feminist perspectives seems impossible to put in action without compromising its credibility. How, in this case, can we applaud the good in bringing forth a conversation on feminism previously missing within their audience while also holding those in power responsible for their deceptive and manipulative tactics of commercializing it? Are we unable to merge discourse on feminism into the mainstream agenda without sacrificing the cause for the sake of exposure in the process? Ultimately, is this a step forward or a step backward for feminism?
Although the progress is tedious, frustrating, and at times heartbreakingly slow, progress is progress regardless, and the small steps forward cannot be taken for granted. It is our job as members of a larger community to shape the conversations of these issues by being vocal on where we stand to make clear the ever changing language of social politics. While the questionable tactics of Sports Illustrated and their nude homage to the feminist narrative continue to be a topic of controversy, it is important to remember that not every person lives their liberty the same way. Some find empowerment in modesty and others find empowerment in nudity, however the final goal of our agency in making that choice is the same. We cannot expect every woman who chooses to share their viewpoint to engender our notion of feminism. Instead we should hold its meaning open to healthy discourse indicative of our diverse views. If any good has come out of the 2018 Swimsuit Edition of Sports Illustrated, it is seen in the conversations that have followed its shocking debut. Sometimes we must weigh the cost of trading in exposure for exploitation and weigh at what cost we may sacrifice these things.
